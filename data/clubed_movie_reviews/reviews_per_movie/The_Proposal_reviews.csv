Decent Proposal,"Well, if I could split the movie into two, I would say that the first half is a superb Proposal and the second half is fairly traditional Hollywood pablum. In the first half, the wonderful comedic timing and chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds was terrific. The writing was first-rate intellectual, snappy sparring, even throwing in some literary references in the put-downs. Kudos to the Director, Anne Fletcher, and the Screenwriter, Pete Chiarelli.The completely different tone in the second half, I surmise, could only be attributed to the studios/producers stepping in and stating that the film must appeal to a wider audience. We, then, get lots of family characters thrown in, with a great reduction of Bullock and Reynolds mutual screen time. And when they do share time in the second half, it's more about slapstick/physical humor (cue studios/producers needing appeal to wider, a.k.a, younger audience). Maudlin music comes in on the soundtrack, letting us know that this part of the movie is supposed to tug on our heartstrings.I don't buy the inevitable resolution either. I don't believe that it is supported well or justified by what came before it.The 1st 45 minutes is WELL worth seeing. I wish the filmmakers could have pushed and maintained the pace and feel for the entire movie. Reynolds and Bullock are so good, they could be this generation's Tracy and Hepburn. I'd like to see them in another project that follows through all the way.BTW, this film was actually shot in Boston and (the Alaska scenes) in Manchester by the Sea and Rockport on the North Shore with digital effects adding snow capped mountains. You might even recognize Motif No.1, a famous small building on a wharf in Rockport which has been the subject of many famous painters' and photographers' work. It was also fun seeing some of my local Boston area acting colleagues doing background work in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A fun way to spend an afternoon,"The Proposal isn't going to win any Oscars, nor will it become your favourite movie of all time. However, it does exactly what it is supposed to do; that is to entertain you. The Proposal is the story of a tough editor Margaret Tate (Bullock) who forces her assistant Andrew Tate (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her so she can stay in the U.S. (Interestingly, in the movie Bullock plays a Canadian and Reynolds an American while in real life, the reverse is true). What happens next will not surprise viewers but they will get many laughs along the way. Reynolds and Bullocks are very funny and also very believable. Betty White (from the Golden Girls) almost steals the show as Andrew's 90 year old ""Gammy"". The beautiful Alaskan setting doesn't hurt things either. Overall this is not a unique movie or even a unique role for Bullock but it is a very funny (and fun) way to spend an afternoon.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was sweet,"Although the movie is predictable, like most romance comedies are, nevertheless it was sweet. Sure a bit unrealistic in terms of the time line of the whole plot takes place but this is why we have movies like this, so you can escape into the fantasy of romance and humor. If you are looking for realism then watch a 3 hour drama, but if you want to escape for awhile and just enjoy a movie you don't have to think too much about then it's worth your time. If you don't want to pay to go see it in the theater, then wait for it to come out on DVD. I saw it during a private screening as part of the ATL Film Festival, for close to two hours I thought of nothing else and laughed and even cried a bit. I would definitely see it again. It may not be the best romantic comedy I have seen but the movie still holds lots of charm.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Charming though Predictable,"Most charming Sandra Bullock movie since While You Were Sleeping, though quite a bit more predictable. (Anyone who knows the general premise can guess how the movie is going to play out.) But it was funny and sweet, and if you need to choose something to take your wife/girlfriend to, choose this one.Sandy's attempting a Miranda Priestly-type character (Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada) which doesn't actually suit her acting style very well, but when you get used to her she's fun to watch. And she has great comic timing. So does Ryan Reynolds for that matter, who has a way of just looking perplexed that can make you snicker.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Starts Off with Snap and Verve But Moves Soon Enough Into Predictable Rom-Com Territory,"Even though it so clearly apes the set-up of David Frankel's ""The Devil Wears Prada"", I think the first 25 minutes of this 2009 romantic comedy has genuine snap enhanced by the sharp comedy interplay between stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Once the story leaves the Manhattan publishing house for the pastoral wilderness of Alaska, the story reverts into a formulaic sitcom bearing more than a passing resemblance to Bullock's break-out vehicle, 1995's ""While You Were Sleeping"", including an escalation of comic deceptions and a heart-tugging wedding confessional. Give credit to the fortyish actress/producer for not giving in too much to standard ingénue behavior this time. In fact, she plays the alpha dog with Reynolds relegated to the traditional leading lady role. The result produces enough contrived shenanigans to please Bullock's die-hard fans thanks to by-the-numbers work by director Anne Fletcher (""27 Dresses"") and first-time screenwriter Pete Chiarelli.The storyline has Bullock playing vituperative book editor Margaret Tate, a workaholic careerist who instills fear into her entire office. As her bullied assistant Andrew Paxton, Reynolds caters to her every whim in the hopes that she will help boost his publishing career. As is typical for an opposites-attract rom-com, a complication occurs when Margaret, a Canadian, finds out she is to be deported because her visa application has been denied. Instead of facing immediate termination, she manipulates Andrew to let her superiors know that they are getting married. This moment of desperate deceit leads to an awkward visit with an immigration agent who senses a green-card arrangement and requires proof of their relationship. In order to avert suspicion, Margaret accompanies Andrew to visit his close-knit family in Sitka, Alaska, where it is revealed his family is quite wealthy and in fact, run many of the businesses in town.They continue their charade of being engaged, which of course, fans the flames of his family's enthusiasm for a wedding. The rest of the film is pretty much you would expect save a strange episode of Andrew's grandmother performing a native dance in the woods. It's funny to see how Bullock cleverly uses the same prickliness she displayed effectively in her near-cameo in Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" in this film's establishing scenes as Margaret. In turn, Reynolds shows smart timing as put-upon Andrew, and their interplay has a nice edge. Note how well they perform during the best scenes early on when Margaret baldly lies about their upcoming nuptials at the office and in front of the immigration officer. It's just when they move into more traditional rom-com territory where their chemistry feels weakened and the sparks doused. Chiarelli's haphazard screenplay doesn't help them as they have little beyond one bedtime confessional scene to make us think they may belong together. Craig T. Nelson plays a familiar role as Andrew's disapproving father, but their subplot weighs down the proceedings unnecessarily.Except for one brief face-off with Nelson, Mary Steenburgen is wasted as Andrew's always-smiling mother. Betty White is a welcome sight as feisty Grandma Annie, although I wish the creators could have made her more like Sue Ann Nivens (""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"") and less like Rose Nylund (""The Golden Girls""). As the girl Andrew left behind in Sitka, Malin Akerman (""Watchmen"") is actually left stranded by the script, while Oscar Nuñez (""The Office"") grows increasingly tiresome as store clerk/male stripper Ramone. His absurd club performance, along with a nude run-in between the principals, just shows how little faith the creators had in the material to sustain the plot. Standard extras come with the 2009 DVD: a decent commentary track from Fletcher and Chiarelli (but sadly not the actors), seven minutes of outtakes, two deleted scenes of little interest, and an alternate ending which really just switches the locale versus the resolution.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Hard to admire, easy to enjoy","The Proposal is a hard film not to enjoy but it's an even harder film to admire. Aside from the two exceptional lead performances from Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock and the humour they create, the story is dowsed in clichés and left to drown. I need a film to at least be thoroughly realistic if not authentic, and the tired screenplay often delves into slapstick and camp when it should have let the leads carry the film.Bullock and Reynolds ooze charisma in all scenarios here, and their chemistry is what anchors the film firmly in watchability, even elevating the film at times to outright excellence. And to The Proposal's credit for every cliché it puts forth, we often get a quick rebuttal of charm, but which ultimately asks the question, why in the first place? I am almost tempted to follow in critic gene Siskel's footsteps and swear off watching movie trailers, because all the best line are in the promotional material; I don't mean they are the only good lines, simply that they would have made the film even more enjoyable had they been fresh. Directed by Anne Fletcher, who has already had rom-com success with Step Up and 27 Dresses, takes a chance with Bullock in my opinion as most would have good with a younger, hot-at-the-moment star. She does not disappoint and in her role as boss, Bullock is certainly suited; imagine that, a character that looks their supposed age.The plot is certainly one of contrivance, as are with most romantic comedies today, with the stern manger of a publishing firm (Bullock) essentially blackmailing her younger assistant Andrew (Reynolds) into marrying her so she can save herself from deportation and stay in the U.S. It just so happens of course, that it is Andrew's grandmother's birthday that very weekend and is heading up to Alaska for the celebration. Trapped in secluded north, will this faux engagement become something real? The worst scenes of the film take place in the office, with the underlings of the tyrannical boss quite literally diving for cover upon her arrival. We have surely seen in films like Office Space and The Devil Wears Prada that a work scenario can combine humour with realism without the need for the employees to act like Looney Toones characters. My first impression of the time frame in which evil over bearer and ambitious assistant fall in love was that of annoyance as such feelings would never form so quickly. However I may have initially judged too harshly, as is nicely illustrated, Andrew and Margaret only have each other. Andrew is ambitious and loyal, knowing everything about Margaret, and in turn Margaret is so dedicated to her job without any semblance of a personal life, he is her only true confidante and slowly the scenario becomes slightly less preposterous.The Alaskan scenery is beautiful, and the supporting cast including the delightful Betty White, Mary Steenburgen and Craig T Nelson make for a well rounded and talented cast. My absolute favourite member, which perhaps not coincidently my favourite part of the film, is Malin Akerman as an old flame of Andrew's. It was so refreshing to see an ex portrayed as a nice, honest human being instead of a vengeful witch and it is these intermittent moments of true human emotion that wouldn't make me turn this film off if I happened by it again; even if I wouldn't seek it out on my own accord.Read all my reviews at www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A fun and excellently done comedy,"Okay, I had been really excited to see The Proposal ever since it came out. I was hyping it up a lot when I knew it wasn't going to be a masterpiece, but I just love Sandra Bullock and Betty White and couldn't wait to get my hands on this film! When I did, it definitely lived up to my expectations.The thing with The Proposal was you could predict the ending and predict some events that would be happening throughout the film and some of the main problems were cliché, but I wasn't basing my opinions on this movie to be,""Is it going to be predictable, because if it is, I won't like it!"" No, I wasn't like that, because I knew this film was going to be predictable here and there, but I was looking to see if they made it enjoyable and at least brought some fresh, new material to the table, which they certainly did that! I thought some scenes were just so wonderfully done and the whole movie itself was constructed perfectly for the type of movie that it is.I had a really good time watching The Proposal and thought it was great entertainment with insanely lovable characters; I wanted to shriek with joy every time I saw Grandma Annie; a lot of incredibly humorous scenes at times, my favorites were when Margaret and Grandma Annie were dancing to the spirits which got the biggest laughs out of any part of the movie from me and when the dog was picked up by an eagle and Margaret was chasing it around trying to get her phone back; both hysterical, and some questionable, yet sweet and charming dialogue; Near the end in the office was cute and original, and the credits were funny as well with the dialogue in them. This movie while being cliché, as I've stated many times, did still pack a very powerful punch and made me laugh, cry and enjoy it tremendously, so therefore it succeeded in what it was meant to do in the first place and that was to entertain. I loved it for the light-hearted, pleasant and fun comedy that it is....",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Typical summer fare -- could have been better, but not disappointing","It is exactly what I expected. There were some old jokes (her entry into the office was a poor rehash of the opening of the Devil Wears Prada), there were plot holes (Betty White plays 90 but was supposed to have been married in 1929? -- that would make her a 10 year old), there were red herrings (an old girlfriend is introduced but she has no reason to be there and is not part of the plot) There were lots of problems with this film - BUT - there were also some funny scenes not shown in the trailers (eagle and dog).I gave it a 7 out of 10 because it was a fun, completely forgettable film. I would suggest renting it in a few months... you will like it, just don't expect a lot - its just a summer comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unrealistic and predictable,"Well, its a romantic comedy with Sandra Bullock, so set your expectations low to have any chance of enjoying this movie. How they made poor Renolds look so washed out and undesirable is the main question and for most purposes the viewers' around us own subplot (was he sick when filming? was he tired?) as they quickly got bored with the Alaska scenery and the endless bossy bolocks (oops did I say bolocks?) and clueless subordinate Reynolds mushy not witty plastic dialogues. Seen this, done that, why oh why repeat it? Hollywood creativity is lacking and this movie is another fowl taste of reheated ""I need a visa so lets get married and divorce"" plots already used and abused. The only reason for watching this I could find is to see the lovely Betty White who really deserves to get bigger better roles than what they shoved her into (nagging grandmother). Overall, there's better romantic comedies that will actually make you laugh and make sense, this one doesn't.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Refreshing and affirming,"My jaw is still aching, almost an hour and a half after the credits rolled. I don't recall when I last laughed this consistently and heartfelt at a new production. Yes, this is pretty formulaic stuff... if you've seen one mismatched couple romantic comedy, you've seen them all. This never claimed to be anything other than that. It definitely delivers what one expects from the genre, without any of it being phoned in or taken any less seriously. Not every film needs to revolutionize the craft, and shape cinema for decades to come. If everything was excellent, it would become the norm, and it would cease to be special. And I find it incredible and immensely positive that a movie with this kind of humor(observational, and largely derived from typical situations that happen to everyone) can still be made, and be nicely received. Humiliation and pain are not actually funny. They get a schadenfreude reaction, ""thank goodness that didn't happen to me"", and thus we move further apart, isolate ourselves all the more. This does the opposite, letting us get closer to each other, share the little things that we've forgotten are silly or ""off"" in our everyday lives. It does go a tad too far on occasion, to get the audience going, but those instances are few in number. The acting is great all-round, and the two leads have chemistry, and play off each other well. There are countless memorable sequences, jokes and gags in this. This contains ""moments"" between Bullock and Reynolds, as well, and they genuinely work. You feel for them. The characters are just about invariably well-written, interesting and credible. In general, the script is well-done. The music is pleasant and well-chosen. This ought to entertain nearly everyone, of any age. There is a little strong and/or risqué language, and a couple of usually mild sexual references, and this tends to be inoffensive. I recommend this to all who think they may enjoy it. Chances are that you're right. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Everything You Want in a Rom-Com,"Breaking news: The Proposal is not going to win any Academy Awards. It is predicable and follows the Rom-Com formula you have seen a hundred times before. Despite that, The Proposal is an enjoyable film and one of the better Rom-Coms to come out in the past few years.Sandra Bullock has the difficult task of being an uptight b**** but still remains a likable character. Ryan Reynolds shows he is a master at the awkward facial expression.

Delightful Entertainment,"In New York, the Canadian Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is the successful self-made chief-editor of the Ruick & Hunt Publishing and loathed by her coworkers. Margaret lost her parents when she was sixteen and is tough with the employees of the office. Her executive assistant and aspirant editor Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) has been working with her for three years without any recognition. When Margaret has problems with the immigration due to an expired visa and is threatened of deportation, she blackmails Andrew to accept to marry her; in return, he would be promoted to editor and she would publish his book. Meanwhile, the skeptical clerk of the immigration department Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O'Hare) schedules an interview with Margaret and Andrew after the weekend. The couple travels to Sitka, Alaska, to celebrate the ninetieth anniversary of Andrew's grandmother in their real estate and Margaret is welcomed by his warming family. Along the weekend, she gets closer to Andrew's family that asks her to marry Andrew in their barn, since it is a tradition in the Paxton family. And the tension increases when Mr. Gilbertson appears out of the blue in Sitka promising to charge Andrew for fraud.""The Proposal"" is a delightful entertainment and the story is very funny. Last week, a friend of mine recommended this romantic comedy and my wife and I really enjoyed it. The shape of forty-five year-old Sandra Bullock is amazing and her difference of age with thirty-three year-old Ryan Reynolds Ryan is not visible and does not affect their chemistry; they form a romantic pair that really works. However, Betty White and Oscar Nuñez steal the movie in the roles of the adorable grandma and the versatile handyman.

better than expected,"We went into this movie more or less out of despair; the cinema offerings seemed uniformly lousy and we simply wanted to see a movie that looked like fun. This one looked stupid: I'd seen Betty White promoting the movie on Jimmy Fallon's show and the scene shown was idiotic, though it did have a couple of amusing lines. Well, we were all pleasantly surprised. The outcome of the plot might be predictable, but the road getting there is surprisingly sharp and entertaining. There are quite a few witty lines and exchanges, and the delivery and timing of the two stars and, of course, of Betty White are just about perfect. Both of the lead characters have surprises in their backgrounds to reveal, and the settings are beautiful. There are one or two scenes that are clunkers, but even the dopey episode with White's Grandma Annie doing a ritualistic dance in the woods ends up having some relevance to a later plot event. The movie is well thought-out and well executed, and the actors create characters who engage us, even if we don't know anyone quite like them in our own lives.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enterprising young assistant takes on hard-nosed boss - romance ensues!,"Producer/star Sandra Bullock turns out what looks like another box office smash. Typical of most ""chick-flicks,"" the trailer tells you just about everything you're going to see. Unexpectedly, though, the surprises come from behind the scenes. The film looks gorgeous (and not just the two lead actors): the prettiness of the interior sets is matched by the choice of locations. While much of the film is set amidst the beauty of a seaside town in Alaska, even New York City is made to look like something out of a story book. It hasn't looked this good since the era of Doris Day. Typical of such a film, the costumes, even on the extras in the background, are so well-coordinated with the locations that the whole thing feels like a ""realist fantasy.""Likewise, the plot itself is reminiscent of the romantic comedies of half a century ago - complete with their morality, albeit updated enough in a post-feminist era for Ryan Reynolds' masculinity to function credibly in ""the Doris Day role."" This he handles extremely well, although Sandra Bullock deserves most of the praise. As a producer, she knows her on- screen strengths and weaknesses, and, most importantly, she knows her audience and, despite the hard-nosed ice-queen she chooses to play here, everyone will continue to love her. Frankly, I was surprised to see so many empty seats at the sneak-preview last night in Boston, but I hope that doesn't get the filmmakers down. The audience loved this film and it's going to get positive word-of-mouth from whoever sees it - young or old. It's going to be around for a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I hate when they tell the whole story in a trailer of a film, and all the good parts were in the trailer. That's exactly what they did with The Proposal. The film itself was boring. And when the funny parts did arrive, it wasn't too funny because you've already seen them. Nothing was a surprise. I do have to say that after watching Ryan Reynolds in this film, I'm really looking forward to his next films. Sandra Bullock on the other hand was very annoying in this film.

A sweet formula film that lets Bullock shine yet again,"The Proposal (2009)Well, I love Sandra Bullock, and the theme sounded good, and so I made myself enjoy those aspects of this film. But it' s formula flick. It has great laughs and some groaning moments and some clichés and silly parts that are forgettable. Not such a great film, as films go, but fun, as fun goes. That's not so much to scoff at.Oh, it's a romantic comedy, probably falling in some ""chick flick"" category, and on that score it works. Bullock is frankly terrific--she plays an unlikable character and you like her anyway. She got her kudos recently with ""The Blind Side"" and deservedly, but she has a whole slew of other films, most of them pretty slim affairs, where she is alive and spontaneous and remarkable anyway. Her love interest here is a flat but charming Ryan Reynolds, who often plays these kinds of parts (and has a way of making it natural, but never quite inspired).The director, one of a whole host of young women directors finally going mainstream, did ""27 Dresses"" previously, which put her on course here. It would be nice to see her not settling for a routine money maker, but use her ability to create a easy, funny, natural mood for something a little less superficial. That might just take better raw material.But this is what it is, and if you're in the mood to not work too hard or be too involved, this might just pass the evening.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cast: First Rate. Script: A Crime,"""The Proposal"" has a stellar cast and a suicidal script. The script begins brilliantly: Margaret (Sandra Bullock) a master-of-the-universe publishing exec who also happens to be very beautiful, has a younger, very sexy assistant – Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) – whom she forces to marry her because her visa has expired and she's about to be deported. Sandra Bullock is fabulously, convincingly, hateful in her opening scenes. She makes the Meryl Streep character from ""The Devil Wears Prada"" look like a shar-pei puppy in comparison. You really want to see this character put through the wringer, that is, to grow and change in response to challenging events. Ryan Reynolds is, as ever, handsome, suave, understated, smart, and a very interesting actor. As buff as he is here, and he is very buff, (preparing for the lead in the next X-Man sequel) it's Reynolds' intelligence and acting chops that are most arresting. Reynolds is as good as the romantic comedy leads from the Golden Age; he just needs the right script to be part of a classic. The rest of the cast, with the exception of an obnoxious stripper who should have been left on the cutting room floor, is similarly brilliant: Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson, Denis O'hare and especially Betty White are all solid professionals who've been fantastic in other movies.There is so much promise here – the pressures and pleasures of an older man and a younger woman; the erotic frisson of a woman boss and a hunky, male assistant, working with symbiotic intimacy over high-stakes projects, the blossoming of love in an impossible situation as two people who both love books get closer to each other, the changes a champion witch might go through as she falls in love. Andrew is given a hometown love interest, the young, blonde, Gertrude. Why did Andrew leave her and his hometown and move to New York City to work for an impossible person like Margaret? Because he loves books and literature and writing and the life of the mind, that's why. The movie could have given us ONE SCENE that showed Margaret and Andrew bonding over their love of literature – and it didn't give us even that. What a horrible wasted opportunity. As discussion boards show, many viewers felt that there was no chemistry between Andrew and Margaret. That's all the fault of the script.Rather than pursuing the potentially fascinating routes set up by the opening scene, the script takes a nosedive into the utterly crass. A sleazy Hispanic male stripper? Margaret confessing her faults in a way that unnecessarily compromises Andrew forever in the eyes of those who mean the most to him? Several false endings that spill over into the closing credit sequence? What's going on in Hollywood? Why can it produce game, top-notch actors who are also stars and not one coherent romantic comedy script since Norah Ephron?",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Isn't worth watching,"I've seen some good comedies in the last months; Tropic thunder, Zack and Miri Make A Porno, Role Models,and I got to say that it seemed that comedies were getting a bit more sophisticated. Today I watched The Proposal and by watching this film you can seen everything that's wrong with most comedies.This little comedy is just so boring,predictable,unoriginal and more importantly, not funny. I mean,I only laughed three or four times during the entire movie (and only a little) which is pretty bad when you're watching a comedy.I would go even further as to say that the movie is better in its few dramatic moments then in the ""supposedly"" funny scenes.I'm not saying this is the worst film ever made or even a bad film, but it is so mediocre and,well; crappy in lack of a better term.The premise is quite simple; Margaret Tate,played by Sandra Bullock is a Canadian editor-in-chief of a book publishing company living in USA and in order to keep her visa and avoid being deported she blackmails her assistant,Andrew Paxton,played by Ryan Reynolds into marrying her; what people call a sham wedding.Obviously they have to pretend they're really together and in love so you can imagine the complications.And then the the viewer is hit right in the face (and I say this because it does hurt to watch something so unoriginal)with the biggest cliché possible, the characters develop true feelings for each other during this scheme. Both Reynolds and Bullock are fine actors and I have nothing bad to say about them, the problem here is the script.Its just a very lame,corny and mediocre comedy that really isn't worth watching when there are so many great movies out there.5.5/10",,Anonymous,Romance
Fun Romantic Comedy,"The Proposal is a fun little romantic comedy starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Both actors were believable in their roles and played realistic characters.

The film is praised for its light and comedic atmosphere, providing hilarious moments throughout the narrative. The pictures Alaska setting adds extra charm to the story, while the presence of Betty White and Oscar Nuñez adds additional doses of humor to the cast. However, some critiques point to Bullock's initially unpleasant character, suggesting that the transition to a more likable figure could have been more subtle. Additionally, there are observations that the plot follows a predictable romantic comedy formula, not fully exploring the opportunities presented by the initial setup. Nevertheless, ""The Proposal"" is praised for its light entertainment, chemistry between the leads, and the presence of a talented cast. The comedy offers guaranteed laughs, making it a pleasant choice for those looking for a relaxed film in the romantic genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Predictable but fun comedy, helped by the strong performances and some truly beautiful scenery","I saw The Proposal last Saturday with some friends, and all of us were very impressed with the film. Of course the plot is gentle, yet very predictable, and I did feel the writers could have developed Margaret's dominance over Andrew more. Still, it is very well done. One definite plus was the strong performances from Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, Bullock especially gave one of her better performances in years. The two share a real chemistry and some good comic timing that was really refreshing to see. Out of the supporting cast, who all did very solid work Oscar Nunez deserves mention for his hilarious portrayal as the handyman, it is Betty White a delightful and very underrated actress who steals the show as the matriarch who thinks marriage is preachy. The Proposal is further advantaged by some truly breathtaking Alaskan scenery. It was so beautiful to watch, and perfectly captured by the skillful cinematography. The direction from Anne Fletcher is very nice, and the film is snappily written with some genuinely funny moments. There were some parts in the more slower and subtle parts that I felt tears welling up too. All in all, very well done for a comedy, predictable it is but it is fun too. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Lighter than air, and sometimes, that's okay","Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds star in ""The Proposal,"" a 2009 Anne Fletcher film also starring Betty White, Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen. Bullock plays editor Margaret Tate, an uberbitch, who is about to be deported back to Canada due to a visa snafu. She forces her assistant, Andrew Paxton (Reynolds) to announce their engagement. After an extremely uncomfortable meeting with a no-nonsense man from immigration who smells a rat (Denis O'Hare), Margaret and Andrew have no choice but to travel to Paxton's family home in Alaska to announce their engagement. It's a little more than Margaret bargained for.Totally predictable and typical Sandra Bullock fare on the style of ""Two Weeks Notice"" - however, Bullock excels at this type of romantic comedy and is always a joy to watch. There is a fun performance by Betty White as a 90-year-old grandmother who prays to the Indian spirits, and Oscar Nunez as Ramone, the only exotic dancer in town.Without Bullock's warmth, charm, and honest emotions, this film would have been a real dud. Obviously, I'm a fan. Bullock started out as one of the flavors of the month about 16 years ago, and at 45, her output of films hasn't diminished. Like one of the classic film stars of the '30s and '40s, who all did their share of fair or bad movies, she can make just about anything enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Funny, well acted and super entertaining, those easy movies you can watch over and over without ever getting bored","Delightful romantic comedy that serves up a perfect blend of humor, charm, and heartwarming moments.

The two must pretend to be madly in love to convince immigration officials, but what starts as a business arrangement soon takes an unexpected turn.Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Margaret is both sharp and endearing, showcasing her comedic talent and ability to bring depth to her characters. Ryan Reynolds complements her performance perfectly with his quick wit and boyish charm, creating irresistible on-screen chemistry.""The Proposal"" thrives on its humor and hilarious misunderstandings as the two characters navigate their way through the charade, leading to laugh-out-loud situations and awkward encounters with Andrew's family.Beyond the laughs, the movie also explores the personal growth and vulnerability of the main characters. As Margaret and Andrew spend more time together, they begin to discover hidden layers and connect on a deeper level, making their journey from fake engagement to something more genuine and heartwarming.The film's supporting cast, including Betty White as Andrew's feisty grandmother, adds even more comedic brilliance and heart to the story. The family dynamics and cultural clashes between Margaret and Andrew's families create additional layers of hilarity and endearing moments.In my opinion, ""The Proposal"" is a feel-good romantic comedy that hits all the right notes.

Stereotypical but entertaining...,"You already know what you are in for when you sit down to watch this movie, and sure enough ""The Proposal"" does follow the standard guide of how-to-make-a-romantic-comedy.

Coming up with an impromptu plan on the fly, she decides to marry her assistant (played by Ryan Reynolds). But there is no love between the two, and just how will a trip to remote Alaska convince the US immigration that the planned marriage is not a hoax just to stay in America.The movie follows the stereotypical hate-turns-to-love recipe and is just oozing with predictability. But it is just sappy and generic enough to be that much entertaining.

"Do you prefer Margaret or ""Satan's Mistress""?","The Proposal is directed by Anne Fletcher and written by Pete Chiarelli. It stars Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds, Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson and Betty White. Music is scored by Aaron Zigman and cinematography by Oliver Stapleton.Bitch book company boss Margaret Tate (Bullock) bullies her assistant Andrew (Reynolds) into marrying her in order to maintain her visa status and avoid being deported from the US. With the authorities watching closely, the pair take off to Paxton's parents in Alaska to get to know each other and plot the sham wedding.The rom-com, a very hard genre to get a film right in, and only really accessible to certain parts of the movie watching world. The Proposal is one of the better ones in recent times, primarily because the lead actors are so likable, they manage the impressive feat of lifting the standard scripting to heights it doesn't deserve. 12 years difference between Reynolds and Bullock (who still looks terrific), but it doesn't show, while the supporting players, operating out of a cranky family/small town dynamic, also offer up considerable moments of quality. Very appealing scenic cinematography by Stapleton too.There's no surprises here, but there are good laughs and interesting scenarios, and if you are in the mood for a romantic pick me up, or having a date movie night, then this is a safe recommendation. The grumpy and loveless, suffice to say, need not apply. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Delightful Romantic Comedy with Charming Leads,"The Proposal (2009) is a charming and enjoyable romantic comedy that delivers exactly what it promises-a lighthearted story filled with humor, chemistry, and feel-good moments. While the film doesn't necessarily reinvent the genre, it stands out thanks to its charismatic lead performances and sharp comedic timing.Sandra Bullock shines as the uptight and no-nonsense Margaret, showcasing her impeccable comedic talent while adding layers of vulnerability to her character. Ryan Reynolds, as the reluctant assistant Andrew, perfectly complements Bullock with his witty and endearing performance. Their chemistry is undeniable, making their journey from professional adversaries to something more heartfelt a pleasure to watch.The supporting cast, particularly Betty White as the quirky grandmother, adds another layer of humor and warmth to the film.

Quite enjoyable,"The proposal is the typical romantic comedy women love with the difference that in this movie the roles are changed, the woman (Sandra Bullock) is the one that falls in love with the man (Ryan Reynolds) at the end.

In The Proposal you can find different types of scenery from the buildings and streets of New York to the amazing and beautiful landscapes of Alaska. The cast of the proposal is very good, Sandra Bullock in a role that fits her very well, her performance was really good and funny, Ryan Reynolds will be loved by all women in his role of Andrew Paxton and as a couple, Bullock and Reynold have a very good chemistry between them.

Is There Really Anyother Way To Criticize Movies Like This,"Was this supposed to be a great movie? Of course not, but was it supposed to be funny and sweet? Well, I think anyone can answer that. Just in case you have not seen the advertisements, The Proposal is about an executive, played by Sandra Bullock, for a publishing company who is startled when she finds out she will be deported from the US due to a technicality. Quickly she finds a solution, that solution is her secretary, played by Ryan Reynolds, his next job will be to marry the woman he is working for. This beginning sets us up for yet another bland and predictable ""romantic comedy"" to come out in recent years.The acting in this film was about as good as it could get in a romantic comedy. Reynolds was actually quite likable as he seems to bring a nice and appealing charm to the screen. Bullock played her character to same type of tune she has done over the past decade or so, an uptight and ill tempered woman hiding her true feelings of loneliness and insecurities.The writing which is just essential to a comedy as the performance of its characters just didn't work. Jokes that have rehashed and overused were applied in this movie just as well. Was this surprising? No, it was not but could it have been better applied? Yes, there was a lot of room for improvement here. Its not necessarily a bad thing for a movie to be predictable but it is a bad thing when the execution of the story falls apart within itself. The film is just to implausible and is sloppy in the way it is put together. This is a poorly handled script that is choppy and just can't sustain itself after the first five minutes.Would I recommend this movie? It seems like a no but if you enjoy movies like this there is no reason why you should miss this film, especially based off my critique or others like mine. If your looking for an escape go watch this movie, but other then that I don't see a good reason to spend $11.50 to watch this.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nowhere near charming or funny enough to cut it,"We all know where we are going here right? When pushy Canadian boss Margaret Tate pretends to be engaged to her assistant Andrew in order to avoid being deported due to a failed visa extension it certainly seems like it is an unlikely coupling – particularly because of how hard-nosed she is about any intimacy or love. The two have to go away to his family home in Alaska for the weekend and keep up the lie – but while it is cold outside, will Margaret begin to warm to this very different life and to the idea of being with Andrew? Hmmmm, I wonder – well, however it turns out I imagine there will be no end of comic misunderstandings along the way.Yep, it goes just where you expect it to and in terms of how it gets there it goes through all the sort of scenes, misunderstandings and ""gradual warming"" stuff that you know it has to do. Having absolutely no problem with genre films doing what genre films do and also being someone who likes Sandra Bullock, I had no problem with this film being the way it was in terms of obvious structure and predictable narrative flow. What I did have a problem with was that it didn't actually do much to make it a good film. The most glaring problem with it is that as a romance it just doesn't work. It seems to expect the viewer to just accept that Margaret and Andrew have fallen for each other and that both have undergone some degree of character change during the film because it certainly doesn't show us it happening in any way that is obvious. OK we have the ""cocked head soft/sad look"" scenes flash up occasionally (to imply Margaret's ""true heart"" coming out) but otherwise nothing.This isn't helped by the film simply not funny enough as a comedy. OK there are some bits that show imagination and are funny but equally there are bits that just don't work. The forest chant/dance is embarrassing, seems dropped in out of nowhere and isn't that funny. It doesn't flow particularly well either, so the film doesn't have any sort of build – the funny scenes seem to stand on their own without leading anywhere or being used to strengthen other parts of the film. I laughed several times and chuckled a few more but mostly it just didn't seem like it was particularly well structured as a romantic comedy. It is a shame because Bullock is good in it while she plays against type. She is a good comic actress and I have no problem seeing her work in the genre where her looks and sweet personae make her charming, but it would be nice if she had more to work with than this. Reynolds is OK but cannot get much in the way of chemistry going with her and he is certainly not her equal in terms of the comedy. Steenburgen and Nelson are solid while White tends to scene-steal with some funny moments, although personally I thought she also had her share of moments that didn't work either – moments that seemed to just rely on her being an old woman in situations where one does not expect to see old women. Small turns from Nunez and Mandvi are good though and the film could have benefited from more colour in these smaller moments.The Proposal is not a bad film by any means. The plot comes with genre territory so should not be dismissed for that alone, but the problems come with the failure to flesh the film out around these standards into a good film. It is sporadically funny but never manages to build or even sustain this, while the lack of chemistry between the lead two characters is part of the reason that the relationship that develops never seem real and never convinced me enough to care about it. A basic genre film that might just have enough about it to please those looking for a basic genre film, but those hoping that it can build on the standards and be funny and charming will be disappointed to find that it falls short in both those areas.",,Anonymous,Romance

But while I don't think either of them is an imminent threat to win an Oscar, neither are they dregs from emergency casting.

Just another romantic comedy,"The Proposal was just another romantic comedy. It was predictable but was funny at moments and romantic, it had two good performances from Bullock and Reynolds and had a interesting plot. But there were some moments that i just wanted to get out of there. But overall it was an alright movie.This movie is obviously a girl's movie. I'm not one who goes for chick flicks. I just sit there and check my watch every few minutes and like always i was there checking my watch. But that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it. I'm the type of girl who likes movies like Goodfellas and The Dark Knight. So obviously this wasn't my type of movie.Both leads were good. Sandra Bullock was alright. She started off as the character you hate but grows on you throughout the movie. It's hard for me not to like Ryan Reynolds since i'm a fan of him. He did a good job in this and if you like him check out some of his other movies. I recommend Just Friends.I recommend you give it a try if your a girl who likes romantic comedies.

Entertaining eye candy.,"The Proposal is charming as hell. Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock are loads of fun as the leads. They make you smile every single moment while you watch this movie. Does it seem ridiculous at times? Yes. Is it clichéd at times? Yes. Is it worth your time? Yes.This is a film, where it doesn't require you to think. You can just kick back, relax and laugh. And laugh. And laugh again. Bullock got a Golden Globe nomination for her work here. She's sexy, funny, and likable. Reynolds is so handsome and charming it's impossible not fall for him watching this here. Betty White gets a supporting role and she is flat-out hilarious.Overall, it's a solid film with a hot cast, everything you could want in a summer film. My biggest problem here is the forest scene between Bullock and White. It's laughably bad. Other than that, see it; 7.",,Anonymous,Romance
"The Proposal: who cares if it isn't hilarious, it has a puffy white puppy","Once again, the trailer is not quite about the movie. Matter of fact, once again, the funniest scenes are in the trailer. You probably are braced for a bad review. See!?!?! That's what foreshadowing does to one's expectations. I'll let this review do more for you than the trailer did for the movie.If you are going to the movie to see Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds or Betty White, I do not think you should be disappointed in their performances. Betty White was fun to watch as was Mary Steenburgen. They all pulled off a good job for their parts. A couple of the performers pulled off a little more than you might expect from this movie, but then, they did get a PG-13, just a close shave from an R.The movie starts off as good as I expected. I got plenty of laughs from the role reversal, you know, the woman is the boss while the man is subservient. I think I read one review where it almost seemed like this could have been a Rock Hudson and Doris Day movie. It's true, that comes across rather clearly. It made for some good laughs. Unfortunately, the laughs are few and far between after that observation. I found myself paying more attention to character contradictions as the movie went on(and on and on and on).Apparently, going home is not always a good idea. That's when it all changes for me. Daddy issues, family warmth (or the fear of it), weird dancing grandmas, old needless relations and multiple sociological intrusions and infractions just tore at the heart of potential for this movie that I thought was Bullock's ""welcome back"". I still love Sandra Bullock and I do not think the problem with this movie had anything to do with her. I only know that a certain director has soured my taste for anything that director may do in the future. For me, the movie came across as a brand new jig-saw puzzle with pieces missing right out of the box. And a couple scene/time-line edits were inexcusable and sloppy, dismissing the viewer's skills of observation.If you are going because the trailer leads you to believe this is hysterical humor, you will be saddened by what you see. If you go to get a few chuckles added to a smattering of character development(perhaps I should say ""distortion""), then you might enjoy this. I for one wonder why Bullock's and Reynold's parts weren't played by Whoopi Goldberg and Jack Black. The mere idea of those two playing the misdirected characters had a better chance of keeping me in tears of laughter instead of disappointment.I give it a 6 out of 10 for early laughs, Bullock, Betty White and a cuddly puffy white puppy.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It would have been criticized for disrespectful manner of portraying woman. Margaret's character is so rude and manipulative, utilizing her higher rank that her childhood trauma cannot make up for it.

Abuse of power = weekend romance...?,"Though its concept is a little dodgy (reverse the genders and suddenly things become a lot more obviously uncomfortable), 'The Proposal (2009)' soon veers into more traditional genre fare. As such, it manages to wave away any worries about its premise surprisingly quickly. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect, to be honest. However, just because it's predictable doesn't mean it's bad. It's a light, fairly pacey and occasionally chuckle worthy affair with a solid set of leads. Even though it's not exactly believable, the central relationship is actually quite charming once it gets underway. The chemistry between the flick's stars is enough to see you through the entire endeavour, actually. Plus, there's some solid supporting work from the likes of Betty White and Mary Steenburgen. In the end, it's a surprisingly enjoyable little tale. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Average Movie,"I was able to view an advanced screening of the Proposal last night and it was a fairly decent movie. It's your average run of the mill romantic comedy. Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock worked well together creating some laughs throughout the movie . The two characters that really stood out were Betty White and Oscar Nunez. Both provided some much needed humor.White was the loving and occasionally odd grandmother and Nunez was the towns store clerk, only male stripper and minister. Overall if your looking for a lighthearted romantic comedy worth a few good laughs I would recommend you see it,but if your looking for something with a little more substance and depth this isn't really the movie for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Could have been great, but doesn't meet potential","The formula of a great romantic comedy certainly exists in The Proposal. You've got big-name attractive stars, who have been successful in rom-coms before. You've got a plot that is reminiscent of other films, where two people who don't get along must pretend to be in a relationship. Why is it that the creative team simply couldn't make all those elements work to form a solid movie? My first guess is that they started with a sub-par script. The comedy never quite works, and I didn't even find myself chuckling at the situations. There are a few moments when Ryan Reynolds will deliver a line that feels like a throwaway joke, and those made me laugh more than anything else in the movie. Even the amazing Betty White didn't get any good jokes, unless you find her dancing around in a Native American headdress to be funny.I think one of the other things that hurts the Proposal is the fact that it doesn't feel like the right casting. In my opinion, Sandra Bullock has more of a girl-next-door quality, so she doesn't work so well as this hard-nosed workaholic who mistreats all of her employees. We're supposed to see her as the equivalent to Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada, and I just don't buy it. This also means that her transformation throughout the film doesn't have a natural flow because she's quick to settle into her comfort zone, and that means the devil-woman disappears too fast. All the flaws don't change the fact that I still enjoy some of the rom-com tropes that are included in The Proposal. It has those moments of conflict and reconciliation that warm your heart and sell you on the relationship. It's not going to be added to my list of favorites of the genre, that I gladly rewatch on a regular basis, but it's certainly not the worst.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

I did not laugh,"Well,after having seen IMDb's current rating (7.1/10) and taken advice from someone who told me the movie was nothing new but very 'efficient', I finally bought the BD and watched it last night. End result: a very strange experience. It's the first time I don't laugh watching a comedy. I mean, not a single laugh; at best, two or three very timid smiles. Yet the movie kept me rather entertained, despite its obvious derivative and formulaic nature. Is it a good film? I guess so; at least, it's very well made.Is it original? Not in the least? Is it nevertheless different from most comedies? I guess so. As I write these lines, I come to realize that, for me, the movie worked best as a commentary on sexism (Sandra is the boss) and on age difference between partners. In other words, it works as a social commentary on serious and important matters. And I feel it's a courageous and laudable move for Sandra Bullock to have taken the part the plays in the movie. It's also always interesting for me, as a male, to watch a movie for which many if not most creative decisions have been taken by females. I feel it widens my horizon and I like it. The only thing I disliked is the social status the (male!) screenwriter gave to the groom's family or, more precisely, how that status was used as part of the plot. That, I REALLY disliked.Le me conclude this way: Did I ever believe in the romance between the main characters? No! Am I happy with the ending? No! Would I nevertheless recommend the movie? I don't know! I hope this review, though ambivalent, will help you.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
unbelievably boring.,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS I hated this movie.I don't usually write negative stuff about rom-coms because i love this type of movie,its hard to do well and i appreciate the effort.But i had to write about this one because i just suffered through this.I don't particularly like Bullock but i don't hate her,she was good in a couple movies.She was lousy in this one.Reynolds should get the most boring person of the year award for this.The story is pretty much what a small segment of ""how to lose a guy in 10 days"" was,the part where they go to the parents' house,only that was just a small part of a good funny movie,this is the entire movie with the entire same premise and badly done,a couple get emotionally involved while visiting the guys' parents.Bullock and Reynolds don't even match age-wise.

Proposing Proposal,"The Proposal has Sandra Bullock (Margret) has the laugh without the grunt and as the subtler version of Miranda Pristley from Devil wears Prada. Ryan Reynolds (Andrew), last seen in Wolverine, now he is the boss's (Sandra Bullock) assistant/executive. Some how Margret puts it together that Andrew and they are getting married, to save Margret from getting deported to Canada.That's the proposal, what happens next in the movie is actually quiet predictable, but i like the way the story unfolds in the beautiful Sitca, Alaska. Even though they are not trying to be funny, but the whole situation and they land themselves into is awkward a first, funny for all of us. Since it is specially based in Alaska, it just seems to be perfect setting for a fantasy and romantic world. But none the less, the timing of the dialogues between Andrew and Margret are comical and well written.Betty White who plays Andrew's eccentric, but loving grandmother takes the cake, specially with her dancing in the middle of the woods, or dancing with the stripper. She is purely brilliant and has her own extreme ways of resolving conflicts, which is hilarious. There is also Andrew's parents who underplayed in the movie. There is Andrew's story is comfortably on the not highlighted.Its worth the watch, at the end of the day, its a nice ""chick flick"".",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

More than you would expect in a romcom with a rehashed plot.,"The Romcom is a genre that becomes increasingly easy to craft, but as the years go on, it's a genre that is liked less and less by critics of all ages. Unlike the genres of action, sci-fi, and even comedy, the amount of ideas for a romantic comedy become quite limited. You can only find so many ways to make people fall in love before you realize you've seen it before. In recent years, romantic comedies rely much more on star power and chemistry rather than storytelling; since the story is probably something done before in dozens of other movies, romantic novels, television productions, plays, musicals, etc.In this decade, the most lucrative romcom hits emerge because of the main actors and their interacting with each other. Movies like Hitch, What Women Want, He's Just Not That Into You, Sex and the City, Knocked Up, and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days used big stars, big names, and lavish productions for successful profiting. The Proposal does the same exact thing: they took a story we all know (and females love) and pitch it with two likable, bankable, and attractive stars. Add a dosage of beautiful scenery, strong supporting staff, and cute animals, and viola, there's a hit arriving. Yet, for the second time this year, we have a repetitive plot being saved by delightful performances. Just like He's Just Not That into You, it's a predictable ride, but an unexpectedly fun one.The Proposal is about a stern, cynical, and seemingly heartless boss (Sandra Bullock as Margaret) blackmailing her young and hard-working assistant (Ryan Reynolds as Andrew) to marrying her to avoid being deported. In order to prove to immigration that they are indeed going to marry and it's not a ploy, the new couple heads to Alaska to meet Andrew's loving family. Throughout the trip, the fake couple learns more about each other than expected; and as the plot twists and turns, sparks start appearing. Like I've said before, we've seen this tale before; it's not a groundbreaking tale that will change movie-making forever.Instead, we rely solely on star power and the supporting cast. Despite the age difference (and the movie experience difference), Reynolds and Bullock have a nice bit of chemistry together, and play off each other's tricks and subtle jabs perfectly. Bullock is very talented, but yet seems to have found a comfortable groove in these romantic comedies, and it is quite frustrating considering her performances in Speed and 28 Days. Reynolds proves that he can mold into different types of roles, as he was a comic book character just a few weeks before this movie's release. Check out the star power behind the support that was not advertised: Craig T. Nelson, Mary Steenburgen, Betty White, Malin Akerman.Yes, the clichés are present, yes left-field moments do occur (and since when do they not in romantic comedies?), and yes, you can predict where the story goes. Fortunately for us, Disney (in its marketing), and the director Anne Fletcher does a fantastic job hiding the surprises sprinkled throughout the 107 minutes. The surprises range from plot twists, to totally improvised moments in which you can't help but chuckle at the absurdness. Fletcher doesn't dazzle with clever shots or beautiful cinematography, but did do a fantastic job maintaining The Proposal in the PG-13 range with several scenes, especially concerning a nearly graphic yet hilarious moment that must have ruffled some feathers in the censorship department with the nudity involved.Bottom Line: Once again, I am surprised by a chick flick, and can't help but actually recommend the film, even with the flaws attached. Star power, like in all the good romantic comedies of this decade, is what carries and drives this film away from mediocrity and keeps it afloat even whenever the movie drags the slightest bit. This isn't going to win awards or become analyzed for years to come, but it will improve any gloomy evening with its comedy, chemistry, and overall lovable personality. Loosely shut off the brain and memory of previous flicks, and you'll have a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Amusing, enjoyable and predictable rom-com perfection even in 2020","""The Proposal"" (2009) is basically a fun, family romantic comedy even in 2020. Chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds makes the movie one of the above average rom-coms. The supporting casting is brilliant, especially Betty White, because she does practically steals her scenes from anyone she is involved with.

Heart warming!,"The Proposal is not the most original movie of the year, and it's not the most unpredictable one, either. Truth be told, it's the same old story, repeated over and over again, but -again- truth be told, it's a very warm comedy. The movie starts much like The Devil Wears Prada, but as the movie progresses, the similarities vanish, and it begins to develop as While You Were Sleeping of 2009. It's the same story: two people who are so wrong for each other, the warm family you want to marry into and you wish it was your own; finally, the confession and the happy end. For some reason, it's not corny or cheesy at all; the great performances of Reynolds, Bullock and White make it seem believable and welcoming. The only problem one may have with the movie is its inconsistency; the movie starts glamorously, just to get silly, then plain stupid, then it picks up again. You have to have a lot of faith and courage to keep up and actually want to watch it till the end. It's semi-worth it: the ending is nothing of an original, but it is what you wanted to see. The movie -in its own charming manner- borderlines on kitsch and romantic, predictable and desired, just to land in the category of the romantic comedy of the year, a good, old-fashioned love story that does not need to be original or surprising, but it does make you fell warm and fuzzy inside.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Started great, ended in a disgusting cliché","At first I thought it could be possible that the movie was really as good as the hype and the marketing made it out to be. I mean, it is a romantic comedy, so could it really show chemistry between the two protagonists, really be funny and not stick to the stupid, idiotic formulas that rule this genre?The start showed all that promise and then it started to go awry. Suddenly the self-empowered New York book editor remembers her passion for hip-hop music, starts dancing ridiculously, accepts anything is thrown at her by the incredibly rude Alaskan family that couldn't have been more annoying to either boy or girl.

"""The Proposal"" as original as its title","There are 8 other films on IMDb titled ""The Proposal,"" and that seems appropriate. The movie offers nothing new, and doesn't even execute a mildly-interesting concept well.There's really not much to criticize here; the characters are done-to-death Manhattan Movie Clichés, their motivations confusing and unexplored. The plain fact is that you cannot spend 95% of a film dressed in desperately hip clothing, trading sarcastic barbs and reveling in the awkward pause, and still expect the audience to be ""touched"" when a few contrived confusing moments of what we're told is sincerity are stuffed down our throats in the final 15 minutes.Too many scenes begin and stay flat for their entirety. Too many lazy attempts at the ethnically-diverse office mates, the ""crazy, liberated and offensive"" grandma, close-minded dad, and other tired characters that we've seen over, and over, and over. Also, a woman doing a small handful of amusing or not-quite-antagonistic things, and revealing a very shallow brand of vulnerability for five uninterrupted minutes, does not True Love create.The worst part about this movie is that it has all these easy romantic-comedy staples, but oddly it tries to preserve some semblance of homegrown dignity by ignoring the punchline, and the result is tame jokes, bored acting and unconvincing heart, all wrapped up in some excruciatingly-long scenes.Watching this movie felt like the writer and director took a trip to Alaska and had a profound and rejuvenating experience, but when they decided to tell us about it, the story ended with, ""Well I guess you had to be there.""Some discipline in the editing room might have gone a long way for this movie, but I doubt it.

Nelson and Mary Steenbergen are great as his parents and the wonderful Betty White steals the show as his kooky grandma. Betty is still going strong at 86 and may she have at least fourteen more birthdays). There is a great scene where Bullocks opens up about being so jealous of Reynolds because he has a wonderful family and she has been on her own since she was sixteen.

Surprisingly decent,"I was ready for the run-of-the-mill 21st century romantic comedy -- a lot of smirky sexual humor, a lot of dumb people, and a lot of lame dialog. I was pleasantly surprised. True, this is no Shakespeare -- or even Howard Hawks -- but that kind of lightning doesn't often strike anyway, so no great disappointment there.First of all, based on some comments I'd heard and read, I was expecting Sandra Bullock to be out of place as the romantic lead (one reviewer referred to her as being a bit long in the tooth for this kind of role). However, her character (Margaret Tate) was clearly a woman who had put off romance in favor of career. Indeed, when she is greeted by Mary Steenburgen (Grace Paxton) as ""Andrew's girl"", Betty White (Grandma Annie) remarks that Margaret could hardly be called a ""girl"". (Note: in the showing we attended, they previewed Sandra Bullock's next movie, ""All About Steve"". Now that one shows serious signs of miscasting.) Secondly, in reference to Grandma Annie, I was fully expecting her to be treated the way elderly ladies are often treated in contemporary romantic comedies (""Made of Honor"" comes immediately to mind) -- i.e., as either foul-mouthed (so we can snicker at the ""f"" word coming out of a sweet old face) or totally clueless about contemporary sexual practices. Instead, Betty White is given a smart, sassy role. She's a bit earthy, but it comes off as endearing and natural.Third, the dialog and the characters are both intelligent. At first, Ryan Reynolds' Andrew Paxton seems a wuss, but as we get to know him, we realize that he is as tough as Margaret, and as ready to do whatever it takes to achieve his own dream, whether that be kowtowing to ""Satan's mistress"", or seizing his own chance to do a little blackmailing. And the Paxton clan clearly accept Margaret not because they're stupid, but because they honestly love Andrew and want to love his (supposed) fiancée as well.Of course, you can't avoid some formula in a movie like this. And need we doubt for a moment that there will be a happy ending? (Although I will give the script credit for throwing in a little doubt there as to just whom that happy ending would include.) All in all, this is worth an evening at the movies. The audience included viewers from teenagers up to seniors, and all seemed to really enjoy it (that's a rarity!). However, we did see at least one young girl (about 10 or so); I really don't think this movie is appropriate for that demographic.

Likable Comedy With Alert Directing and Good Facial Acting,"This is a funny, enjoyable movie with alert directing and good facial acting. The chemistry between the Bollack's Margaret and Reynold's Andrew is fun to watch as they worm their way through the predictable consequences of an immigration scam.The story is that powerhouse publisher Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is in immigration trouble and blackmails her secretary Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) into marrying her so she can stay in the country. To make the lie believable she goes to Alaska to visit his family. As they get to know each other, the movie draws toward the inevitable happy ending.There are several good scenes including the dress fitting, Ramone the exotic dancer, the eagle stealing the cell phone, and just about all the office cubical scenes.ON REALISM: Margaret is a self-centered bully, and she treats people terribly -- early in the movie this is funny as a spoof of office life, like ""Devil Wears Prada."" In reality it is unlikely that Andrew would see anything in her. This plot is not-at-all realistic, and it is an excuse to set up the comic situations of the movie. The Proposal is good because of the dynamics between the characters within the context of the ridiculous circumstances. The movie is more believable than ""Star Trek"", ""The Hangover"", ""Up!"", ""Terminator Salvation"", and about as believable as ""The Solist"".This is light comedy with no redeeming social value, but it is well-done, and most people would enjoy it.MORE: They showed too many jokes during the preview.EVEN MORE: The end is OK, but they should have been more creative.YET MORE: Sondra Bollack looks great for 45 years old.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Gibberish, Sandra how COULD you ...","I tried to like this movie. I admire Sandra Bullock, she has contributed greatly to the art of TV and movie drama, as producer and actress. She excels at the former, and is mediocre to good as the latter.But this movie is a steaming pile of every tired Hollywood invention going. The acting is very good, but can't be saved by this awful script.

Enter Reynolds family which is parents Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen, grandmother Betty White, and a former girlfriend in Malin Akerman and a host of town characters that look like some of Rob Morrow's former patients. Bullock who lost her family early on and has none to speak of gets really comfortable with them and very comfortable indeed with Reynolds.Sandra and Ryan certainly make a nice pair of leads. But I think acting honors go to Betty White who's pretty close in real life to the 89 year old granny she plays here. They also go to Denis O'Hare. He's a great example of a smarmy and officious bureaucrat people hate instinctively.Ironic isn't it because Sandra Bullock is not a terrorist, in fact she's contributing quite a bit to the American economy here. The Proposal takes a strong look at our immigration laws which are incredibly out of whack in this country. Our strength as a nation was the immigrants who came here for a better life. Now we seem to discourage that.As for Reynolds, it might be a wise career move he's making, but as it turns out these two really get to know each other and it might just work out after all.The Proposal is a really nice romantic comedy, don't miss it while it is still in theaters.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing how two very different people fall in love,"This is a silly film, but fun if flawed and okay if not taken too literally. It follows a bit the formula of 'While You Were Sleeping' but doesn't have some of its excesses (although it has some other excesses that one doesn't) and is by no means christmassy. Nevertheless, they are different films, being both romantic comedies and both starring Sandra Bullock.'The Proposal' is not much of a movie and its plot is quite predictable and formulaic, but it does well its aim of entertaining the public. It's a story of blackmail, selfishness and manipulation which converts in... love! Such a strange ""marriage""...Julia Roberts was to have taken the role of Margaret Tate. However, just like in 'While You Were Sleeping' Demi Moore was replaced by Sandra Bullock, on this one Julia Roberts was replaced by Sandra Bullock. Very clever decision in both cases. I couldn't see Demi Moore in that role or that frog's mouth Julia Roberts in this role.Ryan Reynolds and the loving Sandra Bullock have a nice chemistry. They convince as a couple who hates each other but eventually fall in love. Both act well, but Sandra Bullock is better in her performance. While beautiful, she wasn't always a great actress, but with age she has improved considerably.Sandra Bullock... can you believe she was nearly in her mid-40's when she did this movie? She is in amazing shape! She's undoubtedly a milf and there are a few ""sexy"" scenes with her in this movie. A real delight for the eyes and soul of men.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romantic comedy,"This film was fab. I've not laughed so much for a long time, in fact the whole cinema was laughing. Sandra & Ryan worked really well together and the whole story was delightful. At first i wasn't so sure this pair would pull it off as she's much older than him but they did and it worked. Sandra looked great and i felt a great connection between them both. This is not just a chick flick this is a great film for everybody and is full of laughs!!!The plot is superb and there were a few funny twists a long the way. Ryan never fails to bring a sarcastic comedy to all his roles and he definitely dosn't let his fans down. We see Sandra in a more serious way at first compared to most of her other films but she also never lets us down.GREAT AND A MUST SEE.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Surprisingly good, fun and actually really funny in places","Not as bad as I'd thought it would be. I don't do romantic comedies at all, but actually The Proposal isn't all that bad. Yes it's predictable, unbelievable and quite sickening at times but actually it's quite funny too. Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds have great chemistry together and share some really funny scenes. So it's not the most intelligent or impressive of films but it does what it sets out to and is laugh-out-loud funny in places. Maybe it could do with being just a touch shorter, but there are some quite funny characters to keep you laughing right up until the end (which is very predictable, but who cares?)

Usual story and overblown,"Now I happen to be a big Sandra Bullock fan, but honestly, she never should have been cast in this movie.The movie itself seemed amatuerish; the ho-hum beginning, the yawn, and the big sleep.

A very generic romance comedy,"This movie is probably one of the most generic and dull romance comedy I have ever seen. It's just way too predictable and the humor and morality is like from a very very long time ago. I got a few chuckles from some scenes but that is about it, the film was just not funny for me. As a matter of fact the only people that I saw laughing was old people, and I am not trying to be biased against old people or anything and I seen plenty of old people that enjoy rude and crude comedy, but this film was just way to old fashion and just tries too hard to be cute. I am not saying a movie that goes about it with cute humor is necessarily a bad thing, but it just isn't funny and it's very dull and generic. There is also a scene where Sandra Bullock comes out of the shower almost naked which almost makes you wanna gag. I guess it was trying to be one of those sweet comedies, and lot of old people and some girls may enjoy this movie and probably worth a rent when watching it as couple.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
An engaging comedy,"In this film Ryan Reynolds plays a book editor's assistant called Andrew Paxton who hates his boss, Margaret Tate played by Sandra Bullock. Fortunately for Andrew, Margaret is in America on an expired Visa and she is about to be deported back to Canada when she forces Andrew to marry her so she can become an American citizen and stay in the country. Unfortunately for Andrew as soon Margaret gets deported a new boss will take over the company and his first plan of action will be to fire Andrew. So Andrew reluctantly agrees to fake being engaged to Margaret. And to make their engagement seem realistic to a lawyer they have to convince him that they're a couple so Margaret goes with Andrew to Alaska where his family is celebrating his grandma's 90th birthday.For most of the film this fake engagement is funny because you get to see Andrew enjoying bossing Margaret around.The funniest scene is probably when Andrew walks in on Margaret taking a shower. Unfortunately this scene does go on for too long and isn't as funny as it could have been.The film is also dragged out towards the end when Margaret starts to have feelings for Andrew because at this point the film starts to become less funny and a bit too romantic.But overall I had fun with this film and I might buy it on DVD... at a cheap price.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sandra Bullock as not likable person in her nice comedy comeback!,"If someone would ask me on the street if I would marry Sandra Bullock I would say yes in a minute. OK but mostly she plays very likable characters in her films. But this time she is a business woman who seems not to have a lot of fun in her life. I wonder if this role was supposed for Jennifer Aniston. In the great tradition of Screwball Comedies we see Ryan Reynolds as her male opponent. He is her employee. The only chance not to loose his job he loves so much is to play her fiancé. It sounds terrible for a good relation but good for a romantic comedy with some touching moments. The supporting cast with Betty White, Craig T. Nelson, Mary Steenburgen, and Oscar Nunez are all pretty good and enjoying their roles. Don't know why but I got the feeling everybody was very relaxed in this production. Maybe cause of the beautiful locations the movie was photographed. Of course it's a solid comedy not untypical other similar movies but it had certain touching moments and it's good to see the sympathetic Sandra Bullock on screen again.The story was good enough to keep my attention but I thought it could have been a little more adult. I don't know if any kids are really that interested to see a romantic comedy between an elder woman and a younger man. After I left the cinema I had a good feeling and a smile on my face which made it worth to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Doesn't Get Any Better Than This,"I was prepared to dismiss ""The Proposal"" as just another mildly entertaining, ""formula"" romantic comedy. I confess I completely underestimated this film. We saw this in a week-early pre-release screening. Even a week before release the buzz must have been good since the theater was sold out to the last seat. I swear everyone there was rolling in the aisles for the entire film. Bullock and Reynolds have great chemistry and both have pitch-perfect timing. They're supported by an incredible cast that includes Mary Steenburgen, Graig T. Nelson and Betty White. White, in particular, is a crack-up as the feisty 90-year-old Grandma Annie.This is not one of those exasperating comedies that uses up its four good jokes in its trailer. I've seen some commentary describing this as a cross between ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""Green Card"". That is a fair description of the plot but it does this film a disservice. ""The Proposal"" is very much more than that. The writing here manages to be both wicked-smart and belly-laugh funny and the entire cast sells it in every scene. These guys really hit this one out of the park! A nearly perfect film! 10+ **Stay for the credits, by the way.**",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

If You Don't Intend To Watch Or Listen To This......Its O.K.,"This is a dreadful movie. There are no laughs here....none. Sandra Bullock is truly awful as she over-acts and speaks faster than a speeding bullet. The actual story has been done--in one way or another--more times than Oprah has been on a diet. Julia Roberts was first choice to play the Bullock role, but wanted more money. The interesting thing about Bullock movies is they normally make money. This utter rubbish made money !! I am not so sure it would have had the box office success with Roberts. The cinema going audience (who enjoy rom-coms) will go to see Bullock in ANY rom-com. Even this. There has never been a funny rom-com. A friend of mine told me they are actually ""date movies"", so no one is really watching. That sounds like it MUST be true.

A Lightweight But Enjoyable Romcom,"Sometimes people say ""Hollywood doesn't make films like that anymore"", referring to the situational boy-meets-girl romances of the 30s or 40s. Well, it does and this is one example, though this is boy-works-for-girl who is a tyrant as a boss. When you go to this movie, you know it's a romance, and so the ""suspense"", if you will, is how can the writers get the star-crossed characters together?Sandra Bullock plays Margaret Tate, the boss everyone fears and hates. She has no personal life and no family life. Ryan Reynolds is her underling, Andrew Paxton. The story thrusts them into spending time outside of work together. Family members--including Betty White as Andrew's ""Gammy""--help to put the com in romcom.The disdain of Margaret and Andrew for each other appears to be an insurmountable obstacle to love. Before the film ends though, vows are take--but not the kind you expect. Still, such films are about affirming the power of love and this film will not disappoint.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lightweight Confection with Very Good Casting,"This was a fun flick, mostly filmed in Massachusetts, in a community on the north shore called Rockport. Even with some mountains CGI'ed in the background, Rockport didn't look that much like Sitka, Alaska. It looked...well, like Rockport with mountains inserted. Still, they tried. At least the second unit might have gotten up to coastal Alaska for a few shots of mountains and the midnight sun (or their special effects folks had some fun with that).Yes, Sandra Bullock's character behaved like a jerk for most of the movie, but Ryan Reynolds was getting something he really wanted - a massive promotion. So the script observes frequently that he's manipulating her as much as she's manipulating him. He's getting something he wants desperately.I loved Betty White - where's she been? She was great! While Mary Steenburgen was good, it was a little disconcerting that she looked so much like Bullock. It lent a little Oepipal tint to the proceedings.I'm not normally a fan of Ryan Reynolds, but he was pretty charming in this movie.So, I didn't think this was a waste of money.

Pretty average,"I feel like I should have enjoyed this film more than I did as I'm a big fan of both Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock, but the screenplay is all just a bit much.It is one of those romcoms where the premise is just so out there that it becomes a bit of a chore buying into it, and the love story feels weak as a result.Reynolds and Bullock both give good performances, but are hamstrung slightly by the average script. They do however manage to produce some great laugh out loud moments.This is a perfectly decent film if you are in the mood for a bit of far fetched romcom fare, and it does do the job for the most part.

I loved it,"I really loved this movie. To me it was unique and there was really good chemistry. I absolutely adore Sandra and Ryan. I would love to have a love like this.

To me there wasn't a single boring part and the pace was even so it wasn't too fast or too slow. All in all, it has made my top 10 list. I will watch it again and again.I definitely recommend it for those looking for a romantic comedy that has well developed characters and a storyline that is easy to follow without being too cliché. In my personal opinion it is refreshing and worth at least a one time watch.In regards to the age difference, who cares? Sandra looks great for her age and they are both professionals who know how to portray their characters correctly. They have amazing chemistry together, they are both hilarious and when you combine them together, they completely rock and take control of the screen.

Good comedy,"Good comedy. Typical of such a film, the costumes, even on the extras in the background, are so well-coordinated with the locations that the whole thing feels like a ""realist fantasy."" Likewise, the plot itself is reminiscent of the romantic comedies of half a century ago - complete with their morality, albeit updated enough in a post-feminist era for Ryan Reynolds' masculinity to function credibly in ""the Doris Day role."" This he handles extremely well, although Sandra Bullock deserves most of the praise. As a producer, she knows her on- screen strengths and weaknesses, and, most importantly, she knows her audience and, despite the hard-nosed ice-queen she chooses to play here, everyone will continue to love her. Frankly, I was surprised to see so many empty seats at the sneak-preview last night in Boston, but I hope that doesn't get the filmmakers down.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fun to watch,"I first approached this film with caution. I love Sandra Bullock, but after ""premonition"" I had serious doubts about her choice of films. After reading some reviews I decided to give it a try, specially since I read that Betty White was in it.Sure, it's not a masterpiece & there are some parts where it gets a bit predictable, but for the duration of the film I was truly entertained. I laughed out loud and was even moved at the right parts. Sandra Bullock & Ryan Reinolds do deliver, and there was no part of the film where I didn't believe they could fall for each other. This one will surely become one of my ""must see"" films when I'm feeling a little down, since it truly lifted my spirit. I do wish I had given this one a try when it came out on the theatres.If you like films that make sense and where the plot is flawless, and where you'll probably pay attention to every little detail, then you should really stay away from this one.

Romance about green card that should have gotten a red card,"For anyone thinking we'd see an end to the long string of insufferable movies that make up much of the romantic comedy genre (like ""He's Just Not that Into You"" and ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"") I present ""The Proposal"", two hours of stupid fluff directed, written, and performed without the slightest care toward making a watchable movie. ""Knocked Up"" this is not. More like ""Knocked Senseless.""Sandra Bullock returns to being a romantic lead as Margaret Tate, an executive editor-in-chief of a book publishing company. She's tough as nails and because she's a strong woman in a high position, its only natural that every one think her Satan. Or so it goes in most stupid movies like this one. Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) is her long-suffering assistant. When Margaret's visa expires and she faces being sent back to Canada, Andrew and her hatch a deal to get married in order to keep her here. She gets to keep her job, and he finally gets promoted to editor. Just when the government starts investigating the relationship, Andrew must bring her home to meet the family in Alaska in order to sell the ruse.Sitcoms usually start in this way and considering that, its no wonder the sitcom is dying. The screenplay by Peter Chiarelli moves along in predictable fashion and actually finds a way to dumb down a genre that doesn't really need to try that hard in the first place. The couple bicker, then feel guilty, then somehow fall in love. Some family melodrama (involving dad, played by Craig T. Nelson, wanting Andrew to be apart of the family business) is tossed in for good measure. It's a good movie for anyone who find surprises distracting, think that a romance should work just because, and who get kicks out of weak one-joke premises, the joke being that the couple is reluctant toward being stuck in this fake relationship. It's a tiresome idea that, at best, leads to cheap laughs like a scene where the two mistakenly run into each other naked or weak payoffs like when Andrew feels emasculated during Margaret's telling of how he fake-proposed. And director Anne Fletcher hasn't met a desperate attempt at comedy that she can't force to the point of stark awfulness. A scene where Margaret is given a lap dance by an out of shape exotic dancer or when she must chant and dance around a camp fire with Andrew's grandma just come off as eye-rollingly tedious.I'll leave Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds alone here. They're both trying hard to make some of this funny and this relationship worth caring about but neither Bullock's turn as a career-oriented ice queen or Reynold's knack for sarcasm is enough to contend with this very paint by the numbers romance. Betty White, as the sort of movie-grandma who likes to poke around people's sex lives and divulge things about her own, gets a few little laughs here and there but for the most part ""The Proposal"" is no marriage in movie heaven and might as well just be left standing at the altar.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

The premise was pretty dumb -- Sandra character has to marry an American in order to keep her job and not not get deported, not even sure that this is legally correct as a premise, but with the 90 day Fiancé possibility maybe it's true, really don't know, and anyway they didn't have 90 days.

MYeah's review: The Proposal,"While the movie does make for an interesting premise, it's only moderately successful.The film stars Bullock and Reynolds respectively as Margaret Tate, a very pushy boss, and Andrew Paxton, her tortured assistant. After discovering that she is about to be deported back to Canada, Margaret hatches a plan to stay in the country, she decides to marry Andrew so she may keep her citizenship. Andrew agrees to this only if Margaret gives him a promotion. To further keep up the facade, they both travel to Alaska to meet Andrew's family, and announce the news. This includes Andrew's pushy father (Played by Craig T. Nelson), his very loving mother (Played by Mary Steenburgen), and his all around peculiar grandmother (Played by Betty White).The film relies on a lot of formula. Two leads who hate each other at the start, one hatches a plan to obtain something they want, The two begin to understand that they do love one another, and I'll let you figure out the rest. It's not a very original story, but it's better than most formula movies, and at the very least fast paced.The movie at least gets it performances right. Bullock and Reynolds are not only good in their roles, but have such great chemistry together. The rest of the cast such as Nelson, Steenburgen, and others aren't really as good. Even Betty White, who while good in the film, lacks a great deal of her always brilliant comedic presence.So while it suffers from a predictable story, it benefits from two good lead performances.I give The Proposal **1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sandra Bullock was beautiful in this movie Ryan Reynolds is gorgeous and very funny too. Betty White was at her best. The scenery in what was Alaska, was absolutely breath taking. I thought this was a nice clean movie. You don't get to see much of that these days. The fact that there was no violence was a winner in my eyes. I nice love story. I really liked how Ryan could turn on the innocent face, to a tough guy by black mailing Margaret. It was fun. I will look out for him in other movies. he did great.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good film for a first date,"Margaret Tate (Bullock) is a fierce, editor-in-chief of a publishing company, who all the office staff are scared of. Her assistant Andrew Paxton (Reynolds), who has taken a lot of crap off Tate for years and now hate her so, also he can live his dream of becoming an editor.After Tate is told her visa has run out so will be deported back to Canada, Tate blackmails Paxton to marry her. When government investigator finds out they haven told Paxtons family, they tell him they were leaving it for a big occasion that's coming up this weekend (his Grandma 90th birthday), so they end up going to meet his family in Alaska.Normally with rom coms you know exactly how its going to end , 5 minutes into the film, and this rom com is no exception. How ever for a chick flick, there were a lot of laugh out loud movements, which you don't normally find and no ""oh the stuck up bitch fell over"" gags which is always a good thing.The supporting cast had its moments, Betty White as the Grandma was the best family member, this was because you believed that she was a fun loving granny that was a little outrageous , example of this was giving the happy couple a blanket which she calls the baby maker.The character that stole the show was Ramone. I think was because he was the comic re-leaf and popped up, every time the film was slowing slightly. The best part was him as the towns stripper and making Tate spank his arse.As of the leads, i was a little disappointed, Reynolds just seemed to be going through the motions, as a the used assistant, and i never believed Bullock was a bitch of a boss.Overall this film was enjoyable film that i would recommend to anybody on a date, were you are trying to impress by choosing an appropriate film that she would like without getting total bored yourself. 6/10Read more of my reviews here: http://cinemadvdreviews.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
After reading the reviews I have sooo many questions... terrible movie,"I like rom-coms. well to specify, I like good, funny rom-coms, I really don't think I ask for much when I watch one, so this is why I'm selective of which ones I spend my time watching, I'm a fan of both Bullock and Reynolds and think this movie was the worst thing imaginable they could've come up with,But after reading the reviews I thought I may have watched a different movie because some people describe it as laughing hysterically, finding it sweet and heartwarming, great chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds (which I don't know how anyone can arrive to that conclusion when it's obvious that's what is missing the most, even from trailers you can tell they have - zero chemistry).Granted I had my reservations about seeing this movie from the start since I didn't even like the trailers, but my wife wanted to see it and I'm a big Sandra Bullock fan so I said why not, maybe they'll surprise me.I understand each perception is different, but it's not explained in the movie why they like each other all of the sudden, they just filled the time with cliche and cliche about a bunch of nonsense. All rom coms have this, but the chemistry is not there, they don't look good together, for starters she looks too mature for him and there's no endearment from either part, it's all scripted without emotion, thats my view I guessSo the movie people describe on these reviews is quite different from what I saw, so I have a few questions for anyone who cares to answer in another review:What made you laugh hysterically ?? This is my biggest question because I don't remember laughing or giggling at all, at all, I'm not trying to be a stiff, I love comedy and I can find something to laugh about a lot of things, people love my humor but these comments have me baffled, I sincerely can't think of anything lo laugh about in this movie.What sold you the idea that this couple had chemistry ? IMO they look distant and stiff around each other and when they get together it's all artificial, so what did I miss ?What made you think this was a sweet movie ? Maybe I watched too many movies but all the ""sweet"" moments are copy and paste scenes from other movies, and the pasting Is pretty clumsy and predictable IMO, may be you have a better moment that tells you something.If not laughing hysterically most reviews describe the movie as funny, what are the funny aspects of it ?I'm sorry if I come off as a jerk or obtuse, is just that my wife and I hated this movie and we were discussing the other day about it and she told me ""I bet people loved it"", I said ""No, I don't think so, it was terrible"" and we made a little bet which obviously I lost, lol, so I found the time to write this for anyone who cares to read it before I go and pay my debt, lol.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Funny, heart-warming movie -- surprisingly.","I have no real reason, but I absolutely despise Sandra Bullock. I even despise initial choice of Julia Roberts to play the lead role as well. However, nearly a year ago, I saw a preview for this and I thought it looked wickedly funny. I thought, ""my gosh, this may be the first movie with Sandra Bullock that I want to watch."" Despite my passionate hatred for Bullock, the duo of her and Ryan Reynolds was unreal. Fantastic chemistry and the awkward faces and pauses from Sandra and Ryan nearly put me on the floor with laughter coming out of my gut.The premise of the film is Margarette (Bullock) is being deported to Canada and unless she can use her assistant Andrew (Reynolds) as an option to keep her in the USA, by marrying him, then Margarette is out of a job and so is Andrew.I found myself hoping and praying that at the end of the film there would be a happy ending of them magically falling in love. Believe it or not, there is some twists and turns to keep your suspense moist and to keep you on your edge.The comedy is outrageous, especially for an actress such as Sandra. Ryan's no newbie to comedy scene and once again, he dazzles me with his wit and timing. I couldn't stop laughing at his awkwardness during the scene with Margarette telling her boss they'd be getting married. Likewise, I couldn't stop laughing at Sandra's awkwardness --that occurs for nearly the entire film.It's a beautiful film that shows a lot of scenic views and has a lot of established cast as the support and secondary roles. I was very surprised at how much I didn't want the film to end and I was even more surprised that I enjoyed a film that had Sandra Bullock as the main attraction. That being said, I do love the film Speed, which stars Sandra, but I like it for other reasons and try to block her out.I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who's seen the previews. Even if you didn't think it would be good, give it a try. Any Bullock fans will love this. If you're a fan of both actors, this will be your Heaven.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Long In The Tooth,"Sandra Bullock is really getting a little long in the tooth for this type of role. This type of role has passed her by 10 or 15 years ago. It is time for Sandra to start seeking new material. This movie would have been more appropriate for a woman 30-35 years of age. Say, Reese Witherspoon. There is a scene in the movie where Betty White gives Sandra Bullock a fertility blanket, I suppose to help her procreate. Well, that blanket really has its' work cut out for it because at the time of this movie Sandra Bullock was 45 years old. The movie itself was no great shakes, been there, seen that. It is mildly disconcerting how readily Ryan Reynold's character is ready to commit immigration fraud. Ho-Hum, any law I disagree with I can readily flaunt. It is also disturbing to see elderly actors/actresses like Betty White used in such a sleazy manner. We get it, ha-ha, an 87 year old woman goes to the strip club, how trendy. How would you like to be the stripper for a room full of 87 year old women? All in all it was a mediocre story, mediocre acting, and nice visuals. About 2 is all I can give it.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Movie about family values that are different for others,"This movie is great to relax and know that there will be happy ending between hard working boss and her employee. But it is hard to call great chemistry, which is built on their past rather than on current relationships. The comedy plays not the biggest role, but more of supportive to make the story less serious that it is focused on. There is great development for female lead, but Ryan Reynolds character rather feels to be a wake up call for her. In a sense, the ending part of the movies feels rather plastic in a sense of portraying the development of their relationship. Above else, scenery of community and Alaska was descent and gave the sense of opposite world to working realities of big city.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"What is the quilt pattern of the ""Baby Maker"" Quilt?","Does anyone recognize the quilt pattern? If so please add a comment to this site. I LOVED this movie - funny, romantic, scenic, and has a nice finish. The theater was packed and everyone was laughing throughout the movie. It was a real treat to see, a big hit! Sandra Bullock was, as always, perfect for her role. Even though she starts out as a hardened boss with little regard for her staff, she is endearing as her personality is revealed in the movie. Ryan Reynolds is charming, funny, and easy on the eye. Betty Reynolds is simply amazing in her role. The movie wouldn't have been the same without her. The Alaskan town is interesting, a great setting for this movie. The home is beautiful. I didn't realize just how good it would be, I recommend the movie for everyone who enjoys a good romantic comedy. I was tickled to see the same character keep popping up in different roles, as caterer, shop owner, exotic dancer, and later in a more serious role. His character was funny, but more laughable was that he kept popping up in all the scenes where he was unexpected.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Despite a formulaic template, unexpectedly sweet, insightful and witty in spite of itself","A romantic comedy with situational comedy revolving around two mismatched individuals, a looming wedding and an extended family full of quirky characters - with such an astoundingly familiar premise, one could hardly be chastised for feeling apprehensive about The Proposal, or for dismissing it as yet another of a slew of formulaic, forgettable romantic comedies. However, despite well warranted skepticism, the film's main trick card is that, in spite of it all, it is actually a worthwhile watch. Despite its formulaic structure, The Proposal boasts a welcome wit, traces of honest emotion and even a dash of profundity, assuring that while it may not be the innovative cinematic masterpiece of the decade, it at least makes for a pleasantly surprising and thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience.Director Anne Fletcher demonstrates her genre experience by showing enough sense to, rather than caving to its inherent story clichés, hit them over the head with as much spunky exuberance as possible, making the narrative, however predictable, substantially more difficult not to derive at the very least small glimmers of enjoyment from. But what comes as the most surprising are the surprising vestiges of life in Peter Chiarelli's screenplay, with not only a welcomely barbed wit and some genuinely unpredictable laughs worming through the formulaic situational comedy, but surprisingly credible bits of interpersonal interaction. Life stories, personal quirks and inner demons shared by the characters feel a cut above the usual formulaic dredge offered in such circumstances, making the individuals emerging all the more easy to warm to. Fletcher amplifies the realism aspect with fleeting moments of uncommonly artistic technical work, frequently using high angle shots to accentuate closeted emotions and feelings of inferiority, demonstrating far more thought being put into the project than the sort of by the numbers mess it might easily have been.Fletcher even manages to work some unorthodox traces of profundity into her work, as the initially cute toying with gender roles (Bullock as the icy workaholic boss, Reynolds as her neurotic assistant) turns into more of an outright exploration of the male/female binary, of the arenas in which women commonly gain power over men, and the ethical and social consequences of the inherent imbalances and struggles. Carefully dodging caving to traditional patriarchy or outright feminist preaching, Fletcher manipulates her cast of alternatively credible or cartoonish characters sufficiently to point out the flaws in either extreme, while making the eventual leveling of power dynamics between Reynolds and Bullock laudably palatable. As such, in spite of all this, it is a substantial shame to see the entire work drift inevitably into maudlin, syrupy cliché by the end, as the sharp and snappy picture leading up to the teary climax proves a far more self-aware and intriguing animal, making the eventual descent into overt formula feel somewhat of a letdown.Nonetheless, there can be no question that the real strength of the film lies in the performances of its two leads, and the prickly chemistry between them. Sandra Bullock finally peeks out from autopilot, delivering a performance which, no matter how familiar, admirably succeeds in capturing the essence of a conflicted human being, and managing to be both contemptuous, sympathetic and endearingly goofy all the while. Ryan Reynolds, meanwhile, puts his triumphant mastery of comedic timing and dry sarcasm to perfect use, while also demonstrating a scarcely glimpsed potential for bringing credible life to genuine human emotions, purloining many of the film's best lines and scenes while never unreasonably taking command of his scenes. The supporting cast is hardly as remarkable, but most do perfectly suitably jobs, with Craig T. Nelson a sturdy presence as Reynolds' gruff, domineering father and Betty White managing to for the most part evoke laughs out of a worn out 'comic relief grandmother' figure, despite coming across as simply irritating more than one would care for. Malin Ackerman is given next to nothing to do as Reynolds' ex- flame, but Oscar Nunez is a welcome scene stealer as an unorthodox male stripper, bringing in many of the film's more raucous laughs.Despite its eventual caving to cliché and patches of false or unbelievable emotional exchanges, The Proposal manages to accomplish its purpose of being charming and enjoyable with enthusiasm to spare, while managing to work in some unexpected laughs, endearingly sweet patches and even emerging as a mite profound and genuine in spite of itself. While there is still a frustrating sense of the far superior picture which might have been, the film remains worth a watch, if only for the pleasantly surprising moments of quality which pop up welcomely in the midst of its more familiar trappings.-6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Andrew Paxton played by Ryan Reynolds is an editor's assistant in a major publishing company in New York City.,"Andrew Paxton played by Ryan Reynolds is an editor's assistant in a major publishing company in New York City. He has been working closely with his boss Margaret Tate played by Sandra Bullock for more than three years in an attempt to win a promotion to editor. Andrew has become so familiar with his boss that he know just about all there is to know about her. Margaret is somewhat of a recluse in that she has virtually no social life and runs her department at the publishing company with an iron fist. Including Andrew all of her co-workers see her as a witch on a broom casting spells on all her coworkers (Hoberman, Chiarelli, & Fletcher, 2009).Andrew is a devoted employee with a passion to edit. In order to achieve this goal he feels it necessary to know everything there is to know about his boss and make sure that he pleases her at all times. Even if this means marrying her so that she can maintain her Visa status in the United States. Andrew makes what he feels is a deal with the devil in disguise. He agrees to marry Margaret only if she will give him the promotion that he feels he not only has worked three years for but that he deserves. Andrew and Margaret prove that love can come from the most unexpected places and conquer just about anything (Hoberman, Chiarelli, & Fletcher, 2009). Much like another one of Ryan Reynolds movies ""Definitely, Maybe"", where Will Hayes a successful political consultant is explaining to his daughter how he fell in love with and subsequently will divorce his daughter's mother. In the process Will falls in love with an unlikely match, a video store clerk named April (Bevan & Brooks, 2008).The first time I saw this movie I fell in love. Just the thought of two very different people coming together to take a difficult situation and make it work for all involved sounds like the perfect scenario. Andrew who is very easy on the eyes and has women throwing their phone numbers at him has poured all his hopes and dreams into trying to get a promotion to editor under a boss who needs him to such a level that she has no intentions of promoting him out from underneath her. Margaret has closed herself off to the world in such a way that she has virtually no social life and has alienated her co-workers as a result of her work ethic.This is a wonderful film of love, hope and desire. With many familiar and interesting family dynamics that most viewers can certainly relate to and understand. I found the scenery to be extremely beautiful giving the viewer a feeling of renewed hope and excitement.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Are you kidding me?,"The emotional connection between the main characters is not believable. They simply do not have enough conversations in which we see them get to know each other, leaving it hard for us to believe a relationship can realistically be developing between them.This movie relies on slapstick type humour to the extent that it literally 'slaps two naked coworkers together'. Slapstick humour can be funny, but I don't recall laughing much during this film. The film really is more of a ""comedy"" based on an unrealistic situation, than a romantic comedy.I cannot deny that this movie really disappoints, even though I am fans of Sandra and Ryan!!

A little better than just OK,"The Proposal was neither bland nor grand. It was what it was: A zany romantic comedy with a very strong cast and silly plot lines.Sandra Bullock was consistently funny, but it was Ryan Reynolds's character that stood out for me. Every time I see him on film I forget how hilarious he can be.I missed the opening 15 minutes, but basically Margaret (Bullock), a predominant book editor in New York, is in danger of being deported to Canada (unimportant as to why) and the only way she will be allowed to stay in the United States is if she gets married. Her assistant Andrew (Reynolds) is unwittingly dragged into the whole mess and agrees to a phony nuptial as long as she later promotes him to editor. But in order for everything to become official, the pair must prove to immigration that they are indeed in love and not committing fraud by passing an exhaustive test that challenges their intimate knowledge of one other. In a further attempt to attest their counterfeit romance, Margaret tells a representative from the immigration office that she and Andrew will be spending the weekend in his hometown of Sitka, Alaska.That's where I'll stop as I wish not to give too much away.If you wish to simply turn your brain off for a couple hours, The Proposal will suit you just fine. It's also a decent date movie that shouldn't be taken too seriously. There's a scene with a fluffy dog, a cell phone and a hawk that essentially puts the whole thing over the top.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Naysayers wake up!,"This movie is EXACTLY what you expect... a romantic summer comedy. It's not rocket science or brain surgery. There are no surprises, so why are people upset with that? Sandra Bullock is one of the greatest comediennes of our day. Her physical comedy is brilliant. The best part of this movie is that she gets out of the way of her fellow thespians and let's them steal scenes. Ryan Reynolds goes toe to toe with her and holds his own, if not bests her at times. Betty White just RIPS it in every scene she's in. I can just imagine Sandra saying ""do your thing!"". The script has enough substance to hold it together and actually has a few surprises. It's a Doris Day /Cary Grant movie. And yes, some of the scenes seem to be steals from other movies (even one of Bullock's own), but other movies steal from other, other movies. And wasn't it Shakespeare who said there are on 10 stories? If you want to sit back, relax, laugh and be charmed, I recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A missed opportunity for romantic comedy greatness,"Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is a ruthless editor at a New York publishing house who is loathed by her staff. Her loyal assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) does what he can to please her, but he messages everyone in the office just as much about his hate for Margaret. During a meeting with the bosses, Margaret finds out her Visa has expired and she will be deported back to Canada. On a whim, she concocts a scheme that will allow her to stay in the United States: pretend she is going to get married to Andrew. As customs tries to dissect their fake relationship, the ""couple"" travels to Andrew's parents house in Alaska to celebrate Grandma Annie's (Betty White) birthday, while finding out more about themselves.On the outset, The Proposal looks like a by-the-numbers romantic comedy unlike any other. The unlikely couple is set up early on, we get introduced very quickly to the strange and sitcomishly quirky family members and friends, and then we watch as the hi-jinx and love ensue. And for the majority of the first half, the film does exactly that. Only the film lets on that it knows how predictable it is and will become, but lets the cast have fun in their roles anyway. I did not laugh a lot, but I would be lying if I did not have a smile on my face watching Bullock and Reynolds act off each other. There is not a lot of chemistry between them, but it works because Reynolds' character is supposed to hate every fibre of Bullock's being. Watching him pull his wiseass sarcastic shtick has still not become tiresome when it is used in the right films (X-Men Origins: Wolverine was not one of those films). And Bullock has always been a reliable rom-com gem, so watching her back in a role she helped perfect was quite amusing.But then the film takes the necessary turns leading to its conclusion (packing on stranger and stranger moments of ""hilarity"" involving White), and it runs out of gas all too soon. The small amount of laughs left got replaced by weepy melodramatic drama, and a key storyline involving Andrew's relationship with his father Joe (Craig T. Nelson). Its relative ease at knowing what kind of film it is gets replaced by trying to be a film it is not. It takes its quirky set-up, and it turns it into something stale. It feels like someone caught on that the film was playing too fast and loose with romantic comedy conventions, and decided to invigorate it with some ideas it did not need to use. As it beelines headfirst towards its finale, it just becomes a complete bore to watch and lacks any of the zest and enjoyment the proceeding half of the film had. Its predictability becomes a chore for it to fulfil, not a fun obligation.The downfall of the film is in the fact that the filmmakers realized how much of a by-the-numbers romantic comedy it was, tried to change it up, but left most of the evidence behind. The requisite ex-lover is here in Gertrude (Malin Akerman). It seems to be fine for her to hang around with the family, and she reveals a few secrets about Andrew's past, but the film does nothing with her otherwise. Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O'Hare) is set up to be this dastardly villain of a customs agent, deadest on proving Margaret and Andrew are faking their engagement. But by the time he shows up again after his initial introduction, you have practically forgotten he was introduced at all. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen do a decent job as Andrew's parents, but their relationship now and from before Andrew left Alaska is never really fleshed out. We only get small chunks of what went on, and not enough to piece together this backstory that seems so integral to the film. White and Oscar Nuñez are here specifically to be comic relief, but even their outrageous antics become tiresome as the film goes on.But the brunt of the blame falls on Bullock and Reynolds. They work so well together for the first half of the film (age gap notwithstanding) that it just becomes downright heartbreaking to see it all fall apart by the end. It almost looks like the performances they were proud of ended up all at the beginning, and all the negative and rehearsal practice footage ended up at the end. You can almost pinpoint where their hearts are in it making this film, and when they just could care less. If they look like they stopped caring what happens, then why should the audience? It is just so disappointing when you go into a film with low expectations, only to have them shattered so well by being so surprised, only to realize too soon that your low expectations were right all along. I had the same experience with I Am Legend, watching a great first half only to fall prey to an absolutely atrocious second half. While The Proposal was never on track for the same off-the-rails disaster Legend quickly became, it still stands as a film that started well and just ended up being a failure.While there are some hilarious moments littered throughout the film (even when it is at its weakest), The Proposal still acts as a missed opportunity. It has the makings for a typical romantic comedy, but one with an awareness for the genre that does not impede on its ability to be enjoyable. But it betrays that sensibility far too quickly, and ruins any of the fun viewers could have had with it. It is by no means unwatchable, but unfortunately, it is nowhere near as good as it could have been.6/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The movie will further cement the actor's rep as a very likable and talented, soon-to-be full-blown movie star. (Especially with today's news that he will be the star of the next X-Men feature.) That aside, this movie is one major disappointment.Full disclosure: I'm a fan of the rom-com genre and, as such, I tend to cut them a lot of slack. The Proposal, however, just doesn't cut it. If not including every cliché in the rom-com handbook, it certainly covers a slew of them.Predictability is one thing.

Solid romantic comedy,"The Proposal is one of the better stories in the romantic-comedy genre. Margaret Tate, played by Sandra Bullock, is a fearsome autocratic book editor at a publishing firm in New York. Her ""faithful"" assistant Andrew Paxton (played by Ryan Reynolds) follows her every order but trashes the editor behind her back. The story quickly takes a turn towards the hilarious when Canadian citizen Margaret is informed of her visa expiration and imminent deportation, but instead of leaving US of A and potentially losing her job, Margaret decides to marry Ryan to gain legal residency. Ryan agrees to the scam of a ""brief marriage, quick divorce"" because of the enticing promotion she presents to him.To convince the skeptical immigration officers as well as Andrew's disbelieving family, who by this time have had an earful about Margaret, the two invent dating tales as they go. As befitting their characters, Margaret plows right on, while Andrew at times appear unconvinced and much put-upon. Adding to the fun is Grandma Annie, an outspoken and eccentric character who is into giving thanks to Mother Earth by dancing to the sound of drums.For me the female main character contributed much to the watch-ability of this film. There is something about a mixture of stubbornness, independence, and also a soft vulnerability (revealed during the Alaska trip) that I like very much. Andrew's character is convincing but gets eclipsed by the more dominant Margaret.The film has its boring trite moments, for example the bedroom scene where the two have their tête-à-tête. But these are required for plot development and are not dragged out. Even if the ending is predictable, there is plenty of comedy to compensate.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Here comes the bribe...,"Publishing powerhouse Margaret Tate is used to getting her way. She bullies her ambitious assistant, Andrew Paxton. But Margaret, a native Canadian, finds her career in jeopardy when she is denied a visa and learns she will be sent northward. She forces Andrew to become her fiancé, but she'll have to take a trip home to Alaska with him to prove to U.S. Immigration that their impending union is genuine.Every once in awhile, you must be willing to forgive a romantic comedy of its clichéd-filled plot because it's executed so well. THE PROPOSAL is one of those movies. Yes, mostly everything is done strictly by the numbers and yes, we can see the ending coming even before the movie begins but you feel so happy and warm and fuzzy inside that you want the conventional to happen.Most of this is because of the two leads: Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Both have such a great chemistry together and their scenes filled with head-on sarcasm hit the right funny spots! They elevate the movie to a higher level. Other supporting cast members include Betty White, Craig T. Nelson, and Mary Steenburgen, who all have their moments in the film.However, with all this delightful things going on, there were some problems in the film. One main one is that it has some kind of bipolar disorder. For example, one scene starts off sad and tragic and one second later, it's a sitcom. It's like the movie didn't know which route to go to. This happens frequently especially in the last half hour of the film.But other than that, the film is light and fluffy. It plays it safe and sticks to the conventions but you wouldn't mind because of the two terrific leads, whom make it better than most romantic comedies. There are also some standout scenes including one where both Bullock and Reynolds talk about themselves in a bedroom at night, which is truly heartfelt.

An excellent rom-com,"""The Proposal"" (2009) directed by Anne Fletcher and starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds is not my type of film genre. But I have to say, this is a well-crafted one within its genre's limits, such as a predictable plot and a forgiving script in terms of delivering a couple of goofy moments.In spite of all this, I enjoyed the film greatly, viewing it with my wife who wanted me to see it with her. First of, Bullock and Reynolds is a great dynamic duo, and particularly Reynolds was phenomenal in his way of delivering his humour.I thought that the script, albeit predictable, was intelligent and engaging, and the direction was nothing short of excellent for the genre, with great pacing and wonderful sets and production design.All in all, highly recommended for casual viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Boxes Checked,"This movie checks all the boxes for the RomCom genre. You've got the enemies turned lovers trope, a unique destination weekend, two charming leads and plenty of humor scattered throughout.My biggest gripe with The Proposal is the *love* between Andrew and Margaret. In order for these two to truly fall in love, we needed more scenes with them together. While in Alaska many of the scenes took them in opposite directions (i.e., the adventure with the girls, the fire dance, the talk with the dad) rather than bringing them together.I enjoyed this movie a lot and I laughed out loud more than once, it just needed a bit more depth.Best Character: Grandma Annie
Best Quote: ""Do you prefer Margaret or ""Satan's Mistress""?"" - Grandma Annie
Best Scene: The Fire DanceNote: Shout out to Ramone for being absolutely hilarious!Note 2: The mid-credit scenes were solid.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Misses the Boat,"While it has it's moments, premise is weak for several reasons:Margaret...she should have been involved with a man (maybe the writer Frank who we never see). She proposes to him first, he turns her down. Then, last ditch idea, she turns to Andrew. She carries that hurt and rejection (makes her more sympathetic and human) and reveals that in time to Andrew. In other words, make Margaret conflicted, make her begin to fall for Andrew and be shocked, confused and realize that there's more to life than being career driven by what she sees in him. The his great family thing is fine, but in her eyes Andrew becomes great, too.Andrew's mom should hate Margaret. It's OK for the older GrandMa to be all gushy and romantic, but no one really looks at why Margaret supposedly loves Andrew (a boss he's told them he hates). It falls on his mom, who should be more skeptical of the whole deal...this is her only child!! Accepting it on face value is too convenient. Again, this is something else for Margaret to have to deal with.Two scenes could have been better. Don't you think that being on a plane ride for what 10 hrs, the thought of their marriage proposal story would have come up?Also, the scene where Margaret threatens Andrew with mutilation for the grievous crime of grabbing her butt (not funny) would have been funny if she'd just forgotten herself and kneed him in his privates with Mom and Grand Mom looking on.That's it...they were too much 'in character.' Funny would have been the two of them trying to think up stuff to do to appear to be the couple they weren't in front of people. Andrew could have been laying kisses on her in front of his folks without warning her and she'd have to roll with it, etc.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Film,This is a fine and great film for everyone to watch. The crew did a terrific job in creating this film.

A 'green card' story that amuses and entertains,"This romantic comedy does what it sets out to do and I am sure that those movie fans who like this genre will enjoy the experience of seeing The Proposal.It's a very effective vehicle for Sandra Bullock to display her quirky comedy talent, and she does very well (her best movie in quite a while I think). Her co-star Ryan Reynolds adds good support and the pair dominate the screen as you would expect. But viewers won't tire of seeing the duo in action I suspect. The dialog and story move along with pace and there are plenty of opportunities for laughs and chuckles.As you might expect, this is no complex twisting plot, but rather a gentle ride through a nice story of how events can shape relationships, both for good and for bad, further complicated or helped by families.A very watchable movie that neither grates nor annoys (but neither does it leave much in the memory, I must add).My only critical comment would be that I wish the director had worked much harder to make us believe in the strength of the relationship during its transition for one end of the emotional spectrum to the other. Admitedly the plot requires the actors to act hatred and the characters to fake affection, then feel love, but I didn't feel the intensity of either end of the process.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Great Cast, Silly Story","A romantic comedy about a pushy publisher who forces her young assistant to marry her to avoid deportation to Canada.

I guess these characters weren't really supposed to be the kind of people you might work with. Come to think of it, the more I analyze it, the more I take away from it. Just go and put yourself on autopilot and don't try to figure out whether it could really happen.

Been meaning to watch for awhile and it's more fun than I thought,Crazy how this is a 14 year old movie and how much Ryan Reynolds has blossomed since not as much for Sandra Bullock but she's magnificent! Such a goofy entertaining comedy/romance I like how the 2 leads didn't get along off screen. Anne Fletcher has done some guilty pleasure films in her career some that bombed others were better that's ok sometimes mindless fun for anyone. I'm sure Betty White had fun on this despite being away from her golden retriever she was a beloved woman.

"Here's my proposal, then","Usually, I am bored watching love stories because it seems to generic in my point of view, but because there's no good TV program during Sunday noon that I can watch (I'm residing in the Philippines), I decided to view some of my DVDs and when I saw my DVD of 'The Proposal' which I haven't yet watched, it struck me and made me view it on my DVD player.The plot was not that good because it seemed to be predictable. I for one have predicted what events will happen next after I saw the first 15 to 30 minutes and even predicted what would happen in the ending. As it turns out, all of my predictions were correct.However, despite my criticism, I would still commend the convolutions done in the storyline because it was good. It was unique in the sense that it is very weird to watch a girl propose for a man and the revolving love story between them wasn't generic.The cinematography was on average and the screen portrayals were above average. The script was not that heavy enough, however, to make the audience internalize what is happening on-screen.Lastly, I believe I can not and should not comment on the effects & camera tricks used because it wasn't fantasy nor action after all, so there should be no criticisms about special effects existing.I haven't noticed any goofs further until I read all of them in IMDb.

"A Romantic, Touching and Fantastic Proposal","So, being a big butch man an' all I don't go for chick flicks... OK, I lie. I watch a load of chick flicks because they are mostly a nice entertaining time passer - I don't watch them for a good story, excellent characters and great acting.I expect most of them to be simplistic ""we don't like each other"" to ""WE LOVE EACH OTHER"". Although this fits the bill of moving from 'bleh' to 'love' it does it in a casual way and a surprisingly believable way.Bullock and Reynolds had amazing chemistry together. The way the emotions between the two characters visually developed and there wasn't a defining line where they moved from one end to the other like there is in most films. There also wasn't the very usual ""OH MY GOD YOU DID THAT THING WE'LL NEVER TALK AGAIN"" twist that leads to the ""OH MY GOD WE ARE BACK IN LOVE"" re-twist. I enjoyed this film in so many ways because the other cast/characters did fantastic jobs as well. Everything was so genuine which is unusual and one major scene brought a few tears to my eyes.This film really is a fantastic film to watch.

Better than the average romantic comedy.,"Speaking as someone who doesn't have a lot of patience for romantic comedies (and certainly not for Sandra Bullock) I was surprised how charming I found this.I like the two main characters, he's easily flustered, she's taciturn, and seeing them fake a relationship in front of his family and the authorities was quite a good laugh.With only a small amount of suspension of disbelief I could believe the real romance that blossoms between them and really root for it.it's always refreshing to see emotionally closed women have their hearts melted by a man when we get the reverse so often...it's fun.

Sadly lacked development for one of the characters,"***there may be spoilers: opinion on the ending***Frankly, I think Sandra Bullock's acting saved the movie. I started off loving the movie but the end felt very rushed. Andrew's love for Margaret didn't feel believable to me. Like maybe the movie lacked a scene where they really connected (like one person said, their love for literature. and it's a missed opportunity). I wanted to like this movie so bad because the cast and script was really good! Just really felt like something lacked on the portrayal of Andrew. There was definitely a part during the movie I felt Margaret was the only one truly falling for Andrew. Maybe they could've added a few minutes to the movie and inserted more Andrew scenes showing how she felt about Margaret.I give this movie a 7/10I would just like to add I've watched this movie 3 times and I've noticed the movie has a nice flow, makes you want to keep watching. But yeah, still cant get over the fact that the resolution didn't give justice to what came before it (As said by another IMDb user).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Delightful Blend of Romance and Comedy,"The Proposal (2009), is a charming romcom that strikes a perfect balance between humor and heartfelt emotion. The film offers a fresh take on the classic fake-relationship trope, delivering laughter, warmth, and chemistry in spades.Bullock shines as Margaret Tate, a no-nonsense book editor who finds herself on the brink of deportation due to an expired visa. Desperate to keep her position, she ropes in her unsuspecting assistant, Andrew Paxton (Reynolds), into a sham engagement. What follows is a whirlwind of hilarious scenarios as the duo heads to Andrew's quirky Alaskan family to make their relationship appear genuine.Reynolds' comedic timing and Bullock's impeccable ability to blend vulnerability with sternness make their banter irresistible. Supporting performances by Betty White as the eccentric grandmother and Mary Steenburgen as Andrew's loving mom add layers of charm to the narrative.While the plot is predictable, the journey is filled with laugh-out-loud moments, tender scenes, and a genuine emotional arc. Bullock and Reynolds' on-screen chemistry elevates the film, making the romance believable and endearing.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Filling Out The Middle Of The RomCom Genre,"This film was put together well, directed well, edited well, had some reasonably good acting, some funny parts, and even had some heart and believable chemistry. But it was Green Card lite. As usual far too many contrivances, conveniences and coincidences were crammed into a 72 hour period and simply undermined the story. There were also a couple of over the top and unfitting slapstick pieces including Betty White having to perform some Indian Earth chant that leads to Sandra Bullock performing an even sillier rap. A typically good Betty White was an otherwise believable spunky grandma, but was suddenly recast as a cartoonish loon. Ramone the wacky mr-do-it-all was an even worse distraction, while the ex-girlfriend was an unxplored sub-plot gone missing.

For those that didn't like it, should watch Cary Grant & Katherine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby, or Spencer Tracy and Hepburn in Woman of the Year - prime examples of dialogue bouncing off each character, but films that have only been appreciated later for the comic content.Reynolds eye rolling and body moves were a perfect foil for Bullock's mannerisms, and I for one hope to see these two paired up again, for me they were a dream team, it was some of the story line which let this film down.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Proposal (2009) - I Have to Pretend to Marry my Boss from Hell? Here Comes the Bribe!,"Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds star in one of the most perfect romantic comedies ever accomplished. Bullock plays a boss from hell, who pretends to marry her secretary, portrayed by Ryan Reynolds, to save herself from being deported. Then, it leads to complete wackiness when they visit Ryan Reynold's family for the fake wedding, and it ends up into hilarious consequences. Now, ""The Proposal"" is one of the greatest romantic comedies of the year, and Sandra Bullock brings another excellent role of a lifetime that stole the entire show, since her inspirational performance in ""The Blind Side"". Ryan Reynolds does a pretty good job for his role, and he makes perfect chemistry on screen with Bullock. The perfect romantic comedy ensemble continues with Malin Akerman, Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson, and the ever-loving, ever-funny Betty White. Every moment in the movie was totally hilarious, I almost fell out of my seat. Some of my favorite moments include Betty White feeling up Sandra Bullock, an accidental naked jump with Sandra and Ryan, Sandra making a groove dance with Betty White, and the hilarious interviews during the end credits. The movie also has a well-written script that really took another comedic level, and it contains worthy dialouge. But more than comedy, the movie struggles through serious romantic drama when they start to realize they are literally in love, when all they are doing is pretending to be in love. The script is top-notch, the cast is excellent, the jokes are deserving and hilarious, the heart of this movie is beautiful, and this is a well-deserved romantic comedy for the ages, and you won't be disappointed with the results of watching a Sandra Bullock flick. Well, maybe not if you saw ""All About Steve"" (I hear it's bad!). ""The Proposal"", in my review, ""a fun and exciting romantic comedy, with the incredible Sandra Bullock"".",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I love Sandra Bullock and there was no fault in her acting but the arc of her character didn't seem believable. Perhaps there needed to be a typical movie montage where they bond and laugh together in typical Hollywood style. However, despite the terrible storyline, I actually found I enjoyed this movie and have re-watched it many times since. Andrew's mum and grandma are very likable and it's nice to have a movie not primarily set in New York. It's not perfect but an enjoyable watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A funny film with a romantic touch,"""The Proposal"" is a romantic comedy film directed by Anne Fletcher and written by Peter Chiarelli. This film was released in 2009 in the United States of America. The main characters are played by Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Sandra Bullock plays the Canadian Margaret Tate, who is an executive editor in chief of a book publishing company, and Ryan Reynolds plays Andrew Paxton, her personal assistant who is always bullied around by her.After being informed that she has to leave the United States and has to go back to Canada because of an expired visa, Margaret forces her assistant Andrew into a marriage. Margaret promises Andrew to publish his book manuscript if he marries her. An U.S. immigration agent suspects them because he thinks they faked the marriage to avoid Margaret's deportation. The ""couple"" travels to Sitka, Alaska, to visit Andrew's family because of the 80th birthday of his grandmother. There, some unexpected incidents happen.We recommend this film to everybody who likes funny films with a romantic touch.

"Decent, warm-hearted comedy","Although the script included several clichés, their outcome was not always predictable, there were several twists and the whole main theme was reversed - female older boss and her younger assistant. The only thing I was curious about that amazed me: is the US so strict with its neighbor and NATO ally Canada? There are frequent illegal immigrant legalization campaigns, after all...The cast is strong and pleasant as well, especially female ones: Sandra Bullock as Margaret Tate and Betty White as Grandma Annie (White was over 85 during the filming!). Ryan Reynolds is a good actor, but not among my favorites, he seems sometimes rustic... However, there was chemistry visible between him and Bullock, and the duo was nicely complemented by others plus fine Alaskan nature, being a kind of supporting actor as well.All in all, no masterpiece, but worth watching if you like romantic comedies without syrupy course of events.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Decent proposal,"For at least the first half of its running time, I found this a reasonably amusing rom-com. Unfortunately, the plague of sentimentality sets in for the second half, reducing the laugh count and increasing the cringe factor to the movie's overall detriment.Those early scenes, almost exactly mirroring the opening shots of the similarly plotted ""The Devil Wears Prada"", raise a good few smiles as Sandra Bullock's hard-nosed career-obsessed uber-bitch walks all over her winsome P.A., country-boy-in-the-big-city Ryan Reynolds and everyone else in the major publishing house until she gets a call from the Immigration Service on her right to stay in the good old U S of A. Cue her impromptu solution, an immediate engagement to nice-guy Reynolds and their visit to his native Alaska, ostensibly to celebrate his grandmother's 90th birthday but ultimately to break the news of their sudden engagement to his nearest and dearest.The funniest scenes are those where ice-maiden Bullock gets her iceberg chipped away by the dottiness and homeliness of Reynolds and his family - her meet-up with granny Betty White in the woods chanting out her alternative mantra is hilarious as is her encounter with the only male stripper in town at a girls' night out organised by her to be on-laws.Of course given that this is a Sandra Bullock starring vehicle, I should have accepted her thawing out to reveal a marshmallow centre that Reynolds unaccountably warms to - his still-interested old girl-friend seems a much better match for him, plus of course Reynolds gets to sort out his difficulties with his stubborn old dad along the way.The acting is pleasant enough, Bullock, better when she's playing the toughie than the sap, Reynolds nicely underplaying in the fashion of his near lookalike predecessor in films of this type from a previous generation, Ryan O'Neal. Mary Steenburgen, whom I've loved since her introduction to me in ""Tender Is The Night"" about 30 years ago, is the best looking female in the film however; although she doesn't get much to do, I'm pleased to see her still getting parts in big Hollywood films.As I said, it's a pity that the film lost its way for me on its path to the inevitable happy ending, but as modern-day family entertainment, this wasn't bad at all.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
This Summer's First Romantic Comedy,"Everything in this movie may look clichéd, and you may have seen much of the same material from so many other contemporary romantic comedies – girl and boy meet, girl and boy clash, girl and boy get together under unexpected circumstances, girl and boy fly to town to meet boy's parents, girl and boy are about to get married, girl and boy have a fight and break up, girl and boy fly out of town separately only to coincidentally find each other back home and fall back in love again. But a winsome cast holds everything together and sustains many honest laughs to keep ""The Proposal"" from being another formulaic romantic comedy and date movie.Sandra Bullock has been the heroine of so many romance films since 1995's ""While You Were Sleeping,"" but here in ""The Proposal,"" she gets to play a ruthless corporate witch. She plays Margaret, the tough book editor of a prestigious publishing firm in Manhattan, bullying everybody, including her assistant Andrew, played by Ryan Reynolds, who has also established himself as a romantic leading man in many of his recent movies. Somehow, they are smitten by each other deep down. They discover that when an immigration visa inspector (played by Denis O'Hare) declares that Margaret's Canadian visa has expired and she has not renewed it, and now he wants her to leave the country. Margaret and Andrew come up with a ruse saying that they are engaged to be married, but they don't go back to Canada. He whisks her off to Alaska.The Alaska scenery is actually shot in the daylights of Boston and Rhode Island. Here, Andrew introduces Margaret to his parents (nicely played by Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen) and his spry ""Grammie"" about to turn 90 (the always reliable Betty White, 87 years young). The women immediately take a liking to Margaret and accept her as part of the family. However, the father is more cantankerous and doesn't want to see his son fly away millions of miles from home with his bride-to-be, but he warms up to his son and prospective daughter-in-law near the end of the film.There are a lot of laughs that keep the audience rolling, and intermittently, there are scenes played with heart for good balance. No, this is not going to make movie history or win any Academy Awards, but it is a light outing for anyone who wants to fall in love, have a good laugh, or even wants their hearts touched. ""The Proposal"" is an enjoyable summer romance.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great chemistry since Speed,"OK, first of all I love Sandra Bullock even knowing that most of her movies are not so interesting enough. Her charisma is always the top thing about her and her comedy felling always flows naturally being always a pleasure see her in the big screen. On the other side I feel bad because she is one of those stereotyped actress that no matter how hard she pushes in titles like A Time To Kill, Crash, Premonition or Infamous she will never be successful enough if not in a While You Were Sleeping-thing. But following her career for more than 10 years, I have no doubts that she's a great actress.Anyway, this movie is another one with nothing that we haven't seen before in her career or any other 'chick-flick' genre, but I liked because she's comfort in it, and also, there's Ryan Reynolds, and both has a great chemistry in the screen that I haven't seen since Speed. Certainly is entertaining and charming, there are memorable sequences and a few good dialogs, but mainly actors that are not really acting but their experiences give spontaneous funny moments making the movie a lot enjoyable. Even the trailer showing most of the best parts, you would probably enjoy seeing them again. Some kind nostalgic when compared to the old romantic comedy movies but also some kind boring for, once again, being so predictable and full of clichés.The movie plot has a lot of problems mainly about unnecessary issues like Andrew's ex-girlfriend or also his relationship problems with his dad resulting in forgettable dialogs. Seems that they tried to give some consistence for a so loose plot, but audience probably will not give any importance to that as the lack of consistence is notable on its very beginning.But that's OK.

A mixed Proposal of cinematic engagement and disengagement,"Oh, my love. You are the most beautiful and caring woman in this universe. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Saying that (bending on one knee presenting an engagement ring) Would you marry me? Oops! Wrong Proposal written material! That is the one I used in my real-life Proposal pop to my wife. The one intended here is for the romantic comedy ""The Proposal"". Sandra Bullock stars as Margaret Tate, a domineering publisher executive who is threatened to be deported from the U.S. because of past illegal immigration business traveling. Margaret is Canadian. Ryan Reynolds co-stars as Andrew Paxton, Margaret's restless assistant who dreams of proposing himself to move up the publishing hierarchy to Editor. In a desperate & improvisational move to convince her bosses to let her stay employed and avoid deportation, Margaret pretends that she is engaged to Andrew. He is obviously oblivion to this firsthand but quickly sees Margaret's selfish motives. Margaret & Andrew travel to Alaska to visit Andrew's family for his grandmother's 90th Birthday, and consequently so Marg can learn more about Andrew & his Paxton family tree so she can ace the dreadful Immigration interrogation of marriage authenticity. Did Andrew and Margaret get at each other's throat in Alaska? Or do they fall for each other throughout this crazy ordeal? Does his family suspect the farce of it all? Does his grandmother survive? Does Margaret get to keep her job? Does she get deported? Am I asking way too many questions in this review? OK, I will stop! It is just that I am in this ""popping the question"" mode while scribing this Proposal review. One question I would definitely say ""No"" to is: If Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds had screen chemistry? Not to take away from their quasi-commendable performances, I just do not see Sandra being Ryan's hope as a compatible acting partner. And visa-versa for Sandra with Ryan, and that is no bullock! Betty White did have some golden scene-stealing efforts as Grandma Annie, but I would not give it a ""grandmother clause"" recognition because we have seen these shades of White numerous times before with her recent film characters in playing the loony geriatric. Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen looked bored portraying Andrew's parents. And Oscar Nunez playing the Latin zany ""do-it-all"" named Ramone became a running joke that became way too outlandish & creepy and disbarred credibility from his performance; even though there were some ""guilty pleasure"" smirks along the Ramone way. Screenwriter Pete Chiarelli should have proposed to write up a wittier and less formulaic screenplay than the one he offered for the film. Director Anne Fletcher tried to engage the audience with inventive comedic scenes, but not enough to accept her working of ""The Proposal"" as viably original. I do not think you should totally reject ""The Proposal"" but give it some time to think about it, and wait to rent it during its DVD release. End of Proposal! *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good idea ruined by romcom conventions,"There seem to be tons and tons of generic romantic comedies out there nowadays. Most of them have the same basic storyline and the 'comedy' is pretty dry. This movie, however, is different. When I read the plot I though to myself 'Here we go again'. However, I was wrong and pleasantly surprised. It has many parts that made me smile, even laugh. The acting, the production, the cinematography, it's all very neat and polished.But what exactly went wrong with this? Well, with all the unconventional humour found in the movie, I did not expect the movie to succumb to usual romcom clichés and such. But towards to end of the movie, it pretty much became like every other romcom. The movie became very less funny, there was too much emphasis on the romance and the ending is completely predictable to anyone who has even watched a couple of romcoms. I already knew what the ending was going to be when I read the plot but when I saw the movie, I kept hoping that this one would defy the dumb rules of romcoms.Overall, this is a movie that starts out very promising but ends up very generic. When will movie makers realise that you do not need to stick to stupid rules to make a good movie? If you're a romcom fan, I'd definitely recommend it as it's probably the best I've seen in the genre, alongside 50 First Dates. If you're not a romcom fan, this is worth checking out but only if you have nothing better to do.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

While You Were Sleeping ....Take 2,"Although entertaining to a point, there are too many similarities to other comedies to make THE PROPOSAL anything but ordinary.Most notably I found the plot to be very similar to another, older Sandra Bullock movie, WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING. But this time we have an accomplice in the deceit and he's not in a coma. Seriously. Think about it...A woman who is in need of something (in this case a need NOT to be deported) comes up with a plan to achieve that goal (whether by accident – While You Were Sleeping – or not – The Proposal). Girl falls for the wrong guy. Guy falls for wrong girl. Family gets fooled. Girl confesses and thinks she's lost everything. Guy chases down girl with the approval of the family. Everyone lives happily ever after. Ta-da! The entertainment value in the film comes from the first half of the movie in which we have plenty of comedic zingers flying about, including quite a few from Grandma Annie (Betty White) while trying to dress Margaret (Sandra Bullock, THE LAKE HOUSE) in a wedding dress and losing – then finding – her breasts.The cast is good in their respective roles, including main love interest Ryan Reynolds (SMOKIN' ACES) playing Andrew Paxton, a sort of rich boy playing poor boy in order to tick-off his father, Joe, played by Craig T. Nelson (THE FAMILY STONE). Nelson just seems to be going through the motions during the entire film and never really gains and traction. As does Mary Steenburgen (THE DEAD GIRL) who plays Reynold's mother.The other problem with the casting is that we just don't get that romantic air between Bullock and Reynolds' characters. She is obviously much older than him (can you say ""cougar?""), which isn't always a problem but, again, there just didn't seem much attraction going on. They fight, argue and never really resolve anything before miraculously falling in love ...because of one kiss? Let's get real...Even with these flaws, the comedic timing is excellent and the visual backdrops of Boston and the (supposed) Alaskan countryside can take one's breath away. Also, the Paxton family house is stunning to see.Looking for something original? Not here. Want a fantastic romance story? Not here either. Looking for something entertaining, funny, and visual appealing? Give this one a try.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
PG-13 was an extremely misleading rating,"The first half of ""The Proposal"" was charming, funny,unpredictable and swimming in talent. But then it dove, ruined itself for no narratively justifiable reason, via two scenes of raunchiness and nudity. One implied that decent women and grandmas see erotic dancing as a family outing. The other showed a towel-less star having to use a mitten to cover her genitals with one hand while covering her breasts with her other. The camera focused on the woman's body for what felt like an eternity. This was not what I want to see on a date with my husband.The PG-13 rating implies a child might see the film with a parent. It implies a fourteen year old would be fine watching the film alone.The old ""sex sells"" cliché is poisonous. It's a public health issue. Children and others exposed to erotic views can become addicted to ""the drug of the new millennium."" The porn addiction weakens self-esteem and relationships. Don't put this stuff under a PG-13 rating.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Predictable fun,"Yes, THE PROPOSAL is predictable from the beginning, but who cares? It's fun seeing how it all comes out. Some good performances (especially Sandra Bullock and Betty White) and scenery help make the 108 mins. of run time go by painlessly. Looks like a few moments were left on the ""cutting room floor"" as there seems to be some elements and time frame out of sync. Actor Denis O'Hare who plays the immigration officer has a silly role and he overplays it terribly. Not a good actor at all. Spoils the few scenes he's in. For a nice evening with popcorn in hand, THE PROPOSAL fits the ticket. At least there's no foul language, sex scenes, car chases or explosions!!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I am not a big Sandra Bullock fan but have to admit, she had a fine acting job in this film , have not seen, her Oscar performance yet. Betty White was terrific as the spunky grandmother of our assistant Andrew to Margaret the chief editor aka shrew of a top notch publishing company. Faced with deportation, Andrew agrees to marry Margaret to save her life so to speak. Everything is not what it seems as far as Andrews life as well as with Margarets life.

Predictable..........and yet.........,"For me it was better than expected. The star of the show , however , must be Betty White, who had the funniest lines and the kookiest looks as the grandma who is celebrating her 90th Birthday. It's really a film of 2 halves - the first & most interesting one where Sandra Bullock, a domineering & disliked Canadian senior publisher, is being deported back to Canada for flouting US Immigration laws. She hits on the plan to wed her assistant, Ryan Reynolds to allow her to remain & for him to keep his job. They have to convince the Immigration authorities they are a genuine couple in love & need to fly to Alaska to celebrate Ryan's Grandma's birthday & announce their engagement. This all works well, with snappy dialogue and good interplay from the couple. The second half falls into line with numerous other rom-coms, where they reveal more of themselves and get locked into other family issues.
Overall, it works pretty well & Sandra Bullock & Ryan Reynolds show adept abilities in a comedic role. They are ably supported by Mary Steenburgen & especially Betty White who I can't say enough good things about. See the film just for her performance alone !",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It ain't great, but I liked it more than I thought I would","Boy meets girl. Girl meets boy. They hate each other. They are forced to spend time with each other. Despite a few obstacles, boy and girl realize the other isn't as bad as they initially thought. Boy and girl grow to like each other in an unrealistically short amount of time. Just when they are about to be together, another obstacle is tossed in their way. Boy and girl overcome obstacle and kiss. The end.That is essentially the formula for pretty much any Hollywood studio romantic-comedy and ""The Proposal"" is about as Hollywood studio as it gets.The trouble with romantic comedies is that even before the screenwriter can type ""Fade In"" on his script, he knows the audience already knows the ending to his story. So he has to make the journey enjoyable and, more often than not, the journey doesn't quite work or fails miserably, as is the case in ""My Life in Ruins,"" for instance. True, ""The Proposal"" is not nearly as disastrous or dull as the Nia Vardalos film, but that isn't saying much now, is it?The journey in ""The Proposal"" is awfully clichéd and unwinds almost exactly how and when one of those hackneyed screen writing gurus would want the plot to unfold. However, what eventually saves ""The Proposal"" are its two stars - Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Together, they don't have much chemistry - you wanna see real on-screen chemistry in romantic comedies, watch Carole Lombard and William Powell in ""My Man Godfrey"" (1936) or Lombard and Fredric March in ""Nothing Sacred"" (1937) or Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn in ""Bringing Up Baby"" (1938) or Grant and Rosalind Russell in ""His Girl Friday"" (1940) - but, individually, Reynolds and Bullock have charm, charisma and an innate ability to keep us interested.This material is beneath Bullock. She can play these roles in her sleep and, I suppose, the lack of success of her more dramatic films - some have been utter duds and ""Crash"" (2004) does not count because she was just part of a huge ensemble and not the lead - forces her to continue seeking romantic comedies. After all, she is the woman who turned down ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004) so she could star in ""Miss Congeniality 2"" (2005).Bullock has a nice knack for comedy and does admirably here, given the limitations of the script. It's nothing we haven't seen from her before and perhaps it's that familiarity that brings about a semblance of charm to this picture. Reynolds tends to be a bit of a one-note player but, here again, it's an engaging little note. In his defense, he does have a fine sense of comedic timing and can turn an otherwise conventional line into something funny. Malin Akerman shows up in a throw-away role that she tries valiantly to make bigger.You are not going to see anything in ""The Proposal"" that is unpredictable or you haven't seen in countless romantic comedies before. But Reynolds and Bullock bring an energy to the film that made me like it much more than I thought I would. It made me cringe in some places, when I saw screenwriter Pete Chiarelli trying so desperately to eke out laughs because he couldn't drum up anything original.There's plenty of terrific comedic stuff to be mined here - immigration, older woman-younger man, workaholic bosses and much more - but Chiarelli is thoroughly content on sticking strictly to convention. And, given the lack of sizzle between Bullock and Reynolds together, he entrenches his script in formula. So we are treated to forced-funny moments - a ""remedy"" screenwriters seek in romantic comedies that rarely works - of seeing the wonderful Betty White doing some sort of American Indian tribal dance in the woods and Bullock hamming it up, and the over-use of Ramone (Oscar Nunez), making him the film's most annoying and unfunny character. We also get needless subplots, including a father-son conflict. I told you: It's as if Chiarelli kept referring to some screen writing handbook.Anne Fletcher's direction is an uninspired as her previous effort, ""27 Dresses"" (2008). On the other hand, ""The Proposal"" is a more enjoyable film than ""27 Dresses.""What's ultimately disappointing about ""The Proposal"" is that despite having essentially smart characters, it gives them nothing smart to do. What a pity. It was, however, refreshing to see an older woman-younger man relationship on film. After sitting through Catherine Zeta-Jones falling for Sean Connery or Nicolas Cage in bed with Jessica Biel or Harrison Ford romancing Anne Heche or Clint Eastwood hooking up with Rene Russo, it's about time we saw the flip side. And as for the well-choreographed - and much talked about - nude scene in ""The Proposal,"" there's one thing you can certainly say: Bullock: has one heck of a body.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Predictable, but good for a laugh","The Proposal brings together an actor I love (Ryan Reynolds) and an actor I don't (Sandra Bullock), and puts them in a likeable comedy that often gets big laughs. With that said, it isn't going to win any points for surprises. The majority of things you'd expect would happen in a scenario like this happen, and oftentimes, if a certain detail is brought up (like Bullock not being able to swim), odds are it will have an obvious payoff at some point, though more often than not, the payoff will get a laugh. Thankfully, the dreaded misunderstanding cliche that's in so many rom-coms is nowhere to be found and, for a liar revealed story, the scene where the truth comes out is surprisingly painless. As for the comedy, it comes down to several factors, whether it be Reynolds screwing with Bullock, her reacting to the more humble lifestyle in his hometown, or good old fashioned slapstick. Regardless, it got a ton of laughs from me, with a few scenes in particular having me practically in tears. And it has some decent drama, though it does feel a little uneven in the first half, with more drama than comedy. Thankfully, the comedy really picks up in the second hand, with near non-stop laughs.I really didn't buy Bullock as the nightmare boss she's supposed to be. I feel she plays it too safe to work as someone so feared and hated by her employees. She's harsh, sure, but not unreasonably so. It's only immediately after the titular proposal that she starts to seem that bad, but it's too little too late. Also, her transition from hating Reynolds to starting to fall for him is very abrupt and doesn't feel earned. With that said, she handles the comedic and dramatic moments really well and has good chemistry with him. Reynolds meanwhile is hilarious as always and really carries much of their scenes together. As for the supporting cast, they do a good job, but most of them aren't really funny, except for, no surprise here, Betty White as Reynolds' grandmother. She was truly one of a kind and she is arguably the best part of the movie, responsible for one of the aforementioned scenes that had me in tears.Overall, The Proposal has a lot of flaws, but also a lot of strong elements. Above all, though, it made me laugh a ton. And for a comedy, that really what's most important.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The reason why I don't watch rom coms,"The Proposal is one of the most clichéd and routine movie formulas in existence. A comically unlikable boss forces her assistant to marry her so that she can sort out a visa problem. This seems to be moderately popular and plenty of people seem to like it. Why?! Just why? Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds do have plenty of chemistry. They're good in the movie and although they don't seem to star in that many great movies perhaps they deserve to. It has mildly amusing moments involving dogs, getting fired and various awkward situations. It's not aimed at me at all, but the best films can be enjoyed even by those who aren't that bothered about that kind of movie. I hated this movie. I don't know quite why I hated it, I just hated it. The premise is awkward to begin with and seeing it get dragged out over 2 hours when it's better off for a skit on a comedy show is agony. The script is absolutely by the numbers and makes the film feel like a landfill of clichés, unoriginality, stereotypes, stock characters and formula.The direction is very routine and cinematically the film isn't interesting at all. It just doesn't have a lot of charm or brains, and it's so insistent on sticking to formula that you know every single thing that's going to happen 20 minutes before it does. It's just awkward situation after awkward situation but it's not funny it's just... awkward. This is an example of how stale romantic movies have become in recent times, although to its credit it's so formulaic and bland that means you don't need to watch any other romantic films as every single cliché in the book has been summarized in this. It isn't funny and it just feels annoying and the excess of awkwardness removes any real charm or surprises from the movie. Just don't bother with it if this isn't your sort of thing. If you don't like this sort of movie it'll be nightmare. Look at the poster. Watch the trailer. Read the back of the DVD cover. You've now seen the whole movie.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Proposal,"OK so, the rule is as followed. As a dude I'm entitled to enjoy one romantic comedy a year, any more than that and I may as well have grown a vagina. The trailer for ""Bride Wars"" made me distinctively uncomfortable. I couldn't make it through the first 30 minutes of ""Confessions of a shopaholic"" so it comes as no surprise that this proposal didn't interest me. Why did I go? To state a few reasons, its starring Ryan Reynolds, aka the greatest guy that ever lived. He was the one spot of blue in the big sea of red that was ""Wolverine"" and his presence alone made me excited to see the proposal. The verdict? This is one of the better romantic comedies you'll be likely to see this year, granted its made especially for women, this won't send men into a nauseating coma but It may just make that special someone go week at the knees. If the movie doesn't do it, Reynolds is sure to.Sandra Bullock stars in the romantic comedy The Proposal, as a Canadian immigrant who creates a demanding and difficult work environment for her subordinates at the office. When the news arrives that she's about to be deported to the Great White North, she rushes into a marriage of convenience with her young assistant (played by Ryan Reynolds) to prevent such a catastrophe from occurring. 27 Dresses' Anne Fletcher directs from a script by Peter Chiarelli for Touchstone Pictures. The story isn't anything groundbreaking. To put it simply its tediously formulaic and, as is the trend for romantic comedies, ""The Proposal"" doesn't aim for new heights. Instead of going for gold it plays it safe making for a satisfying if unoriginal coupling. The story hits every point you expect, it has the rise, the fall, the rise then once again, the fall and, not to ruin the ending but typically our heroes rise once more. It's been here seen that all before material but it does a decent job of getting from point A to point B.What works for the film particularly well is casting director Amanda Mackey Johnson knew what she was doing. The film is wonderfully cast with each actor giving it everything they could. We've come to expect exceptional performances from screen veterans like Reynolds, Bullock and Steenburgen but the real pleasure comes from Golden Girl Betty White was makes for a hysterical treat as she goes from the bizarre to the downright dangerous. Bullock is better here than she's been in some time. That's not to say she is going to be nominated for any awards but she gets the job done with grace and dexterity, and for a woman of her age to have the guts to do a nude scene, you have got to give her props. What's odd is my distain for this director (Anne Fletcher) previous two movies. Step Up and 27 Dresses were two films I couldn't get through, possibly because I'm the wrong crowd but here she brings her A game and directors each moment with grace and a certain style that I haven't seen in a Romantic comedy in quite some time.Whoever decided to cast Sandra and Ryan in this together is a genius. Their chemistry is so natural and they look so good together that it is one of the main reasons that this film works. You won't laugh out loud too often. And in fact some of the scenes are plain embarrassing (especially those involving Oscar Nunez's waiter/exotic dancer/minister character) but it is all rather engaging fun. Plus there is a very funny nude scene that Bullock and Reynolds have to share that goes to show that both are in good nick physically (remember she has 12 years on her younger co-star)and are game for a laugh.Verdict: The Proposal is not a marriage made in heaven by any means, but the eventual charm of the leads and a gag-packed second half manage to salvage the movie from inauspicious beginnings. Ultimately, there is something refreshing about The Proposal's undemanding humour and unabashed feel-good factor. A pedigree cast, fun premise and punchy dialogue make Bullock's return to romantic comedy look a great catch, and Reynolds is sharper than a diamond solitaire. For my overall rating I give the proposal 3/5.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The stars deserve much better,"From the opening moments of sitcom-inspired office hi-jinks in this plinky-plonky rom-com, the outcome is never in doubt. When we first glimpse our leads - beautiful people Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds - the inevitability of how this film will leave us is cemented even further. There's a set formula to these kinds of movies, and knows well enough just how the target audience it so aggressively pursues wants to be left feeling. The key to a decent rom-com is having a funny script; one that will have you laughing and hoping the mismatched couple will finally realise their love for one another to care about how predictable the whole things is. Anne Fletcher's The Proposal does none of these things, and instead betrays the likability of its leads by having little zip, and keeping them apart for what seems like a large chunk of the movie.Margaret Tate (Bullock) is executive editor-in-chief in a successful New York-based publishing company. She has an icy reputation in the office, and her panicked underlings frequently alert the others of her arrival via group e-mail. Her dedicated but overworked assistant Andrew Paxton (Reyolds) is the only one who tolerates her, and that is because he hopes to win himself a promotion through his loyalty and hard work. Margaret also happens to be Canadian, and after a minor violation of the terms of her work visa, she finds herself facing deportation and without the job she has worked so hard to get. In a panic, she announces that she has been seeing Andrew for the past year and the happy couple are soon to be married, much to Andrew's dismay. Sensing foul play, U.S. immigration agent Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O'Hare) keeps a close watch on them, forcing Margaret to accompany Andrew to a family get-together in Sitka, Alaska.Despite never really convincing as a couple, and neither really having moments of clarity that will help us understand when the script starts to push the two closer together, the two leads are a joy to watch. Bullock is now a legend of the genre, and Reynolds demonstrates the cheeky charisma he wouldn't be allowed to fully embrace until 2016's Deadpool. It's solid proof that the fault lies with the material they're given. Once in Alaska, The Proposal becomes a sickly loop of increasingly bizarre comedy set-pieces, including a moment where Margaret must fend off an eagle attacking the yappy family dog. It's a sea of white, middle-class faces, and the only person of colour seems to be the Hispanic Ramone (Oscar Nunez) who, in a slight racist twist, works just about every job in town from store-owner to stripper. There's also the dull sub-plot involving Andrew's father (Craig T. Nelson), who wants his son to ditch his New York adventure to join the family business, which exists solely to give Andrew something to do away from Margaret.

Rom-com disaster...likable players lost in an ocean of inanities,"The resident dragon lady at a New York City publishing house will be deported back to her native Canada if she doesn't marry her male secretary, who despises her. Woebegone romantic material from screenwriter Peter Chiarelli, who flails away with the most obvious gags. For the first hour, Sandra Bullock (who also served as executive producer) and Ryan Reynolds testily badger each other, culminating with Bullock threatening her would-be fiancé with castration (that joke never was very funny). The final 47 minutes suddenly turn warm and fuzzy--nothing surprising about that, though the two stars are obviously more comfortable with this territory. Chiarelli is so hung up on his laugh-lines that he never does get around to creating engaging or appealing characters; despite a friendly cast, the emphasis is not on the people but on the jokes. Setting the entire second act in Alaska (during summer solstice with constant sunlight) doesn't really work, either...it's too disconcerting for an assembly-line comedy. The two protagonists attempt to fool the assistant's large, bustling family with their sham engagement...and wouldn't you know it? His parents decide they should get married right then and there (in the barn--it's a tradition after all!). ""The Proposal"" is a continual cop-out without an ounce of wit, coasting on Bullock's built-in good will and even reprising some of her former movie highlights (like a Greatest Hits package).

Excellent movie,"The plot has its weaknesses, especially some of the sudden ""jolts"", but all in all a nice movie to watch.I found some of the scenes a little too forced, but they were prolly needed to get the plot along.And there is a lot to like in this movie. I really liked the ""boss"" scenes in the office, and the ""country"" setting afterwards. Sandra B makes an excellent bitchy-boss (female): be nice to customers/bosses and demand perfection of her underlings. Her Male assistant is perfectly suited to her as well.Once out in the country, you cannot help to develop a sympathy for the parents either. And I especially like the way the father is portrayed.10/10 for encouragement to Sandra.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Bad, Bad, Bad","The story was something we've seen thousands of times before. You not only know where the plot is going, you're there ahead of them. So it was predictable and forgettable. The casting was dumb. There is no chemistry between the two leads. It was unbelievable. Sandra Bullock is too old for these ingenue parts. It wasn't funny. It was just cringe-worthy.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romantic Comedy fun,"This movie was fun! And, I read a review somewhere that said it was unrealistic and ridiculous. Well, I personally don't want to see a boring realistic story or yet ANOTHER so called ""reality"" situation put on the big screen instead of staying on a smaller screen where the viewer can turn the dang thing off. In other words, keep the romantic comedies coming Hollywood and make them fluffy, ROMANTIC, FUNNY and full of hope. And, I personally enjoy them being filmed in another unrealistic way, or fantasy like to me....in a state/town/place that has seasons and isn't over a 104 degrees everyday. I can live vicariously that way too. So, loved the movie, Ryan Reynolds has been one of my fav's since the Pizza place show and Sandra Bullock can still make you laugh and love her all at the same time. The End. : )",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Completely Generic,"The only part of this movie that is not a generic romcom is the proposal!Everything else is pretty generic after 10 minutes in. The character also just don't make any sense honestly. The reaction to the female protagonist of everyone at the office was as if she were an incredibly harsh and serious person, but that is not how she acts at all, much to the contrary, the male protagonist is the one who acts as if in a dominant hierarchy for most of the movie, while she acts as a clumsy and generic woman. The two main characters also take actions that go straight against their goals all the time, and this is just unbearable.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rom-com haters begone -- it was good!,"Anyone who didn't give this movie full marks just plain doesn't like romantic comedies. You know who you are.

The rest of you, go see this movie.Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds have fantastic screen chemistry. And for once, we see an older woman and a younger man – hallelujah! A playful reversal of gendered rom-com clichés! Fantastic supporting performances! Great clothes and scenery! What more does anyone want? And did I mention naked Ryan Reynolds? Not quite ten dollars' worth, but enough to leave you with a big smile on your face as you exit the theater.And you know what? There were guys in the theater laughing their asses off, so don't tell me this is just a ""chick"" flick.

"Awesome ""Proposal""","First off, Sandra Bullock is so hot nearly naked in ""The Proposal"". Her romantic lead Ryan Reynolds is completely ripped, seeing his shredded body is depressing. The two literally collide naked in a hysterical scene. Reynolds's Andrew screams, ""Oh my G**!"" Bullock's Margaret screams, ""Why are you naked?"" Andrew yells, ""Why are you wet?"" Director Anne Fletcher's ""The Proposal"" is the best romantic comedy of the year, by far. ""The Proposal"" brilliantly written by Peter Chiarelli is a cross between ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"". ""The Proposal"" is formula; however, Fletcher and Chiarelli deliver flawlessly on point.Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds have such amazing chemistry. I am such a fan of Bullock. She is beautiful, and masterfully transitions between comedic and poignant. There is a touching scene following Gammie's (wonderful Betty White) ""Easter egg"" hunt for Margaret's (Bullock) boobs in a wedding gown fitting. Gammie gives Margaret the family keepsake that has been in the Paxton family for generations. She tells Margaret that grandmothers want to feel like they will be part of their grandchildren's lives after they are gone. Bullock silently stares into the mirror as her eyes well up. I too welled.After Margaret shares with Andrew (Reynolds) the significance of her tattoo, Andrew, who is sleeping on their bedroom floor says, ""Don't take this the wrong way. You are a very, very beautiful woman."" Reynolds is the new George Clooney. He is handsome, charming, and can deliver a line. Reynolds is going to be a huge star. He has the action star body, but his real gift is romantic comedy. Reynolds has great spirit. He and Bullock are awesome together. Whether Bullock hilariously reminds him, ""Touch my ass one more time, and I'll cut your nuts off in your sleep."" or when Reynolds quietly comforts Bullock in the boat, they land as real and authentic. ""The Proposal"" is hysterical and predictable, yet unexpectedly poignant-- celebrating the best in people.In ""The Proposal"" Sandra Bullock plays Margaret Tate, high powered Type A and Editor-in-Chief of a New York Publisher. Scattered and smart Ryan Reynolds plays Andrew Paxton, her suffering and loyal executive assistant. Margaret asks if Andrew's family is telling him to quit his job. Andrew replies, ""Every day."" The Chairman Bergen (solid Michael Nori) informs Margaret that she is being deported—back to Canada. When Andrew interrupts the meeting, Margaret derives a solution. She informs Bergen, ""We're, ah getting married."" Stunned Andrew replies, "" We are."" However, Andrew now realizes that Margaret is beholding to him. The conspiracy is risky. Intrepid Immigration Agent (brilliantly stiff Denis O'Hare) warns the happy couple that if he uncovers fraud, Margaret will be deported and Andrew will go to jail for years.So in the mean time, Margaret and Andrew travel back to his hometown of Sitka, Alaska to attend the 90th Birthday of his grandmother Gammie (Betty White), and announce their engagement. Margaret discovers that Andrew's family are the Kennedy's of Alaska. Andrew has not been home in 3 years, because his father Joe (great Craig T. Nelson) wants him to take over the family business, and stop messing around in New York. Andrew's passion is becoming an editor, and paradoxically his bond to Margaret despite the surface disdain. Mary Steenburgen is amazing as Andrew's mother Grace, who is the strong and understated peacemaker. She has a powerful scene where she tells Joe to clean it up with Andrew. Margaret also meets Gertrude (charming and pretty Malin Akerman), Andrew's ex-girlfriend. Margaret witnesses Andrew's life and dreams.Can Andrew and Margaret pull off the charade, and the family induced wedding? Of course high jinx ensue. Margaret has her Blackberry high jacked by an eagle, and survives Sitka's only exotic male dancer (hysterical Oscar Nunez). Andrew stresses out that his Mom's dreams will be dashed when she discovers fraud. Here Fletcher balances humanity at the narrative arc. Margaret breaks down realizing her selfishness when she tells Andrew, ""I forgot what it was like to have a family Have people love you"" We kind of know how things will resolve in the ""The Proposal"", but that is never really the point. It is the things unsaid, like the look in Andrew's eyes when he realizes that he is in love with Margaret, that touch us. ""The Proposal"" is hysterical, smart, and all about love and heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nothing Special At All,"In my review of The Break-Up, I expressed my frustration at modern romantic comedies. This one is that exactly. I mean, this movie feels like the stereotypical romantic comedy. More formulaic than just about any film that I've ever seen.After awhile, I started getting the same feeling that I did when I saw Prom Night: I was calling out what was going to happen next thirty minutes before it happened. It got quite annoying. There's a scene for an obvious setup for a gag in which Bullock and Reynolds end up in the same room without seeing each other and both get naked to take a shower. It's such an obvious setup for ""hilarious misunderstanding"" that I wanted to turn off the film. And the film is *so* predictable. They force themselves with each other but then *gasp!* they start falling for each other. I mean, *who* could have seen *that* coming?!As for the performances, they were nothing special at all. I thought Reynolds did okay, but his character was entirely uninteresting to me. As for Bullock, she was bad. She wasn't Kristen-Stewart-bad, but she was still worse than I've ever seen her before. She just seems so lazy with it, as if she didn't really care about the picture. Sandra Bullock played an executive type character who will be kicked back to Canada from whence she came, so she must marry to stay in the country and with her job.But here was a *huge* problem I had with the movie: why did that guy *care* if they were really in love or not? A marriage is a marriage, dude, so calm down. It's not like they were forging the marriage, so what is going to matter if she just does it to stay in the USA? I did not like The Proposal much at all. Of course, I liked Betty White, but that's because she was Betty White. And even she was subjected to some really lame setups.The Proposal wasn't total crap, but it's devotion to formula is what made me so frustrated by it. It might have had some potential if the filmmakers had bothered to do anything new with the film, but they didn't bother. No effort put into story, so no effort by me to be entertained.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delightful Romp,"Sandra Bullock absolutely wonderful as always but I had not seen Ryan Reynolds before and wasn't certain how he would pan out, but to my surprise, I found him to be not just engaging but very sexy and a perfect foil for Sandra - together they make a great couple and I even teared up at the end - yikes - am I turning into a creme puff or what? The supporting cast is uniformly strong and the location shots are first rate - who knew Alaska could be so inviting - in fact all production values are first rate and I am certain this has a lot to do with the fact that the film was Sandra's baby since she is one of the producers and I am certain the force behind getting the film made. She is no longer a lightweight - that's for sure. She's right up there with the big boys!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Uau! I saw Sandra Bullock naked!,"You can actually see Sandra Bullock naked in this movie!!! and man, she gets better and better as she ages!

But did I say that Sandra Bullock appears really naked? and...Jesus...she's so beautiful! About the movie..about the plot, about the acting...bah! that's not very important!...the important about this movie is that you realize your life is going to change when you leave theater, because you capture the message of hope and honesty, and you learn that you can only feel complete when you stand for what you believe, no matter what....or is it because you saw Sandra Bullock naked and now you can walk all the way home with a smile on your face?! Damn! she is gorgeously hot!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
An unexpected pleasure...Ooh Ms. Sandra,"Hey now! I picked this for my wife tonight. Though, it seemed that the pre-views somehow, didn't look that appetizing. I couldn't have be more wrong. And what a sweet surprise! This Sandra Bullock produced little diddy had her in what I say is one of her smartest roles/characters I have seen so far. Aside from the dancing with Gammie over mother earth, even with that she still was hot as can be, all the while shaking' her groove thing. I didn't quite get it other than comic relief I'm sure, but it didn't seem to fit the story, although it was kinda cute anyhow. I never payed attention to anything other than Sandra's acting before now. She played this rich witch executive to the edge. I was proud of her performance, she is amazing like never before. She had a rigid sexy grace about her that just makes you CrAzY!! She, not to get off on a 'rabbit trail' here, but she seems to have nice aging process. Some people get older, some look more and more wonderful as they age, thus Sandra.She is stunning...I am shocked that I am writing this, because I have never felt this way about Ms. Bullock. Ryan her secretary assistant is quite the right man for the job. He brings with himself an ability for on the line delivery. He is totally believable. He was the perfect opposite to her sexy, steely eyed lady boss. The story takes Sandra's character by surprise to Alaska, to get her out of trouble, she doesn't want to take the trip at second thought, but has to end up following through, or she could lose everything. While on this little adventure and cover-up mission to save her ass, they take in a few different situations that teach them some different things about themselves and some life lessons that they won't soon forget.I have to admit that amongst the beautiful Alaskan backdrop, this family of Ryan's character are sort of like the Kennedy's of Sitka, Alaska. They were very outgoing and happy and totally engrossing to this duo. They really didn't have a chance when it came to trying to pull off what they were trying.I must say though, through the laughs and all else I was shocked at seeing Sandra in just a wash cloth covering her tan bod. She is fit, she's hot. No debate there. I saw more of her than I ever have, or though I would and what was more, the pre-views don't do the bedroom crossing scene any justice, at all. When the two crossed paths naked and basically met sticking together standing up before they hit the floor, like that, it was not something that you are gonna soon forget either. I was dumb-founded. I never knew that Sandra was that way. Jeez Louise!!Well this one with the astute Madison avenue frigid queen of cold had me at the proposal on the street corner.They made this one with love you can see, some lust too just to keep the guys on the edge of the seat so to speak and a fun story about a couple that were not supposed to fall in love, but did anyway. Betty White was a wonderful addition to this by the way, here's to you Betty for putting something smart and comedic into this feature of love from New York to Alaska.I recommend to the girl and guy date night type stuff it's a winner.(****)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Cute comedy, maybe predictable but so what?","Bullock does comedy very well, not just because she is a good actress but also because she is believable as a decent human being - contrary to Jennifer Lopez, just to mention the first name which came to mind -. This is the only problem with this movie. It is hard to buy Bullocks as a bitch, exactly because she is inherently good. However, the movie works out fine. Her leading man, Ryan Reynolds, is also quite good in a part that could easily fall into slippery territory. Unfortunately, he is a bit too young for Bullock and no real chemistry is detectable, but the pair still looks good together. The plot is easily said: Canadian boss needs to marry American citizen in order not to be deported. Being an unpleasant person, our girl Bullock does not have any man handy, so she has to ask her secretary. Forced to meet his family she falls for them. Very much along the ""When you were sleeping"" lines (another movie where Bullock falls the family), but then again, what is wrong with that? We all need to belong, and the Bullock character was cut off from family relations for too long. She needed to build a hard exterior to protect herself and naturally enough, once back in touch with a softer environment she melts. It may be boring and predictable, but also very human and the stuff life is (or should) made of. Regardless of what the cynic might think.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fun and Worth A Watch,"What Can I say... interestin tension? Fun and worth a watch but I don't see Bullock and Reynalds as a match of any kind, especially these characters, but maybe thats the point?

Very Funny - Bullock and White Fantastic,"I generally like the movies that Sandra Bullock has been making over the years, however there have been a few bombs. This is not one of them. In many ways, this is a slightly different version of past scripts of other romantic comedies. What makes it work is Bullock and Betty White. Bullock has once again shown she can play comedy very well and she especially does so with her body language and facial expressions. However, what added to this movie's charm was Betty White, who stole the show at times. Even though she was not always on screen, when she appeared, you noticed her. I may be judged wrong by others, but I hope the Academy seriously considers her for a best supporting nomination for her role come the next Oscars. I have seen other actresses do far less and win, so heads up Academy come January 2010. Two weeks ago I went to see the Hangover and as much as I liked it, this was a far funnier film. Everybody in the audience seemed to be laughing as much as me. Good movie, worth seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"It never feels disjointed, which is actually impressive given the plot.","You can see what's coming from a mile off. Still good though.I'm pretty sure I've watched 'The Proposal' before many, many years ago as I semi recognised a couple of scenes and knew where the story was going from basically pressing play, though the second half of the film didn't feel like something I had previously seen... so who knows! Either way, that didn't affect my enjoyment at all.Having only seen Ryan Reynolds in his present day comedy machine it is so odd seeing him act less jokey and more serious, even if you can still spot the quintessential Reynolds comedic delivery in there every now and then. It takes a little bit to get over that but eventually a strong performance is clearly visible. Sandra Bullock fits this realm comfortably and is also very good throughout.The film does a neat job at making it all believable, the journey from where the two characters begin to where they finish is one that somehow feels natural. It never feels disjointed, which is actually impressive given the plot. Reynolds and Bullock, who share sizeable chemistry, are a large reason for that, of course.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Loved it,"Yeah, it was predictable, but so is Titanic and no one seems to care about the fact we all know the ending there. It doesn't really matter. What matters is how exactly we're getting to that ending. How the movie makes you feel and how much you care about the characters, that's what makes you keep watching.This one delivers all the character development a movie should have. Right off the bat we understand their goals and motives and therefore are able to go on the journey with them and enjoy it as much as they do (or more). It does not matter that we immediately predict how they're going to end up, because we care about HOW they will get there. And in my personal opinion the things they go through are absolutely hilarious.I laughed so hard and even got emotional a few times. Sandra's and Ryan's acting was obviously amazing and the rest of the cast only made it better (granny, I love you). I only wish it was longer so I could see some more crazy dances or absurd accidents.Definitely a new comfort watch!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable And Funny,"This is most definitely the definition of a ""chick-flick"" but I have to say that it's also one of the better romantic comedies I've seen in quite a while, highlighted by a very good chemistry between stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Bullock's Margaret Tate is an employee's nightmare as the hard-driving boss at a New York City publishing company, while Reynolds as Andrew Paxton is her long-suffering assistant. Unfortunately, Margaret is a Canadian who's about to be deported, and the only out for her is to get married to Andrew so that she can stay in the country. This leads to a fun romp in Alaska, since Margaret, to satisfy the US immigration authorities, is forced to join Andrew in visiting his family for a weekend in the far north. The weekend represents an epiphany of sorts for Margaret as she's reminded what the warmth and love of family really is, as she bonds especially with Andrew's mother and grandmother, and then eventually begins to fall for Andrew himself. Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen played Andrew's parents, but the best supporting role was certainly that of Betty White as Andrew's grandmother. The movie is exactly what a romantic comedy should be - gently but not outrageously funny, with director Anne Fletcher showing a deft touch as she gradually builds the romance between Andrew and Margaret.One minor criticism might revolve around the need for someone to coach Bullock in how a Canadian would pronounce ""Toronto."" She insisted on saying ""To-ron-To"" whereas a real Canadian would say something like ""Tuh-Ron-uh"" (the second ""t"" not generally being pronounced, and certainly not emphasized.) That, however, is a minor criticism (albeit one I noticed as a Canadian.) 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Surprisingly better than expected!,"THE PROPOSAL as written by Pete Chiarelli and directed by Anne Fletcher looks on the surface (posters, promos. trailer) like yet another version of tough woman manipulates subservient guy in a toss that ends up in a role reversal. And in many ways that is what this film is about: hard-as-rocks but beautiful editor Margaret (Sandra Bullock) verbally abuses her assistant, wannabe author Andrew (Ryan Reynolds), until her employers discover her visa is expired and she is to be deported to her native Canada. A fast thought drives her to claim that she and Andrew are engaged in a ploy to avoid deportation. Shocked at first, Andrew decides to make this ultimate blow to his ego work for him and takes Margaret to his home in Siska, Alaska to meet his family - mother (Mary Steenburgen), father (Craig T. Nelson) and wildly alive grandmother (Betty White) - where Margaret must play the charade. Of course in the beauty of Alaska and under the influence of the warmth of a family Margaret never had, the expected magic happens and ... you know the rest.Sandra Bullock is good and creates a solid character, but it is Ryan Reynolds who proves his chops as one of the best comedic actors on the screen today. It is a fun outing. Whether or not it deserves the Golden Globe attention mush less Oscar attention is up for question, but it is a pleasant diversion for some very fine comedians.Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is a Good Movie (to not watch),"If you like Sandra Bullock then just see this movie, she delivers the usual nonsense. There are no surprises here, you sort of care about the characters. Not really, but you kind of do. I gave this 5 out of 10 because its not good, but you're not suffering in the theater, you are not in PHYSICAL pain while watching this. So this does deserve credit for achieving that.The plot is paper thin, controlling Boss (bullock) needs a green card, so she tells Reynolds to marry her for a promotion. But they have to really pretend to be married to convince the government people, and blah blah.You never believe for a second that Ryan Reynolds or Sandra Bullock would ever end up together. Reynolds has some cool ex girlfriend in alaska, and oh yea hes not interested in her at all, because she looks like a Swedish supermodel, that is no ones type.Also Reynolds and Bullock, 12 year age difference there, they could have sort of acknowledged that in the movie, like oh yea we have an age gap or something. I mean I think it would probably be addressed in most scenarios.I would say if you have to choose between this movie, and a movie you know with absolute certainty is horrible, then see The Proposal, because its not absolutely horrible.

Green Card meets Devil Wears Prada,"21 June 2009. This fusion of Green Card (1990) meets The Devil Wears Prada (2006) is one of the most intelligent funniest movies of the year generating some real genuine laughs from the heart while also incorporating decent balance of family drama at the same time. Betty White offers up some great comedic scenes though also some of the more bizarre scenes that don't quite completely work. There is some great acting sensitivity by Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds as director Anne Fletcher captures longer comedic touches that allow the humor to really take hold in a number of scenes. Craig T. Nelson and Ryan Reynold's characters don't quite get to fully develop their cycle of relations on screen while the post-climatic ending is a bit forced and manipulative and not quite a strong as say The Devil Wears Prada. It's somewhat debatable whether or not Sandra Bullock's character could have moved further towards Meryl Streep's character in The Devil Wears Prada to have been more effective as Sandra's character had to reach further through more emotional and extended plot scenarios than Meryl. However, this is one of the better comedies of the year that allows for more exposure of creative humor.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfect Summer Movie!,"Ever since the trailer came out I was over-excited to see this movie. I simply adore both Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock and wanted to see the chemistry between them on the big screen. And I was NOT disappointed.I went Saturday night with a friend, expecting it to be like Miss Congeniality or like Definitely, Maybe; acting wise not plot wise. Being a romantic comedy fool, I was on a constant roller coaster of laughs and 'aw' moments.Both leading actors pull of their rolls perfectly, dipping into their natural talents as well as performing off each other. The chemistry from the very beginning of the bitterness road to the very ending was believable and very entertaining. And the supporting cast was completely on the ball, from the hilarious Betty White to the doting mother, Mary Steenburgen. I did love the IRS agent in the sense of the ""bad"" guy type figure.The best part about the movie was the laugh-out-loud scenes and the little moments between Bullock and Reynolds (Especially his facial expressions!). I laughed about 90% of the time, along with the rest of the filled theater. Very few people in that theater walked out disappointed.If you're expecting some Oscar-Award winning movie, you might want to go see something a little less funny and a tad more serious. And while I know that The Proposal has gotten some flank, I would like to say that it was a feel-good, laugh-out-loud, go home satisfied experience. And I've been harassing everyone from work to the cashiers at Target to run out and watch it. Lord knows I've already seen it twice!

There's a strong supporting cast doing wonderfully--White is great as always and Mary Steenburgen is excellent as Reynold's mother. Oscar Nunez is great in multiple roles! Only Craig T.

By the numbers rom-com,"An uptight boss (Sandra Bullock) forces her young assistant (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her in order to keep her visa status in the U.S. and avoid deportation to Canada. He is reluctant at first, but goes ahead with it so he doesn't loose his job. The film is by the numbers and lacks subtlety, it's full of cringeworthy moments of humour which most of the time falls flat. It could have worked well as a drama but instead the filmmakers steer towards sitcom style comedy. The film is peppered with annoying stereotypical characters who often take us away from the film. However there is some enjoyment to be had with the chemistry of the two leads. They are two completely different people whose relationship starts to improve throughout.They both to go to Alaska where she meets his eccentric parents and weird grandmother. From here on its full of slapstick comedy and family dilemmas. A lot of the situations feel awkward and forced - one scene involving a eagle snatching a dog and another where they both bump into each other naked. It was just too silly and felt like something you would see in an episode of Friends. It's sappy and sentimental at times, but oddly enough that is what makes the film work. There are indeed some funny moments, but only thanks to Bullock and Reynolds who really play off each other here. It's fun to see them avoiding each other as he hates everything about her. It's an okay film to see if you have 90 minutes to kill.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

If you ask me, there were a lot of hilarious mishaps. Some of the funniest, in my opinion, were the ones with the dog and Margaret's (Sandra Bullock) cell phone. I hate to say this, but Margaret was really pushy at times. Also, I didn't like the wedding dress that she tried on. Before I wrap this up, the performances were spectacular, the direction was flawless, and everyone involved did a good job. In conclusion, to all Sandra Bullock fans who haven't seen this excellent, hilarious, charming, and sweet romantic comedy, I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
When you're scraping the barrel for a romcom to watch...,"To be honest it's not the worst film, I was just totally unconvinced that these two actors would be together. I didn't feel any chemistry.

he marries his mother,"Sandra bullock is not that hot she is hardly a 7 and a mediocre actress at best. She is 45 yeas old here and she does look a 45 year old woman. Ryan reynolds is 33 so a total mismatch. I wont' spoil anything because there isn't anything to spoil. It's another boring cliche falling in love by accident story with actors trying hard to be entertaining. Everyone is OVERacting here and the grandma ? And the constant sexual innuendos; holy cow, does she ever shut up?His parents are either clueless or crazy. Despite the fact that she is old enough to be her mother they never bother to ask her about their future plans or children? The ending couldn't have been any more unoriginal it's been done before. If this were a better couple a more believable couple with some chemistry between them i would've given it a 3 but this just didn't do it for me.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
We need more romantic comedies,"The summer months are reserved for the boys and their violent toys. Let's give the girls something to look at. The best things about the Proposal are the two lead comediennes Sandra Bullock and Bette White, and it's hard to tell who's stealing the movie from who. I give Bette the edge. Sandra is at her best in these familiar, comfortable roles and she's still got that comedic timing. Ryan Reynolds shows his comedy chops too. The story is a cross between The Devil Wears Prada and While you were sleeping; Sandra once again plays a woman who has to pretend she's in love or about to get married to a guy she hardly knows. It works just the same, and she shows a little grown-up toughness in this story. Lots of laughs and the girls will love it, especially at the end; everyone will go ""aaaHH"" goes ""aah"" when the two protagonists kiss.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Actor Josh Brolin said he had seen this movie 3 times. He was just pulling Ryan Reynolds leg, because this is without a doubt a sentimental chick flick of the worst kind...","I cant believe I fell for the joke Josh Brolin made during a talkshow with Ryan Reynolds, in which Brolin said that he had watched ""The Proposal"" 3 times. What a joker.Dont watch it. Please dont. Maybe if you are a sentimental chick who loves cheesy, corny romcoms, then you might give it a go, but really this movie becomes unbearable to watch after the first half hour, when everything gets incredibly lovey dovey and soft romantic, the way Hollywood likes it (and audiences probably too).It's nice. Nice, in a bad way though. As in boring nice. Still quite funny at times and the acting is ok, but the story is SOOOO sentimental, predictable and boring near the end that my teeth start to hurt of all the sweetness going on...The story for those desperate to watch a chick flick: Ryan Reynold's boss is a b**ch, but she forces to him to marry her, because her immigration visa got expired.

It's a good movie!,"""The Proposal"" is a fun romantic comedy film starring Sandra Bullock and Adam Sandler, directed by Anne Fletcher. However, the film was not perfect, as the story was quite predictable, and the characters were not fully developed either... and the movie contained some clichés.But now I'll move on to the good stuff, which is: it was superbly filmed with good acting and the direction was also good. The movie is also full of funny moments and has plenty of other good qualities, for example, a good soundtrack.All in all, ""The Proposal"" is a pretty good film, which is not nearly perfect, but still enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Say YES to ""The Proposal""!","I can see why it's doing so well at the box office! No wonder everyone's been saying yes to it! It does help if you're a big fan of both Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. I am for sure! Sandra Bullock does not disappoint, she's better than ever here! Ryan Reynolds has great chemistry with her and holds her own. It's also great seeing Betty White! The funniest character of all is that guy(cant remember his name haha) who is a male stripper one minute and then the guy who holds the wedding the next minute! There's a reason why The Proposal is dominating the awful Year One, and is even holding its own against the famous Hangover! Say yes to the Proposal! Just one thing though. What the hell was up with the previews? As much as I love Sandra Bullock, her next movie(based on the previews) is truly going to make me lose some respect for her! Oh well.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Used to Like Sandra Bullock movies,"Her movies used to be good, and I did not object too much my wife dragged me off to see them. They were sort of like a romantic comedy version on the the Dukes of Hazard theme (the real Dukes -- the TV version): the good guys always won, the bad guys always lost, and nobody got hurt. Somewhere her movies started fading, though. The one about a time warp (one or two seasons ago) was the first of hers that I thought was pretty dumb. The Proposal was better but still dudley. The plot was way too predictable, some of the characters were stupid, and Sandra is way too old to be playing the part. Ryan Reynolds did well, as he always does. Anyway, I'd have to say the Proposal is mostly a bust. Not a waste of time; just not very good. I'd just as soon forgot I ever saw this thing, except the characters were so idiotic that it is going to take a while for this too happen. Back to Sandra Bullock: The I liked the best, of all her movies, was 28 Days. She was great in that.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Is this a comedy?,Its a crime that this movie have a better rating then most comedies its so bad and not funny at all. And maybe thats because no comedic actors are in it. Its not romantic and not funny at all. I know Sandra Bullocks character were suppose to be cold and soulless but does the entire movie need to be soulless aswell? People who give this a high rating doesnt know anything about movies.,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Highly Comical,"While this is your typical romantic comedy, it's always made better by a phenomenal leading man. I personally think Ryan Reynolds is brilliant the way he can take over a scene with a mere mannerism or facial expression and this film is no different. However, he has a great serious side that he portrayed briefly in previous films such as Van Wilder, Blade III and Amityville Horror. The diversity is something I've grown to appreciate and it makes for a more believable role; girls don't like complete jokers, you've gotta have a serious side.The surprise, to me, was the supporting cast. Sandra Bullock and Betty White took this movie to a higher level than I had expected. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to most anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Okay,"Really nothing special, it was fun to watch, but didn't have a deeper meaning, no emotion, not much of a story. It didn't do anything for me. I would have enjoyed more if the characters weren't as shallow and there seemed to be a message.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
WAY better than expected!,"This is where Sandra Bullock shines. She does comedy so well, I'm so happy to see her go back to it. Ryan Reynolds has always been a favorite of mine. I wasn't at all thrilled about X-Men Origin: Wolverine, but he made a good move here. To see him in this was awesome. Acting was top notch! Their expressions were great, this duo knows how to make the simplest reactions look ridiculously funny. Speaking of which, Sandra is oh-so beautiful. I have to say if you're at all curious about The Proposal, go! You'll have a lot of fun.Anyway, the only reason I haven't given it a 10 is because I just want to be stubborn.

Boring!!!,"So boring. Flat acting, dry dialogue, fits the cliche too well, and boring soundtrack.The only good actor is Betty White, the other characters aren't believable. Ryan Reynolds appears for 3-5 lines at a time and is offscreen. Weird considering he's a love interest. Sandra Bullock is awful; same tone of voice, sounds bored and stiff all the time and I get that's her character but it's not acting she's genuinely a bad actor. No emotion for any part of the movie, she can't even squeeze out a tear during the soft moments.Not even corny, just so boring. Funniest part was when she flew off the boat and that wasn't even supposed to be funny. Best part is the setting; cozy small town vibes.Ending was beyond pathetic.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

As subtle as a gun,"Sandra Bullock said in an interview that she was leaving rom com alone for a while and perhaps it would have been a wise move to have stuck to the intent of that statement. Her performance in this film is one of its biggest flaws. Her delivery is as subtle as a gun, subtle as circus clowns with big shoes and a plank of wood. This was like stage slapstick rather than cinema. Overblown actions and responses, painted in large black and white lines and yet it still managed to seem muddled and unnatural.There were 2 saving graces.one was the location. A beautiful Alaskan setting and stunning house.The second was Ryan Reynolds who even in a derivative uninspiring flat piece of movie making like this can still manage to put in a great performance. Granted it's a performance he's put into many of his roles before, but he's imminently likable and watchable. He doesn't put in obvious primary colours to his work and for that he is always the one to watch. I doubt the director guided him to this judging by the 2 dimensional rest of the movie.Most of the good gags were in the trailer. I'm so pleased we got free passes to a preview, I just wish they'd been to another movie, like a half decent one.Please stop making these kind of movies Sandra. You're not without talent but you've got to start figuring out what that talent is, and it's not lame over acted rom com.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

But with the exception of some brief B-roll stock footage of eagles, spruce, mountains, and sea lions, THERE IS NO SITKA IN THIS MOVIE. All the ""Alaska"" scenes were shot in New England.

A delightful movie,"The Proposal is an entertaining good time that'll warm your heart while laughing. First of all, let me just say that Betty white is Queen and rules over all lol. White is absolutely hilarious as grandma Annie, I adored her lines of dialogue, and there is absolutely no one that could have delivered them better, she has great moments of physical comedy as well, the nature worshiping scene is so good. Sandra bullock does not fail to please, with this and the blind side both in one year, she rocked 2009! As for Ryan Reynolds, he fits the leading man role well and I think Sandra and he had really natural chemistry together. The writing fits well throughout the movie, some parts it's funny and in others it's sweet and makes you become invested the characters. I am a big Mary Steenburgen fan too, both in her movies and just her as a person, and I loved her here, it's not like there's a whole whole lot to her role, but still I think she was very convincing. The male stripper scene is hilarious, it may be a bit too strong for some viewers, so there's a warning for ya, but I thought it was funny, Sandra's reaction is priceless. The ending is sweet and it's refreshing to see a movie like this every once in a while. 8/10 for the proposal!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Summary of the Proposal,"The proposal was one of the better romantic comedies I've seen. Sandra Bullock can pull off any role imaginable. Ryan Reynolds has always proved to be very humorous and the two actors were a very good match for this film. Sandra Bullock plays the harsh boss of an editing firm while Ryan Reynolds plays the ""bitch"" secretary.Sandra Learns that she is being deported back to Canada therefore won't be able to work for a US company anymore. Thus, she gets the idea to be ""engaged"" to Ryan Reynolds so that she can remain in the country. Since she threatened his career, he agreed to marry her so that she could become a citizen of the US and then quickly get a divorce.The comedy in this movie is so much better than some of the films the two have been in such as ""Just Friends"" (Ryan Reynolds) and ""All About Steve"" (Sandra Bullock). Betty White is also in this movie and plays the sweet and dim-witted grandmother which truly adds to the movie. Also the fact that the two travel to Alaska for the weekend provides the movie with beautiful scenery and even a tad bit of action. It is a must see ""chick flick"" and perfect for a date night.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Bad Movie,"Rating: 4.8
Overall, even though the movie has decent chemistry between the leads and some jokes that do hit, it feels like a forgettable 2000s Rom-Com as it follows the genre's template to a tee and is saturated with cliches from the era.Bad to Pretty Bad Direction (the direction on a macroscale was pretty typical of other Rom-Coms from the era; the direction on a microscale was pretty typical to other Rom-Coms of the era (but honestly worse because a lot of the scenes feel extremely mismanaged with a lack of intent); the direction of actors was pretty bad as everyone who was not in the principal cast feels tone deaf; the storytelling was very typical to other Rom-Coms from the era; she built tension towards the end in the most stereotypical Rom-Com way), Decent Acting (Decent to Pretty Good from Sandra Bullock (Uses her experience as a leading lady to get through this performance and has decent chemistry with Ryan Reynolds), Pretty Good from Ryan Reynolds (Has good comedic timing and has decent chemistry with Sandra Bullock), Decent from Malin Åkerman, Decent from Craig T.

The Proposal,"This movie doesn't really bring something new to the comedy genre, but why is this a bad thing? The movie gives what can be expected and for me that is enough.

"Okay, but.............","Canadian Margaret Tate (Bullock)is a hated boss, but her Visa is expiring and she proposes to marry her assistant Andrew (Reynolds) to be able to stay in the United States.This had huge comedic possibilities but the script wasn't up to the effort. If the promos hadn't shown the Betty White scene 10,000 times where her character is fitting Margaret with her old wedding gown it could have had, at the very least, one LOL moment. Didn't happen. The script was bland and okay for a made-for-TV movie.And, really. in a movie like this where the main characters who don't like each other, end up liking each other (Oh, you didn't know that would happen? HA!) someone should try to match actors that have a good chemistry so we could all feel good at the end. Didn't happen. I didn't care if the pairing, proposal, or ""marriage"" would work. Did anyone? Also, I think the ending should have gone another way. Would have made more sense. No, I can't tell you what the ending is and what I wanted.Needless, useless and not funny scenes: every one with Ms Bullock and the dog, and the male stripper scene in the bar.I want to say the acting overall was good, and it was, but there were some over-acting moments with Bullock and the dog and I couldn't wait for them to be over with. Do people actually watch the scenes before it goes out to the public? Hmmmm.Yes, Ryan Reynolds looks like Ben Affleck. I thought it was Affleck and had to check the DVD box. They look the same, act the same, and have basically the same expressions. Think I'll check the box again.Betty White is a treasure no matter how many times a scene with her is shown. Other treasures are Nelson and Steenburgen and they did good as did the rest of the cast. I thought we would at least see a family dinner along the way. Didn't happen. The breakfast-in-bed thing doesn't count.Overall, an okay movie that has been hyped to death. I get the feeling that Ms Bullock wants to push the envelope with her partial nude scenes. Suggestion to her: Do it with a better script.Violence: No Sex: No. Nudity: Partial by both Bullock and Reynolds Language: No.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Margaret, will you marry me? Because I'd like to date you","The Proposal is a 2009 romantic comedy that centers around a pushy executive who fakes getting married to her assistant in order to avoid getting deported back to Canada.This is a nice Rom Com that although doesn't exactly bring anything all that new to the table, still manages to tell a fun little story about two people (who can't stand each other) figuring out that they actually love each other in the end.Sandra Bullock stars as Margaret Tate, a bossy executive that finds out her work visa has expired and will lose her job due to deportation. So she hatches a quick plan to marry her assistant (Ryan Reynolds) in order to stay in the country.It's not the best of the best when it comes to romantic comedies, but definitely has more than enough going for it to be overall entertaining. Reynolds and Bullock play off each other well, and really make the love hate relationship between them shine through the comedy. The cast is good, there's plenty of funny moments, and even though the end is kind of eye rolling, it finishes the story on a high note.I think this is a great movie, and if you haven't seen it before and like Rom Coms, I would definitely recommend checking it out.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great movie.,"This movie was funny, charming, and heartwarming. The ending was pretty predictable, but overall it was a great movie. Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds were a great combination. Both are very witty. Bullock and Reynold's ability to be both funny and sarcastic is great because the sarcasm doesn't get excessive. Bullock is great in these kinds of roles, as seen in the Lake House. While Reynolds has always been funny, it was good to see his serious side.If you're looking for a good laugh with a romantic touch, this is the movie to see. Not only are the two main characters funny, but also the supporting cast. You will laugh out loud multiple times. While there have been many romantic comedies in the past, this is one of the first with the deportation storyline, which does had an extra ""umph"" into the story and its core.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not What I'd Hoped For,"I like these characters. I like the actors. In fact, it's a terrific cast. Ryan Reynolds is great. He has the looks, the build, the acting skill and the screen presence to be a leading man. I hope someday soon he finds a role that challenges him and exposes his true talent. Sandra Bullock does what she does best: she's a master of comic subterfuge and misrepresentation. The supporting cast, a few of my favorites, are left with table scraps and cliché.This movie suffices as passable living room entertainment but misses the bulls-eye by a mile. Some of it is banal and some of it falls victim to bad writing and directing. It's supposed to be an adult comedy and yet there are times when it's moments away from a fart joke. It also suffers from poor timing. The three-act structure collapses and it ends abruptly and without conviction.If you go into it without expectations, and you're happy with the way actors look at each other in a movie, you'll be entertained.

As a guy expected to cringe more than I did -- thankfully,"I find Sandra Bullock funny and easy to watch. Without her, I wouldn't have accompanied my wife to this movie. But it turns out, Ryan Reynolds more than holds up his end of the bargain, and that was a huge relief because I was certain they were going to put in some female heartthrob making it almost impossible for a guy to enjoy watching Ms Bullock get out of her predicament. (She needs to fend off Immigration so she isn't deported to Canada. I can't believe this happens much in real life, btw.) But Ryan matches her all down the line comedy-wise and there's something extraordinary about that. This guy's quite good. In fact all the secondary players are quite good as well. This is a message film and the message is, family matters even more than a high-powered job in New York. It's not a perfect film, there are a few rough spots and some laughter dry spots, but in general, it's a pleasant time at the movies with some very capable actors and a workable script.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sandra Bullock acted a woman from Canada work in New York was going to be expelled because of the due of her visa. She had to marry someone then she can stay in New York. So she proposed her assistant on her knee to marry her. This part is very funny. Another part that made me laugh a lot is the word she said ""Alaska"". Because of the special pronunciation of this word that I can still remember the word she said and imitated her. That really interested me. They pretended that they married and they fell in love accidentally at the end. I like this kind of romance though it is a common plot. But I think it is still sweet. As a person who desire for love, the movie of love real touch his or her heart. As a comedy romance, it makes me feel warm and touching and makes me burst into tears with joy.

"Cute movie, only lacking in one area","My husband and I went out to watch The Proposal last night with a pretty full theater. I have to admit we, and the rest of the theater, were laughing repeatedly throughout the film. Bullock and Reynolds are incredible comedians and the film is very entertaining. I would definitely recommend it for both men and women.The only problem I did have with the film was that it felt a bit rushed. The film could have easily been a good half an hour longer and it would have made the movie so much better. Bullock and Reynolds do have amazing chemistry together and feelings developing between the two of them are very sweet and they pull it off. The only problem is the plot forgets to really give them time to 'fall in love.' There are precious few scenes of the two of them alone together. A lot of the interaction is with Reynolds and his father and Bullock with the grandmother and mother... it becomes a love story with Bullock and family life and Reynolds almost seems to be pushing the business-deal marriage forward in order to spite his father instead of because he might be developing a soft spot for Bullock's character.However, the scenes they do have together are very well done and the chemistry is very sweet. The movie is funny, the two leads are great together, and the movie has Betty White in it. What else can you ask for in a night out at the movies?! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
didn't quite gel,"I like both these actors so I feel I should have enjoyed this movie more than I did. Their chemistry was ok, if a bit stiff, and the first half of the movie worked ok for me. I liked the way the power dynamic between the two leads shifted when they went to Alaska. But I felt the promise of that shift wasn't followed through in the second half. Most of their time in the second half was spent with other people, and they never seemed to have a moment of true connection. It was as if they were in two separate movies, with most of the focus being on their individual interactions with the secondary characters. The whole way through the movie I kept thinking it was going to be like ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" where they learn the lesson that what they really need is to be apart. I feel there was the potential for this to be a really good movie and somehow it didn't quite come together for me.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Seems like Sandra is trying to play a younger character,"I thought this was an enjoyable romantic comedy. It did what many movies don't do, which is to allow you to empathize with all the characters and actually care about them. One thing I noticed is that the ages of the characters was a little hazy. Ryan Renolds is 33 and seemed to be playing Andrew at about that age, maybe a little younger. That would make Mary Steenburgen believable as his mother at 56 and Craig T. Nelson as his father at 65. That would also make Betty White (87) believable as Nelson's mother who is supposed to be 90. But how old is Sandra Bullock's Margaret supposed to be? She is 45 in real life, only 11 years younger than Steenburgen. But did she see her first concert at age 24 when Rob Base released ""It takes two"" in 1988? Seems like she is trying to play 5 to 10 years younger than her actual age. I guess she can pull it off OK. The other thing that jumped out at me is that when they announced their engagement, nobody asked to see the ring, and nobody noticed she had no ring. Also, they made it seem like Toronto is this far away foreign land. It would have been much easier for her to return to Toronto, and then for him to drive 10 hours up to marry her there and get the papers for her to return at the U.S. consulate. But I guess you can't overthink these things.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A longer period of time and better screenplay could make this a top comedy,"""The Proposal"" is a fair comedy, but it's a stretch to call it a comedy romance. Sandra Bullock is a very good actress, and she shows it in her role as Margaret Tate in this film. She does so well convincing the audience that she is a tyrant and witch to work for, that the romantic switch in just three days just isn't believable. And, there's absolutely zero chemistry between the two leads (Bullock and Ryan Reynolds), which cements it as too far out. So, instead of a strange mixture that eventually works in the laboratory of life, this relationship bombs the film.The rest of the cast are good, but no one stands out. The story is an okay one, but had the plot been made to play out over a little more time, with some gradual changes in Tate's character, it would have given the film a more pleasant air of believability. And, Reynolds seems too much the schoolboy opposite Bullock. So, his part either had to change to be a little naturally attracted to Tate in the first place, or they needed another actor for the part.What makes this film at all funny are the occasional funny lines, and the camera work. The production moves nicely from the hustle and bustle of the Big Apple and office life there, to the serene vistas and landscape of Alaska. The latter was filmed on the East Coast of New England.This is one of those films that could have been a comedy masterpiece. Having the story take place over two to four weeks, with more story in a much better screenplay could have put it over.Here are some of the funniest lines in the film. For more dialog, see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page of the movie.Margaret, ""They are going to make Bob chief. Andrew, ""So, naturally, I would have to marry you?""Margaret, ""They're hunting for terrorists, not for book publishers.""Grammy, ""Well, now, do you prefer being called Margaret or Satan's mistress? We've heard it both ways. Actually, we've heard it lots of ways."" Grace Paxton, ""She's kidding.""Grammy, ""You see the shoes that broad is wearing?""Andrew Paxton, ""C'mon. Let's go. My grandma's moving faster than you.""",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
The proposal,"It is a standard romantic comedy but it has scenes that make us reflect on gender issues and on situations that we live in our professional life.
Other issues that make a difference in the film is that we have a female director Anne Fletcher and the amazing performance of Ryan Reinalds and Sandra Bullock.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
great cast translates to an enjoyable movie,"I think I'm really starting to love Ryan Reynolds. Every new movie I see him in, I think he's hilarious and not to mention dashingly handsome and rock hard athletic. Sandra Bullock is another under-rated actress who appears here in quite a different role than she's played in the past. Bullock pulls off the ""Satan's Mistress,"" as Betty White puts it early on pretty darn well. I will say that the first scenes in the movie seemed torn right out of The Devil Wears Prada. While I think Bullock in general did a good job of being pretty mean, she definitely did not come across anywhere near as scary as Meryl Streep at the beginning of The Devil Wears Prada. The movie runs at a decent pace, although the ending is a bit rushed in my opinion, and comes in at a typically good time for a romantic comedy (just over 100 minutes). The cast, I think, is really what made the movie an ""8"" for me and not a 6 -- everyone is SPOT-ON....Betty White as Gammi, the matriarchal grandmother who has Inuit Eskimo background and does a great dance thanking ""Mother Earth."" Mary Steenburgen turned in a fine performance as Drew's (Reynolds) mother -- she misses her son and blames his over-bearing father (Craig T. Nelson) who has set up a pretty substantial financial empire in Sitka (he basically owns the town). Nelson played the part well as usual. Reynolds and Bullock turned in great performances and had great on-screen chemistry.My only disappointment was that the movie was not filmed in Alaska and was instead filmed on Boston's north shore. Alaska is a beautiful state and I felt ""jipped"" that they digitally added all of the mountains.Overall 8/10, 3 of 4 stars",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just daft but expected,Thought I'd give it a try and watched all through awaiting a satisfactory feeling from watching good actors or seeing a good story line This confirmed that these type of films are best avoided. I believe they come under the title of American schmaltz. Really lacking in credibility; as if. The leading lady acted as herself as usual. The settings were just obvious. Just do not know how the get away with making such unimaginative films that are so underwhelming. Don't bother wasting your time watching this it should have been a made for TV movie.I gave it a very generous four out of ten as maybe young people might enjoy watching this innocuous film.,4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"As you'd expect, but well done","OK, I don't think it's a spoiler to say that this is a genre movie, and we all know the conventions of the genre. Which means it's not about the story, it's about the execution.And this was a well-executed instance of the genre. Not as good as the absolute best, but pretty damn good. The leads are attractive and appealing, there are few (unfortunately not quite not zero) of the lazy clichés so common to movies, and very little I found objectionable.My primary (small) criticism is somewhat meta: we are supposed to take from the fact that this woman is driven and competent that she is a b**ch, a monstrous boss. At the start of the movie we are told by everyone how awful she is, but that awfulness seems primarily to consist of her being confident and doing her job well. This left a bad taste in my mouth --- it seemed like an example of precisely what feminists say about the impossible situation of a woman in business.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Way funnier than I expected,"This was really funny, way better then I thought it was going to be as I'm not usually one for the romantic comedies but The Proposal was kinda clever, had a feasible storyline, great actors (Ryan Reynolds, Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson) and some genuinely hilarious moments. As well as the gorgeous scenery, a male stripper scene (ha) and well, Betty White! What more do you need?I actually laughed out loud in a couple of scenes and Sandra Bullock looked gorgeous especially nude, eat your heart out Jessie James.Here Sandra Bullock forces Ryan Reynolds to marry her in order to avoid deportation back to Canada. 09.11",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Didn't do it for me or fellow viewer,"I managed to watch the whole movie although my partner in film bailed about half way through saying ""i don't like this film, it's a bad film"".She was wiser than I was. The Proposal lacks chemistry and cohesion. There are a few nice moments, but it's a poor, stuttering effort given the array of acting talent on show, who deserved a much better script.There is some nice scenery - a pretty seaside town with a mountainous backdrop.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Fun Comedy!! Reynolds and Bullock are great together!,"Ryan Reynolds has always been a favorite comedic actor of mine and Sandra Bullock has always been good in her comedies. These two really work well together. This a great comedy for both genders. Most of the story takes place in Alaska which provides some pretty visuals.There are also some touching moments in this movie too, it got a little dusty in the room towards the end of the movie. Oscar Nunez's cameo in the film was funny and weird!It was also great to see Craig T. Nelson aka Coach in this one, he really brought something to the character and the relationship of the father son. IF you are in the mood for a feel good laugh out loud comedy, then you should really give this a view.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
loved this movie,"Right now, i've definitely been watching a lot of romance movies and i can't lie, i really enjoyed this one. While ryan reynolds wouldn't be my favourite actor, this movie was just so entertaining, funny and the romance was just so so cute. Honestly, one of my favourite tropes is fake dating because it's a really interesting and entertaining trope, and the same can be applied to this movie. Of course, i loved it because ryan reynolds was in it and he's hot af but, i loved sandra bullock and betty white's acting. They really upped the entertainment factor a LOT. So overall, i definitely liked this movie, though i wouldn't say it's my favourite but still definitely enjoyed it overall.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sweatened almost bearable story,"It started not so bad, with enough humor to keep you watching. Then cliche moments started raining, not much of a fun but uncomfortable moments, annoying family pressure and more annoying couple moments.Seeing Ryan Reynolds naked wasn't enough to make the movie good, it's just not. It's obvious he choose this movie for the two personal topics, Canada and the issues he had with his father. Predictable situations, domestic ones, I forced myself to watch it till the end because two of my favorite actors were playing, but at the end there was no satisfaction or entertaining at all. Just too boring and annoying piece to watch if you are not super romantic and have a few trucks of patience loaded at the backyard. The choice of an actress for the mother was quite inappropriate, knowing her reputation of other characters choices.Also a thing, pretty fluffy dog laying on the coach where another animal fur is skinned and just standing there. If that's not a hypocrisy, I don't know what is.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Grows on you Romcom...,"A stellar cast,still watchable in this decade,some of the cast not on the planet anymore,and the supporting actors that still are ,appeared in other Bullock movies...I watched this originally on a round the world trip in 2009, on the first leg to Hong Kong, and rewatch occasionally as and when there are Afternoon specials when I need to switch off and chill.Mary Steenburgen another favourite character actress,and wearing well.The director has experience in other popular romcoms,""27 dresses""another favourite.There is also a very cute Dog,who should have got an animal award.Great script,not actually filmed in Sitka, but northern shores Boston and Rockport,with cgi mountains.

Perfect for a bus trip,"The only reason I would consider watching a movie like this is when I am bored or I am traveling from city to city. Having to travel by bus from Zaragoza to Madrid every week, I had gone through most of the movie on offer on the bus. The proposal seemed the least bad choice. The movie is a comedy, and is full of surreal and nonsensical situations. I am not sure they really make your laugh but they keep you awake. The movie is all about seeing the actors in action. If you like Reynolds and Bullock, you will tolerate this movie. If you don't, it may feel like a very long movie. There's plenty of movies similar around. This one is nothing special. Romantic comedy, with its twists and turns and very little unpredictable moments.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An obvious romantic comedy, yet unique and fun","I knew from the start how this movie was going to be like. The plot is very original, yet the script is almost the same as any other average romantic comedy. The plot is what sets this movie apart from the other. Another thing that makes the movie original it's when it comes to comedy. I had a pretty good laugh at this film from start to finish. I heard that this movie was going to be more of a chick flick (I do not enjoy chick flicks), but I guess the chick flick part of it was a little bit in the ending. If you've seen a lot of romantic comedy flicks, then you know how this one is gonna go, however i recommend it for anyone who wants to see a well made romantic comedy movie.It gets an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the better comedies,"I don't understand the low ratings on this movie... It has everything needed to be a successful comedy, and indeed provides a good comedy. What else have you expected it to be???Yes, the story might be cheesy, but... is there any comedy with a serious plot?? Haha come on, people!To those claiming it was ""too predictable"" I can reply: No, it wasn't predictable at all. Unless, you're watching it for 5th time (because you loved it so much) and know how it goes? Mmmh? LolI remember I watched it when it came out 15 years ago and had a good laugh. It was on local cable today and I watched it for a second time and I enjoyed it the same was as I did 15 years ago!Yes, it's a good movie, one of the better comedies out there. It's not great, but it's good enough to make you relax, smile and have some fun. What else would you need or expect from a comedy movie?!?Sandra and Ryan did well, and all the hate on them, especially on Sandra is ridiculous. She might be 45 but she has a better body and looks better that you, is that why you don't like her?? That's ridiculous. She's such a sweetheart and always ads colors and shining to the movies she's in. The role of the ""Witch on a broom Boss"" suits her perfectly and she did well! Show some respect.I'm giving it 8/10 because I enjoyed it (twice), and I'm sure I can watch it again and again without getting bored. One of the better movies out there.R. I. P.

It was fantastic,"I absolutely loved this movie.

Funny,"The proposal is really a good romantic comedy. Just as Mama Mia, it's my favorite kind of movie. I watched this movie because of our listening and speaking class presentation. The actress, Sandra Bullock, won the best actress in Oscar this year. The theme of the movie attracts me, because I love to see how a love story developed. The story is easy to follow and it's a good movie to watch in our free time. There are lots of funny scenes such as Margaret asked Andrew to marry him on the street, Margaret and Andrew told the fake story about how they proposed to Andrew's family, Margaret gave the dog to the eagle, the naked scene and Andrew's grandma pretended to have heart attack, and so on. It made me laugh. The ending of the story is also great. I love happy ending.",,Anonymous,Romance
Craig T. Nelson,"I thought this movie was Sandra Bullock's best. I saw it twice. Have been recommending it to others and planning to buy the DVD.NOT after seeing Craig T. Nelson drivel on Fox News talking about health care. Hollywood should know where its money comes from. There are programs he doesn't want his tax dollars to fund! Well, I don't want to line his pockets with any profit he might make from this movie.Really, movie makers, get your stars in line!Ryan Reynolds is Canadian, so he gets health care. I guess that was one of the motivating impulses in Nelson's character treating him so badly.Also, Mr. Nelson, your bought and paid for by movie goers face lift is way bad. I object to having to see stars with crummy plastic surgery. Not much of a recommendation for private health care, Mr. Nelson.",,Anonymous,Romance
The Proposal,"Margaret Tate is an executive editor in chief of a book publishing company. Her workers dislike her for her pushy, bossy and demanding. Her assistant Andrew Paxton works very hard to achieve the orders. One day, when Margaret realized that she is about to be deported back to Canada, she forced Andrew to marry her. He conditionally agrees to marry her only he gets promoted, and his book has to be published. Then, they flew to Sitka, Alaska to celebrate Andrew's grand mom Annie's 90th birthday. She was warmly welcomed by all his family and friends. One morning, the family suggested that they can get married in the same week, they agreed the offer. Margaret was well treated by all his family. Then, she started to feel lots of pressure because all the marriage was a lie. The relationship between Margaret and Andrew changed; they started to care about each other. During the ceremony, Margaret realized that she could not fool all the people who treated her so well, only to prevent her from deportation. She confessed to all the people came to attend the ceremony. They were all shocked by the unbearable truth. Margaret then went back to her office and packed her stuff and had to leave in 24 hours. Andrew, wanted to get her back came to the office and proposed to her. This time they are truly in love. I think this film is quite interesting and touching to me. With the two main characters interaction, the film became impressive to me. It's a nice romance comedy!",,Anonymous,Romance
Some Day Sandra Bullock's Ship Will Come In,"SPOILER ALERT Sandra Bullock is a beautiful woman and a comedic actress of considerable talent, waiting for the right vehicle to come along. ""The Proposal"" isn't it. There are several things wrong with this film. First, I don't remember when I've seen a film that was more predictable. Not only the outcome but key details. E.g., Margaret Tate (Bullock's character) can't swim; surprise, surprise, she falls out of a speed boat giving her pretend fiancé, Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) the much needed opportunity to rescue her and comfort and cuddle her. Second, although Reynolds is a good looking guy, he hasn't got the magnetism or the acting skills to stand beside Bullock. There are a couple of well-played supporting roles: Betty White as Grandma Annie, the Paxton family matriarch who wants to see her grandson married and producing great grandchildren, and Denis O'Leary as the immigration official who correctly suspects a phony marriage to prevent Margaret Tate from being deported from the U.S. to her native Canada. Mary Steenburgen and Craig Nelson perform credibly as Andrew's wealthy parents, who'd like him to come home to Sitka, Alaska to run the family empire instead of chasing the literary dreams that has imprisoned him as the terrifying editor Margaret Tate's personal assistant and full-time slave. I found the movie pleasant enough, though a waste of Sandra Bullock's talents. My wife wasn't that charitable.",,Anonymous,Romance
An Offer I Could Have Refused,"Trash.When Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds bump into each other by accident--in the nude--I realized that this scene is an economy of scale, a miniature of The Proposal, a painfully unfunny and moronic collision of concept and cynicism. Bullock, Reynolds, and the entire auxiliary cast are so astonishingly bad, so dull and unpleasant, that the only entertainment that could possibly be derived was to see if my beloved wife and daughter would declare it good . . . and me bad.I reviewed Practical Magic a few years ago and, if you go back to read it, you'll notice that I had some kind things to say about Sandra Bullock's pleasant believability on screen.Where did it go? The woman I found breathtakingly normal ten years ago looks and acts as if she is just a skin shade shy of a George Romero undead-person; Bullock shambles zombie-like through the movie. The only thing missing in her frigid executive non-performance is her not throwing that stupid dog into the bay. I would have given anything to watch her grab Betty White to rip out her throat (not that I have anything against Betty White--it's just that THAT would have been original!).Everything sucked in this movie, even the idea that Reynold's family couldn't be a normal working-stiff clan, but a dysfunctional way- upper middle class bunch of unappealing boobs.But . . .I did get two hours of uninterrupted quality time with the family. The snow was flying outside. The coffee was good. The Chihuahua hopped up to cuddle on my chest.When I go home on my prep period from the high school I work at to help my wife load up trash to take to the transfer station, I can either grumble about how my clothes smell funny the rest of the day or I can say I got to spend some quality time with my sweetheart and best friend.I guess that's why I called The Proposal garbage.",,Anonymous,Romance
Propose To Your Assistant,"Fletcher's film reminded me of the 1996 movie 'While You Were Sleeping' (which also starred Sandra Bullock). While that was a superior film in comparison, the main similarity is that the lead female is deceiving a family under the pretense of being their son's fiancé. That is not to say that 'The Proposal' is devoid of entertainment. In spite of being a typical romantic comedy it was a lot of fun to watch. The Alaskan setting was refreshing. I also enjoyed the scenes between Bullock and the family. It is Sandra Bullock followed by Ryan Reynolds who make this work. After a long time, Sandra Bullock has returned to comedy and she carries the film with no difficulty. She's still among the funniest actresses out there. Reynolds holds his own. Of the supporting cast, Mary Steenburgen is great and Betty White is adorable while Malin Akerman is wasted. For those who are up for a bit of rom com, 'The Proposal' isn't a bad watch.",,Anonymous,Romance
"wonderful, cute, even sardonic comedy.  Ms. Bullock is great.","Very well chosen cast. I am 68 and have loved Betty White for 50+ years going back to her days on, IIRC the Jack Paar show. As to MS. Bullock, how much praise can one heap on her. She was perfect for the part and one has to assume the part about her rather small (but perfect) breasts were written to suit her.I have never been a big fan of Craig Nelson but he seemed very at ease here. It took a while before I caught the connection between the family name and the business names in Sitka.One thing I noticed was on one shot from below her shoulder level, her face was shown profile and the likeness to Michael Jackson, from the pinched, nose to the chin dimple is astonishing. This is not a negative, merely an observation on my part.",,Anonymous,Romance

The amazing turn around of a love story!,"The Proposal was a great movie I would have to say. It was very shocking in the beginning when it all started I wasn't expecting to turn out that great. I was obviously wrong when I saw this film. It was very interesting how the main characters met in the first place, they worked together and she was his boss. They obviously has no intention on falling in love with each other in the first place. The only thing that was happening is they were faking it so she didn't have to back to Canada. When they went and visited his parents they ended up having a great connection. They clearly had a lot of background stories for each other that they would have never guessed considering they didn't know anything about each other, until that day when it all turned around with there relationship. I thought it was so cute how he ended up flying back to meet with her and ended up proposing to her for real.",,Anonymous,Romance
