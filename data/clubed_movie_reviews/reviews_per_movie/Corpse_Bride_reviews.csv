A Work of Dark Art,"After enchanting audiences with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" Tim Burton brings another stop-motion animated spectacle, ""Corpse Bride."" In this story, Victor Van Dort, an inept young groom-to-be, can't make his way through his wedding rehearsal. Going outside to get his lines right, he accidentally winds up marrying the corpse of a murdered bride-to-be. The animation is spectacular, proving stop-motion can be good enough to compete with computer animation. Johnny Depp provides the voice of Victor, showing mild-mannered and nervous grace. Helena Bonham Carter is the voice of Emily, the Corpse Bride, giving the dead character lively emotion. One striking element of the movie is the color scheme. In the living world, there is no bright color, making a near-black and white appearance. The story is well-written, and the music is good. Overall, ""Corpse Bride"" must definitely be seen!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautifully crafted,"This is not my favourite Tim Burton movie by a long shot, but I did find myself enjoying it. The animation is absolutely amazing with the dark bold colours and inspired visual ideas. The music is good too, it adds very well to the atmosphere. The four songs are pretty decent, if nothing special. Remains of the Day was the one I liked best. The script is witty and deliciously dark in places, while the story is clever and fairly original, even if it drags slightly occasionally. The characters are wonderfully quirky and the voice work from the likes of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter is top notch. All in all, a beautifully crafted film, if not quite Burton's finest hour. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Chopin's Grave,"I liked this a lot, and a large part of the reason is that it is pure a Burton film as we are likely to find.And when I say Burton, I mean that oddly successful collaboration between him and Elfman colored by commercial realities.The big picture is that there are very few filmmakers with the skills and courage to be unique, to make movies that only they could. This goes beyond style into the nature of the soul.If you do not have an interesting soul, you cannot be an artist. If you do not have the courage and ability to reveal that soul in some way to us, you cannot either. So hurrahs for the few in the world of film that do.In a way, this film is a notion expanded around Ub Iwerks' (yes, that's a real name) ""Skeleton Dance"" done for Disney and quoted in a couple more hip Betty Boop cartoons. In another way, it is a simple date movie: boy gets girl, boy loses girl by misunderstanding, boy gets girl back and the thing ends in a wedding.And also in a way, it is a love poem to his girl friend. I'm fascinated by these things, where a talented director (usually a man) can shape the image of the woman he loves. Films DO influence how we think of love, but this is more genuine and powerful than any of them, this real love that shines through purely cinematic means. Just think about casting the woman you love as a corpse! She is as alluring here as she has even been.But beyond that is something that is more lasting, the business between Depp and Burton. Johnny is a fine actor, but many fine actors don't get the opportunity to explore new and unknown corners of darkness. He has and is better off for it. And so are we, though whenever this happens we end up with a new character template that inevitably becomes a stereotype. Depp already mines that stereotype in his Pirate movies.But what concerns us here is how Burton/Elfman deepens what he has with Depp. He introduces the character as a pianist, and does so with a piano piece. That piece is a skillful blend of Chopin and pop, but more on the Chopin side. For many, Chopin is the most nakedly emotional yet dark soul they will encounter. No humor, only intimacy and passion.So two clever things were done with this. The first is that the Depp persona (though an animated avatar here) was made deeper by reference to our deepest pianist. The second is that a few musical scenes and effects are set up, all of which reference the scene in some way. There's a sweet musical duet with Helena where they do fall in love. There may be few things more lovely than making love via music played to each other -- with each other.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Animation
Here's the thing,"People say that Corpse Bride was horribly boring, etc. HOWEVER, that is because they are comparing this nonstop motion picture with Nightmare Before Christmas. Those who were really upset after the movie, saying that 'it's definitely not Nightmare', you are absolutely right. It is not Nightmare. It's Corpse Bride, a completely different movie. Everything was comparison, Nightmare to Corpse Bride, and yes, I'll admit, I enjoyed Nightmare more. However, when going to see this movie, you cannot compare Corpse Bride to Nightmare because then yes, you will be upset. If they had done another Nightmare, they would have done it years ago. But this is a different movie with a beautiful plot when you think more closely about it. It's a very strong plot of love, betrayal, hate, death, etc and you see that very strongly if you listen closely to Danny Elfman's wonderful music, vocal and instrumental. Basically, go into the theaters with an open mind and enjoy and pay attention to the movie because it truly has strong, very strong, meanings. If truly watching and comprehending, at parts you cry and at others you smile. It's very clear that it is beautifully created and the actors match their parts well, but the storyline is simply beautiful. Do not think about Nightmare because that movie has been finished years ago, but enjoy Corpse Bride. I will not give anything away, so I leave my review at that. Enjoy Corpse Bride people! And for others who think I am Anti-Nightmare or something, I am seriously not. I loved and still love that movie, but just enjoy Corpse Bride without judgement until after the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Corpse Bride Is To Die For,"I think that The Corpse Bride is a beautiful story. It's about true love and kindness. Johnny Depp is a perfect Victor Van Dort and all the characters are played wonderfully. The animation is superb from facial expressions to a reflection in a tear drop. The ending is one worth waiting for. It's an excellent film that all families should see. I'd suggest not taking children younger than 8 or 9. They might not understand the story line that young, but they'll love the dancing skeletons and the fun songs! That was a surprise: all the songs they sang. If there's one song you must hear it has to be the skeleton one, but also the piano sequence is beautiful as well. Hope you enjoy the film as much as I did!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tim Burton Does It Again!,"In Tim Burton's dazzling Corpse Bride, both Tim Burton fan freaks (I was raised on Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice) and new inductees alike will find something to like here. The exceptional stop-motion animation (which has seen an upgrade since 1993's classic Nightmare Before Christmas) joins with top-notch voice talent (Depp and Helena Bonham Carter stand out here) and typically good score/musical work from genius Danny Elfman to create a wonderful movie-going experience. Yes, this is a movie for anyone - in fact, I think teens and young adults will enjoy it more than younger kids with its dark at times bold humor and fast-paced banter (particulary in the clever songs). NO, it is not as good as Nightmare Before Xmas, but it may be that it would be hard for any film to match that picture. As usual, Tim Burton is always at the top of his game when he sticks to his favorite formula - exploring the darkness of the human soul with off-beat humor. Well-paced and a terrific ending wrap up this well-crafted package! 9/10 stars - it's awesome.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good animation, but not one of Tim Burton's best","I probably would have liked this movie more if I had not already seen - many times - ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" which was a brilliant and original piece of work. This movie does share some of that movie's qualities - haunting soundtrack, bumbling authority figures, a tall thin protagonist who is searching for something, a heroine whose limbs easily detach, and a dear departed house pet. It also has some interesting ideas of its own - the living looking and acting as though they were already dead, versus the dead living it up, since they have no more worries and forever to look forward to with the prospect of all of their loved ones returning to them one by one. In fact, the only time the living seem happy in this film is when the dead return to the land of the living for a truly unique wedding and instead of menacing or haunting the living, there are tearful and happy reunions. However, the individual characters in this film are just not that interesting.In short, even though all of the characters in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" are dead, they just seem more alive and motivated than the characters in this film. Also, this movie is darker than ""Nightmare"" and not as funny, so kids under 10 might find it too intense and probably not as interesting. Thus, although it is worthwhile viewing, I'm just afraid that Tim Burton set the bar too high with his previous animated film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An interesting and relevant, if not perplexing, morality tale","Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is by no means a bad movie- indeed, it is much better than most schlock these days- but it is part of a growing category of films with a very specific problem. It does not seem to have a specific audience in mind, or if it does, it is not approaching that audience in the proper way.Most people will see this film because it is to all appearances the follow-up to The Nightmare Before Christmas. Visually, this is true- Corpse Bride looks and feels very similar to the older film, although computer animation makes this one look even better.However, whereas The Nightmare Before Christmas maintained a jovial, family friendly theme and plot (complete with misunderstood heroes and dastardly villains), Corpse Bride gives us a quiet little story about three young adults who find themselves in an impossible moral situation. Promises are made which must be kept, and out of three people, one must inevitably end up heartbroken. The three central characters are all exceedingly likable- although one may believe Emily is to be the villain of the piece, she consistently demonstrates as much humanity as anyone.Ultimately, the film is about one very difficult moral choice that has to be made by one of the characters. The choice is made and the movie ends, but unless you're paying really close attention, it's difficult to understand why the characters act as they do, and why the film has the ending that it does. While not giving anything away, I'll say that in this sense, the third act of the film presents a very mature dilemma that children (and many adults) are not going to appreciate.Of course, the frustrating thing about this movie is that so much time is spent on song and dance numbers that the moral and romantic elements never really get fleshed out. As such the film (like Victor) is stuck between two worlds, and never really makes up its mind where it wants to be. On this point, then, it fails.It's probably still worth watching, although Tim Burton has done much better in the past.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Makes You Feel Better About Death,"Tim Burton's Corpse Bride was one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. My mother and I are so happy that he made another beautiful and original animated film since The Nightmare Beofre Christmas because we waited for it for 10 years. I'm glad to say that the wait was worth it. The Corpse Bride is a wonderful emotional yet fun story with heart. We had a wonderful time watching it in the theaters and we can't wait to go see it again this weekend. The visuals are so amazing that you'd have to go see the movie with your own eyes for its impossible to explain there perfection. The characters all look stunning and there are so many wonderful new characters in this movie that will keep your eyes glued on the screen. The voices of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Emily Watson are packed with fantastic emotion and acting. The score goes very well to the movie and the four songs that are performed sound wonderful. My favorites were ""Remains of the Day"" made me feel like dancing: it was such a jazzy fun song with the cool voice of Danny Elfmen. And my other favorite was ""Tears To Shed"" it broke my heart. Helena Bonham Carter sang that song with such heartbreak I loved it! The story is very entertaining and it has so much heart in it and Gothic like background. I loved the dialog some of my favorite lines were ""Why Go Up There When People Are Dying To Get Down Here"" and ""Can A Heart Still Break Once It's Stopped Beating."" But the most important thing is that this movie makes you feel less frightened about death. Death in this movie is a lot funner than living and the dead are always having a good time and partying that you feel like dying is not so bad. You should take anyone to see this movie if their paranoid about death it will soften their fears, Overall I strongly encourage anyone to go see this movie. I hope Tim Burten wins the Oscar for best animated movie this year. He truly deserves it! Thank you Mr. Burten for the Corpse Bride, Nightmare Before Christmas and years worth of your great films.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A typical Burton: Good visuals, but not much beneath the surface","Tim Burton is a director who almost always makes enjoyable movies - you can watch them, enjoy them, laugh a bit here and a bit there - but eventually you will forget them. Tim Burton creates beautiful and magical worlds, and the problem is that he often just focus too much on the visuals.In that sense, Corpse Bride is a typical Burton movie. The plot is a simple fairytale which works great for the moment, but it's not something that will stay in your head. Instead you'll want to watch it for the typical Gothic style of his movies, which works great. It's beautiful animated and Danny Elfman's music adds even more to the atmosphere. What's interesting here is that the movie show us two worlds - the world of the living and the land of the dead - and it's the world of the living that is the dark place, with a color scale of black, gray and white and inhabitants that are sad, evil and greedy. In the land of the dead corpses and skeletons sing together, it's colorful and mysteriously beautiful and almost everyone there seems to be having a good time, even though they're dead.The voice actors are great; as many times before, Burton features Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in his movies. They're both great. Other notable voice actors are Christopher Lee and Emily Watson.In the end, it's a pretty funny movie during the time you watch it, but there's no depth in the story whatsoever. It's no movie that stays in your head. That's the reason that I can't rate it any higher, but if you get the chance to see it it's good entertainment for an hour and a half.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Visually interesting world that Tim Burton created but...,"The plot and characters I found lacking. Victor was incredibly annoying simply because he refused to ever speak up for himself and tell the truth on what was going on. Instead, he stuttered through the movie, all doe-eyed, while everyone else talked over him. I found it quite irksome and made the whole plot unnecessary.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dazzling Gothic animation!,"After the huge, and endearing, success of Nightmare Before Christmas - director Tim Burton has returned to Gothic animation, this time as director, with the superbly macabre 'Corpse Bride'! Personally, I prefer live action films; but when animation looks this good, I can hardly complain. Corpse Bride is rich with skeletons, spiders, maggots and a lush dark atmosphere - making this the most horrific 'kids' animated film I've ever seen. Many of the sequences really are quite macabre, which was surprising considering most kids films tend to have a 'nice' slant. One criticism I do have for Corpse Bride is that it's theme is wasted a little. The ideas behind the central plot are too complex, and the film never really explores any of them in great detail. Don't get me wrong, I like this film; but I also feel that a really, really great live action film could be made from a similar plot. Anyway, the basics of the story are that a young man forced into an arranged marriage accidentally finds himself married to a corpse after putting the wedding ring on her finger while rehearsing his vows. Oops!The style of the film is absolutely wonderful. The lushly Gothic visuals are married to a distinctly dark picture, and this results in a great base for the macabre plot line. Many of the scenes look absolutely amazing - the title character's introduction scene being the best of them! Burton has gathered up an array of talent for the making of this film, including Johnny Depp, Emily Watson and Helena Bonham Carter in the leads; and horror icons Christopher Lee and Michael Gough delivering great supporting performances. Danny Elfman has created another great score, and while I don't usually say that I'm a fan of musical numbers in films like this; most of the songs here are actually quite entertaining. The character development is surprisingly good too, with the final outcomes of the leads being believable in spite of the fact that they're just lumps of clay. On the whole, while this film lacks the depth that the themes behind the story deserves; the animation is top quality, the film is lots of fun and there's enough dazzling sequences to ensure that any horror fan will enjoy this movie. Look out for the Peter Lorre-soundalike in the role of the maggot that lives behind the Corpse Bride's eye!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This film is 100% spectacular!,"This film is 100% spectacular, in my opinion. As we all know from the previews prior to the release, Johnny Depp's character must choose between his living and dead brides, essentially. To be perfectly honest, throughout most of the film, I was undecided on who I thought he'd choose and be able to work it out with. This is accounted for by wonderful story-fying and lovely screen writing! Danny Elfman is the musical genius still, not that I had any doubts.Overall, throughout my viewing of the film, I was in awe, gales of laughter, near tears, or just plain excited! Tim Burton has done it again.AMAZING FILM!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Burton does it again,"We all know Burton love the Gothic, the dark and the comically twisted. He uses it in all his films, in one way or another. But he is also very diverse. Movies like ""Ed Wood"", ""Mars Attacks!"" and ""Big Fish"" are proof he can do other styles as well. But in this movie, Burton does what everybody expects him to do, and boy does he do it good.The art style of this movie is perfect, flawless and as Burtonesque as anything can be. The use of stop-motion puppets instead of the more and more tiring CGI gives the movie a realistic feeling and makes it feel more artsy.The story might be the movies weak link but I never thought about it during the movie. Besides, it's an old folk tale, so it's bound to be pretty basic.Danny Elfman. That makes a few roll their eyes but Burton and Eflman is a good team, actually. The songs in this movie were not as good a those in ""Nightmare before Christmas"" but the suited the movie fine and they were never annoying.The voice work is fine, Christopher Lee is great, and the characters are really characteristic and alive, ironically enough. Johnny Depp might be a little wasted since his character is pretty unremarkable, but his involvement has to do with his friendship of Burton and not as a poster name.I recommend this movie to those who liked Tim Burton's earlier movies. You might not be surprised or totally blown away, but masterful handiwork like this is to be encouraged in these times of repetitive CGI children's movies. If you do not like Burton's very special style, then this movie is not for you, but for us who like a little originality in our lives, this is just right.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Magic Music  by Elfmann,"Corpse Bride works for me on so many levels but outstanding is the integration of music and words. The musical that blended the words and music to such a level that one could hardly imagine the film without the composer's contribution. This should be advertised as Danny's production as was the practice of Rogers and Hammerstein, or Irving Berlin or Cole Porter. We have a new art form here: the animated opera. Music is alive and well in the world of the dead. The music in the titles presents themes which continue into the film. An important part of the love story is the interest of the main characters and their methods of expression of emotion via piano music. The characters exist in an aura of sound. Imagine a Russian epic without the Lara Theme or Rick's place without Sam's piano. This film has achieved an identity that says this is music and this is what the movies has to say. All awards to those involved!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Charming Animated Musical,"""Corpse Bride"" is one of the best animated musicals since ""Beauty and the Beast."" Danny Elfman is co-creative force with director Tim Burton, as the delightful songs, music and piano playing courtships match the distinctive ensemble of characters.There are no schmaltzy Disney ballads as the songs, sung by the character ensemble, help to reinforce plot and character points. While the songs aren't classics, they are hummable. With a few more additions, Elfman could turn it into a theatrical production.Each character has delightfully exaggerated features (who didn't want to cut Johnny Depps's drooping forelock off during the Academy Awards?). The crowded Victoriana setting is as fraught with visual possibilities as ""Howl's Moving Castle (Hauru no ugoku shiro)"" and Hogwarts in Harry Potter. The color scape is almost all moon-lit black, gray and blue.The film is charming and funny from the opening through its smidgen too long 76 minutes (though I didn't stay through the credits). The stream of visual jokes and one-liners may go over kids' heads, such as the head waiter. The tributes to old movies also come fast and furious, from the Harryhausen piano to ""The Gone With the Wind"" satire, the Heckle and Jeckle dream sequence from ""Dumbo"", ""Barkis Bittern"" seems to look a lot like an older ""Gaston"" from ""Beauty"" or maybe ""Dudly Do-Right,"" and more. The Peter Lorre-imitating maggot was a bit much.This isn't the first time we've seen dem bones dance around in animation but this is once again with a lot of feeling.Christopher Lee voices the minister marvelously and Helena Bonham Carter enlivens the title character.What's particularly lovely is that none of the characters are really nasty and the magical romantic triangle is resolved with no cruelty.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Can't there ever be a animated movie that sustains a darkly beautiful tone?,"I'm not a huge Tim Burton fanSweeny Todd was decent, but that's all I can really give himand I've never seen The Nightmare Before Christmas, so I can't compare this to it. If you're looking for an unbiased review, this is one of the few you'll get.First of all, for an animated movie, this is one of the better ones I've seen. The themes running though are not overdone clichésunlike, say, Wall-Eand it was very nice to see women in an animated film fighting for the man, and not clichéd vice versa. The plot line itself is something similar to what you'd read in a kid's horror anthology, but it totally worked for this film's style. More importantly, the plot isn't something you've heard a thousand times, and I couldn't pick out any glaring clichés. In a way, The Corpse Bride is more mature of an effort story-wise than some of Burton's live-action, R-rated films because it has more imagination.The signature Gothic style is done very well, and the animation is stellar to look at. I found the use of black-and-white in the real-world sequences a bit annoying and overdone, but to each his own. For someone who isn't a hardcore Burton fan, I can't say I really even noticed the music. Every now and then I thought it was pretty, but I doubt if you're not paying a lot of attention you'll even notice what everyone else is deeming as ""beautiful and a masterpiece"".The main problems The Corpse Bride had: - Most of the characters were forgettable. They play out flat, as if the plot is just using them as pawns. I wouldn't mind this if the plot was AWESOME, but it just simply isn't, and the lack of emotional attachment to the characters really gets in the way of the overall effect.No immersion. I understand this is a children's movie, and being an adult may have something to do with it, but as hard as I tried to love The Corpse Bride there was just something dull about it that I can't put my finger on. The world Burton creates is a near-perfect mix of childish macabre fantasy, and it is beautiful, but there is something missing. I assume that would be a darker plot line. The constant use of puns, also, takes away from the seriousness and beauty of the whole thing. Can't there ever be a animated, PG-rated movie that creates and sustains a darkly beautiful tone? Overall: Be sure to watch it on TV when the countless cartoon networks are playing it for Halloween. It is worth your time. It's just not the masterpiece I was hoping it would be.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A marriage made in the afterlife,"By Keki Tognetti and Manny CastroTim Burton fans watch out! His new film 'The Corpse Bride' came out in theaters on Sept. 23rd, and it is fantastic. Burton comes through again for all of his fans, delivering a comical, heart wrenching, and an emotional roller coaster that you will want to ride again and again.For those new to Burton's whimsical style, the film is very appealing and enjoyable for everyone in the family, though not highly recommended for those whose preference in movies doesn't involve characters singing rimes. The story takes place in a small town during what might seem to be late-19th century Eastern Europe, where everything and everyone is as boring and life-less as a stone grave.The main character Victor, voiced by the talented Johnny Depp, is troubled, extremely nervous and uncertain about his upcoming marriage to Victoria played by Emily Watson.Romance seemed to spark between the soon to be married couple, but just when all seemed well poor Victor takes a turn for the worse and forgets his vows, bringing shame, and dishonor to his family.In panic Victor flees the wedding rehearsal and accidentally marries The Corpse Bride. He then finds himself being taken to the world of the dead by Emily, played by Helena Bonham Carter who is now his new lovely wife.There she shows him a world he's never seen. While the life of the living is dull, monochromatic, and vivid less the world of the dead is boiling with song, color, and excitement.Tim Burton's crusade to rescue the dying art form of stop-motion animation is seen in other Burton stop-motion projects (Vincent (1982), The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), and the 1996 release of James and the Giant Peach) Corpse Bride is a celebration of its art form. Anyone familiar with Burton's career knows that he is a true artist and each film is a reflection of his life. The film is very beautiful.You can either take your children, spouse or a date. The film is very romantic yet very energetic and full of comedy and eye-popping scenes. It has something for everyone. I know the question on everyone's mind, is it better than Nightmare? The answer is no, but so what? It is a great film accompanied by amazing visuals and cool music by Danny Elfman.This film is one of his best works yet, though its a tearjerker at the end, it leaves you wanting more once you reach it. The movie runs for 77 minutes, no fans will be disappointed on the film itself; it is gorgeous. The only real disappointment is how short the film runs, but what more can you expect from stop-motion? It's simply a must see.",,Anonymous,Animation
"""Play dead. "" - Victor (to his skeleton dog.)","On Friday, I went into the movie theater showing 'The Corpse Bride' with kind of mixed feelings. Whenever a Tim Burton film comes out you know it's going to be original and something different, but that doesn't always mean it is going to be good. Since he had just released his masterful remake to the beloved children's novel 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', 'The Corpse Bride' seemed a little rushed and I wasn't sure of how good it was going to be. Well, I can tell you, I was very pleased with the film. 'The Corpse Bride' isn't nearly as good as Burton's classic 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' but it was a very entertaining, inventive and charming animated feature. It was also much creepier then 'Nightmare Before Christmas'.The story follows the solemn Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp) who comes from a middle-class family. His parents are excited because he is being married off to the daughter of a wealthy and prosperous family (who secretly have ran out of money.) Victor is nervous about the marriage and like a klutz screws up at the rehearsal dinner. Filled with shame, Victor runs off to be alone in the creepy woods of the town. He practices his vows, and accidentally places the wedding ring on a narrow tree branch with turns out to be the remains of a dead girl (voiced by Helena Bonham Carter). Now, Victor's world is turned upside town since he is now married to one of the deceased who secretly live below the living.'The Corpse Bride' is one hell of an eerie tale that will no doubt enthrall most adults, but may scare the crap out of little kids. Tim Burton does a good job with this film (it's not one of his best, but isn't one of his worst films by a long-shot). The movie borrows heavily from 'Nightmare Before Christmas' but it is still original in some aspects. Johnny Depp is perfectly cast (or voiced) in the lead along with Helena Bonham Carter. The film also features voice-overs from Albert Finney, Emily Watson, Tracy Ullman, Richard E. Grant and Christopher Lee as the town's reverend.I recommend 'Corpse Bride' to those who would like to see something a tad different, and don't mind the strangeness of the film. It's better than a lot of the swine that's in theaters currently.

Horribly Under-Appreciated,"Corpse Bride gets slammed a lot because it's not in the same vein as the bright, kid-friendly, constantly moving Nightmare Before Christmas. Sure, they were both created by Tim Burton, they both have a similar look and they're both stop-motion, but that doesn't mean that Corpse Bride is going to be the exact same movie done a second time. This movie is the result of Tim exploring other venues within his dark imagination, and the final result of this one is quite satisfactory.This film, while technically a kid's movie (and a musical), is a lot darker, in virtually every way possible. Still, just like with Nightmare, the sets for this film are exquisitely detailed, immaculately constructed with love and attention put into every minute detail. There isn't a single moment of the film that features something that doesn't look like it's right where it needs to be, and that's a testament to the brilliance of Tim and his team. The stop-motion moves with such fluidity that it's easy to lose yourself in the action of the film. Even the fast-moving scenes are handled with such careful precision and professionalism that this film is truly a joy to watch.Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter work fantastically off each other in this film; the former playing Victor Van Dort, a lovable yet clumsy young man forced into an arranged marriage with Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson), only to wind up unwittingly proposing to a Corpse Bride (HBC).It's a fun, upbeat - albeit creepy for younger viewers - trip to the underworld, a ticket to experience the world of the dead, complimented perfectly with the music of Oingo Boingo's Danny Elfman, who also did the music on Nightmare. Yet again, his score is hauntingly beautiful, creating the exact emotions within the viewer that Tim intends with each scene. The songs he's crafted are irresistibly catchy and, when they need to be, slower, heart-felt and moving.This is a movie with a lot of heart, which is a little bit weird to consider for anyone who may not be accustomed to the world of Tim Burton.While it's not a perfect movie, and it can't be viewed on the same level as The Nightmare Before Christmas, this movie stands perfectly well on its own and is a must-see for Burton fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Burton's best animated feature,"I'm no big fan of these quirky, Gothic stop-motion animation type films, but I have to say that CORPSE BRIDE is a darn sight more entertaining than that overblown '90s film, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas. Tight pacing, plentiful action, some fun songs and excellent attention to technical detail make this the superior film in every way, and I can fully appreciate the fairy tale storyline of a man who accidentally finds himself married to a dead woman.The film utilises some fine voice talent, which I admit was the reason I chose it in the first place. Helena Bonham Carter's vocal chords are put to excellent use as she plays the alluring, surprisingly affecting titular bride, with Johnny Depp almost unnoticeable opposite her. The pairing works so well that Carter and Depp were later also put to good use in Burton's excellent musical version of Sweeney Todd. Emily Watson, Paul Whitehouse, Joanna Lumley, Richard E. Grant and Albert Finney all provide solid support, and there are also a couple of made-to-measure parts for old-timers Christopher Lee and Michael Gough, who are both excellent.The animation is colourful and action-packed and unsurprisingly Burton comes up with plenty of ghoulish creations, could they get away with a live action version of this? I think not! All in all a witty, dark fun little film.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another beautiful Tim Burton movie,"i just saw this movie at the Toronto film festival. Tim Burton, as with most of his movies, makes the setting and visuals the most important part. And what a beautiful movie it was, the animation was astounding. You could tell that each frame was tirelessly worked on in order to make each little piece have its own distinct look. The plot is unimportant, and cliché, but that doesn't matter. This movie shouldn't be watched for the storyline. The voice acting was very convincing, especially the lead, Johnny Depp, who does a great job as the shy, clumsy Victor. The only character i really didn't think was needed was the worm, who was just included just for some childish comedic relief, which took away from the dark mood of the picture. Though not as enjoyable as ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" it still was a very good animated movie. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Hey! Give me a listen, you corpses of cheer/ Least those of you who still got an ear/ I'll tell you a story make a skeleton cry/ Of our own jubiliciously lovely corpse bride!","Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (2005) is a stop-motion-animated Romance as well as Comedy / Family / Fantasy / Musical which takes place in two parallel worlds, in the world of living and in the world of dead. It starts in the Victorian England and tells of a young man, Victor who is to marry a girl he never met, named Victoria (Victor and Victoria in the Victorian England). Victor and Victoria fell in love from the first sight but unknown for him, Victor finds himself married to Emily, a mysterious Corpse bride, and taken to the world of dead which in Burton's movie is much more colorful, friendlier, and jollier than the world of livingWith the running time only 76 minutes, ""Corpse Bride"" simply does not have time to become boring. It is funny, charming, and refreshingly effective in its use of the stop-motion animation in the age of the advanced computer technology. Some characters are absolutely hilarious, for example, a cute green maggot that lives in Emily's skull and pops out from her eye with the smart remarks and comments. The songs are nice; especially the one that tells the horrific story of the Corpse Bride in such colorful way that you would not stop smiling. Danny Elfman, the film's composer provided voice for Bonejangles, the singer. I also noticed the use of the elegant cutout-style animation with the hypnotizing backgrounds very much in the style of ""Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed"" (1926) directed by Lotte Reiniger, which is the oldest surviving animated feature film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Exquisite (haven't seen that word in a while),"Burton takes another playful swipe at his stop-motion heroes with this nicely-done treat.Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is a milquetoast. A bumbling, unlucky dreamer. To make things worse, his parents (multi-talented Paul Whitehouse and Tracey Ullman) are forcing him into the classic ""arranged marriage"", which is more like a contract with the cash-strapped but aristocratic Everglots (Albert Finney & Joanna Lumley). Things turn around, however, when he meets his intended, Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) who is actually very attractive, inside and out.The ceremony is as arranged as the marriage, unfortunately, and the frustrated minister (Christopher Lee) demands that Victor take time out to PRACTICE HIS VOWS. This too, is awkward, as in the midst of his rehearsal, Victor places a ring upon a corpse's poking finger (just the place to rehearse a wedding, a cemetery) thus rousing the title character (Helena Bonham Carter), who leads Victor on a voyage through life and death and an unwitting quest to figure out what he really wants.Exquisite, yes, and enjoyable, but not without a few flaws. Most of the songs, while well written, feel out of place, and potentially powerful villain, Barkis Bittern (post-Doctor Who Richard E. Grant) doesn't seem to be allowed to do enough. But the good far outweighs the bad--moviegoers who get past the title will find a light-hearted romp that is rife with parody and spoof, from the Harryhausen brand piano to the diminutive character Bonesapart (played by the diminutive Deep Roy). A cameo by Jack Skellington would have been cool (O.K., Disney) but Danny Elfman's Bonejangles does pull off an eye-popping number. Even the unsettling, Peter-Lorre-channeling maggot residing in the Bride's skull threatens to steal the show. Good cast (with many Burton stalwarts, incidentally), with the philosophy that less is more make for a good time.Like it or not, it is well-worth noting that this film delivers many firsts to film-making, including new-style digital camera-work on refined stop-motion. To animators and film students, this offering comes highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Tim Burton Look,"Victor Van Dort and Victoria Everglot are arranged to be married. The Van Dorts need the social status. The Everglots are broke and need the new money even if it smells like fish. The regimented rehearsal wedding goes terribly wrong. Victor goes off to practice his vows. When he places his ring on the finger of a corpse, he finds himself married to the deceased Emily, and he is transported to the world of the dead.The Tim Burton stop-motion animation is impeccable. The real world is very grey, and the dead world is colorful. It starts off in a horribly stuffy ugly world that looks very tired. The lead is a meek guy. It looks interesting but the story isn't that compelling.The dead world looks much more imaginative. It's definitely much more colorful. I didn't particular care for any of the songs. They all sound like Broadway rejects. I didn't like any of the characters, but I didn't find them that compelling to hate either. I certainly wouldn't want to stay in the dead world. It wasn't even a close call since Victoria seems to be such a sweetheart.However I've got to give it credit for it's great Tim Burton style. And the characters have that weird Tim Burton sense and sensibility. It's a better movie to see than to follow as a story.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
well crafted,"The contrast, showing the afterlife to be more colourful and vibrant than the land of the living, was PROFOUND. The art style was fresh & unconventional, like in all Tim Burton movies.I found the lyrics ""Perhaps he does belong with her, Little Miss Living, with her rosy cheeks and beating heart"" and ""Though it doesn't beat, it's breaking. And the pain here that I feel, try and tell me it's not real. I know that I am dead, yet it seems that I still have some tears to shed"" to be rather too relatable.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Victor/Victoria?,"Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is supposed to marry Victoria Everglot. Both sets of parents are in favor of this arranged marriage, as the Van Dorts have money but are not part of high society and the Everglots have noble blood but are dirt poor. However, at the rehearsal, Victor screws everything up and he's sent off to try to memorize the wedding vows...which he keeps screwing up. While walking through the woods and practicing, he finally gets it right and ends up married to a corpse who has just come back to life after he put the ring on her skeletal finger! What is poor Victor to do? After all, life in the underworld with a skeletal wife isn't most folks' idea of a great marriage!The animation is pretty spectacular...though the Laika stop-motion films are a bit prettier and are more fluid...though for 2005 this is awfully good. It's also interesting how they used colors in the story. The world of the living is all in gray tones...whereas the underworld is very vividly colored...quite the opposite of what you probably expected.As for the story, it's very nice. My only complaints about any of this is that the story is perhaps too simple and the music isn't at all memorable (unlike Tim Burton's more famous stop-motion predecessor, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas""). But the visuals are amazing and the story is fun.By the way, I would NOT recommend it to small kids. The story about death is awfully creepy and this is more a film for older kids and adults.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Enjoyable, fun though macabre film relying on a wonderful painstaking stop-motion technique.","It revolves around Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp), the son of newly rich fish merchants, and Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson), the neglected daughter of impoverished aristocrats, prepare for their arranged marriage, which will simultaneously raise the social class of Victor's parents and restore the wealth of Victoria's family.

Loving You Is Like Loving The Dead. !A Grave Proposal!. The Graceful Dead !. Throw Him A Bone !. The love of his life !. The love of her afterlife !. Can a heart still break once it's stopped beating?. Rising to the occasion !. There's been a grave misunderstanding !.Very amusing and well made stop-motion animation film, competently realized by Tim Burton, Mike Johnson and financed by director Tim Burton himself . Burton's peculiar artistic style is backed by an extensive and fruitful filmography and in 'Corpse Bride' shows his narrative skills. After 'The Nightmare Before Christmas', charismatic director Tim Burton returns to the world of animation, this time based on a Russian tale that tells the macabre story of an unwanted wedding between a disgraced man and a dead bride. The film was nominated for best animated film. The acclaimed director and screenwriter worked for 10 years to bring this story to the screen as an animated film using the Stop-Motion technique. This is a fun, entertaining and ingenious stuff with some creepy touches, magic as well as funny elements, but ponderously paced in keeping with rather rousing musical score. An original fairy tale with an amazing screenplay by Caroline Thompson and John August from roles and characters created by Tim Burton and Carlos Grangel . It took more than two years to shot with a perfect technique by means of stop-motion. Not cuddly, best appreciated by those with a feel for the sinister, enhanced by cameraman Pete Kozachik's dark cinematography . Fast paced is maintained throughout by the equally breathless, lively soundtrack masterfully composed by the great musician Danny Elffman with some catching sings , too . Including known voices, such as Emily Watson, Tracey Ullman, Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney, Richard E. Grant, Christopher Lee, Michael Gough, Jane Horrocks and Danny Elffman himself. It is a really amusing film that kiddies and adults with a sense of the bizarre enjoy very much.The picture was financed by Tim Burton who was an animator trainee at Walt Disney productions. Burton came up with his adventurous idea but could not get it made, subsequent directorial hits brought more clout. Burton also produced or directed other fims in similar style as ¨Frankenweenie¨ and ¨The Nightmare Before Christmas¨ , in the latter Burton hired Henry Selick who made a very competent direction who equally directed ¨Monkeybone¨, ¨Caroline¨ and ¨James and the giant peach¨. Corpse Bride(2005) rating: 7.5/10. Better than average. The flick will appeal to Tim Burton fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Nutshell Review: Tim Burton's Corpse Bride,"Tim Burton and Johnny Depp? Sign me up for it, anytime! I've pretty much enjoyed their collaborations, from Edward Scissorhands to Sleepy Hollow. Hot off the heals from their box-office success Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, their latest collaboration sees Depp lending his voice to Burton's macabre vision in a stop motion animated movie, along the veins of Nightmare Before Christmas (NBC).The story's a little bizarre, a little morbid, but hey, it's Burton on familiar grounds. The Von Dorts and the Everglots have agreed to an arrange marriage between their children Victor (Depp) and Victoria (Emily Watson), but Victor, fumbling the marriage rehearsals, runs away to seek solace, and accidentally unleashes the Corpse Bride Emily (Helena Bonham Carter, giving the character an impeccable Brit accent). So begins a crazy love triangle of sorts, involving characters from both the realm of the living and the dead.Surprisingly, Burton managed to squeeze a couple of subplots into this relatively short film, and touched on themes like arranged marriages, what's in it for both families (The Von Dorts are the newly rich, wanting to add prestige to their family name, while the Everglots are bona-fide aristocrats who've gone bust, and need the dough to continue their lifestyle and save face). Different facades of love are exhibited between Victoria-Victor-Emily, one which is the more conventional (and maybe improbable?) ""love-at-first-sight"", while the other, growing to love a person (though it happened within 24hrs, so what?) You might be able to guess the ending and the relations between some of the characters mid-way through the movie, though some might prefer an alternative ending. If you're acquainted with Burton's works, it's typical of him and his style, so you'll see it coming the way it was, as per his dark visions.The art and characters are very NBC-like too, with their small heads and extremely long limbs. Stop-motion is difficult to do, and watching it in a digital format brings out the crispness of the figurines. Burton loads the film with many supporting characters, each with its own zany behaviour, and some even spoofing characters from movie classics. Somehow Christopher Lee's Pastor Galswells suffered from LOTR's shadow and always reminded me of Saruman, though I think the reference was unintentional.And what's an animated flick without humour? Corpse Bride has tons of references, and both physical and dry humour to satisfy both camps. The music's also top-notch, but what can you less expect from another long time Burton partner Danny Elfman? Though you can hear shades of Batman in the instrumentals, the songs and lyrics are really a class of their own, bringing this musical to life, just like what Elfman managed to do for NBC.Highly recommended, even if it means forking out S$9.50 on a weekend for a less than 80 minutes show. I can't wait for another dark stop-motion animated movie from Burton. Bring it on I'd say!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Comes Alive When It's Dead,"This stick-figure animated film offers good visuals, inventive-looking characters (that being perhaps the most fun of the film), and a decent story that finished with a very nice ending. There are songs in here but they are only so-so, and certainly not the attraction to the film.The story starts off slowly, but once the characters went down under into the land of the dead, not only did we finally start seeing some colors other than blue, but the whole film came alive and pretty much stayed that way until the end.As with good animated movies, there is so much you can see that you can't take it all in. It's a feast for the eyes with all the wild-looking characters and nice drawings. Getting good visuals from director Tim Burton is no surprise; he always comes through in that department. Unfortunately, he also usually delivers an anti-religious cheap shot or two.. Here, the minister is pictured as a sour old guy. Burton also pictures clerics in a negative way, and the occult in a positive way. However, he certainly makes interesting films, no matter what the subject matter, and there usually isn't a lot of profanity in his films. There is none here whatsoever.Overall, an inventive film and fun to watch once you get past the slow first part.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tim Burton's Better Film.,"Review:
'Corpse Bride' is a dark-fantasy film directed by Mike Johnson and Tim Burton.
I've seen parts of this movie multiple times but have never fully watched it through until now. If I am being honest, I'm not the biggest Tim Burton fan and I can't really put my finger on why that is. His movies seem to be the same dark concept with different stories. Let's look at some movies that his name is under. We have 'Corpse Bride', 'Frankenweenie', and 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' and these are just his stop motion films. None have any gripping elements to bring viewers in to start watching it let alone continue through the runtime. However, out of all the Tim Burton stories ""Corpse Bride"" is one that I could see myself viewing again.
We start the movie out being introduced to Victor (Johnny Depp) and his odd mother and father. We learn that he is to be married to the daughter of a thought to be known wealthy family's daughter; Victoria (Emily Watson). When the rehearsal for the wedding goes awry, Victor sets off to the woods to practice his vows before the big day, only to become married to an undead bride when he places his ring on the corpse's finger, thinking it was a branch. Now, locked into the commitment of marriage to a dead woman named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter) and trapped in the land of the undead, Victor must find away out of the marriage and look for a way back to the land of the living.
A big positive for this movie is the voice acting. It may not seem like a big deal, but having the wrong voice come out of a certain character could throw off the whole film and everybody in this movie did a fantastic job bringing their characters to life. Although, Helena Bonham Carter does such a great job giving her character personality you almost want Victor to end up with her at the end of the movie when I don't think that's the intention of Tim Burton.
I was also a fan of the musical choices in this movie. I thought it brought a much-needed energy to the overall story and was executed fully. The one thing that spoke most to me and what I thought was a brilliant concept was that fact that when the movie is in the land of the living it is very dark, and everybody looks miserable. When the movie is taking down in the land of the dead it is colorful, and everybody looks happy. Now, I don't believe that the movie is saying if you want to be happy be dead. It's just telling a realistic view on life, not everybody is happy, and maybe the dead are happy, and we shouldn't feel so scared about death when it comes.
Overall, this is classic Tim Burton and if you're a fan of his you will love this movie. It has a dark sense of humor and tell a story of death, love, and sacrifice.

Night of the Moping Dead,"Stop-motion animation is a rarely used medium these days, but one has to admit -- when it's done, it's usually done very well. 'Corpse Bride' is a great example of this; every visual in the movie exhibits beautiful style and craftsmanship. It's a shame they had to waste all this eye candy on a script which is so thin and lifeless (like a corpse bride, har har). The premise is interesting, at least -- a nebbish groom winds up accidentally ""marrying"" a zombie -- but all of the interesting possibilities of the premise are ignored, as the plot mostly adheres to overdone kid's movie conventions. There's a bad guy, and cutesy little supporting characters, and parents that just don't get it, and everything else you expect to find (and are disappointed to find) in this type of film. Mostly these conventions just distract from the love triangle that is central to the movie, and which is never developed as fully as it should have been.'Corpse Bride' is also a musical, but you'll wish it wasn't. Generally musicals feature a wide range of emotions in their songs, and since this is a bittersweet love story, you would expect that to be the case here. Not so! It seems that few of the characters are able to lift themselves out of their self-pitying depression for even a few bars of any song. It's probably the worst score I've ever heard for Danny Elfman; just one drab, interminable tune after another.I'll probably watch this movie again, simply because the animation was that good. Next time, however, I'm muting the sound and turning some other music on.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Undead wedding,"I really like this movie, with its really good voice acting and really catchy or fitting music that fits the beautiful and creative scenes.Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter were really good, even the stop-motion animation was beautiful in how its shown and how creative it is in the dead world in Tim Burtons dark style.The music is really nice to listen to and I love that this is another LAIKA studios stop-motion movie, the stop-motion animation mixed with Tim Burtons style makes the movie a creepy fun movie.I suggest wtching this when you gat a chance, you might love the style of the movie and you will think this is a really good Tim Burton movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tim Burtons Second Best Stop Motion,"I am part of a select few here in the las Vegas area, that have been privy to a advance screening of THE CORPSE BRIDE. I have to say it was one of Burton's best. I used to think his animated short VINCENT, was his second best. Having JUST seen the movie ( no more than 45 min ago ) This movie was just as good as nightmare. Actually, you could see were there are even better moments in the CORPSE BRIDE. ( IE new camera moves ).All in all, this movie is a 10!! I am going to be seeing it MANY more times before it is let out of theaters. HIGHLEY recommended!! As always, Mr. Burton has NOT let us, his lowly Fanboys down! ;)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Corpse Bride,"Corpse Bride is a charming enough movie but it lacks flair. It's all very lukewarm. None of the songs really jumped out at me. The story is good, not great. The visuals are wonderful and the voice acting is impressive but that's not enough to drag it too high out of mediocrity for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A new generation of animation,"I don't care how visually brilliant an animated movie is. These days, if it doesn't have a good story, interesting characters, appropriate music, and competent actors, the movie is going to suck. I want to feel like I'm watching a live-action movie. Fortunately, Tim Burton is a wonderful storyteller, and ""Corpse Bride"" is an example of his imagination.Victor (Johnny Depp) is about to meet his bride Victoria (Emily Watson) for the first time. It's early 19th century England, so it is an arranged marriage. During the rehearsal, he keeps flubbing his vows, panics, and runs into the woods. He practices, and when he finally gets it right, he places the ring on a tree branch. Except that it isn't a tree branch. It's the finger of a corpse (Helena Bonham Carter), and she thinks she's now married to Victor! He runs, crashes into a tree, and knocks himself out.When he comes to, he finds himself in--it's not really Hell, and it's not really Heaven, so we'll just call it the underworld. Bonejangles (Danny Elfman) tells the ""tragic tale of romance, passion, and a murder most foul"" in a jazzy song-and-dance routine. Victor becomes friends with Emily, the Corpse Bride, and she falls head-over-heels in love with him. But he's not sure if he wants to live among the dead, and he's torn between Emily and Victoria.The stop-motion animation is the same style as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" The animation has come a long way since 1993, but I liked ""Nightmare's"" story more. There are some parallels, but contrary to rumor, Jack Skellington does not make a cameo. Overall, this is a beautiful love story with likable characters, catchy music, and, of course, visually brilliant animation.PG for scary stuff. Most kids who understand death and/or love will enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
the dead have much more fun!,"It's plain to see which side of the life-and-death divide Tim Burton's heart is on. The living, in Cousin Tim's universe, are stuffy, status-obsessed, grey people who frown upon music, deviations from the norm, and the frivolous notion that couples about to wed should--the very idea!--LIKE each other! Whereas downstairs in the land of the dead, skeletal barkeepers sing up a storm, there's hot jazz, dancing, bright colors, and (maybe not so surprisingly) very warm hearts. Heck, the dead even have cuter dogs (a common Burton theme and true again here). Victor, a very proper young man so non-morbid that he collects--and then releases--butterflies, accidentally finds himself married not to his living fiancée Victoria, but to the winsome and lovely Emily--whose only failing as a wife is her residence outside this mortal coil. (Tell ya the truth, though, he's not good enough for her; he's just too uptight, and the never-ending party vibe in the Ball & Socket Tavern seems to give him, well, butterflies.) How did sweet Emily end up a Corpse Bride? Will she be avenged? Can Victor and Victoria find their way back to each other and a subdued, proper, contented (but bloody boring!) life? You will have a great time finding out, cos this is a complete gem, funny, touching, dark and sweet, with the prettiest ending I've seen in years. It really did make me both laugh and cry, and I hardly ever get to say that. Tim, darlin', I forgive you for Willy Wonka; this one will go straight into Goth hearts worldwide and last for ages. (footnote: kids in the crowd we saw it with actually got up and danced in the aisles to the cookin' jazz in the closing credits! ever see THAT before? maybe the dead can even show us living stiffs how to have a good time. =)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Decent but could be better,"POSITIVES:1) The voice acting is very good, especially Johnny Depp as the meek Victor
2) Every scene with Victor and Victoria together is very heartwarming
3) The two scenes with Victor and his brides playing the piano are by far the two best scenes in the film - they're beautifulNEGATIVES:1) Even with such a short runtime there were scenes that felt pointless
2) The dead characters were inherently unlikable for the sheer fact that they were forcing Victor to stay with them against his will
3) The twists of the narrative were so easy to foresee that it came across quite lame; you could argue that they were intentionally easy to foresee but even in that case I'd have preferred a narrative with a couple of genuine twists",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I really didn't like this.,"I thought this film was definitely one of the worst of all Burton's. I'm not sure why, just that it lacked something that usually captivates the watcher.Compared to Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow its quite unadventurous. It seemed dull and a bit lifeless (no pun intended).And didn't really have much suspense, kind of monotonous. Although on a more positive note, some of the characters were quite interesting and there were a few amusing and comical moments. The dancing and singing made it a bit more lively and a few of the characters were funny and portrayed well. The fact that the death world was lively and the living world dull, made it quite quirky and gave a good change in setting, as well as contradicting the modern worlds ideas about death.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful movie with few faults,"Tim Burtons Corpse Bride is an amazing film. I do not know why I love it, there's just something about it. I bought it on DVD about a year after it was released because it had gotten a lot of good reviews. And my was I stunned. I watched it 3 times the first day i got it and another time the next day. It was just amazing.Its about the story of Victor who is to marry Victoria. But, after a series of unfortunate events he finds himself married to the corpse bride Emily instead. It has the flavor of being made for kids, but is a movie for all ages. And I'm not usually the one to watch children's movies.Both Johnny Deep, Helen Bonham Carter and Emily Watson offers some really good voice acting. One can feel that the voices really fits. The rest of the actors offer some strong voice acting too. My favorite would be Christopher Lee as Pastor Galswell. but how does it work? Why would we need so simple movie-making techniques in a time of computer animation? Because it ads a interesting feeling. And if your wondering, yes, even though its not CGI its still beautiful.The voice acting is well done, the story is good and interesting, its got many good jokes and its entertaining from beginning to end. And thats what really matters. I would definitely say you should see Corpse Bride. The only fault with this movie is thats it to short. Sill, a must see in my book.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Loved the movie, but did not like the ending","Contain spoiler.....I've just seen the movie last night and had to register here to leave a review for this movie. The movie was very well done. The voice acting and the singing were appropriate and fun. I will abbreviate my review by not repeating what others have already complimented.I would love to see an ending that takes a different twist. It's very typical and predictable for a handsome prince to end up with a beautiful princess. A typical audience would think that Victor would end up with the living and beautiful Victoria in the end, which is exactly what happened. I saw this movie and was so disappointed that he did not end up with the corpse bride or Emily (I felt so sorry for her character - she was cheated out of her life and had nothing in return). The movie would have more emotional meaning in the end if Victor fell in love with Emily through a progression of character development, after all she shared his passion for piano and may be other things. Instead, he ended up with Victoria, who was just a pretty face. What I'm saying is that the movie could end up like the Shrek where the princess turns ugly to be with her love, rather than beauty and the beast where the prince turns handsome to be with his love. Sacrifice always represent loves more than reward.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not Jack Skellington, but still a beautiful tale.","Being Tim Burton's 2nd animated film, it's definitely flooded with Burton's unique art style paired with the stop motion animation that isn't seen all the time. Something that sets it apart from Burton's iconic Nightmare Before Christmas is the coloring. Corpse Bride utilizes a bit more fluorescent colors compared to the darker color scale from his previous animated movie.A negative about this movie is it's attempt to be a musical. The songs were not too memorable and it's hard to beat the quality from Nightmare Before Christmas. But the highlight of the film for me hands down is the musical score. That, I would say, is the one thing better than it's predecessor. Victor's piano song, which plays as the main theme throughout the movie, is one of my favorite pieces of music of all time. The entire score is haunting and beautiful, and definitely a standout for me in Danny Elfman's repertoire.So, again, the reason why not many people talk about Corpse Bride as much is because we're too busy comparing this story to Jack Skellington's tale. While the Christmas-Halloween crossover is practically unbeatable, the story of the corpse bride is actually really interesting. It feels more of a fairy tale or old folk tale that's good to tell over a campfire. It's also another opportunity for Burton to explore what the afterlife might be like. The character design of the bride is beautiful and the film has an excellent cast. For any Tim Burton fan, please add this to your Burton or Halloween marathons. It's not the most iconic or exciting, but it's still a beautiful experience nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

At only 1:19 in length, the movie leaves the viewer with a lack of closure and wanting more.As a children's' film, the movie succeeds in flying colors with a wonderfully fun story line, beautifully drawn stop animation, and of course, captivating music from the mind of Danny Elfman who never ceases to amaze his listeners.Unfortunately, the film caters almost exclusively to children and leaves the older audience, looking for more intelligent humor, wanting.In short, this film doesn't represent the best of Burton's abilities. It has dazzling images, but doesn't have any underlying themes. As it exists to entertain, it succeeds. However, as exists to enlighten or make the audience think, it's no ""Big Fish.""",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
What is this movie exactly?,"First of all I have to say I didn't dislike this movie, it just left me with a strange sensation of not knowing what I had seen and that I didn't find it funny in any way. It's not a movie for children at all, some parts are quite scary and in most parts it is rather sad. Yet it's not a movie for adults either, the ""humour"" is too naive and simplistic and the plot does seem like the one in a children movie. I think that most people who enjoyed this movie are adults that 'prepared' themselves, putting themselves in the proper mood to watch this, wishing to like it. Even though the esthetics are very impressive and the sung parts are great I don't think this movie is as good as it's been said.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An inspired, beautiful tale of melancholy romance","Acclaimed director Tim Burton's latest venture into the world of stop-motion animation, a world with which he has long been acquainted with, is an inspired, beautiful tale of melancholy romance. Don't let the creepy title of this macabre musical throw you off. Granted, this kind of film may not be for all tastes, but if you can get past the ghoulish appearance of the film and are game for a wondrous, haunting world of fantasy and love, then this is the movie for you.Although deriving from a relatively simple screenplay by John August, Pamela Pettler and Caroline Thompson, Corpse Bride showcases characters that are well etched and constructed, and that are able to form a very strong, emotional bond with the audience. We truly feel for Emily, the Corpse Bride, whose heart was broken once before and is threatened to be broken again, by Victor, who wants to leave the World of the Dead and return to his love, Victoria. We sympathize with Victoria who, while waiting for her true love Victor to return, is being forced to wed another man by her desperate parents. And we feel for Victor, of course, for having to face this awful dilemma and choose one of the two brides. While I won't give away the conclusion, I will mention that the film's finale is one of the most beautiful scenes I've seen in an animated film. The final shot is a wondrous, memorable end, reminiscent of the melancholy ends of some of Disney's greatest films.The animation is, of course, top notch. It is virtually seamless, fluent and full of motion and energy. The characters and figures move as in real life. The animators have clearly put a lot of effort into even the tiniest of details, such as the billowing of the Corpse Bride's dress, or the way her and Victor's hair move when they walk or swing their heads. The characters themselves are beautifully designed, every character having distinct traits that truly define it. Much detail has gone even into the tiniest background character. It is certainly a giant leap from the Rankin-Bass Christmas specials of the 1960s, or Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion monsters, which influenced Burton to begin work with stop-motion animation in the first place. It is even a technical leap from The Nightmare Before Christmas, Burton's previous feature-length stop-motion masterpiece, from 1993. What's for sure, Corpse Bride is a beautiful rebuke to the current trend of 3D computer animation, started by Pixar in 1995 with Toy Story.The voice work is also excellent. Johnny Depp (Victor) tones down his usual eccentric acting and delivers a simple, quiet, innocent performance in a perfect British accent. Helena Bonham Carter (The Corpse Bride), Burton's fiancé for four years now, also delivers a wonderful performance, and proves her singing talents as she sings her heart out in one of the musical numbers. The other cast members, including Emily Watson (Victoria), Albert Finney (Finnis Everglot, Victoria's father), Tracey Ullman (Nell Van Dort, Victor's mother) and Christopher Lee (Pastor Galswells) to name a few, are quite effective at bringing their characters to life.As with The Nightmare Before Christmas, Burton and his art and set design team paint two distinctly different worlds in the film, both an amazing visual achievement and absolutely gorgeously designed. In The Nightmare Before Christmas, these two worlds are Halloween Town and Christmas Town. In Corpse Bride they are the World of the Living and the World of the Dead. Ironically, it is the World of the Dead that is colorful and lively, while the World of the Living is painted in austere, lifeless mutes of gray. With the World of the Living, Burton paints a Victorian Nightmare, a pale, lifeless, Gothic wonderland with muted colors bordering on gray-scale and large, somber, cold yet beautifully dark set pieces. Such design is by now considered a trademark of Burton, and is expected of him after appearing in his previous films such as Edward Scissorhands, the two Batman films, and Sleepy Hollow. The other world, the World of the Dead, is livelier, the sets full of color and crammed with detail and character. In the World of the Dead, the design team create a colorful world of decaying flesh, decomposition, and a wonderful, merry good time of singing and dancing. The decaying yet colorful characters, figures and streets are absolutely brilliantly designed.The music is yet another element of this film to praise. Danny Elfman, longtime collaborator of Tim Burton's (he scored all of Burton's films from his first and up until this one, except for Ed Wood), continues his trend of writing and performing songs for Burton's movies (he has previously done so for The Nightmare Before Christmas and, recently, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). His nifty little songs are really quite enjoyable, the highlight of them being a song titled ""Remains of the Day"", a pure, jazzy number Elfman clearly enjoyed composing  he even sang the song himself. As expected, the musical score of the film, aside from the songs, is powerfully atmospheric and reaches peaks of true composing brilliance at times.To sum it all up, Corpse Bride is whimsical but eerie, funny but melancholy. If The Nightmare Before Christmas was a Christmas-tainted pop number, Corpse Bride is a waltz  an elegant, romantic, melancholy tale, an ode to love and sacrifice. This film doesn't only have everything I look for in an animated film, but also everything that I look for from a Tim Burton film. I'm convinced that, with time, this film will become a classic like The Nightmare Before Christmas. It's an instant classic in my book, a surefire contender for being crowned the Best Animated film of the year, and a film like nothing else at the movies these days.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
It was OK,"Tim Burton's second stop-motion animation movie (following ""The Nightmare Before Christmas""). Meek, mild and VERY thin Victor Van Dort (voice of Johnny Depp) is going to marry beautiful Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson)...but he's not sure if he's ready for marriage. He (accidentally) puts his wedding ring on the finger of a skeleton's hand. This reanimates the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) who assumes he wants to marry her! And it's a musical too! As you can see this is pretty silly--but stories are never very strong in Tim Burton movies. The visuals are the first concern and they ARE incredible. The animation is flawless--the characters move fluidly and some of the sets are really incredible. There's also tons of visual gags (my favorite is when Victor tells the skeleton dog to roll over...and play dead) and the songs are actually not bad--the score from Danny Elfman is great and there's a skeleton song and dance that stops the movie. But I didn't really like it.I found it slow...even at 75 minutes (I dozed off at one point!) and all the sets are (purposely) very gloomy in dark colors--the film looks like it was shot in black & white at times. It fit the story but started to wear down on me--I was getting depressed! The jokes really don't work--some do but most just sit there. The total lack of logic in the plot began to annoy me--there was a twist at the end that I thought was particularly contrived. However the voices DID fit the characters and it was interesting to look at. But I need more than visuals to keep me interested. If you're a Tim Burton fan you'll probably love this--but I can only truthfully give it a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wow...,"I saw this movie recently, seeing as Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are some of my idols, and i have to say i was never, at one time, disappointed. The animation was superb, and the undertaking to attempting to get every scene up to satisfaction(for something is never perfection) was very impressive. The voices for the characters were well chosen and the design and characteristics of the characters was very vivid and real-like. I am going back to see it this weekend, and am sure the movie will be just as enjoyable. Johnny Depp was very interesting to watch mold this character directly from just working on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and still manage to make this character just enough before falling over the edge. The music by Danny Elfman was again, like always as he tends to pair Burton often, was quite mystical and serenading.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Beautiful, yet cold... even films about dead people still need heart","Tim Burton is an exceptional auteur. Few directors have made such a stylistic mark on the viewing public as he has. He creates wonderful visuals in all of his films, but his talent for directing is another matter. His films, unfortunately, are largely hit or miss. He is mostly able to create deep connections between his off-beat characters and the audience, but this is not the case in the Corpse Bride.None of the characters are inherently sympathetic, and the film is not nearly long enough to understand their emotions or motives on anything but the most superficial level. (I hate to make the Nightmare Before Christmas comparison, but at 76 minutes, it's actually exactly as long as tNBC. Dir. Henry Selick utilized his short time to a greater emotional level, plus the songs in that film told decisive parts of the story, which they don't in the Corpse Bride.)The style is quite appealing, but the angles, spirals, and dark alleys of Halloween Town were that much more effective because of the far more intriguing characters that inhabited it.The music and songs felt mostly forced, and I left the theater not having any of the tunes left lingering in my head.All-in-all though, the film is fine. The plot is dull, the characters are dull, the music is dull, but it is mostly captivating in the theater, simply due to the visuals. See it for the animation. And hope that Burton takes his time, and next chooses a project that relies less on looking ""spooky"", and more on simple, quality characterization.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Most Delightful Movie,"As usual, Tim Burton and Danny Elfman have hit the jackpot. If this one does not qualify for the 2006 Oscars, then I don't know what does. My family and I experienced every emotion one can feel from a movie; but most of all we left the theater smiling from ear to ear. My family cannot wait until this one comes out on DVD. We've spent the past several years watching ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" every chance we got. I'm referring everyone I know to go out and see this wonderful movie. The great thing about it is that it's not just for kids but adults will be thoroughly entertained. We took our daughter, Joi to see it in Illinois for her tenth birthday. Thanks for giving my daughter one of the best birthday's ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't expect NBC...,"Yes, I judged this one harshly. And, may I say, Tim Burton, I'm disappointed in you. Then again, perhaps it's my own fault for walking into what could be considered a kids' movie and expecting the plot not to be transparent. I had everything except for the finest details pegged within about 15 or 20 minutes. Yes, the resolution to the love triangle was nice, but I wish there'd been a little more mystery on who it would be. Some of the death puns were a little overbearing, but the spoof sequences were quite enjoyable. (I'll admit, the Gone with the Wind one got applause from this fan.) The music was quite good, but the songs were a little lacking. Overall though, I majorly *heart* Danny Elfman.In sum, my suggestion is don't walk into Corpse Bride expecting to see glory and creativity that is Nightmare Before Christmas...or even anything very close to it. While charming, The Corpse Bride is not the fine work of art it could have been. Nice try, Tim, but I expect better next time.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
'Til Death...,"Tim Burton's ""Corpse Bride"" is deceivingly titled. Though its lead character is in fact dead, ""Corpse Bride"" is inspired dark comedy and an unexpected touching love story. ""Corpse Bride"" is traditional stop action animationa very time consuming process. A lot of time was also invested in the movie's storytelling. ""Corpse Bride"" is a macabre fairy tale. Director Tim Burton is either hit or miss for me. Burton as usual is absurd and eccentric, but here he also follows a conventional fairy tale in spirit. This is largely due to the screenplay by John August, Pamela Pettler, and Caroline Thompson. Their crafted tale is funny, clever, and also in love with its characters. Burton's ""Corpse Bride"" is all hit. An almost unrecognizable Johnny Depp voices Victor Van Dort the young man who inadvertently ""marries"" the Corpse Bride (voiced by the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter). Being that they are literally from different worldsone being that of the livingtheir future is cursed, so to speak. Their believable love story ultimately makes ""Corpse Bride"" this wildly funny dark fairy tale about love and selflessness. Very cool stuff.Victor (Depp) is victim of an arranged marriage to Victoria Everglot (the very charming and strong Emily Watson) of the noble, but bankrupt Everglot family. The Van Dorts are the nouveau rich, in search of title. Hence this marriage fulfills title and wealth. Win. Win. You would think. During the rehearsal a suspicious relative Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant) arrives a day early. Even his name is unsavory. Although Victor accidentally finds his soul mate in Victoria, he can not bring himself to follow through with the rehearsal. He flees to the forest. There he professes his vows to his true love, and the Corpse Bride (Bonham Carter) accepts. They leave for the world of the deadthe catch being that Victor still has a heart beat. Victor's stay is both hysterical and just plain weird.""Corpse Bride"" does telegraph a plot point prematurely, but overall the story has a charming and touching twist. Credit its amazing voice actor talents. Johnny Depp gives Victor an innocence and strength of character that is never frivolous. Emily Watson threads the fine line as the ""other woman"". She gives Victoria great compassion and heart. This is really Helena Bonham Carter's showcase. As she voices the Corpse Bride she is initially unaffected, not realizing her fate. Then there is a visceral sadness when she comes to terms that she must go without love. She poignantly says, ""My dreams were taken from me."" So does she now take this away from someone she now loves? This really makes ""Corpse Bride"" a funny, inspired, and special movie. This is Tim Burton's best work. See ""Corpse Bride"".",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Genre-Bending Marvel,"So, how do you classify Tim Burton's Corpse Bride? It's a story about true love temporarily interrupted...so it must be a romance. It's got several original song and dance numbers...so it's a musical. It has enough puns and double entendres to make anyone laugh...so it is a comedy. It's about corpses, ghouls, and skeletons....definitely horror material. And oh yes, it's done entirely in stop-action animation, suitable for all family member, except maybe the very young.I've got it. Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is the first of a new genre--a romantic musical comedy horror animated family feature film. I wonder if the Golden Globes will create a new category.But whatever you call it, this film is a marvel. Despite a few cloying characters (the Peter Lorre maggot being one) and songs of uneven quality, this is a movie worth watching...and watching. It is a visually stunning film with an enjoyable script that is voiced perfectly by an A-list cast. To borrow a line, you should definitely keep an eye out for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Man, did I hate this movie.","In these times, 3-D animation has practically killed off 2-D. All-CGI movies flood the cinemas. But even the most realistic CGI just feels fake to me. Corpse Bride offers an alternativestop-motion animation, where hand-made puppets are photographed one frame at a time.Corpse Bride centers on Victor (Depp), on the night before his arranged marriage to a woman named Victoria. After blowing the wedding rehearsal, Victor flies to the woods to practice by himself. He puts the ring on a twig, pretending it is Victoria's finger. The twig turns out to be the decaying finger of Emily, the corpse bride (Carter), a woman who waited until her death for her fiancée.Thus, Victor accidentally marries Emily. The movie goes downhill from there, though it is boring from beginning to end. I did not give Corpse Bride this rating because I thought Nightmare was better, like I see many do. I gave the rating because the movie just plain sucks. Recently, Nightmare became popular with Hot Topic shoppers and others who only pretend their lives are miserable. Corpse Bride seems like an attempt to cash in on that demographic. Either that, or Tim Burton has forgotten how to make a movie without Gothic visuals, dark humor, and haunting music from Danny Elfman. Someone should tell Tim that he directed Pee-Wee's Big Adventure twenty years ago. Then, maybe he'll stop giving us garbage like Corpse Bride and Michael Jackson and the Chocolate Factory.Pros: -At least Johnny Depp fakes a British accent well.-Making a stop-motion animated film takes a while. Burton gets an A for effort.Cons: -Corpse Bride has a pretty bad script. At different points, Victor seems to fall in love with both brides for no reason. And in another scene, Victor inexplicably climbs up a wall just like Spider-Man.-The filmmakers fail to make Victor a protagonist I cared about, let alone like. In fact, I'll cover all the characters in this section. I saw nothing new. The filmmakers bothered not to flesh out the characters and make them interesting.-Only one running gag uses the 3-D animation well, a corpse who often splits in half vertically. That one gag does not justify the use of these puppets. It all just feels like an attempt to cash in on Nightmare fans.-Some guy sitting in front of me actually laughed at some of the other gags. I didn't laugh at all.-The aforementioned Spider-Man scene also gives Danny Elfman an excuse to recycle his music from Spider-Man. Overall, Corpse Bride seemed to recycle music from Elfman's resumé.-Same goes for the use of Nightmare's Gothic visuals. Same goes for this movie in general. Everyone just did it for the money.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Well made,"I had seen Corpse Bride as a kid back when it came out. I rewatched it after around six years, and it's still as fun and entertaining as when I first watched it. It isn't better than the more recent Coraline or 2005's Wallace and Gromit film, but it's still enjoyable with great colors and designs. How odd that Bonham Carter was in the two best animated films of 2005. Most songs are a bit forgettable, but there is one that really stuck with me, and that's the one sung when explaining what happened to the 'corpse bride'. Overall, this is definitely recommended. It's just what one would expect from Tim Burton, for better or worse for each kind of person.",,Anonymous,Animation
Tim Burton does it again!,"Wow...what can I say about this great film that hasn't already been said?

Not a gloomy place at all, actually, more lively than the Land of the Living, which is shown in dark, melancholy tones.The character depth is simply amazing!

Does everyone these days think kids are stupid?,"I had this movie figured out from almost the beginning. I know this wasn't meant to be Nightmare Before Christmas Part 2 or anything, but at least Nightmare was original and gave kids some credit. This one I guess just assumes the kids are too dumb to pick up on subtle hints. They had to make it blatant and easy to figure out.I did like the score, and it was an original idea. Danny Elfman had been on my sh*t list for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's score, but he redeemed himself with this one. I love the overabundance of harpsichord. I also think the voice casting worked.I wish there could've gone into the Underworld a little more.

The ghost of Jack Skellington hangs over this,"Am I the only one who's beginning to think that even though Tim Burton is still churning out solid entertainment, his magic touch deserted him ages ago.To be honest, I don't think he's been involved in a really spectacular film for over a decade. And this ""really spectacular film"" comes to mind when watching his latest, Corpse Bride. Because both that film and his latest are stop-motion animations.Yes, I'm talking about The Nightmare Before Christmas, that near masterwork which had some remarkable elements, including a wickedly original sense of humour, interesting characters, a well-played romance, and songs that weren't brilliant but grew on you.Barring the songs (which are unmemorable and difficult to make out) Corpse Bride has got all of those. But the storyline is less coherent. That, and the film seems more trite and sentimental. Is this because we're getting a little too used to Tim Burton's style of film-making? Or is he just becoming too methodical? Victor (Johnny Depp) is getting cold feet before his arranged marriage to Victoria (Emily Watson). Somehow, he can't even remember the vows before the big day. So he goes for a wander in the nearby forest, where he can rehearse and hopefully put things right. But just as everything seems to come together for him, a venture into the forest unearths the sinister Corpse Bride, Emily (Helena Bonham Carter).The story is told competently enough to keep you involved, and the animation is superb. At least Burton's visual gift hasn't been diminished; the production design and the faces of some of Corpse Bride's characters, especially the title character, prove that. These stop-motion figurines are voiced by a wide array of talent. Although truthfully, that means little these days; Charlie And The Chocolate Factory's gifted cast couldn't lift it above the mediocre. Fortunately, Corpse Bride is certainly more than ""mediocre""; it's guaranteed satisfaction on all levels.My problem with it is that I was personally looking for more than just mere ""satisfaction."" Perhaps I'm drawing too many comparisons to The Nightmare Before Christmas? I know this review may sound negative to you, but don't get me wrong. I did like Corpse Bride and I think you will enjoy it. I just expected more. Now, if only Burton could truly rediscover his magic touch once and for all...Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Macabre magic,"Tim Burton, the master of spooky, kooky and cute has delivered another classic that makes magic out of the macabre. If the whimsical story, derived from a Russian folk tale, doesn't charm the pants of you, the stunning puppets, sets and stop-animation imagery surely will. The vivid worlds, both above and below ground, that Burton has handcrafted are simply enchanting, and his second foray into stop-animation (the first was The Nightmare Before Christmas) further stamps his name as a leading artist in this medium. Corpse Bride follows the unexpected journey of groom-to-be Victor Van Dort (voiced by Johnny Depp), who is spirited away to the underworld on the eve of his wedding when he unintentionally betroths himself to a dead bride. Ever since she was mysteriously murdered on her wedding night, the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) has waited, heartbroken, for her groom to come and claim her. Victor unwittingly becomes that man while practising his wedding vows in the forest and is dragged down to the land of the dead. He tries in vain to find his way back to Victoria, but his late bride is determined to make him honour the bond of their unholy matrimony, and isn't going to make it easy. The film is peppered with cute one-liners (""People are dying to get in"", one of the dearly departed says to another at one point) and sight gags (""Is it my eye?,"" the heartbroken bride asks her bewildered husband as it is popped out by a roguish maggot), and the subtle touches of adult humour are brilliant. Burton has managed to make the most unlikely, adorable  even the aforementioned eye-popping maggot, and given the afterlife an entirely new image  in Burton's land of the dead, the pubs never close and the corpses are more lively than anything you see up in the world above. Spectacular song and dance numbers complete this deliciously dark treat that will delight film goers of all ages. Take my word, you will be dying to see this one again!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Giant Leap,"Tim Burton is a master. The direction in this film is brilliant. Some of the shots he achieved are just unbelievable and the character design is remarkable! There were moments when I had to force myself to remember that I wasn't watching actors. The stop-motion processes have become so much more fluid and human than they were in ""Nightmare Before Christmas."" I'm still puzzled over how they managed to get those puppets to do some of the things they did. This film represents a giant leap for stop-motion. I'm incredibly excited to see what Burton does next with the medium.Story-wise, there wasn't too much new ground made. Burton's fascination with ""the outsider"" is further explored here but there's not a lot in the way of new insights.Some people have complained that the film is too short. I think that feeling arises because the film is so visually amazing that you can't help but want to see more. 90 minutes is still the average length of a film. I guess we've been spoiled by some really excellent films that are a bit longer in the past few years.Danny Elfman's music is excellent again, but it's not his best work. The songs are not going become as unforgettable as those from ""Nightmare"" which, I think, will probably always be Burton's stop-motion masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie wishes it could be The Nightmare Before Christmas.,"There can be no doubt about it: this movie made a conscious attempt to recapture the magic of The Nightmare Before Christmas. But it is a failure. The charm, the charisma, the sprightly feel, the memorable characters, the catchy songs, the very soul is missing.Victor, the hero, is largely to blame. Or rather, Tim Burton is to blame for writing him. Jack Skellington was a fantastic character. He exuded charisma. Victor is a spineless little wimp. I can't count the times I wanted him to be a man and stick up for himself; to do the obvious things he needed to do to win out. But instead he was a passive vessel for everyone's abuse. He is a terrible heart for this film. And when he enters the world of the dead, his introduction, ""Remains Of The Day,"" finds him constantly freaked out and scared by his strange surroundings. The movie shouts, ""This is weird and creepy! Doesn't it make you feel uncomfortable? That means we're doing it right!"" But of course, after The Nightmare Before Christmas, this world isn't so weird or unfamiliar. We've seen a similar place before. And a better move would have been to show Victor becoming comfortable in this strange world. Remember how ""This Is Halloween"" invited you into the macabre and bizarre Halloween Town and made you feel comfortable in that fantastic place? Wasn't that a cool feeling? Wouldn't it have been great if your point of entry to the world of the dead wasn't such a spineless ninny?And now to another flaw that sinks this film: the songs. It's Danny Elfman, of course, teaming up with Tim Burton in the usual way. But this collaboration doesn't have the magic of the Nightmare Before Christmas score. In fact, it feels totally phoned-in. The opening song, ""According to Plan,"" is such a boring piece of exposition with such un-engaging and workman-like lyrics! ""Assuming nothing happens that we don't really know,/That nothing unexpected interferes with the show./And that's why everything, every last little thing,/Every single tiny microscopic little thing must go/According to plan."" These are lines for a Greek chorus, not for characters who have names! We see this problem in other songs, like ""Remains of the Day"" and ""Tears to Shed."" In The Nightmare Before Christmas, the songs contributed to the flow of the piece. It was comparable to The Wizard of Oz. Here they just slow things down and call attention to themselves.Sure, it's pretty to look at, but the first consideration, the script, was a weak foundation, and the flaws keep this film below the level of simple goodness, hence 5 out of 10 stars. Perhaps Tim Burton should have had Henry Selick direct again. Certainly he should have had the script rewritten and sent Danny Elfman back to the drawing board. The whole thing is an exercise without passion or inspiration. And not to be a formula nazi, but the film needed a third act. It didn't so much end as stop.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Fantastic Movie by Tim Burton,"In 1993, writer/director Tim Burton brought to the big screen the world's first full-length stop motion animated film, the Nightmare Before Christmas. Both critics and audiences around the world loved the movie. It is apparent that, in modern film-making, computer animation has become the popular animation style among filmmakers, and with it comes horrible movies like Robots and Shark Tale. It seemed as if the great method of shooting miniature models frame by frame, moving them just a little in between each shot, to give the impression of movement had been eliminated from the big screen. Luckily, Tim Burton is still around and still making films. Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is the most visually astounding and emotionally touching movie of the year. Featuring the voice talents of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Albert Finney, and Christopher Lee, with music written and composed by Danny Elfman. The Oscar for best-animated film of 2005 belongs in only one place, in Tim Burton's hands.Set in 19th century England, the film begins with Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) and his parents (Paul Whitehouse, Tracy Ulman) on a way to a wedding rehearsal for him and Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson), his planned to be future wife, the daughter of a loveless rich couple (Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney) who is quickly losing their riches. Victor completely botches the rehearsal and is instructed by Pastor Galswells (Christopher Lee) to learn his vows. He wanders off into the forest and begins practicing. After failing repeatedly, he manages to recite his lines perfectly, using the surrounding environment as props. For the final line, he drops down onto his knees, places his ring on the roots of the nearby oak tree sticking out of the ground, and says, ""I ask you to be mine."" As the crows caw above, and the wind begins to pick up, Victor's arm is pulled into the ground, and he learns the terrifying truth. He had not put his ring onto the roots of a tree, but onto the bones of a dead woman's arm. He watches the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) emerge from the ground, accepting Victor's marriage proposal. She brings Victor back to the land of the dead, where the dead are more alive than the living. As Victor tries to explain to the Corpse Bride that their marriage was nothing but a ""grave misunderstanding"", Victoria attempts to find a way to help him back in the land of the living.What truly makes the movie great is not the brief comedic moments, or intense action scenes (which it had none of). What makes this movie great is the characters. The conflicts presented between them, their emotions, their struggles, its all presented almost perfectly in this movie. The way Victor is caught between a living woman that he feels he must be with at all times, and a dead woman that he cannot bare to see unhappy and alone. Its just so believable and will actually make many viewers feel sad and depressed, especially at the very end. This sad and depressed feeling is aided by an amazing score by Danny Elfman. The score throughout the movie really captures the mood and setting. Right from the beginning, with a song that expresses the joy of the Van Dort family, and the anger, sadness, and frustration of the Everglots, all the way to the depressing score at the very end that expresses Emily's feelings. The characters and Danny Elfman's score is what truly makes this movie great. It actually had me feeling bad at several moments, which usually never happens.If there is anything about the movie that brings it down, it is the fact that it is way too short. Because its stop motion animation and it takes about a whole week to shoot only one minute of film, the movie only comes to a total of 76 minutes in length. There is one major casualty because of this, and its not Victor or Emily, its Victoria. So much of the story is based around Victor and his problem, that Victoria only gets a few entrances every once in a while, and this makes people dislike Victoria. We do not get to see what kind of personality she has, her talents, and any kind of similarity she shares with Victor. This makes a lot of people not care for her. If the movie could have gone about 20 minutes longer, they could have spent a little more time building the relationship of Victor and Victoria, but that would require a few more months of filming. Despite this little problem, the rest of the movie is beautiful. The visuals, the score, the acting, the directing, the story, all of them top notch.As far as animated films go, the Corpse Bride is one of the best. Better than Tim's first stop motion film, Nightmare Before Christmas, better than Disney's Lion King, better than Brad Bird's The Incredibles, and better than Wallace and Gromit. As far as emotionally touching movies go, this one really gets the job done. The kids can enjoy the childish humor while the teens and adults can enjoy the adult humor, and situations. So sit down and enjoy one of the best movies of the year. The movie that deserves the best-animated film of 2005 award.Overall = 10/10Favorite Scene = (Spoiler) It is truthfully impossible for me to pick a favorite scene. The whole movie is good. The best parts though, are just about all the scenes with Victor and Emily together. Especially the scene when they go back into the land of the living where Emily begins gliding around the trees, around Victor, humming quietly at the same time, and the scene when Victor attempts to work things out with Emily after telling her that he would never marry her. While trying to explain things to her, he begins playing the piano with her in a nice duet.",,Anonymous,Animation
"When it's a good director, it's a crappy movie.","This movie is basically a Nightmare Before Christmas spin-off, and is no where near as good.The songs are poorly sung, and the lyrics are written poorly. The characters are not as lovable, but I will say that the animation has improved.But this still does not excuse the fact that it is just an okay movie. It's not worth buying on DVD when it comes out, but it IS worth renting.Although it is not much more than a spin-off, it will entertain you and your family. It's just worth seeing, not buying.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Romantic Masterpiece,"I had gone in to see Tim Burton's Corpse Bride with high expectations. His previous Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) was a great film, and added that I had read a countless amount of reviews from both critics and moviegoers alike, saying only wonderful things about this movie. Also, I am a huge Burton fan, and have learned to expect the unexpected when it comes to his work. He's never let me down before, so I had no reason to doubt The Bride.And I must say, Tim's done it again.The Corpse Bride weaves the tale of Victor Van Dort and his interesting journey through two worlds. As the story opens, we meet fortune-less Mr. and Mrs. Van Dort, who wish to marry their son off to the daughter of aristocrats Lord and Lady Everglot in order to pump up their social status. The Everglots, as we learn later, are not wealthy at all, in fact. Because of this, they are slightly perturbed that their daughter Victoria is going to be wed to a family of such low rank on the social ladder. The nervous Victor had elongated the wedding rehearsal for three hours on account of not remembering the vows. In a comic scene, we see him trying to do everything right, but either his candle doesn't light, he knocks into the table, or he completely forgets what to say. Everyone becomes obviously frustrated, and flustered Victor leaves. He walks through the woods for an apparently long while, desperately trying to get his lines right. Finally, he recites them correctly, and places the ring on a supposed tree root. His moment of contentment is short-lived, as the tree root grabs him and the figure of a woman in wedding garb rises out the ground. He has, in fact, accidentally wed himself to the Corpse Bride. Victor, in fear, flees out of the woods, but to no avail. The mysterious corpse catches him, and brings him to the underworld, which is depicted as a snazzy, funky-colored, lively and entertaining place, much unlike the ""upstairs"", which is gray, bleak, bland, and boring- much like the people in it. Once in the land of the dead, we are entertained by a jazz number telling the story of the Bride, that leaves Victor quite confused, or slightly amused...it's hard to tell. The story continues on, with Victor's desperate attempt to see Victoria and escape this obsessive corpse. Eventually, though, a decision has to be made: Will Victor remain in the wondrously upbeat land of the dead, with this charming and beautiful, yet strange and mysterious, corpse bride...or will he return home to the one shaded land of the living, to be with the sweet Victoria, whom he has come to love?The Bride is a beautiful movie that grabs the audience and pulls them in, and doesn't let go until the very end. The animation is pure magic, stunning in every way. The stop-motion technique, especially in this movie, made it all the more a visual delight. At some point, you seem to forget that these are just foot-tall silicone encased puppets being moved by people. It feels like you're right there, in the movie. How many other animated movies can do that? Not many.It's all thanks to Tim's unique vision, and the way he sees things. The look and feel of this movie is classic Tim Burton, with an unusually romantic twist. But the breath-taking visuals is just one part of what makes this movie so grand. It's funny, charming, sweet, and heart-wrenching. A top-notch cast gives a superb performance, one that leaves you feeling the emotions. The story itself, (although including dead and decaying corpses acting very much alive and functioning), just seems so real. It is wonderfully romantic. The leading characters have such human-like qualities and flaws, which you don't normally see in other animated movies. The story is unique and beautiful, and very believable.At a short and sweet seventy-six minutes, The Bride delivers all that's expected, and even more. This movie is definitely up there with Tim's greats, and is sure to entertain audiences for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Animation that is death-defying,"Victor Van Dort(Johnny Depp) is to be wed to the prestigious Victoria Everglot due to almost certain bankruptcy of the once rich Everglots. After having been ridiculed for forgetting his vows, Victor panics and accidentally be weds a corpse who's finger was thought to be a twig. A confused Victor falls in love with both women and has to decide against the two.Tim Burton has never made a movie I did not find entertaining and this is no exception. It was quite entertaining and moderately funny for a kids movie although it was the animation that astounded me. Using the same type of animation used in The Nightmare Before Christmas was absolutely brilliant on Burton's part. Overall, the movie was an above average comedy that can be admired for its great animation.I recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Art over substance,"Another Tim Burton's ""classic"", that I've watched recently. I am really starting to see that opinion about him being overhyped may, indeed, have some ground.Don't get me wrong, this is not necessarily a bad movie. It certainly has amazing character design, overall art style and its... Let's call it ""action"" is overall well staged. But I think that's all there is to the movie, really. Meaning, that the story being told is kind of shallow. It is well structured, yes, but when you think really hard about it, it is somewhat nonsense. In a way it kind of plays into the art style, of course, but I simply do not believe the ""love theme"" here.I think there are 3 ""loves"" here: Emily and her killer, Emily and Victor, Victoria and Victor. None of them showed any signs of real love. Relationship between Emily and her killer is not really shown even. Emily's affection towards Victor is out of loneliness, Victor's affection towards Emily is out of pure defeatism. Victoria's and Victor's affections towards each other is more like ""I'm rolling with the punches, but the guy/gal seems quite intriguing, so why not?"". Personally, I can't feel for any of them here.Nevertheless, this is a fun watch. It probably could have been better, if it was extra 30 minutes longer and explored the pseudo-love, but, it is what it is.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Good Second Attempt,"The setting is a 19th century cobblestone town, and the story begins with a hateful couple living in a ghastly mansion, once luxurious, but decrepit from years of dwindling funds. They intend to marry off their daughter Victoria (Emily Watson) to a rich family and restore their family's former glory. Thus, Victor (Johnny Depp) meets Victoria and love blooms. Clumsy with his vows, Victor wanders off into the forest only to accidentally marry a corpse (Helena Bonham Carter). Great fun ensues. A co-directorial effort by Tim Burton and Mike Johnson, The Corpse Bride draws various similarities to 1993's The Nightmare Before Christmas due to the use of stop-motion animation and Burton's involvement in the creative process. These comparisons are unfortunate, as The Corpse Bride is a much different film altogether. The story and content is much more accessible to a wide audience, but it may be argued that the art and music lags slightly behind its spiritual predecessor.Tim Burton is no newcomer to the stop-motion animated forum. Whilst Nightmare was directed by Henry Selick, Burton has had a long history of interest in this realm of animated film. As such, The Corpse Bride is the most perfected of the genre; a little piece of trivia floating around has indicated it took animators twenty-eight shots to make the character's blink. The careful attention to detail and intensity of the work of the animator's pays off in a big way; Corpse Bride is a fully immersive world where character's move smoothly and colors expertly blend together. Some of the character designs, especially in the world of the dead, are comedic: one such being General Bonesapart (Deep Roy), a skeletal image of the historic figure with a blade through his chest. Characters in the real world have accentuated features, such as a depressed face or baggy eyes, portraying the town as a tired place suffering from boredom.Perhaps an error made with The Corpse Bride was in making it partly a musical as well. The combination worked expertly for Nightmare Before Christmas, which boasts some of the finest examples of animated themes in history. However, apart from a melodic and haunting tune from the Corpse Bride, the music never really engages in the film. Even the singing seemed muddled at parts, making it hard to follow along with the seemingly clever words. Having omitted the musical portions, the feature may have benefited from a few more scenes in the land of the dead, which never came to life quite as convincingly as Halloweentown. What is left are wonderfully composed piano pieces by Danny Elfman, and a hauntingly beautiful story that only Tim Burton could craft on screen. When viewers can feel pity for a rotting corpse with an eye that falls and uncovers a green maggot who talks, then that is quite a feat in itself. (7/10 Good)",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Emotional, Frightening, and Beautiful at the same time!","Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors (why, Batman and Beetlejuice are on my list of top ten favorite movies). And this movie can show how great a director Tim can be. Sure, a lot of his stuff nowadays is either considered meh or bad, but this film is probably one of Tim's best to recently come out.This movie actually came out the same year I was born (Same with Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit)! And I'm actually glad that this movie came out. The animation is incredible, the actors did an amazing job (even Johnny Depp, who likes this movie better than Edward Scissorhands), and the music is beautiful! The story is so incredible, and the idea that the living are dead, soulless people and the dead are bright, colorful, and upbeat corpses is a great contrast, as one would think the opposite!This movie is definitely one of Tim's most underrated, and one of the movies that I will aways watch in October (same with Beetlejuice and The Nightmare Before Christmas). If you haven't seen the movie, you should watch it!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great Burton movie for 2005,"sigh...its nice to see him back in form! Though its vintage recycled Burton material, i have to say I very very much enjoyed it. As a monster Burton fan I have to say I was very letdown and disappointed with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and I thought his best stuff was long behind us. This time NO ONE booed the film. Burton, Depp,Carter, and Elfman actually produced something here this time. It was like seeing the old Beetlejuice cartoons over again and remind you why you like the man's films so much (even though he didn't have too much to do with the cartoons). I'm glad to say I will actually get this one on DVD, continue to be the fan I was since the late 80s, and enjoy cinema in the way I did as a child growing up. And JUST because everyone is comparing it to NightmareBeforeChristmas...I will say I like this one better (settle down... NBC was a good Burton flick too). hehehe. Nice to see him back and redeem himself.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Corpse Bride: Beautiful, if faltering","The film is beautiful. Many visuals done to positively stunning effect. The characters and ideas set in perfect motion, both literally and as regards dialogue.... ....and then the worm starts singing.There are elements here of the grand old Burton, and you can't help enjoying the gallows humor; this is a funny, joyful romp. It's also very predictable, and contains the usual Tim Burton cheap-shots at family and religion (you'd swear he'd been injured rather than pampered as a child).I will neglect to give away any element of the film (singing worm excluded), but I should say this...once a certain point is reached, some things go awry, and not for our hero, Vincent. The script begins to love itself too much, and a fantastic idea begins to waver. The songs seem to turn a little sappy, and with the exception that the dead are involved, you'd almost think you were watching the Hallmark Channel. One cannot say there is no spark in the production's second half, but it feels a bit forced; almost mechanical. The ending, I shall only say, left me a little flat. I was looking for a bigger ""kaboom,"" as Marvin the Martian might say. For most directors, I would have hardly noticed, but Burton's creative genius is usually matched by a certain level of punch. That panache comes and goes in ""Corpse Bride,"" whispering in and out like a wind.But let me not denigrate this to an extreme; the film is playful, colorful and all-over an enjoyable second-helping to ""Nightmare"" fans, even if it falls short of its predecessor.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Interesting concepts bogged down by a dull script and story,"Although at times it can be sweet and amusing, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is ultimately robbed of its potential, by relying on tedious and often formulaic storytelling- and its vast dull nature to carry it. The film stars Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter as Victor and the Corpse Bride herself. Both of them give rather decent voice performances, but unfortunately their work in the film is ultimately undermined by the film itself. Simply said, the film is rather a bore, and its dull nature and grim color pallet does nothing to help that fact. The film lacks much excitement at all, and at times, it just feels dead (pun intended). The film can be a bit amusing at times, and even romantic too, but it squanders the potential of all these interesting concepts, plotlines, and ideas by such a boring story and such tedious situations. In the end, Corpse Bride has some decent moments, but ultimately fails to stay together.

Where there's an light that burns brighter...,"Life is dull and oppressive, cast in washed out grays and blues by Tim Burton in THE CORPSE BRIDE. Reminiscent of Burton's BEETLEJUICE, the life of the living pales (literally and figuratively) in comparison to the land of the dead.Victor (Depp) is thrust into the latter by serendipitous calamity, where bebop skeletons jive among eclectic backgrounds painted in vibrant colors. It is these lush visuals that carry the weight of the film, filling the screen from corner to corner. Also outstanding is the voice acting. Albert Finney's gruff voice is wonderfully befitting of the stout, scowling character it is attached to, and Emily Watson is a good choice to convey wholesome daintiness (notice that her cheeks are the only thing in the living world with color, a cheesy but cute allusion to the 'thing that makes life worth living'). I wonder if Richard E. Grant was cast because of the script's homage to HOW TO GET A HEAD IN ADVERTISING (1986). There are certainly similarities between the Peter Lorre worm rambling in the eponymous character's skull and the talking boil that drives Mr. Grant mad in How To Get A Head.The basic plot is clever and endearing, and the characters are all solid, if somewhat limited at times. The primary fault I found with this film is that it doesn't approach the glory of THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISMAS, a true classic. The bebop skeleton number is great, but on the whole the songs aren't as good as in The Nightmare. Neither are the characters, the story, the pace or the animation for that matter, perhaps only the voice acting here surpasses its predecessor. That doesn't make this a substandard film though, THE CORPSE BRIDE is very entertaining, and a must see for fans of NIGHTMARE, BEETLEJUICE and Burton in general, but do not expect it to eclipse those prior works.7/10* RECOMMENDED...Very entertaining, missing something though",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Burton returns to what makes him work best...,"In a nutshell, Burton works best when he is at his mildly weirdest. For all seventy-four minutes of The Corpse Bride, we get the Tim Burton who made such gems as Ed Wood or Beetlejuice, as opposed to the Tim Burton who made such unmemorable pieces as the 2002 Planet Of The Apes or Big Fish. In essence, The Corpse Bride is Burton simply being Burton, rather than a big studio filtering Burton through their lens. It is far from perfect, but it is a charming little piece that is really on fire when it works. Much like Ed Wood, Burton brings back a core cast to provide voices for his stop-motion creatures. Some of the voices, such as Tracey Ullman or Jane Horrocks, hardly have any distinction. Others, such as Christopher Lee and Johnny Depp, remind you why Burton chose to work with them in the first place. In fact, it is Christopher Lee's voice acting that steals the show during most of this piece. When his ridiculously-shaped character is present, one almost salivates in anticipation of his next statement. For certain, this is one of Tim Burton's most satisfying creations.The stop-motion animation is also brilliant, although one has to wonder if the painstaking work done to achieve it was worth the result. Sure, these puppets move so subtly that one could mistake them for real actors if not for their ridiculous body shapes. Observant viewers will note the use of stop-motion legend Ray Harryhausen's name on a piano, but I think that Harryhausen would look at this piece and wonder if maybe just a little too much effort is involved. On the other hand, compared to the so-called ultra-realistic effects of such films as the recent Star Wars episodes or Final Fantasy, perhaps the obvious fakery combined with the smooth and strangely lifelike motion has its own peculiar charm. In that sense, Burton's greatest charm, his ability to mix the absurd and unreal with a grounding in reality, is what makes The Corpse Bride work. The film is a delight to look at, one more than just one level. The attention to detail in the backgrounds of some scenes alone is breathtaking.Sadly, the weakness of The Corpse Bride is in its soundtrack, and to some extent its story. I do not know whether this was partly the fault of the theatre I saw it in, which gets worse every week, but critical moments such as when we learn how the Corpse Bride became a corpse in the first place were almost indecipherable. Were it not for an exceedingly obvious plot and some pre-release hype, I would have had no idea exactly what drives the Bride to so doggedly pursue Depp's character. The Van Dorts and the Everglots are about as deep as a puddle, and Barkis Bittern only exists to give the audience something to sneer at. Fortunately, Burton is also wise enough to give this character the send-off that he anticipated the entire audience would be chanting for by the time the film finished. But aside from Victor Van Dort and the Corpse Bride, we know about as much about every single character in the story by the end of the film as we did at the beginning. It is this absence of dimensions that scuttled both Planet Of The Apes and to a large extent Sleepy Hollow.However, if Tim Burton manages to control his propensity to create shallow characters, he could potentially reach even greater heights than his biopic of Ed Wood. His scene composition and design are beyond reproach. He must also be given credit for occasionally turning to the kind of subject matter that Hollywood would not normally dare touch. It is he who gave us back a Batman who gave a reason for doing what he does other than the opportunity to nance around in a funny suit, after all. Helena Bonham Carter should also be reminded that this is easily her most non-mainstream role since Fight Club, and not coincidentally, also her best. Johnny Depp proves that apart from providing a distinctive or memorable leading man (he doesn't here), he can also be depended upon to put in a solid performance. Anyone who is familiar with Burton's dramatic leanings will have no trouble guessing who Victor Van Dort is meant to be a proxy for. That Depp restrains his urge to make his presence felt in order to fit the wider dramatic picture is a true credit to him. And the animators, of course.Out of ten, I gave The Corpse Bride an eight. It is not Burton's best work, nor is it the most compelling film I have ever seen. What it is, on the other hand, is a walk through the imagination of a non-standard man that manages to be entertaining and charming as it is also puzzling. And I know I will not be the only one to say that Hollywood needs to make more of those films.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best family movie about necrophilia ever...,"""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride"" isn't as good as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" but in its defence it isn't a retread. Apart from the whole Rankin/Bass special on acid thing, which is in no way a criticism.This quasi-musical-comedy-horror tale of a betrothed man accidentally married to a corpse gets off to a somewhat stodgy start as it gets its somewhat slim story underway - it might have been suited more for a short story than a movie - and although leaving most of its cast for the movie's credits rather than the posters, even in Britain, is a welcome move (because it gives the movie itself the centre stage, not the cast), it has to be said that Johnny Depp is almost bland as the voice of Victor; maybe it might have helped if he sang. Also, the visual trick of having the world of the living be just one tone away from being black and white and the world of the dead in full, vibrant colour wears thin before the end, although that's just about the only thing about the visuals that doesn't.But as the tale moves along it gets both funnier and more involving, with Danny Elfman's variable songs (as the voice of Bonejangles, he gets the best one) made up for by his own familiar but still effective score; the movie might not have much story, but it also doesn't overstay its welcome... which, given that the ultimate revelation about Barkis (an excellent Richard E. Grant) isn't much of a revelation at all, is probably just as well. With terrific stop-motion animation throughout to boot and a great wedding finale (though I won't give away who gets hitched), this movie may not be for everyone, but it's ultimately a delight.Ironically for a movie where nearly everyone is dead, this is full of life.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Atmospheric Parody of Tim Burton's Most Detailed Perceptions of People and Things,"Tim Burton's films are cultivated by the same halfway goth preteens that melt over Johnny Depp, and the feeling of the multiplex theater crowded with them on a late Friday or Saturday night with your own dynamic yet passive group of friends is felt through Corpse Bride even while one sits at home and watches it on a DVD rented from the public library. If Burton has fallen off in recent years with Sleepy Hollow, Planet of the Apes, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you must admit that there is still an atmosphere such as the one above mentioned in his more recent and continuing films. Whatever he does to carve and style his work for each generation's wave of odd but commercially compelling target audience is a great talent for subtlety.While it isn't something very special that will stay with me much later, Corpse Bride is a film of Burton's I've truly liked after awhile not having made movies on the same wavelength as Ed Wood, which I adore. In Corpse Bride, the virtuously atmospheric clay animation is the outcome of Burton's very specific, meticulous, and imaginatively analytical ideas and artistic demands. The animation is able to depict parodies of his most detailed perceptions of people and things, and the clay element gives the film a very Gothic look which is his trademark. I was also surprised by the wonderful impact of the emotional finale.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Filled with the trademark visual plethora to expect from Burton, with the laughs, very good movie","Although I might not say Corpse Bride is a great film on the level of Nightmare Before Christmas (there are some things involved with the characters of Corpse Bride that aren't as realized as in Nightmare, and the songs aren't as instantly classic, arguable I'm sure), I would not tell you not see this film if you are the least bit a fan of Tim Burton's work or of his previous stop-motion film. This time the story brings a torn to-be married gent named Victor (Johnny Depp voices, thankfully not too recognizable) who is in that uncomfortable point as in other movies where he can't take having to marry someone he barely knows, Victoria (Emily Watson), and her money-hungry parents. So, as a lark, he places his engagement ring on a tree, and within a minute he's taken down unwittingly to the land of the dead- as the corpse bride's husband. Things get complicated then within this sort of quasi love triangle, where the terrific horror clichés (and others) of old lay the framework for a really sweet, neo-classical love story.For the sheer visual marvels that Burton, co-director Mike Johnson, and their genius team (creating more than 100 MILLION frames for each second of animated film), it gets a high recommendation from me. Any reservations I have at all with the film (as I said, not as strong character connections, in particular Victor doesn't hold up like Jack Skellington did with inner conflicts) should not be held too much in comparison with the previous effort from the director. Much of the humor that is brought into the film, which involves about a couple of dozen (at least) puns and gags at old horror films (dancing skeletons and a Peter Lorre inspired earthworm give it two or three points out of the ten automatically), is key and makes the film's more serious elements some balance. It would be one thing if this was all romantic melodrama, but by making it also a sly comedy of (un-dead) manners, it doesn't sell anybody short seeing the film.Kids (maybe not the wee little ones, like 5 and up) will love the wildness of the film, of the kind of awe that Burton tries to bring out in most of his films; adults will find the gags and some punchlines very funny, and there is one animated song/sequence- I forget it's name but it involves the multiple skeletons, the second song in the film- that ranks up there with 'Pink Elephants' in Dumbo for creating such an array of wonders that it practically doesn't matter what the characters are singing about. At the least, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is a complete triumph of style (not quite) over substance, and at best it delivers more for the eye than any other animated film has this year.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A nightmare before Christmas...,"This is not really very good at all. I don't understand all these rave reviews. What went wrong? A Nightmare before Christmas is funny; has great music - also by Danny Elfman I believe; the story is delightfully subversive and the animation brilliant.Let's begin with the good news. The animation in Corpse Bride remains excellent. Particularly the use of highly chromatic grading in the ""dead world"" contrasting deathly grading in the living world.In every other respect it is ponderous (in the extreme) in fact I fell asleep. Maybe I was just tired. Maybe it was just plain dull. Maybe both.But the truth is the story is no more than a tissue (it might have made a nice short) and the gags mostly lame and you could see them coming a mile off.Danny Elfman surely trotted this one off in his lunch hour. Possibly his worst soundtrack ever and in any case there wasn't that much for him to do.It's funny because the new Wallace and Gromit's a bit overrated too (but a lot more entertaining and far better scripted than this.)

"A pleasure to the eyes and ears, but about as lively as a corpse","""Corpse Bride"" is a film by Tim Burton, who made most of his fans by impressing them with ""Nightmare before Christmas."" So, to put some extra cash in his pocket, he came out with ""The Corpse Bride."" Like most Burton films, ""Corpse Bride"" stars Johnny Depp. This time, he plays Victor, a soon-to-be husband of Victoria. Of course, he comes from a rich family, and the parents are making him marry for money. However, he can't quite master the wedding ritual. Instead of simply saying ""I do"" the ritual is long and quite difficult to remember. Anyways, while Victor is practicing the ritual in the woods, he slips the ring onto what he thinks is a stick, but it's actuallythe corpse bride! So, they get married, and Victor tries to find a way out of it.This film was a lot like Burton's previous work ""Nightmare before Christmas."" Here are some similarities:The main character is male and regrets something. Jack (""Nightmare"") is tired of celebrating Halloween over and over, while Victor is ashamed he can't do the wedding properly.Both main characters have a pet dog that happens to be dead.-Both are in love with/going to be married to a disobedient daughter who often escapes out of her room.-The song with the spider and the worm sounded very similar to one of the ""Nightmare before Christmas"" songs.-Both have dead people, clay animation and music.The visual and sound is stunning. The stop-motion animation was excellently used, and one of the best parts of the movie. The living and dead are almost vice-versa, because the living world is boring and the dead world is colorful. The sound is excellent. The songs are reduced to about three, but they sound pretty good.But, that's the flaw. The main reason I enjoyed ""Nightmare"" was the music. I remember singing some of the songs by the time the film was over. This one had about three songs, and was lacking any background music when needed. Remember that this was supposed to appeal to ""Nightmare before Christmas"" fans? Well, I don't know why people would like it as much if it had no music.Music is what brought the dead to life, and what made the film fun. ""Corpse Bride"" looks slow and short, and tries to fill in the little story it has into 80 minutes. It started in the boring living world and never seemed to get away from it.Good: Visuals, some good songs (even if there are only a few), funny at timesBad: Only a few good songs, seemed boring, similar to ""Nightmare before Christmas""Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",,Anonymous,Animation
Depp and his stiffy.,"The plot here is definitely secondary to the stylistic value of this animated film, but I'll give an explanation anyway. Johnny Depp's Victor Van Dort is a hapless, affable though well-intentioned young man who is being co-erced into an arranged marriage by his parents to Emily Watson's Victoria Everglot. Victor and Victoria meet accidentally and it's a joining of kindred spirits (pardon the pun) so they are keen for the marriage to go ahead despite the bullying from their respective parents.The marriage rehearsal does not go well, however, and Victor is forced to promise to get his vows perfect before the big day. And, as all good plans in spooky films go, a late night stroll through the woods is in order. The climax of Victor's finally perfect speech sees him place the wedding ring jubilantly on a twig - a twig that's shaped strangely like a skeletal human hand.The earth shakes and up rises Helena Bonham Carter's Corpse Bride: she's blue, she's half skeleton, she died in mysterious circumstances, and she also believes Victor's vows to be sincere. A curse made in her grave takes effect... Victor and the Corpse Bride are man and wife. This is when the fun starts.Burton's films are so striking in their visuality that there's never any doubt you're watching one of his films. Corpse Bride is no exception; the whole film is a feast for the eyes and the senses. The set pieces during the musical numbers are outstanding and some of the characters' body shapes are mildly disturbing (in a good way). Depp and Bonham Carter are endearing in their roles, particularly Depp - you'd be hard pressed to guess the shy, bumbling Victor is voiced by a movie legend, and Bonham Carter even gets to sing a little. I wonder, did they record their dialogue, along with Deep Roy (who played the Oompa Loompas in Charlie...) during a lunch break whilst filming Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?Of course, as with most films, there are some minor disappointments in Corpse Bride. The plot is somewhat clichéd and predictable. It also finishes rather abruptly. There are some extremely child-friendly characters, namely the Maggot and the Black Widow Spider which seem only to be there for mild amusement (extremely mild from where I was sitting). And whilst the set pieces leave nothing to be desired, the songs and lyrics leave a lot.As for whether Corpse Bride matches Nightmare Before Christmas, Burton's other full-length animation, I'd say it falls fairly short. Corpse Bride is more mainstream and less likely to attract a cult status due to its child-friendly aspects and missed opportunities for spookiness. I felt Burton et al could have got away with a lot more with its PG rating; for a Halloween film the spook-meter is very low.Overall, Corpse Bride is a must-see for existing fans of Burton. For new fans, it's more of a gentle introduction to his style of spooky animation than his previous works. Watch it if you fancy something a little different.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
What's this? What's this? Why it's completely new!      Corpse Bride is a new classic,"What a summer for Tim! First Charlie, and now Corpse Bride! I got to see the showing yesterday at the Toronto Film Festival, and I loved every second of it! The worlds Burton has created are once again visually distinct and complete. The ""Land of the Living"" is familiar, the art design is classic Burton, with harsh lines, and almost no colour. The ""Land of the Dead"", however, is Halloween Town on acid. The neon colours, catchy music, and unforgettable characters evoke memories of Burton's earliest films like Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice. The stop motion animation builds on the achievements of Nightmare, and at some points you have to remind yourself that you're watching an animated film. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with one aspect of the film. I feel that there weren't enough songs. The ones in the film were so fantastic, you will wish there were more. And the puppets preform them with the flare and spectacle they deserve. Danny Elfman's character Bonejangles is definitely a highlight. Overall, the film was amazing. Some people may say Nightmare is better, but they aren't being truthful. I will always have a special place in my heart for nightmare, but Corpse Bride does everything I loved about Nightmare, but adds real emotional depth and new characters to love. In conclusion, Burton most definitely rose to the occasion",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cautious thumbs up.,"Well thought, very entertaining picture, done much the same way as Burton's smash, Nighhtmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride will get applause everywhere it's watched. If there's a movie Tim's directed that hasn't been critically acclaimed, let me know. Get ready for music, wit, charm but ... and it's a big but, be also prepared for spiders, maggots and a serious storyline that might leave people scratching their heads at the end.A musical opens the movie explaining the son of a rich merchant family and the daughter of high class paupers are arranging to marry off their kids to save themselves. Victor and Victoria seem fine with each other, but after a botched rehearsal the groom to be practices his vows to a tree stump, only for it to accept them in the form of a corpse in a wedding gown.I enjoyed the characters in Corpse Bride. There is a kind of realism on how Emily and Victoria relate to Victor, and each other, that keep the movie going. That's not to dismiss the dead, all of whom own the movie, which I guess is the dramatic irony throughout the Corpse Bride: the afterlife is bursting with more liveliness than the living! Burton however, takes the Corpse Bride much more seriously than I would have expected, reminding us that Emily's ending was, and would, as bittersweet as the movie itself. I was thoroughly entertained, but aside from those determined to see the movie anyway, I would not know who to recommend the movie to.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Burton masterpiece,"Burton strikes gold again with his newest stop-motion animated film ""The Corpse Bride."" The animation, along the lines of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", is simply gorgeous, capturing the Gothic fairy tale perfectly. The design of all the characters, from the bony Victor, played by Johnny Depp, to the score of undead which fill the after life is simply amazing. The score, composed by Danny Elfman, a regular to Burton films, is top notch. The piano pieces are definitely my favorite part of the entire movie, and help to portray the dark feeling of the film along with the large Broadway like singing portions which made ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" famous. Finally I'm sure you are now wondering about the most important part of the entire film, the story. This is classic Gothic romantic at its best. Burton manages to combine the themes of love and death perfectly, taking this to the level of his previous successes like ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and ""Big Fish."" He takes you from side splitting laughter to tearing in a matter of scenes. I highly suggest this film, and while I admit that it may not be for all audiences due to its dark nature, I have to praise Burton and Elfman for creating another thematic masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Charming and Unique,"I love the way Mr. Burton populates his movies with these wonderfully whimsical characters. While the world of the living is surely one of conformity and drudgery the underworld is populated with colorful and emotionally rich creatures. I very much enjoyed the concept and the artwork. I also enjoyed the hauntingly beautiful piano pieces. I'm not so sure the other musical numbers work all that well in the context of the story.I liked the story idea. I don't think that the Victor and Victoria characters are fleshed out enough so that their fate has much emotional resonance. Emily was by far the most interesting and compelling creature. Overall, it is a treat to a unique experience but I think a little more time to flesh out a few of the characters would have made this an even more memorable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A visual and audio masterpiece. Beautiful!,"No filmmaker in history has nearly driven me to tears with his stories more than Tim Burton. It's really difficult to keep appearances when your squashed between several of your closest friends in a theater with tears in your eyes as a funny joke comes up on screen. Ever notice how funny you sound when your laughing and crying at the same time? Well, I was pleasantly surprised to hear the same garbled half-cry/half-laugh out of several of my friends, one of which is a 250 lb. motorcycle riding bad ass. Beautiful. This movie was a triumph for Burton and Elfman. Most people criticize it for not being ""Nightmare Before Christmas 2"", but they have to keep in mind that this IS a different movie and it shows. This movie is much darker and more emotional where NBC is a kids riot. The music is superbly Gothic and dark, just like Burton's visualization of the living plane. I can't recommend this movie enough!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
More Creepy Fun from Tim Burton,"""Corpse Bride"" is probably not quite as good as Burton's previous stop-motion masterpiece ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" but that would be a tough act for anyone to follow (though actually, he didn't direct ""Nightmare"" himself, so it's not really a direct comparison). ""Bride"" has the same phantasmagorical look, the same delightful attention to detail, and the same sense of morbid fun that the earlier movie has. It's got a few Danny Elfman songs that sound very much like the ones he composed for ""Nightmare"" and are probably the film's biggest weakness. But the voice-overs are terrific and the whole thing is thoroughly enjoyable.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Don't Expect Another ""Nightmare""","1993's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" was a milestone in cinematic history: the first full-length claymation film. And oh, what a glorious film it was! Bursting at the seems with twisted, beautiful, and vividly imaginative imagery thanks to creator Tim Burton and wonderfully catchy and quirky musical numbers thanks to composer Danny Elfman.Needless to say, Tim Burton's return to claymation was long awaited for me and many others. In 2005, it finally happened with ""Corpse Bride"". Everything I had seen in the previews looked absolutely fantastic, and I had some very high hopes for the film.The plot is as follows: Victor (Depp) is a very shy but very spirited young man living in a dreary city populated by stuck-up rich snobs who care about nothing other than money, rules, and manners. He is set up by his parents to marry a young girl named Victoria (Watson), who is, of course, the one other free spirit in the city. Due to an unfortunate series of events, Victor accidentally marries a dead bride (Bonham Carter) and is consequently sucked into the land of the dead. He then attempts to sort out this misunderstanding and get back to the world of the living.The potential is vast, but the film does little to utilize it. On top of the storyline being crazily predictable, the characters, as you can probably already tell, are paper thin and horribly clichéd. The story has some great opportunities for hilarious macabre gags, which the film obviously tries to harness, but unfortunately, they all end up being painfully corny. Also, the musical numbers, unlike in ""Nightmare"", feel forced and unnecessary, as if Burton threw them in just because he felt he had to. There is just no energy or passion in them. But the biggest problem with the film is that it should clearly be a heavily aesthetic experience, and the visuals are, quite frankly, underwhelming, unlike most of Burton's previous films, which contain more than their fair share of bravura images.Also, the film seemed very short and ended very abruptly, even though it seemed to drag for the majority of the running time.The major redeeming feature of the film, however, is Burton's very interesting contrast between the land of the dead and the world of the living. The dead inhabit a fun, friendly, colorful place where song and dance are encouraged, as apposed to the living, whose world is cold, dreary, desolate, dull, and, ironically, dead. Who are the ones that are truly alive in this situation? 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nothing Spectacular,"This film is average, not the best Tim Burton has done but not the worst either. Some parts of the film are a real bore and some parts are exciting. Helena Bonham-Carter suited the part of the Corpse Bride brilliantly and provided a great voice for her. On parts I found the music spoiled the film and could have done better without it. This film may scare children under 8 years old, my 8 year old sister was hiding her eyes on one scene close to the beginning, so be prepared. This film could be a rip off of the ultra successful 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and is no way better than it. People over 14 years old might find this film rubbish and childish and a waste of their money. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Visual Poe,"Although a few of us have married corpse-like spouses, and those unions were doomed to hell from the start, Tim Burton in Corpse Bride depicts Victor (voice of Johnny Depp), a shy, awkward, introverted pianist actually marrying a corpse (Helena Bonham Carter), by error. Because this is stop-motion animation, even better visually than Burton's Nightmare before Christmas (1993), the expressions are artful and sweet, macabre and eccentric, all the while depicting with icy hilarity the pitfalls of arranged marriages and passive attitudes.Along with the recent Just Like Heaven, Corpse Bride's dependence on love in its Platonic, non-corporeal form is entering the imaginations of contemporary writers in more than one film.If you like your Edgar Allen Poe visual, this animation is for you. The characters from hell, such as Mr. Bonejangles, a Peter Lorre maggot knockoff, and a headwaiter with just a head, are Halloween scary and funny while the more normal living beings, such as Victor's social-climbing parents and fiancé Victoria's poor aristocrat parents, are already in their own pre-grave version of hell.How Victor inadvertently weds a skeleton (albeit a curvey one) and gets dragged to hell is yours to find out. Meanwhile, sit back and enjoy the brilliance of a director whose imagination is scary.From Shakespeare's ""Measure for Measure"":"". . .

Burton returns to what he does best.,"""Oh, don't be ridiculous. What corpse would marry our Victor?""The story of the Corpse Bride is very simple. A young man accidentally practices his vows on the eve of his wedding in the presence of a woman who died a tragic death, and finds himself in the land of the dead, married to her in truth. Does he return to the land above to marry his betrothed, or does he remain with his corpse bride?I'd be perfectly content if Tim Burton would stick to his original creations, and stopped adapting other people's work.  Especially if it lead to more stop-motion movies like this one. Burton's obsession with deathly pale characters with sunken eyes and Victorian clothing is much more charming in animation, than it is in his live-action movies.I know that making a movie of any kind is labor-intensive and time-consuming, but it's rarely as evident as it is in stop-motion movies. The obvious comparison to Corpse Bride is The Nightmare before Christmas. The former isn't quite as clever as the latter, but it's nearly as artistically pleasant. The character designs are good, the sets are impressive, and the painstaking attention to detail is astounding.Other than some underwhelming songs, I enjoyed every bit of Corpse Bride. It's a dark, fantasy tale that has all the humor, star power, and whimsy that a child or adult could want from an animated movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
a beautiful haunting,"THE CORPSE BRIDE Warner Bros 2005 color 83 minutes Musical/Fantasy featuring the voices of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter Directed by Tim Burton Rated PG for adult themes Hot off the creative gem remake Charlie and the Chocalate Factory Burton returns to his artistically drab Nightmare before Christmas roots for a pleasant if over hyped excursion into the after life. Corpse Bride tells the tale of a nervous gentleman wonderfully modeled after Johnny Depp who gets cold feet on his wedding rehearsal and while practicing in the woods accidentally marries the corpse bride. a young woman whom met an early demise on her wedding day. There is obviously lots of singing and macabre gimmicks as he tries to escape her and return to his real fiancée. The movie is littered with creative ideas and imagination galore. But it ends up a little on the shallow side when it comes to feeling like a complete film. Although hauntingly beautiful and a glorious technical achievement topping nightmare before Christmas's wizardy the film relies too much on it's underdeveloped characters and storyline to pull it's weight through. In the end it remains nothing more than brilliantly artistic, souless but a hauntingly beautiful piece of artwork. But it's a nice one indeed. ***(out of five)",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Magical.,"I know that there's a lot of people out there who are ready to compare this to The Nightmare Before Christmas, but there's no comparison. Corpse Bride and Nightmare aren't the same movie. Sure they're both Tim Burton and they're both done in a puppet style but they're essentially different mainly because Nightmare was a musical and Corpse Bride is simply a romantic graveyard comedy. Bride does have a few songs but not enough to make it a musical. Depp ends up doing the voice of Victor, who as usual in a Burton movie, does another stellar job. The movie is shot in a Victorian era making it very cool to watch. The music is done great as well; very suiting and very beautiful. The story isn't complex but it's also not meant to be. The movie is directed more towards children than adults, but that of course doesn't mean adults can't enjoy it as much as children. I highly recommend this to Nightmare Cultists, Burton fans, Halloween buffs, or anyone who likes an all around good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Animation for adults,"I'm sure there will be some children that enjoy this movie, but unlike W&G which will suit both adults and children, this is going to appeal mostly to the adults. It is unmistakeably a Burton movie with the usual Gothic overtones, but fairytale feel.Victor (Depp) fluffs his trial run marriage vows to Victoria (Emily Watson) and goes away to the woods to practise. He accidentally marries Emily (Bonham-Carter) a Corpse Bride. The remainder of the film focuses on whether he can undo this and indeed whether he wants to undo it.The films visuals are great, there's plenty of gags and the script and story are both nicely played.

Comparisons to The Nightmare Before Christmas are of course inevitable but to me that's like trying to spot imperfections in two flawless diamonds.The visual in Corpse Bride, especially given the complexity of the puppets, is brilliant beyond anything I've ever seenevery expression (CG quality facial animation performed by cranking tiny gears within the puppets heads) and flowing costume a marvel to behold. And once again Tim Burton has managed to surround his vision with greatness.

"Visually stunning, entertaining but not perfect.","I am a big Tim Burton fan. I have watched all of his films and have even written academic essays about him so I had a fair idea of what to expect from this latest offering. The Animation is an absolute joy to behold. Visually stunning in all respects and there are some good visual jokes, my favourite being a characters jaw literally dropping off when he is surprised by some news. The lighting is fantastic and thoroughly realistic too. Storywise this film has Burton's ""unique"" edge. A young man, Victor (unrecognisably voiced by Depp) is set to marry Victoria although the pair have never met. At first both are a bit wary of the idea but warm to it after they meet. Problems soon arise as Victor accidentally marries Emily, a corpse (it will become clear when you see it). I did enjoy this strange set up and there are some good jokes that play on common figures of speech, my favourite one being ""I'll keep an eye on him"". Throughout the film you do wonder how they are going to manage to comfortably tie up the story and in fairness it doesn't do too bad a job. Its good to see (or hear at least) Burton regular Michael Gough back in the cinema playing an elder among the dead.There are songs that aren't immediate classics like some from ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"" but I'm sure they may grow on me with repeat viewing. There is also some beautiful piano music. Danny Elfman fully deserves the credit he gets for writing good scores.I have given a lot of praise to the film so far and I did enjoy the movie a lot but it seems a little bit empty somehow. I'm not entirely sure why perhaps other reviews may help to explain that. Overall then, the movie is definitely worth a watch though perhaps there's no need to rush to the cinema to see it now.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Tim Burton's lovely ""Corpse Bride""","Tim Burton's ""Corpse Bride"" bills itself as a supernatural romantic comedy (much in the same avenue as his own 1993 effort ""The Nightmare Before Christmas""), but upon closer inspection is revealed to be something much more touching. Co-directed by Burton himself and Mike Johnson, it's a tale of lost love and what is truly meant to be, and, as usual, Burton takes a macabre spin on the material, in this case it's the phrase ""It is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.""The Corpse Bride of the title does have a name, and it's Emily (Helena Bonham Carter). Yes, she is dead, dead as a doorknob. She's a walking, talking, rotting corpse, with bones falling from her body, her wedding gown is torn and faded, and a friendly maggot has taken up residence in her right eye socket and from time to time offers her advice much in the same vein as a conscience.As the film opens in some unspecified time in what is presumably a Victorian-age England, Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is about to be wed to Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) in an arranged marriage. The two of course have never met, and both have the wedding-day jitters. Victor comes from a rich family, and his parents (Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse) are supportive their son is getting married. Victoria and her parents (Joanna Lumley and Albert Finney), however, come from a poor background. For the two to get married, Victor would have family and Victoria would find her way into money. The two are happy to be getting married, but is it meant to be?However, Victor is such a nervous wreck he can't even remember his vows at the rehearsal ceremony. The priest gets fed up with his ineptitude to even recite a simple marriage vow and sends him out to memorize them. He wanders into the forest, practices and finally gets them right, even going so far as to use a tree limb as a woman's ring finger. But when he does slide the ring onto what he thinks is a branch sticking up from the ground, what emerges from underneath the dirt is the Corpse Bride.It turns out that in the Land of the Dead (which is populated by those that look like they didn't make the cut to appear in Halloweentown), and because he was able to successfully recite his vows and place the ring on the bride's finger, Victor's marriage to Emily is legitimate. So Victor and Emily are in an unlikely but legal binding. The idea of the story is not to make Emily an object of horror, but of sympathy: she was murdered the night before her own wedding, so by being with Victor, she is given a second chance for wedded bliss that she could not obtain while alive.If you know Burton, you know he specializes in freaks, and their acceptance more or less into normal society. Very often, said freaks are the heroes while ""normal"" individuals are evil. If you've seen ""Batman"" (1989), ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990) and ""Ed Wood"" (1994), you'd know this. Here, in ""Corpse Bride,"" it's no different as romance and tragedy become the centerpieces of Burton's tale.The previews may mislead people into thinking ""Corpse Bride"" is a comedy, which is a stretch considering there are a few laughs but most are spare and have a macabre tone to them. The focal point is the theme of lost love, which is what should stick with viewers. The music and songs, by frequent Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, sometimes also help to drive home these points and even partially expresses Victor's newfound predicament: How can he be married to two different women at the same time? Mistakes happen, misunderstandings arise and hearts are broken in ""Corpse Bride,"" but that's love, isn't it?In a time when CGI rules everything around us, it's good to see a film take advantage of the old cinematic stop-motion techniques. I've seen enough computer-enhanced blockbusters this year to last a lifetime, and ""Corspe Bride"" comes as a lively, refreshing change from what is quickly becoming the norm. Tim Burton's imagination was obviously on overdrive here but in the right spot, and ""Corpse Bride"" may very well be his most touching film yet.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Corpse Bride Delivers Thrills, but mostly Chills","Not just chills from the overall 'creepiness' of the movie either.This is a prime example of how a movie has great potential yet... Misses something and that something destroys the movie's overall appeal. Sadly, I believe Corpse Bride is Tim Burtons worst film since the Planet of the Apes.I just did not enjoy it as much as I had anticipated. The living characters acted wooden and dull, while the dead characters seemed alive and active. (Purposefully?) I like the look and feel of the movie however. It was definitely a Tim Burton film. The direction was top notch as always, but the score left a bitter taste in my mouth. The songs weren't very enjoyable. In The Nightmare Before Christmas, every single song was very memorable. I am sad to say, Corpse Bride songs are just forgettable.In fact, I want to forget this movie was made right now. Tim Burton did a fabulous job on the direction and I applaud him for that.

With a running time of 75 minutes though there isn't any room for substantial development which is unfortunate.The character Emily had so much heart and her one contribution musically had some nice lyrics, though overall I found the songs lacking other then the piano piece which was terrific but doled out in too few increments.CB lacked the cuteness, the wit, the humor and charisma of Nightmare Before Christmas, and the potential in glimpses we get here and there are merely teases in a movie that ends up feeling like a mismanaged script, rushed out the door with too little clothes on.The ending was also rushed and the butterfly sequence not as strong as it could have been if we were given more time to fall in love with Emily. She had potential and we do get those glimpses like I said, but too few and far between.The beginning starts off rather cliché, but at midpoint picks up in a story twist that is fantastic if you didn't know it was coming, worth watching but I felt more tantalized then gratified.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Short and sweet,"This is an amazing movie. I had previously watched Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas and expected a similar experience: Nightmare was amazing to look at and a marvel to listen to, but in between all the singing, I found it a bit dull. This movie though, never encountered that issue.Viktor Van Dort, son of a wealthy fishmonger family, is set to marry Victoria Everglot, daughter of a poor yet high-class family. The Van Dorts hope to earn high-class, and the Everglots hope to earn money. Victor and Victoria aren't keen on the idea, but once they meet in person, it's love at first site. The shy Victor, however, completely fails at the wedding rehearsal and flees to the woods. He practices his vows there on different branches, finally putting the ring on a very hand-like one. And in fact, it is a hand! The hand of Emily, the Corpse Bride, who was killed by her new husband and swore to await her true love. Victor now finds himself married to a corpse, when he wants to get back to Victoria. Although during the movie, he begins to show more care and love for his new bride. But I won't spoil the ending.This movie has less music and more plot than Nightmare, and therefore isn't as dull as I found Nightmare to be. It goes at a perfect pace, mixing excellent music with even better voice-acting, of particular note Johnny Depp as Victor and Christoper Lee as the priest, Pastor Galswells. Even more so I must mention the quirky and witty humor in this movie, with many puns and cute jokes, and of course the amazing visuals - stop-motion animation at its best. This movie should be seen only to admire the animation.It is a bit on the short side, standing at only an hour and 15 minutes, but it doesn't hurt the film. Rather, you can enjoy this fun and light-hearted movie to its full extent before it has a chance to drag into dullness. Many a movie have been ruined by being too long.This movie is a must-see, if only to appreciate the animation.

missed it by that much,"The Corpse Bride, Tim Burton's second venture to share the magic of stop motion animation to a new generation, is a film I wanted to love. I really wanted to love it. But unlike Victor's piano playing in the movie, it seemed to be a note or two off. Technically the film was superior than his first venture, The Nightmare Before Christmas. In all honesty, the script and music were as good if not better than Nightmare also. But it seemed to lack that emotional tug and enthusiasm that Nightmare has. But before I go further, I leave the disclaimer that Nightmare is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. The Corpse Bride may suffer another flaw with me that is unfair to it- deferred love and praise from a cult classic. Just like that actor or actress who receives an Oscar nomination for a lesser role because last years phenomenal performance was overlooked, The Corpse Bride might have acquired a little extra unearned hype from Burton's first venture that went initially unnoticed by the mass audience. I think that if you were to have seen this film before Nightmare, it would definitely impress. And it did even to me. I watched the whole film and enjoyed myself. The scene where Bonejangles leads his skeleton band is fun to watch. The end actually maintained a solid level of suspense and closed the story on a great note. But ultimately the simple characters, arguably no more complex than in Nightmare, never really stuck to memory for me. And as enjoyable as the cinematic ride was, I guess I would prefer to ride down the cult cinema of Nightmare, not The Corpse Bride, any time.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Mystery, Suspense, Worms!","Burton scores again with this charming story. Part murder mystery, part comedy, part tragedy, and part love story, Corpse Bride is delightful. There's just enough screwball antics and mayhem to keep the kids enthralled, and more than enough witty dialog for the parents.The story moves along at a brisk pace (not surprising given the oh too brief length of 76 minutes), and so character development leaves quite a bit to the imagination. There's no backstory, and no subplots, but it doesn't take long to become enamored by the characters in Burton's love triangle of the living and the dead. Depp, Bonham Carter, and Watson all turn in laudable performances, and the stop-motion animation is not just truly amazing, but a refreshing break from the computer graphic trend that's become the bread and butter of animated movies.I think I liked this better than my kids (but they loved it too).",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

If you aren't particularly interested in either it may be best for you to wait until it comes out on DVD and pick it up as a rental instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
I liked it but it lacked something,"This movie was a fun watch for sure, I thought it was a good film but it lacked something for sureIt felt ""small"". What I mean is that the film felt really claustrophobic, this entire movie felt as if we were confined to a small area. Of course, that isn't a bad thing. Some of the best movies of all time are in small settings such as Reservoir Dogs. But I feel like things are different for an animated movieThis movie felt super constricted. If your setting is small, it should be your goal as an animator to make the world feel bigger than it is but it failed to do so",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Burton Reanimates His Style,"This was overall a beautiful film. I happened to enjoy the Nightmare Before Christmas, and I had a feeling that this would be just as good. I was not wrong. Yes, you could see the reflections of many of the characters from NBC in this one, but I did not mind that. This was still a movie on its own. The music was fantastic, the animation was splendid, and the visuals were marvelous. I do not believe that a fan of Burton will be disappointed with this one. I like how we come to care about the characters and actually feel what they are going through just by looking at their facial expressions. That surely is quality. There are so many scenes in this movie that are extremely beautiful, one being a piano-playing scene between the main character and the Corpse Bride. There are a lot of symbolic features, which is of course typical of Burton to do, and that is one of the reasons that he is a great director. I have said so many good things about this movie, so now let us move on to the negatives. A lot of people will want to expect something new from Burton, which they will not get here, but I did not seem to have a problem with it. What I do think is that there could have been a little bit more development with the characters and a few of the scenes, but I did take into consideration that this type of animation is extremely hard work. The movie was still very well done, and I do not have many complaints about it. I think kids will like this, especially since there are enough funny moments, and older people will enjoy the movie as well, most likely for its beauty and ""cuteness"" it has to it. Burton reanimates his style through this one. That is why I think that his fans should not have a problem with this Corpse Bride =)8/10 Stars",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have done it again!,"This movie was excellent! Tim Buron's vision was amazing. I loved every second of it. I've seen it twice already and its even better the second time. The stop motion film was just wonderful and gave at a feeling that computers just can't do. I am a huge fan of all of Johnny Depp's work and i believe he did a wonderful job of the voice for Victor. This film is full of magic and surprise! I also think that it is great for all ages. It has jokes for the Kids to get and also adults.

"Odd, but still charmingly cute!","I do not know much of Burton's work and I decided to watch this movie based on the fact that I like good movies.Victor (Depp) is to marry the beautiful Victoria (Watson), but during the rehearsal he gets the vows mixed up so he goes to the woods to practice. He proceeds to unknowingly ask the corpse Emily (Carter) to be his bride and she accepts; bringing him with her back 6 feet under.It a charming, odd (but cute at the same time) and fun movie. It's not hysterically fun, but the way Burton uses irony to get the message across is thrilling. Burton also makes you guessing which one Victor will end up marrying in the end. This movie is good entertainment without being Oscar material. It makes me want to get into Burtons work and see what else he has done.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Burton's Mad World Is Now Six Feet Under,"Starting off in the bleak world of the living, The Corpse Bride introduces us to Victor (Johnny Depp) and Victoria (Emily Watson), the couple soon to be wed and just about meet. Both shy and anxious about marrying someone they do not love, they meet and thankfully DO love each other. Phew! But then....Whilst practising his admittedly very difficult wedding vows, Victor places the ring on what appears to be a hand-shaped branch in the spooky forest/cemetry. The hand-shaped branch turns out to be the actual hand of a corpse bride (Helena Bonham-Carter) and now Victor and Corpsey are married. Oops.Burton's animation is incredible. Quirky and Gothic, he's cleverly depicted the land of the living in near monotone and the land of the dead in vibrant, almost electrifying colour. Skeletons dance and maggots pop out of eye-sockets in some truly gorgeous song-and-dances. Victor tries to escape his gruesome but oddly fetching wife and return to save his True Love from the evil Lord Barkis, but he then learns that even though his wife hasn't got a pulse, she's still got feelings.The Corpse Bride can be safely assured of a spot in the canon of clever, funny and entertaining animated movies, although it probably won't get any further than that. Its short run-time and simple, although sweet, story makes it a kiddy classic with some appeal for adults. But despite its advanced visual effects, The Corpse Bride is not as wacky as other Burton ventures like Big Fish and it seems to fall just a tiny bit short of being spectacular.",,Anonymous,Animation
Not What You Expext,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to The Corpse Bride.Depp reteamed with Tim Burton for a fifth time when he agreed to do the voice world alongside Helen Bonham Carter. Both characters look like the actors. It's not the dark horror piece you imagine based on the trailer. Its a sweet and charming movie about lost love. That's not to say it's not without its moments.I always see this as a companion piece to Nightmare Before Christmas, so if you like that, yiu will enjoy thisThe Corpse Bride grossex $53 million at the domestic box office to end 2005 as the 51st highest grossing movie of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing. Period.,"Wow. I was truly impressed by this movie! I knew this was going to be good, but not this good! I was so amazed. I loved The Nightmare Before Christmas and knew I'd love this. And I did. The stop-motion-animation was tremendous, the voice acting by Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carterwas awesome! They fit perfectly with the roles! The music was very good. Though the music set the mood and was so cool to listen to, I wish they would have made more singing songs! The ones they did do were so good and if they were to make more, it would have been even better. I loved this movie from start to finish.

Best Film in Years,"This is a beautifully done, and very moving film. It skillfully blends romance, humor, and music into a memorable and gripping story that is up there with the great ""Casablanca"". The use of stop action animation is perfect for this film, giving characters and setting a richness and depth unavailable otherwise. This is actually a film that improves with re-viewing. Have so far seen it 3 times, and it gets better every time. The only improvement would be for it to be longer to better develop Emily's and Victor's relationship. Even as is, it is the best I have seen in years, and deserves ranking with the greats. Including the above mentioned ""Casablanca"".",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Visually stunning yet fails to impress...,"Tim Burton has created masterful films in the past, one being the animated classic ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". His choice of color contrasts makes him one of the great directors of his time. In the film ""Corpse Bride"", he succeeds with telling a great story filled with great characters. Where he fails to meet my expectations though is with the humor. I felt that the jokes weren't as clever as I had expected and they seemed to pop up at odd times. I would still recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a great looking film with their kids.

Tim Burton's on a role this year!,"12 years ago, Nightmare Before Christmas was made. It was a great, 10/10 classic. Now Corpse Bride is here, another 10/10 classic for me. I love this movie, and plan to see it a lot before it crawls out of theaters. It's a favorite. It has great songs and the voices perfectly match the characters.The story starts out with Victor Van Dort, the son of two fish merchants, who is to marry Victoria Everglott, the daughter of parents who are known to be rich, but secretly aren't, so they need their daughter to marry to avoid living the streets. They've never even seen each other before, which makes it interesting. But when Victor messes up their wedding rehearsal, he fleds to the woods and murmurs the wedding vows to himself. After he's got them down, he practices saying them aloud pretending the nature around him is his audience. But when he puts the ring on what he thinks is a stick, but is a finger, a corpse emerges from the ground and claims that she's legally he's bride. I shan't say anymore.10/10. Tremendous. Good ol' Tim Burton never let's his little fan girl down.:-)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just the Fab 3 being fab(again),"I've just watched CB and I can honestly say it's enchanted.OK,the plot and the characters are pretty clichéd(in basic means of course,it's not that you see a corpse bride living underground with skeletons and interesting insects everyday!),but the power of this sadly-short picture is not it's great scenario or exciting storyline.It's proved over and over again that you don't always need a genius plot to give an artistic performance(Johnny Depp of all people knows it best I think.Exhibit A:Pirates of the Caribbean.)And if we don't call CB artistic,I don't know which animation deserves this title. It's so sweet with little,well-placed details,I'm still smiling.It's not one of my immortal movies,I admit(that's why it receives 7,not full marks from me)but I'll always remember it with a smile. I liked it although I sadly watched it dubbed in Turkish(I always prefer original and I'm really curious about the characters singing voices)and the sound was so low because of a problem in my PC.

"A Little Cheesy, But Overall A Good Experience","This movie is so sweet and the art style is to die for (pun intended)There are a few flaws, the villain is one dimensional and cheesy, the main protagonist is a bit empty, and the romance is a bit forced. But that's all easy to forgive when presented with the adorable characters, moving songs, and hilarious moments.Something else that makes this movie unique is the way it handles death. Death isn't presented as a horrible thing, and the afterlife isn't shown in any sort of religious or heaven/hell context, which is rare for most kids films that deal with the afterlife. Death in this movie is simply seen as a part of life, moving from one state of being to the next. The dead aren't angsty and sad, they're happy and living their lives in a different way than they were before.The main character Emily however is where the movie truly shines. Her sweet and likable nature makes the movie so entertaining, as well as her slightly creepy but overall adorable design.A great movie to put on for your kids! Not all adults will enjoy it,, but it's definitely a good family film and if you like Tim Burtons work this is worth checking out!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dead on Arrival,"First off let me tell you I love Tim Burton's work. I live for his next film....but this film....it was D. O. A. I'm reading all these positive comments on this film, and I can't help but wonder....did we see the same film???? I found it very very dry and boring. The characters were just that....Boring. The kid behind me said to his mom half way through, ""Mom can we go...this movie sucks..."" I must agree with him. The Nightmare before Christmas was one of my favorite films from Burton...it seemed like it was an attempt to re-capture some of that film's magic and charm. It failed horribly. I am still shaking my head at what I just saw...Danny Elfman...I love his work also. He must've been rushed in this film because a lot of the musical score in this film like he took the score he wrote for Nightmare before Christmas, changed a few words around, changed a few note positions around and viola! it was done. Very dull.So I disagree with the people that wrote how great this film was and how it was Burton's best yet... 110% disagree... it was garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unworthy Successor to Nightmare,"My apologizes to Tim Burton fans but this movie is a pale successor to Nightmare Before Christmas (one of my all time favorites). The music and lyrics aren't even close to the beautiful tunes and rhymes of Nightmare and the plot is thin. What I found most disappointing was the absence of interesting side characters. Nightmare was chock full of hilarious characters from the Mayor to Dr. Finkelstein to the wonderfully varied children. After leaving the theatre I was hard pressed to come up with a single memorable side character from Corpse Bride.I'd probably have a better opinion of this flick if I did not have Nightmare to compare it to. I'm reminded of the many times a new band has released a master piece 1st album and struggled to follow it with a comparable second. It could be that Nightmare set the bar so high as to jade my opinion of Burton's further adventures in stop motion musicals. I do however, hope he continues to try.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Animation with Cute Story,"I really enjoyed the simple and sweet story that was Corpse Bride. Undoubtedly, the strength of the film lies in its visuals and its attention to imaginative details. I don't think the storyline has the cleverness of A Nightmare Before Christmas, but for me, the animation was leaps ahead. All the cleverness of this film basically lies in the visuals. The clay look worked really well for this film because the animators took care to add in little details like the butler's nose always flipped in the air, the exaggerated features of the parents, and the waiter in the dead world being a head carried by bugs. You really have to wonder at how the creators even thought this stuff up! I wasn't a huge fan of the songs, but they fit in with the story and don't distract. The actors are terrific and very versatile, especially Johnny Depp who, to me, didn't even sound like himself. It's just a very cute and simple tale that most will enjoy, I think.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really good cartoon,"The cartoon ""Corpse Bride"" tells the story of the son of rich fish merchants Victor and his adventures. It's not a horror, but it has some elements of a fantasy. The cartoon is set in the Victorian era. Characters-dolls live in two divided worlds: the Land of the Living and The Land of the Dead.The film has a quality cast. It begins when Victor Van Dort, stared by Johny Deep, and the daughter of impoverished aristocrats, Victoria Everglot, stared by Emily Watson, are preparing for their arranged marriage, which will simultaneously raise the social class of Van Dorts and restore the wealth of Everglots. Victor runs the wedding rehearsal by forgetting his words of the oath.The film is full of thrilling moments and unexpected tums. The film was directed by Mike Johnson and Tim Burton. They were able to answer a lot of questions from viewers. And although the color scheme in the cartoon is quite gray, thanks to their ideas, the cartoon is very interesting. The musical accompaniment, created by Danny Elfman, made this picture more enchanting.I recommend Copse Bride. You can immerse yourself in Victorian era, go to the Land of the Dead and enjoy beautiful music while watching this cartoon.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not bad.....but not great,"I have to admit, I came out of Corpse Bride a bit disappointed. It wasn't because the film was bad. It is because it didn't equal or surpass Nightmare Before Christmas.The film effectively evokes the Burton sense of style and story telling. But something is not quite right. The songs are one thing. Elfman, a great composer and long-time collaborator, seems to just kind of sleep walk through this one. Nothing really catchy in the way of songs, which was a big part of Nightmare. The other thing, the story just kind of left the whole sub-plot of the bride and the duke. There really was no real acknowledgment of their past.All in all, will be added to my collection, but can't help but feel this was a bit rushed.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A very well done work by the master himself.,"Yesterday at school, I watched Tim Burton's ""Corpse Bride"" for the third time I think. Lately, I've had Burton's work on my mind lately. I've been thinking about a lot of his movies, like his dark ""Batman"" films, the enchanted Christmas classic, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (which recently celebrated it's 20th anniversary) ,and ""Edward Scissorhands"", one of my all-time favorite movies. So watching his work again makes me realize what an interesting and talented director he is, even if he might be stating to decline slightly. And watching this movies again really captures the beauty and elegance of his works like none of his other films. The premise of the film centers on a shy, nervous man played by (who else?) Johnny Depp. He is engaged to be married to a lovely women named Victoria, played by Emily Watson. However, after getting cold feet during the rehearsal, he accidentally marries a dead women instead, played by (again, who else?) Helena Bonham Carter, who takes him to the land of the dead, to marry her. There are so many things to admire in this film. I guess the best place to start is the animation. It is simply beautiful. The character's eyes are made bigger, in order to make make them more expressive. And Burton makes the smart decision to make the living world black and white, and once we get to the world of the dead, it becomes very colorful. Not only that, but he chooses to keep the living people black and white when they are in the world of the dead. And it's clever little quirks like that make the film a great Tim Burton film. Burton uses clever uses of cinematography, tilted shots and things like that. His sense of art direction is very good as well, with nice designs done for the buildings and characters. And speaking of the characters, they are interesting, and their actors do fine. You admire how smart, sophisticated, funny, or just kind they can be, which make them all very memorable. The music is also really beautiful. Danny Elfman returns to score the movie, and creates some nice songs for the characters to sing, as well as some quiet piano music to accompany other parts. ""Corpse Bride"" is one of Tim Burton finest films. It is beautiful, funny, inspirational, and has great attention to detail. Check it out if you haven't already.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Movie Schitzo's Review of ""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride""","Tim Burton is a very weird and interesting individual. With movies like Ed Wood, Mars Attacks!, Edward Scissorhands, and Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, he creates movies that are visually stunning, weird, funny, touching and heartwarming. Here, he takes an old folk legend about a nervous groom and turns it into an animated film. Here, we are introduced to Victor Von Dort (Johnny Depp), whose parents are making him get married to the wealthy Victoria Everglot so they can inherit her family's fortunes (Emily Watson) whose parents are making her get married to him to inherit his family's fortunes. Victor is very nervous on his wedding day and goes into the woods to practice his vows. He tries it on what looks like a stick, but turns out to be the hand of The Corpse Bride (Helena Bonam Carter) and he has just proposed to her! She takes him down to the Land of the Dead and prepares to marry him all the while, he is pining for Victoria and planning to return to her. The voice actors did very well here and changed their voices so that you couldn't even recognize them and the visual effect were astounding.

Not enough to it,"Corpse Bride is enchanting and interesting, and most of the songs are pretty catchy, but I didn't think there was too much to it.

And the plot was an interesting premise, but it didn't seem to really take off. Overall, I'd say I enjoyed it, but like Nightmare before Christmas, I just didn't agree with all the hype.

Beautiful but Predictable,"While the design was spectacular, the script was altogether predictable. There are many elements of Tim Burton's former films here, from Vincent to Frankenweenie to Nightmare. It's a bit of a conglomeration of them all. Even some of the characters seem to be reincarnations of others we've seen before. All of that would have been forgiven if the script and characters weren't so stereotypical, like Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney, etc. Caroline Thompson's script is simply thin and transparent. The only thing that kept me guessing was how Vincent (Johnny Depp) would ""get the girl"" in the end. Danny Elfman delivers a great score and good songs, but it isn't enough to lift this film to just above average. It was entertaining, but again, predictable.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful and Dreamy yet Simple at Heart,"To put it simply, this movie is a jewel: After being in love with it for quite the time, I have decided to settle down and write a review for it, because no matter how much praise it gets, this short animation film deserves more.This is the kind of movie which will not leave you unhappy; there's a little bit for everyone in this masterpiece. Are you one for emotional, expressive characters? Then you'll like it: not only are the characters, even those more minor, cutely designed and each with unique, sweet strands of quirky personality in themselves, but the clay models' expressivity is sometimes more than that of some bland actors and actresses. The voices are wonderfully implemented too, with Johnny Depp taking into the role of the main focus, dreamy Victor van Dort, and Emily Watson voicing Victoria, his sweet and naïve 'human' fiancée. But the true star is unequivocally Helena Bonham-Carter as the alluring Corpse Bride herself, the bubbly and sexy Emily, whose emotions switch swiftly from happy to sad to angry  and you really won't want to mess with this Bride! Of course, the rest of the cast is placed just as aces, with Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse as the Van Dorts, Victor's status-hungry parents, Joanna Lumley and Albert Finney as the stuck-up and aristocratic Everglots (and, in the best possible way, these were *perfectly* voiced), and Richard E. Grant as the dark, refined and depraved Lord Barkis Bittern.The score? Striking, simply, a perfect ten. You really couldn't get anybody better than Danny Elfman to do this job, and even with him, I don't doubt it must cost a painful amount of time and effort to compose such a perfectly fit soundtrack, but as it is? In my opinion, it couldn't be better. This man just seems to hit the spot every time, and although nobody would miss a few songs more (comparing this to Nightmare Before Christmas, the result is rather less quantitative), you can tell the songs are a definite improvement, from the repetitive tunes of NMBC to the full songs, complete with lyrics which tell portions of the story as opposed to simply describing situations.Another of this movie's strong points is the humour. Whether you're one for sophisticated and adult wit, or darkly jokey slapstick and in-context plays with words, there's bound to be a little wink at the audience you'll at the very least smirk at. While the dry comedy is reserved for the grey Land of the Living, wildness is unleashed in the colourful and spazzy Land of the Dead.So take your pick, but whether you're already a fan of Burton's or a newcomer to his wonderful and crazy world, this dreamy piece is something notable out of his filmography. Personally, I think just the effort and hours put behind the animation, especially with it being so detailed and dynamic in the final result, are worth respecting. Couple that with a wonderfully told, beautiful storyline which, although many found simple and linear, I thought it really couldn't give more out of itself, and you have Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, a movie with quite simple ambitions which easily becomes one of this director's liveliest  no pun intended.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"As always, a Burton movie with its own brand of grotesque charm...","An amazing array of Gothic background details and a charming background score are given a chance to highlight the main characters voiced by Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Emily Watson in this Victorian story about a timid young man (Depp) and his anxious bride-to-be (Carter) who just happens to be dead. The voice talent of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Emily Watson helps make their characters endearing, wistful and funny. Others in the talented cast are equally good.The absurd story gets loving attention to detail and mood, its atmosphere and look bordering on Charles Dickens at his darkest. All of it is given a sort of grotesque charm, no matter what the characters or situations are, including a singing maggot! Very original, with the charming ""piano duet"" for Victor (Depp) and Emily (Carter) by Danny Elfman sounding like a segment of classical music.Admirers of Tim Burton's art of animation will surely rank this among his best creations. Rightfully, it was nominated for a host of awards in the animation field.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
fantastic breath taking,"The team of Tim Burton and Jonny Depp (Edward Scissorhands) return for this sophisticated, humorous brilliantly directed fantasy animation in which a remarkably look a like animation of Depp is juxtaposed with Emily Watson's posh character to create a charming marriage focused story in which there are proposes, engagements and remarkable weddings to look out for.The reason I loved this film was the slowness and gentleness of the plot. When the groom wrongfully proposes to the corpse in the forest many audiences would believe it to be ridiculous and coincidental in the way it came across. However I believed it conformed to the fantasy genre beautifully and with Burton's known dark mind for the genre it is really effective and will defiantly engage you into the plot as the stakes are raised for Depp's character as he wonders what is happening to him.The two worlds are amazing. The land of the living and the land of the dead are amazingly portrayed, especially the dead as it shines with life and light, strange but a different concept to the ideology of the dead. The skeletons, zombies, corpses etc are fantastic, gruesome and funny (watch out for the singing skeleton whom I simply loved!) the living world also appears more dark and gloomy than the death world which is an interesting technique used by Burton and one which is an essential make to this film.In comparison to the nightmare before Christmas the animation is fantastic. The detail to the gruesomeness of the two worlds is amazing and breathtaking. The creep characters to are also splendid and confirm to audience's expectations. Unfortunately the songs don't quite match those in Nightmare but are still humorous and do tell the story well.The film is always consistent in grabbing the audience attention, the odd joke is really funny (with usually play on words and puns of the genre) the characters are interesting to observe and help make the story what it is and the animation is breathtaking, one of my all time favourite animations, after only one viewing.watch it now!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A work of Art,"In keeping with the eeriness that October generally brings, I have seen the latest effort by Tim Burton entitled ""Corpse Bride"" (contrary to popular belief, there's no ""the"" in the title). Like Tim Burton's 1993 stop-motion classic ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""Corpse Bride"" takes something wonderful and makes it sinister - In this case, the accidental marriage to a corpse.From the opening scene onward there's trouble brewing and you know very well that nothing can go right when you hear the parents of both wedding parties singing ""everything must go according to plan."" This song is probably the most memorable out of the entire film (which doesn't say much), but it does serve to set the stage. Indeed everything must go according to plan. The bride's parents are in dire need of money while the groom's parents seek a better reputation. Apparently this marriage can make everybody happy except the bride and groom.It is at their own wedding rehearsal that our young couple, Victor and Victoria, first meet. They have a brief moment alone in which the pair seem to believe that they can make this work. Feelings of affection also begin to become apparent in this scene - perhaps they will learn to love each other.As the rehearsal gets underway, we find out what a neurotic and scatterbrained person Victor is. He just can't get his vows right. The more times he makes a mistake, the more impatient everybody becomes, and the more likely he is to make another mistake. After SEVERAL attempts, chaos ensues and Victor flees. He ultimately finds refuge in a dark forest where he finally gets his vows right! He slips the ring, the symbol of his unhappiness, onto what he thinks is a twig, but is actually the remains of a woman's hand. Naturally he's taken aback by the dead chick in the wedding dress that pops out of the ground and says ""I do."" What can you do? Victor ran.For a while Victor tries to rid himself of his corpse bride but he ultimately falls in love with her because she is more alive than those that can breathe. However, he also still has a soft spot for Victoria who, in Victor's absence has been betrothed, by her parents, to a Mr. Barkis Bittern who clearly has a more cynical role tin this whole story. Victor is being pulled in two directions but can choose only one.Johnny Depp (Victor), Emily Watson (Victoria) and Helena Bonham Carter (Corpse Bride) lead an exceptional cast of voices. Tim Burton is, again, in his element here, creating a visually striking and sentimental work of art. The Music is okay. The songs are all forgettable and have little purpose except to fill time which this film definitely needed. At only 76 minutes, this film is barely feature length. There's little character development and everything feels a bit rushed, because, well it is. Pacing problems are bound to occur, though, when you're dealing with stop-motion animation. You simply can't tell how the final product will work out, and because of the time and effort it takes to film, you can't very well re-shoot things. ""Corpse Bride"" took a whopping fifty-five weeks to film and during this time one hundred nine million four hundred forty INDIVIDUALLY animated frames were arranged and shot. The animators had to create 28 frames just for the corpse bride to blink ONCE. You can't help but appreciate that kind of effort.The story is quite original, yet oddly predictable. The dialogue is often simple but sometimes inspired - ""Can a heart break once it's stopped beating?"" As of this time, I'd say that ""Corpse Bride"" is a shoe in for ""Best Animated Picture."" It really hasn't been a great year for animation. I do not recommend shelling out nine dollars to see this film on the big screen.

"""Relies more on visually pleasing the audience""","Victor messed up his vows during a wedding rehearsal, and is traveling through the woods, reciting his vows. He stops to rest in the woods,and while practicing, he gets them right and puts his wedding ring on a finger-shaped stick in the ground and says his wedding vows. The stick turns out to be a rotted finger belonging to a murdered girl, who returns as a zombie and insists that she is now Victor's lawfully wedded wife.When seeing this film, one will make the connection to The Nightmare Before Christmas, which is unfair in the sense that they are two totally different films, only similar in the animation. Leave it to Tim Burton to take us inside his ""cooky-artist"" head to bring us the beautiful Corpse Bride.Technically, Corpse Bride is ahead of the race in every sense of the word. Lightyears ahead of NBC in terms of style, with quirky characters bug eyes and legs as thin as toothpicks. Stop-motion animation is a form that should be more explored in film. Corpse Bride unfortunately relies too heavily on it's animation and strays away from it's story.It seems the motivation of the main character, to fall in love with this corpse is a little hard to follow. At first, he's terrified of her, then wants to run and hide from her, then falls in love with her and will die for her...but loves someone else in the end. Corpse Bride takes all these emotions throws them into a blender and hits the ultra mix button. This leaves the viewer with an awkward feeling at the end towards our so called hero.Okay, so it is a kids movie, so harping on the emotional value could be unfair. But Depp as the lead offers nothing to the movie, which his character always looking shocked, we get Depp voicing it all whimpy. It's good to see the other cast members giving their voices more range, I mean when you hear Christopher Lee's voice as the towns Pastor it's so deep and recognizable that anyone can notice. Helena Bonham Carter does the best with her incredible singing talent and voiced with a lot of depth and emotion.Danny Elfman's score, along with everyother Burton movie, takes the film to another level. With surprise musical numbers, which aren't too apparent in films these days. It takes you back to those old Disney films.Seeing the underworld, so vibrant and alive, and seeing the living world, so dreadful and dead, it makes you wonder who's really who in this world. Seeing the two at opposite ends is a feast for the eyes, which is what many people will see this movie for. If you're looking for great animation and musical numbers, then Corpse Bride is the film for you, other-wise the story is kinda of dead.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tim Burton can't make movies anymore,"Yes, I know he didn't direct it but this is a god awful piece of tripe that spits in the face of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" It commits the cardinal sin of movies such as this... it's boring. Lame songs too. This would have been much better as a live action movie. I can see Depp really pulling this off with another trademark performance. The sad fact is, Burton hasn't made a great movie since ""Sleepy Hollow"". ""Big Fish"" was overdone and over long and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was the same. And what the hell is wrong with Jon August? How can the writer of the brilliant ""Go"" be stuck writing studio garbage? It's to bad he appears to have gotten caught up in the paycheck instead of continuing to write his own stuff.

3D animation that looks like stop-motion,"I am a big fan of Tim Burton's movies, but this one is missing something. You can try to put your finger on what is wrong, but there is too much things. First, and the biggest is this is not stop motion animation, it is 3D. If it is, eventually, stop motion, than its stupid. Is there any reason to for using one of the hardest ways to animate? He didn't get the Oscar for it, but Walas and Gromit did, with animation that is not so perfectly done. Second, plot is trivial. Third, Tim Burton is having such fun madding it just for himself, it looks to me that he wanted to this movie before ""Nightmer"" but he didn't have computers that good, like today.

The two do not know each other and are sent to a wedding rehearsal where Victor, afraid of the marriage (and the Pastor's cane on his head), messes up his lines and goes out to say them properly, but mistakenly places the ring on a branch in the ground which he thought was a branch. It turns out that the branch is actually the Corpse Bride, who thinks that Victor has married her. It seems he is in an impasse and doesn't quite understand what to do...

Lively land of the dead.,"Tim Burton's first return to stop-motion sees him take full control as director and bring to life a macabre little fairy tale that focuses on a young man who accidentally marries a living corpse after practicing his vows in the forest. 'Corpse Bride (2005)' takes a while to get going, initially seeming overly dreary and, even, somewhat slow, but it's a decent amount of fun when it does. Ironically, it really livens up when its protagonist is transported to the land of the dead. This segment is colourful, inventive and relatively fast-paced. It's also chock-full of the fantastic 'child-friendly' gore that acts as a key motif in its creator's career. The feature isn't massively compelling and it certainly has its ups and downs (for example, most of its songs leave something to be desired), but it's a generally enjoyable affair with some creative character design and its own kind of charm. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tim Burton indulges himself,"Corpse Bride is about what I'd imagine goes around in Tim Burton's mind in any given moment. It is a sweet fairy tale painted in macabre colours. A children's colouring book if the only colour available was grey. And, if you've liked Mr. Burton's other creative efforts, this is pretty much more of the same and thus well worth a watch.The story follows a young man named Victor (Johnny Depp) who is about to marry a woman named Victoria (Emily Watson). He's out in the woods, practicing his vows, but happens to be overheard by the spirit of a dead woman, played by Helena Bonham Carter, who promptly decides that he was saying his vows to her and that they're now married.It's not a bad story and fits the usual grim Tim Burton imagery well. It's at the same time gothic, melancholy and just the right kind of naive. The characters are pretty one-note overall, especially the parents, but that also fits this kind of narrative well. It's supposed to be exaggerated and somewhat childlike.That being said, the film has some problems when it comes to style. Like, for example, the colour palate is about as grey as a coal mine. Even for Tim Burton. The underworld is a bit better in this regard, but not by much. The aforementioned land of the dead is also tonally jarring. The film begins as this heavily gothic Victorian affair, but then they drop into the underworld and suddenly the film is a jazz musical of all things. These two don't mix very well at all.Still, I can't say I minded seeing the film. Not the best effort any of the involved people have produced, but it has its moments and is well worth a watch if you have it in you to watch yet another Tim Burton extravaganza.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

He'll have to find the way to leave the underworld and his unwanted dead wife, and return to the real world to marry sweet Victoria.The movie mixes the moods of the classic Charles Dickens's novels and the 18th-19th century horror stories, and is sprinkled with a great sense of humor and a few winks to the adult viewer. The colors and backgrounds are beautiful, with a mix of the dark bright colors and precious quirky design that characterizes Burton's design.The characters are physically well designed, his personalities well constructed and brought to live, and they are very witty and charming with those English and Scottish accents. The dubbing is excellent and helps the characters to come to live; you won't recognizer the famous actors behind the characters, which says a lot about the good job they do dubbing them.The musical numbers are brilliant and funny, hilarious sometimes.A very entertaining engaging animation movie for both adults and youngsters - Very sweet and funny despite the title.

Classic Tim Burton.,"Review:
'Corpse Bride' is a British-American stop-motion animated dark-fantasy film directed by Mike Johnson and Tim Burton. I've seen parts of this movie multiple times but have never fully watched it through until now. If I am being honest, I'm not the biggest Tim Burton fan and I can't really put my finger on why that is. His movies seem to be the same dark concept with different stories. Let's look at some movies that his name is under. We have 'Corpse Bride', 'Frankenweenie', and 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' and these are just his stop motion films. None have any gripping elements to bring viewers in to start watching it let alone continue through the runtime. However, out of all the Tim Burton stories ""Corpse Bride"" is one that I could see myself viewing again.
We start the movie out being introduced to Victor (Johnny Depp) and his odd mother and father. We learn that he is to be married to the daughter of a thought to be known wealthy family's daughter; Victoria (Emily Watson). When the rehearsal for the wedding goes awry, Victor sets off to the woods to practice his vows before the big day, only to become married to an undead bride when he places his ring on the corpse's finger, thinking it was a branch. Now, locked into the commitment of marriage to a dead woman named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter) and trapped in the land of the undead, Victor must find away out of the marriage and look for a way back to the land of the living.
A big positive for this movie is the voice acting. It may not seem like a big deal, but having the wrong voice come out of a certain character could throw off the whole film and everybody in this movie did a fantastic job bringing their characters to life. Although, Helena Bonham Carter does such a great job giving her character personality you almost want Victor to end up with her at the end of the movie when I don't think that's the intention of Tim Burton.
I was also a fan of the musical choices in this movie. I thought it brought a much-needed energy to the overall story and was executed fully. The one thing that spoke most to me and what I thought was a brilliant concept was that fact that when the movie is in the land of the living it is very dark, and everybody looks miserable. When the movie is taking down in the land of the dead it is colorful, and everybody looks happy. Now, I don't believe that the movie is saying if you want to be happy be dead. It's just telling a realistic view on life, not everybody is happy, and maybe the dead are happy, and we shouldn't feel so scared about death when it comes.
Overall, this is classic Tim Burton and if you're a fan of his you will love this movie. It has a dark sense of humor and tell a story of death, love, and sacrifice.

Tim Burton did again!  a magnificent approach in bringing stop motion animation and romanticism into one.,"Tim Burton's Nightmare Before x-mass wan an awesome work in stop motion animation, making me and countless others, watch it again and again. I thought , it couldn't be out-done. but he did it with Corps Bride for sure. it premiered at out campus at the university of new Mexico, and we all waited some three hrs to get to see it!.the movie is full of deep life's sentiment and philosophical messages with an end result that it brings you dropping tears at the end, though, with a perfect feel of resolution. in bringing the dead and living together, you're really not sure which way the story is taking you, an art of keeping it in suspense as this movie does so skilfully to the end. and when it's least expected, the resolution comes with a very sentimental act and comment by the murdered bride. it certainly touched my heart and soul, more than one way. I am brave to admit that this movie became another one of Tim Burton's works that I watch repeatedly, I'm not gonna say how many times!! the music, in particular, the piano piece, comes in at a very perfect time where groom is awaiting his living bride, while sitting at the piano. a beautiful , yet , simple piece on piano, puts you at a perfect moment and harmony with what's happening as the story unfolds in front of your eyes",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very sweet,I think this movie was sweet and had some flair I did enjoy here and there but other parts were meh. Like ok so I did enjoy this movie a lot and I think it had a very sweet plot and I can say I lowkey relate to Emily a bit I do really enjoy her character. And in the land of the dead certain scenes had a really fun flair I enjoyed. The songs were cute that the thing with this movie it's very cute. Overall though there was much to it I guess. It's really short so it's not horrible in that sense but idk it doesn't give me much to chew on if that makes sense like I'm leaving it feeling that was nice but idk if I'll come back to it again maybe once if someone told me to and they really wanna see it like I wouldn't complain but it's not a movie I'd come back to on my own accord.

"CORPSE BRIDE (Tim Burton and Mike Johnson, 2005) ***","The second ""animated"" feature-length offering from Tim Burton (after 1993's THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas which he only produced and co-wrote) is a delight: jaunty, funny and macabre in equal doses with impeccable vocal characterizations by the usual coterie of Burton regulars (Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Michael Gough) and a couple of welcome new inductions (Joanna Lumley, Emily Watson and Richard E. Grant).The musical numbers, courtesy of perennial Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, are quite sprightly and give a cheerful boost to the ostensibly grim goings-on. The story is the stuff of fairy-tales with the usual assortment of shady relatives, and villainous suitors, so what ultimately sticks in the mind is the quirky supporting characters, particularly the maggot's perfectly-etched Peter Lorre impersonation (Enn Reitley).Although, at this remove, I'd say that I enjoyed THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas slightly more than CORPSE BRIDE, it doesn't lessen in any way the latter's remarkable technical achievements, its boundless inventiveness and undoubted entertainment value.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A good film, but something is missing.","The film is enjoyable, but it leaves you wanting more. There's a sense that the story could have been richer, with more depth to the characters and plot. The visuals are impressive, but the script doesn't fully capitalize on the potential of the premise.The movie introduces Emily as a desperate corpse seeking a wedding, but fails to explore this character beyond the surface level. Her backstory is presented, but there's no real development or growth. The plot is thin, and the overall execution feels weak.Victoria could have been a great character to be explored, but they failed. The few times she appears, she isn't that useful. Of course there is the fact that she fought to help Victor but she could have done much more than that.Victor deserves some spotlight too. The decision to focus almost exclusively on Emily ended up harming the development of other characters, like Victor and Victoria.

the ruling class as opposed to the afterlife,"There's a couple of things to say about Tim Burton's ""Corpse Bride"". It's an impressive achievement in stop-motion animation, and the voices fit the characters perfectly. But I'd say that what's more important is what it says about the class structure in 1800s Europe. Set in an unidentified village - it could be anywhere in Europe, despite the English accents - there's an arranged marriage planned between the son of a nouveau riche couple and the daughter of cruel aristocrats. It turns out, after the son gets whisked away to the Land of the Dead, that this place is livelier than the ""alive"" place. There can be no doubt that the ""nice"" world of the aristocrats was a facade (it's worth noting that Johnny Depp also played James M. Barrie, whose ""Peter Pan"" constituted a rebellion against the world of the aristocrats).So I'd say that's that movie's real strength. It has a creative plot, but the indictment of the aristocracy is the important thing. Along with Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Tracey Ullman, Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Michael Gough (Alfred in the 1989-97 Batman movies) do a fine job with the voices. I recommend it.As for Burton's disliked 2012 adaptation of ""Dark Shadows"", I interpreted it as a look at the political situation in the early 1970s.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Depp and Bonham-Carter make for a lovely duo in spite of the origins and alignments of their characters, proving once again that Tim Burton knows what he's doing.This is one brave film maker. He exhibits no fear in conquering an ages-old story, a well-loved franchise, or in introducing something never seen before. He is fearless and uniquely creative, and everything (so far) with his name on it has been creatively different in its execution, with or without a slick production style, including this, the Corpse Bride.

"Outstanding style, slightly flawed plot","Undoubtedly, ""Corpse Bride"" is a masterpiece with unique charm in artistic style. The perfect combination of stop-motion animation and Gothic style makes every character design in the film exquisite and every scene vivid. Watching the film is like strolling in a mysterious world that is both fantastical and beautiful.However, there are still some shortcomings in the plot. Limited by the approximately one-hour duration, the rhythm is a bit rushed. The portrayal of character relationships is not delicate enough, and there are too few interactions among characters, and the emotional foreshadowing is relatively insufficient.

I really like the fact he is still working with Michael Gough (the beloved Alfred he worked with in the original Batman and its sequel), the animation was just as good as in the aforementioned The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Danny Elfman's music was again much appreciated (since Tim Burton and Danny Elfman are one of the ultimate film-making dynamic duos).

Exquisitely crafted. But don't look for substance.,"I'm continually disappointed with Tim Burton. In my opinion, his best work is behind him. After a promising slew of films in the late '80s and early '90s, from Pee Wee's Big Adventure to Edward Scissorhands (and, to a lesser extent, The Nightmare Before Christmas - which he didn't direct), it's all been downhill from there. Granted, ""Ed Wood"" was an interesting, if slow-moving pet project which boasted knockout performances from Johnny Depp and Martin Landau. But fast-forward to 2005. It's been a busy year for Burton, with two films released within a period of less than 4 months. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was a visually impressive (that becomes a given with all of Burton's films), but ultimately unsatisfying experience. With the promise of a stop-motion follow up to The Nightmare Before Christmas, the disappointment of ""Charlie"" could be overlooked. However, ""Corpse Bride"" is another brilliant exercise in style, that falls short in the substance category. The story is far from engaging, the pace is slow, and Danny Elfman's musical infusions fall flat. As an aside, Danny Elfman has paralleled Burton in his downward spiral - when was the last great Danny Elfman score you heard? For me, it would inevitably be the memorable score and songs from ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" And that is where ""Corpse Bride"" disappoints the most. It pales in comparison to the former. The characterizations are dull, the plot is nonexistent, and the music is derivative (again on Danny Elfman's case -he's recycled an Oompa Loompa tune here, as if we wouldn't notice!). That isn't to say that the film isn't watchable, or well-crafted (the animation is painstakingly realized through the analog magic of stop-motion). But from Burton, we've come to expect more. Mr. Burton - it's time to turn off the auto pilot, and deliver something you promised us over a decade ago.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Can everybody just give Tim Burton a break!,"I have been to many sights discussing Corpse Bride and to all you people who didn't think you got your moneys worth, you don't know stop motion animation. Give Tim Burton a break already. I have heard enough of this b.s about oh there was only a few snickers, oh there was no plot, oh the characters were so undeveloped. I too love the NightMare Before Christmas and was obsessed with it as a child, and now that Tim Burton has made another stop motion classic I, and MANY, others couldn't be happier! I know you had high expectations and were very excited about the movie, but once you saw the movie you couldn't grasp Tim Burton's style of story telling. And as for forgettable songs, I cant get the songs out of my head. So say what you want but I say that Tim Burton's Corpse Bride has just become a timeless classic that all families can and will enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Wonderful visually, but less than average in all other respects","This film definitely has Tim Burton's visual style behind it and the animation work is some of the best I've ever seen.Unfortunately, that's all that stands out. The plot is thin and has no real depth. The songs prolong the movie but don't really add or explain anything and aren't particularly interesting musically. The movie would have honestly been better off without them.The voices were well done in for all of the characters and the singing was done well. I thought that Johnny Depp did particularly well as I never heard his voice stand out throughout the entire movie. He was playing his part and the character felt like a new character and not just another version of Depp.Despite the good voice acting, I didn't care especially about any of the characters either way. The protagonist(s) have very little real motivation or dilemmas and the antagonist(s) are laughable. The characters are shallow and I don't feel like they or the world they live in exists for anything more than this movie.If this movie had been presented as a 30 minute short about, say, an old fable, then it would have been much better. As it is, it's not really worth seeing in the theater or even seeing more than once unless you really love claymation. Well, not even then. Just buy a Wallace and Gromit DVD or The Nightmare Before Christmas. You'll be much happier.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tim Burton's Finest!,"I just saw this movie yesterday (Sept 16th) and........WOW!! This movie was just brilliant! Everything from the characters, to the visual presentation, the camera angles, the jokes and the songs!! It was like watching another take on Night Before Christmas. (With less songs thought) All the characters are very interesting and charming in their own little way. The jokes and gags are also worth mentioning, everything from a head waiter to a second hand store. It's very clever and well thought out. And these songs are some of Danny Elfman's best work yet! Excellent beats, fun lyrics, and.......well, I could go on, but all I'd be doing is repeating myself. So let me close by saying, for all you NBC, Tim Burton, Danny Elfman and undead movie fans out there, this movie is Definitely worth checking out! ;)My favourite character is Bonejangles! He's awesome! ^_^",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Alive and kicking,"Johnny D does his best to impersonate Hugh Grant and he does it quite well actually. You can't really fault the voice acting at all, they all seem to have been appropriately cast.I did like the characters and the story was enjoyable enough, if not as good as 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (1993), which just had that certain something extra.It's good to see animation of this sort as it seems to have been lost to us lately in favour of CGI and it's such a shame. The puppets and claymation productions had so much more character and quirk.I would be quite worried about showing it to a very young audience and I'm not sure that an older audience would necessarily appreciate it. I think it's hitting around the 9/10/11 age mark, but without that X factor it probably wouldn't hold much for anyone other than Goths.The songs aren't quite as fun either. It was always going to be difficult to compare it to the cult classic of ""Nightmare"", perhaps it's the naivety and cruder nature of the 1993 production which was more charming?641.15.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sweet, not Scary","Corpse Bride to me was the 2nd most anticipated movie of this year and it is better then anyone could expect. The mix of Johnny Depp, Danny Elfman and Tim Burton has had 2 successful movies this year and that includes this beautiful film. Helena Bonham Carter was the perfect choice to portray the Corpse Bride and Johnny Depp perfect as Victor, the timid main character. This film is not scary and though that's coming from a big fan of Tim Burton I know people who got scared of Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" that liked this movie and thought it was sweet so that's saying a lot. The plot is entertaining and the script was written very well. Some people are planning on comparing this to The Nightmare Before Christmas, listen, there is no comparison. Two totally different story lines and plots! In my opinion nothing can beat the Nightmare Before Christmas but this movie did come close.

"Good animation, lame story","I used to be scared of this film as a child. I used to shield my face from the DVD. Watching it as an adult, I can't see why. This film has lovely animation, camerawork and colour grading. I also think for the most part the character designs work well, although there is something odd putting about how large their eyes are. There were some beautifully composed visual sequences. I also thought that the background music was enchanting, this cannot be said of the sing tracks, however, as they are unmemorable and not very fun. The story meanders around, lacking focus and the climax is disappointing. Some of the sound mixing is a bit off, especially at the beginning, you can't really here the dialogue very well, this also happens during a musical number, which makes it even less memorable. Honestly with a better story and songs, the animation team can and has made far superior films.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"He overdid it!   Too ""Burtony"".","Seeing this movie is no different an experience from seeing any other Burton's movies.I rate Batman and Beetle Juice as masterpieces, but now I'm not too sure about his animated films.If a director uses a formula too many times, it tends to wear old. I'm personally tired of short, crooked figurines singing around and black and white curly touch-ups, also I'm through with his common places and the gloomy, goth-like atmosphere.I can name at least three of his films with a similar graphic style and look-alike characters.I thing he tried to pull off a collage of his best movie making techniques and added up new visual breakthroughs, like realistic fire blazes and seamless CGI, but the movie as a whole is like a Burton's buff's wildest dream. Or in my case, worst nightmare.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Burton rises again...,"After some shorts from his early days, after ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Nightmare before Christmas"", Tim Burton strikes back with his own universe skulls and characters that look like they've been created by a Gothic Dali. ""The Corpse Bride"" contains a simple story: a fairy tale in which Snow White has her cranium inhabited by a talking worm (sort of a Jimmy Cricket from the afterlife), and lives surrounded by coffin-shaped furniture... The musical acts are played by black widows and skeletons instead of dwarfs and teapots... Walt Disney having fun in the Ghost Train, that's what ""The corpse bride"" looks like... There's no doubt that Burton really enjoys this kind of projects: he doesn't have to deal with actors, or with the pressure of the big studios...Humor and romance delightfully macabre, for the eldest and for the young ones. This is the Tim Burton we love, not that one who makes awful remakes of Hollywood classic movies.*My rate: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"The ""Corpse Bride"" lives!!!","As a big fan of Tim Burton, it has been pleasing for me to see his work go from strength to strength in recent years, especially after the much-criticised ""re-imagining"" of ""Planet Of The Apes"". What's also pleasing is how much he can change his focus on when it comes to particular audiences. In the case of, say, ""Ed Wood"", we have a mature adult audience against the family-based ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory."" ""Corpse Bride"" fits into the latter category like a well-fitting glove. Like ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" before it, ""Corpse Bride"" is a wonderful stop-motion gem filled with Burton's typical grotesque characters and Gothic, dark and often very funny humour.The tale is fairly simple - Victor Van Dort is arranged to be married to Victoria, whose parents are grudgingly setting up for marriage because they are broke. Victor, being a quiet, timid sort of guy, is made worse by the fact that he falls in love with Victoria almost straight away, and so can't say his vows properly during the rehearsal. Practising with a few twigs in the woods, he inadvertently marries the Corpse Bride, who whisks him away to where she lives in the Land Of The Dead. Now not only does Victor have to try and escape, he also has to try to stop the villainous intentions of Barkis Bittern, whose ideas of marrying Victoria are not all that innocent...The animation is superb, no question about that. In fact it's refreshing to see, along with ""Wallace And Gromitt: Curse Of The Were-Rabbit"", the return of stop-motion after a lengthy wait after the last masterpiece of this type of animation, ""Chicken Run"", and before that ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and the ""Wallace And Gromitt"" shorts. In fact, it's nice to see Burton taking a risk with an art that is certainly considered dated in this modern-day age of Pixar and Dreamworks CGI films.The voice cast is outstanding - Johnny Depp as Victor gives his usual brilliant Johnny Depp best with an English accent that sounds like a quieter version of Ichabod Crane from ""Sleepy Hollow"", another Burton film. Burton's other regulars are all here: Christopher Lee and Helena Bonham Carter, who gives a magnificent performance as the Corpse Bride with genuine feeling and emotion. The rest of the British cast - Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney as Victoria's parents, Tracy Ullman and Paul Whitehouse as Victor's, and Emily Watson as Victoria - all are wonderful. As is Richard E Grant as Bittern, though I do feel we don't see enough of him.The music is typical Danny Elfman - spell-bindingly beautiful and haunting. Like Tim Burton and animation, Tim Burton and Danny Elfman just connect so well. What I do feel was lacking was a few more songs, especially after the triumph of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" which was, to a large extent, sung. Still the songs here are fairly good, though none are as catchy as the ones in ""Nightmare"". It's actually nice to hear both Paul Whitehouse and Helena Bonham Carter singing!In fact, and this is my real moan, I actually thought that the film was a little too short at 74 minutes. Although Burton was obviously going for the family audience, there are some Disney films which are longer than this. It left me wanting more, and where that is generally a good thing, I felt it rather negative for this film. There are also parts of the story which some little children won't understand exactly - they may find it a little scary as well, though Burton's dark humour is enough to make this fear diminish quickly.""Corpse Bride"", despite it's length, is a wonderful film. Along with Aardman, Tim Burton has breathed new life into stop-motion animation. It didn't win the Oscar, but I knew it wouldn't - the flaw for the film was that it was released around the same time as ""Wallace And Gromitt"", and as both were up for the Best Animation Oscar at the 2006 awards, I had a feeling that ""Wallace And Gromitt"" will clinch it. A pity, because I do believe that this film would have very much been an Oscar winner.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fair to Middling,"By this time we know what to expect stylistically from Tim Burton: dark, macabre, and humorous. ""The Corpse Bride"" was all of that in claymation form (or something close to claymation).A man named Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) was to wed a woman named Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson), but while practicing his vows in a shadowy desolate forest, he wound up being betrothed to a corpse. He wanted to get back to future wife Victoria, but his corpse bride Emily (Helena Bonham Carter) wouldn't let him go.The movie was a bit of a musical which didn't help when it came to the storyline. It's hard to understand crucial info when it's being sung. Other than the singing I had no problem with the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Burton, you've still got it!","Tim Burton's 'The Corpse Bride' is about Victor Van Dort, a sweet man with a gentle nature, his parents arrange for him to be married to Victoria Everglot, a genuine soul like himself.

Much to Victor's shock, the stick in the ground is a finger, a finger belonging to a female corpse wearing a wedding dress. Unaware of what he has done, he has married a corpse!Very much lived up to my expectations.

Poor attempt to cash in on The Nightmare Before Christmas,"Just came from this, and I must say there is very little to recommend. The storyline is tissue thin with virtually no character development. Even the naming of the lead characters, (Victor and Victoria) shows a disarming disregard for or lack of imagination. The songs are utterly forgettable and thankfully few and far between. It would seem that given the cash cow that The Nightmare Before Christmas merchandising has become, the powers that be would make sure that this film contained enough highly recognizable characters to plaster on t-shirts, lunch pails, etc., but other than the three leads, the dog and an annoying worm, one would be hard pressed to distinguish one character from another, in fact most of the characters seemed like bland Nightmare Before Xmas rejects. The villain, whose evil plot and purpose is revealed and dismissed in three lines, should have been a memorable, darkly drawn character that young goth chicks would want emblazoned on everything from their backpacks to pantyhose, but instead is like a smarmy Saturday morning cartoon scoundrel. I counted four times when the audience seemed to genuinely laugh out loud, which sort of disqualifies this from being a comedy. There is no drama to speak of, and it could only squeak by at being a musical. Basically, it's a mess, and a sad waste of a great cast.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing but still good,"Mixed opinion about this film i think. On the one hand this film is great, the songs are great, the characters are great and the animation is great.

I only laugh at least three times during the film and they where all for the sake of it. The two really good bits would be the opening song when the parents of the Bride and Groom are singing about how everything must go right and the skeleton song where he's singing about what happened to the corps bride.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful Film,"Always being impressed with Tim Burton and Danny Elfman, I did not know what to think of Corpse Bride. It seemed a little tone downed compared to a Nightmare before Christmas. However, this motion picture had stunning animation and a musical grip that left me in awe. The characters were so believable that during the show I forgot it was animated. The voice acting was perfect, the humor was appropriate and hilarious, yet not as often as expected, because this was more of a romantic film than a comedy. I loved how they portrayed both the female characters and their status with Victor, and the conclusion to the story had me in tears. I had no idea it was going to be a musical, and while it could of contained more songs to reach a 10, I will definitely purchase this film on DVD, and thats the best complement I can give.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful Albeit Simple Gothic Tale,"Despite Tim Burton being mistaken for making The Nightmare Before Christmas, it was actually his friend Henry Selick who directed the whole movie during its entire production. In reality, Burton has only directed two stop-motion animated films as of late, and one of which is Corpse Bride, based on a 19th century Russian folklore. Given it's critical praise and decent box office revenue, I think Burton managed to pull together a quite unique and gothic movie that holds up for the most part.For starters, the actual story is pretty simple and even kind of predictable, as it centers around the nervous Victor Van Dort who is soon to be married to Victoria Everglot through an arranged family marriage. While practicing his lines for the wedding, he accidentally puts the ring on a branch that drags him to the land of the dead. The branch is really the hand of a corpse named Emily, who was murdered after eloping with her love. Now Victor must set things right before Victoria marries the villainous Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant). While the story line is pretty routine and easy to follow, the heart of the movie is what makes it shine, as the emotions drive the movie by showing and even answering what it means to marry the dead. There are even some neat concepts about entering the land of the living that showcase the film's occasional creativity. While not high in substance, the story's dark atmosphere and harmonious tone make it a breath of fresh air for anyone into mysterious romance.Character-wise, most of them are rather one-dimensional but by no means horrible. Although Victor doesn't have much personality outside of his gawkiness, the things he goes through by ending up with a risen corpse of a bride does make him somewhat endearing and it makes one feel sorry for him as he just wants to make things right with his fake and real fiance. As for Emily, she has a rather tragic yet beautiful story-arc that anyone can find touching and heart-breaking, and whenever she sings about her remorseful state, she really gives the movie some much needed heart. Even Victor's fiance, Victoria, is worth giving some sympathy for considering the financial crisis her family is in. The rest of the cast range from bland like Victor's family, to weak and petty like the antagonistic Barkis Bittern, to even rather annoying like the comical reliefs.Next, the animation is just beautiful, as it goes for a very gothic and Burtonesque visual style that perfectly emulates the macabre setting of 19th century Victorian London. Although not quite as expressive as the characters in Nightmare, or even the Aardman and Laika films, the characters stay true to their simple albeit exaggerated graphic designs and faces. One notable highlight of visual splendor has to be the Land of the Living, as it features the most imaginative looking creatures and most amount of sickly colors to bring the world to life, complete with numerous somber and enticing effects.As for the songs, Remains of the Day is quite entertaining and upbeat while serving as a backstory to how Emily became the way she is. Otherwise, despite serving the story, none of the songs really stand out to much. They are well thought out and perfectly timed, but they don't have that certain pizazz that makes them memorable enough like Nightmare. Although Danny Elfman's music score is appropriately haunting and poetic, fully embracing the bleak and lovely setting of the film.Overall, despite being rather straight forward in its story and not being perfect in terms of character or even songs, Corpse Bride works well enough as an touching and haunting macabre tale that will make any fan of gothic stories, Tim Burton, or even animation go nuts over. I recommend this movie enough to say that it's worth a watch, even if it's not quite up there with other stop-motion films in terms of story or character, but at least the visuals are gorgeous. Not sure if Tim Burton is still planning on making more stop-motion animated films, but here's to a bright future if he's still interested in doing so.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

However, it probably required more depth to the plot.It is full of top quality animation, visually comparable to Pixar and the unique characters in the town and also in the underworld are extremely lovable.The only other similar films like this are again from the imagination of Burton so you are sure to like others by him if you liked Corpse Bride.Overall, it is a good quality kids film that could keep them occupied for an hour or two.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Don't get me wrong Nightmare Before Christmas is awesome it's actually my favorite movie of all time, but there will never be another Nightmare Before Christmas.

It's a strangely uninvolving little film that features another barrage of unnecessary Hollywood voices, money wasted that could have been spent on better writers--well, it's a Tim Burton movie, so visuals are more the point here. The main character, Victor Van Dort, bears a passing resemblance to Johnny Depp-a little wasted in-joke that goes nowhere.

The animation is flawless, the story is unique to say the least.The characters each have individual traits that stick out and let you relate to them (whether you love them or hate them). What really shines though, and I can't get over, is the music. It took a few listens to get, but when I got it I was blown away. The themes that carry out thru out the movie are well crafted and arranged perfectly. The lyrics, amazing.

Unusual cartoon,"The Corpse Bride is a cartoon by Tim Burton. And that is very unusual cartoon. It contains death theme and love story and use puppet animation. You may think that this film isn't good for child, but it isn't so. And cartoons are not only for children but for adult people too.This cartoon is made in 2005. It was directed and produced by Tim Burton. The plot was written by John August and other talented people. The music, which was written by Danny Elfman, contributes to the atmosphere of this film. If you watch it on English, you will hear Jonny Depp as Victor, Helena Bonham Carter as Victoria and Emily Watson as Emily.Story shows time of conflict between the bourgeoisie and the nobility. We see two families from these layers of society that want to marry their children for themselves wants. But the hero, one of them, which is called Victor, accidentally become married the dead woman, which name is Emily. It sounds strange but interesting.Setting can be understood only by adult people. But sometimes film is too childish. I really don't understand, which auditory the film aims at. What I didn't understand were Victor's actions. Every time, when he had a problem, he ran away. But only once he decided to do something important. Either he chose what he wants or writers made error in his personality. But it's not so bad on the background of many good elements of the film.First of all, other characters were well drawn. I understand their actions. Also, you dive in the cartoon very deep and you can't get out: it has gripping plot, beautiful puppet animation and background music. I should say, is The Corpse Bride good or bad, but I don't know it. It is not awful and not perfect. But I think everybody would like this cartoon after watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The film would be great for kids but I think adults will enjoy it a fair bit too. All the cast are really good in this, Christopher Lee even makes an appearance. The film uses colour wonderfully to contrast the upstairs and downstairs worlds, one grey and colourless, the other vibrant and fun. It won't change your life seeing this film but it is pretty enjoyable and you must admire the craft.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stunning. Once again.,"I have watched this movie three times now. I still can't shake the feeling off - the same one I had when I watched ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".Although I enjoyed ""Wallace and Grommit"" - a lot - I'm happy to have found this little gem, and I do believe it should have won the Oscar. It simply takes the art of animation to a whole new level, all while carrying on a sweet little story of love, redemption, and forgiveness.Yep, the same feeling I got with Jack, Sally, and the rest of the gang in ""Nightmare"". It's more of the same - only even more beautiful this time, and a bit sweeter, darker, and sadder. ""Nightmare"" has a better musical selection (actually, it may be my favorite soundtrack), and the story has become a classic of sorts after all these years. But it'd be impossible to choose which one is better. I'm just happy both exist.Films like this, ""Big Fish"", ""Nightmare"", make you happy to be alive.10/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
So far... the BEST!,"I can't claim to be a huge Tim Burton fanatic, I really like his animated films. I think this is his best! Most of my comments will probably make those Burton devotees think about skipping this... DON'T! There's plenty sick corpse humor to keep you happy.This film is pure artwork. Tim Burton has discovered the other 60 or so crayons in the jumbo box. Very often I found myself thinking it was computer animated! There's almost a Disney feel to the movements of the Corpse Bride... 'til the magical last frame of film. You'll know what I mean when you see it. Where Shrek thought it was hip to do a bit a Disney bashing, this film is a tribute to all that is great about fairy tales. Full of wonder... drama... mystery... humor and love! Every studio who releases animated films should study this one good. Most ""family"" films are made for kids, with those pop culture references to keep adults from going stir crazy! I sat in a theater where adult couples, twenty somethings and families with kids were all laughing at the same parts! Nothing too scary.. if your kid can handle Beetlejuice, they'll love this! Too bad there's a separate Animation category at the Oscars... This could have found itself the 2nd animated movie in history nominated for Best Picture! Go see it again and again and again!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

New Arrival,"Tim Burton returns this time in full control with Corpse Bride. Set in Victorian Britain the story follows a young man named Victor(Johnny Depp. Who set enraged to get married to a woman named Victoria(Emily Watson). Victor is rather shy and kinda incompetent as he fails to enact their wedding rehearsal and blows. However, when he goes off alone in the woods to practice his vows he accidentally puts a ring on a corpse and ends up marrying Emily(Helena Boham Carter). Much like Nightmare before Christmas Corpse's bride is a film that takes that very gothic dark element and mixes it with Whimsical While not as full out to say as Nightmare, It has this very clever contradicting style to it. As you show off these two separate worlds Victor is torn between Seeing how The world of the living is almost absent of life from its stiff movement of everybody to the noticeable lack of Color and emotion. As opposed to the world of the dead very everything is filled with Color and Energy. Almost like is saying that life and all its obligates are kinda tiring and death is a kinda that release from those hardships to just be free. While the characters aren't bad the voice acting from everybody is great such as victoria's father and Christopher Lee who plays a pastor. I will say that Victor is not the most interesting lead, but I love his reaction to everything. Emily is charming and Sympathetic victor lies anybody is freaking out and not okay with this, but she sees no problem at all and she is just happy with the idea. It does a fine job of humanizing her. The soundtrack is good though the songs aren't really what is most memorable, I would say it's more the scenery background music. Plain and simple the sets and models are great the sylizilze and very particular designs. The models are designed with unique especially, of course, The Corpses bride and the dead.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A mystery film in the spirit of Tim Burton,"Corpse Bride is a combination of comedy, horror and drama in one film. Mystical puppet cartoon was directed and produced by everyone's favorite Tim Burton. The composer is also a well-known Danny Elfman. Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp voiced the main roles.The story is set in the late 1800s in a Victorian village. Victor and Victoria are betrothed. But when things go wrong at the wedding rehearsal, Victor goes into the woods to practice his vows. When he say them correctly, he realize, that the branch on which he have put the ring is a finger of corpse bride - Emily... So, two brides, one groom, what will be next?Cartoon is very mystic: life in afterlife world, the abundance of excellent soundtracks and the piano, runaway hands, indecisive Victor and dreamy Emily, the horrific killing - all of this give a kind of flavor. Animation fully puppet, you will be able to enjoy the work of operators(dolls and the world is very detailed, what you can find only in some cartoons)I thoroughly recommend Corpse Bride. The audience will spend an hour and a half with pleasure, because all of Tim Burton works will not leave anyone indifferent. I think, you like the funny and horrifying atmosphere.

"A creepy, spooky, fantastically done non stop animated cartoon for both kids and adults","***1/2 Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Depp Roy. Directed by Tim Burton. Burton makes his second trip to the underworld even better than a Nightmare Before Christmas. Of course casting his buddy Johnny Depp to play the shy Victor Van Dort who on the day of his wedding vanishes and accidentally marries the beautiful yet dead Corpse Bride (Carter). She takes victor on a wild rush through the underworld where he sees life after death. Burton yet again does a fantastic job at animation with his team.

Just Burton,"I saw this one today and found it very amusing and charming. Not the best thing out there, but it was quite entertaining. Anyone who has seen Tim Burton's previous works will know what to expect from this one. The stop-motion animation was a lot more fluid than in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". Johnny Depp's voice was perfect as the main character. Recommended for those who desire to see something a little creative and different, but it might not be for everyone. Although some people can found, joyfully brilliant animation and wonderful music are unfortunately muddled by a boring plot and depressing and empty characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Movie about death isn't as interesting as it may sound,"""I do"". Those are two words that Victor Van Dort just can't seem to say. He practices and practices but saying his vows aren't an easy thing for him to do. Perhaps it's because he barely knows her and doesn't love her. Or because he is a nervous wreak. Which is it? Either way, it clearly isn't going according to plan. Victor wanders off into the forest and while practicing his vows yet again, he finally gets them right. Unfortunately, it happens at a very inconvenient time. A dead woman, buried in the ground, has been waiting for the perfect man to come and say the exact words that Victor said and she believes it to be for real. She brings him into the world of the dead which is not at all what he is looking for. Tim Burton's idea is a strange and creative one but, to me, there was clearly something missing. Johnny Depp does a mediocre job playing the selfless and kindhearted Victor but that's just it; its mediocre. Same goes for Helena Bonham Carter as the corpse bride and most of the other voice actors. But as I said, Tim Burton's ideas are creative as usual, and the animation that he hadn't used since ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", works well here.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Film - Burton Produces A Great Film,"A great little film, i say little knowing that the work that must have gone into this is huge, everything was perfectly animated, not only the characters but the surroundings were perfectly done everything from the little church to the one eyed skeleton were done to perfection.And the direction by Burton was flawless, the film was put together so nicely and it really does make for a great film to watch whether it be with kids or adults. The storyline is nice and the actors played their parts perfectly, Depp who always seems to take on his roles with pure perfection again did not disappoint. As well as Richard E Grant who's chilling voice was perfect in the film, and Carter as the corpse again a nice soft voice and greatly played. The songs were very entertaining and the little jokes here and their again were good fun to watch. And to actually see the story unfold was one of the best bits wondering what the ending would be, which is why this is such a good film.I still think there could have been more to make this better but even so this is a well put together, with acting and surroundings and story done perfectly, i will gladly watch this film time and time again and so should you",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A very enjoyable movie,"I gave this movie a score of 7, but I think I should point out that I see a difference between a ""negative"" 7 (a movie that's basically good, but suffers from lamentable shortcomings) and a positive 7 (a movie that's entirely satisfying, but which could still be better), since I would consider this to be a classic example of a positive 7. I felt this movie began slowly (not surprisingly, since the animation style of the ""living"" world is less vibrant than the animation style of the ""dead"" world), but it was very enjoyable once the main character Victor transitioned to the world of the dead, and I was surprised when the movie came to an end because I would have liked it to go on longer. In all technical respects, this is a well-made film, with main characters I cared about, and attention to detail which was most impressive, and I think most viewers would be satisfied by this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Can the Living Marry the Dead?,"Once again producer/director Tim Burton has successfully created a work of unique cinemagraphic art. From the title alone, The Corpse Bride, one might conclude this film too frightening a horror flick, but fans of Burton know this is rarely the case. He has truly painted a masterpiece in this stylized animated film. Fans of all ages will surely enjoy it.It has been over fifteen years since the release of Burton's first macabre but amusing animated film, A Nightmare Before Christmas. Both of these whimsical Gothic fairy tales were made in the near antiquated art of stop action animation. Each and every character puppet, prop, and piece of scenery was crafted or sculpted by an artisan. The pieces are set up in a scene, much like a still life painting, and photographed. Each frame of the movie is a single shot with subtle changes such as the movement of an eyebrow or slight turning of the head. All of these progressions and facial expressions are done by hand, not computer, which is the norm in animation today. The puppet actor's lips and emotions must match what the live actors are saying. The work is tedious, time consuming and the end result may not be as streamlined as CGI, but every nuance and attention to detail, such as the subtle movements of fabric in the bride's veil, is ethereal and beautiful.Like most directors, Burton routinely collaborates with the same amazing talents in his films. The Corpse Bride is no exception, even though this was a relatively low budget project. The actors lent their skill just for the sake of art itself. Johnny Depp has worked with Burton on a number of films, including Edward Scissorhands, and Sleepy Hallow. Other famous voices include Helena Bonham Carter (Big Fish), Joanna Lumley (James and the Giant Peach), Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Tracey Ullman. Danny Elfman wrote the musical score elegantly. Elfman's style is similar in all of Burton's movies, but this time Victorian harpsichord music washes you into the creepy world of German Expressionism with cold cavernous foyers, slanty pointy imagery and demands an emotional response. Sometimes jazzy and vibrant, sometimes contradictory, the words of the songs tell parts of the story, perhaps not as well as in Nightmare, though. Elfman himself is the voice of Bonejangles, jazz-man and underworld storyteller. The song he sings detailing the demise of the title character is based on a Cab Callaway song. One must also appreciate the bride's maggot friend, a nice if somewhat obscure tribute to horror character actor Peter Lorre.In The Corpse Bride, a story of unrequited love is true to Burton form. He brings together clashing worlds, the natural and the supernatural. Victor, a man from the ""upstairs"" land of the living, accidentally marries the corpse of a dead bride from ""downstairs"" or the land of the dead. As soon as he unknowingly puts the ring on her bony finger, the tragic angel rises from the dead and claims her groom. Right away viewers will notice the vastly opposite and topsy-turvy reversal of worlds. ""Upstairs"", where Victor (Johnny Depp) and his intended bride Victoria (Emily Watson) live is a repressed and rigid world of arranged marriages, formality, and greedy aristocratic parents. Life is more dead than alive, and Burton has shaded this world in frigid shadows and drabness. ""Downstairs"" on the other hand, is a world of blessed freedom, festivity, and vibrant color, more alive than dead. It is a welcomed departure from the horror of the mundane.A Corpse Bride is bittersweet and sentimental from beginning to end, a seemingly silly love triangle with a bit of necromancy. As Bonejangles says, ""What a story it is. A tragic tale of passion, romance, and murder most foul."" Victor must choose his one true love between the lovely, shy, living, breathing Victoria or the giggly, but melancholy dead girl whose parts keep falling off. Does everything go according to plan? Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. This movie, like life (or death), is not perfect, and as most fairy tales go it is a bit predictable. All in all, one can forgive its flaws; enjoy its accomplishments and just delight in Burton's vision.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I really liked this movie...,"I saw this movie over the weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought the movie was technically amazing, along with having a good story to tell. There were times when I found myself engrossed in the plot that I was not thinking about what effort must have been involved to photograph the scene.The only problems I had with the movie were that the pacing of the movie seemed off. Some of the plot points seemed to be rushed. Some movies develop very slowly, sometimes too slow. This movie develops very quickly, almost too quickly. Also, not all the musical numbers are enjoyable. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" was a better movie for pacing and for musical numbers that stick with you after the movie ends.So better pacing and better musical numbers would have earned this movie a 10 from me.

"Burton, almost brilliant in an animated feature.","I guess it has all the potentials for becoming better than it was. The animation is pretty cool in Gothic and Johnny Depp's voice was clumsy and very young that fits in his character. But the only problem is, it was too rapid and almost a half-baked animated film. Burton looked like he haven't got sufficient time to make this more astonishing! The film was completely fast and unable to touch the spectators. The tale is wonderful and clear but unfortunately fast, it could've been more dramatic if it emphasizes more on the tragic love, so the happy ending is much more felt by the watchers. You couldn't ask for more, the story was sure excellent, but what I'm asking is, to make it more lasting and enduring. It could've been great but it was fine.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

This film was mediocre...,"Let me start with what was good about this film. It was visually beautiful, as was already evident in the previews. The music was stirring and fun, as is to be expected from Danny Elfman. And, of course, the overall feel was delightfully morbid. Everything I expected.The problems begin with how cheap and predictable the story was. I knew the entire story about a half-hour in. Really, the opening was quite gripping, and then after that it felt forced. ""Forced"" is the perfect word, too. It was like they were trying so hard to recreate the success of Nightmare Before Christmas that they lost the inspiration which made that movie great. The other gigantic problem was that there was only one 3-dimensional character in the whole movie. That was, of course, the title character, Emily. She was interesting. Both Victor (the main character) and Victoria (the love interest) were (though rather nice people) completely lacking in depth. They were so 2-D I had a very difficult time relating to either of them. Perhaps if the film had been a bit longer (It was only 76 mins), there could have been more time dedicated to character development. Outside of the three principles, every single character wasn't a character at all but a one-dimensional characterization. I was just plain bored with all the characters in this film.Regardless of how visually appealing a film is, what makes a film great is an engrossing story. Great stories transport us to other places, into the heads of interesting people, and they teach us things about ourselves and the world. The Nightmare Before Christmas was one such story. It was groundbreaking and beautiful, that's why it captured our attention. But it was a really great story, and that's why it captured our hearts. This film was not such a story.All in all, this film's worth a rental, or a viewing at your local theatre. But it's got no value after you've seen it once. Tim Burton has very much let me down. That's three films he's added to my crap-list, now (this, along with Batman Returns and Planet of the Apes).",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Corpse bride, to dark for kids?","Movie review The Corpse Bride is quite a good movie for a kid who doesn't get scarred easily. I remember as a kid getting very scared at the graphics and the characters in this movie. Most of it is very good, but there are quite a few scary parts. Some of the characters and designed in a spooky, scary way, trying to capture the ""just rose from the dead"" look. There is also a part where the charters are getting drunk and that might be a little explicit for a child at a young age. Emotionally bittersweet as I would call it. There's happy parts, sad parts, and funny parts. You really learn to love some of the characters. And then you really learn to hate some of the chats. It's very visually entertaining, especially for the six to twelve year olds. There are not a lot of colors, it's very bland and kept to a dark color scheme. The characters, and the set is very imaginative, and has a very whimsically feeling to every part of this movie. Burton pays a lot of attention to detail which is why this film so eye capturing. This movie would best suit kids six and up.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another chapter/episode from Brother Burton's Fairy tales,"The decision to see this film was made by a friend; since it was in celebration of her birthday, she chose both our restaurant and movie.I think many(most?) of Burton's films can be considered as modern editions of fairy tales -- more technologically advanced versions of that which -- earlier -- the Brothers Grimm and many others have collected, revised and published. These all capture recognizable human urges and conflicts followed by choices which can lead one way or the other. When the tale is finished it becomes obvious which choices have taken the higher moral road and lead to ultimately more satisfying conclusions -- and often those which would not.While my own personal enjoyment of the film was probably around a 6 or 7 level, I rated this at an 8 because I think it will become a timeless classic. My companion would have rated it a 9 or 10 which made it quite satisfying to give as a birthday package. The music by Danny Elfman was great and deserves listening to many times. The claymation (or whatever) characters were ""over the top"" caricatures but fit their roles. And the voices also matched the images quite well.IMO, this is a movie which many future generations of girls shortly before and after the cusp of puberty will replay many times and rate as a 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Visually Stunning Disappointment,"I was looking forward to Corpse Bride for the longest time. Since I am a huge Nightmare Before Christmas fan, I was expecting Bride to be another Burton classic. Unfortunately, it was anything but.Corpse Bride ranks with Planet of the Apes, in my own opinion. There was no emotional value, and the entire film felt empty and underwhelming.The music by Danny Elfman was always less than wonderful. Especially the lyrics during the musical numbers, were hard to understand, and just went on and on without any catchy beats or haunting melodies.Character development was also lacking throughout. We only get the basics for each of the characters, and everything else we have to figure out for ourselves. It is almost as if Burton and Elfman thought they could just explain everything with one song, and then just move on.Visually, though, is where I give it credit. However, that is no surprise coming from Burton. The living world is Gothic and colorless, with a cold and lifeless tone. In fact, a lot of it reminded me of Sleepy Hollow. The dead world is filled with color and life, happy characters who get along with each other, and where much of the dark humor sits in. The character design was also quite unique. All of them always caused me to laugh once or twice.If this had come from any other director, I would probably give it a higher rating. But Burton always mixes sentimentality and heart with his sometimes dark vision. This time he left out the heart, and only cared about the vision. That is why I was disappointed.I would watch Charlie and the Chocolate Factory over this, any day.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

The animation was incredible and I love how Tim Burton makes them look. I would say a fine movie to watch once, but I think that on the terms of buying it on DVD or VHS, that's a maybe.

Corpse vs. Wallace,"By now I think most of us can agree that the two main contenders for best animated feature are Corpse Bride and Wallace and Gromit. Both films are great, but my pick would be Corpse Bride.I have been a fan of both The Nightmare Before Christmas and the Wallace and Gromit shorts since I was a child, so judging between the two has been no easy task. Ultimately, however, I chose Corpse Bride. I just can't ignore the amazing animation, acting, and of course, Mr. Elfman's amazing score, as usual. In many ways, it surpasses Wallace and Gromit tremendously.Corpse Bride did have its flaws, mainly in the story. This movie is only 80 minutes. Ridiculously short, but understandable for a movie that uses a filming process so excruciatingly slow and painful. But because of its short length, at times the story seems rushed, particularly about fifteen minutes in, when Victor first meets the Corpse Bride. The entire sequence just felt to me as though both writer and director were trying to speed things along, and you never want to feel this way when you're watching something. You want it to go at an even pace. Not too slow, and not too fast.Should you see this movie? Will you like it? Hard to say. It's brilliant, and Oscar-worthy, but that doesn't mean that everyone will like it. I'd say if you've seen anything with Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, or Danny Elfman in it, then you should see this movie and you will probably like it. If you haven't, then you need to watch the trailer a couple of times and decide for yourself if it looks good. The trailer is very helpful, I promise. And F.Y.I, Danny Elfman wrote the opening for The Simpsons, and that definitely counts.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Below-average for Burton, but still enjoyable","Being a big fan of Burton, I've been looking forward to seeing this one for quite awhile. To be honest it was a bit disappointing, but still a good film. First off, I love Burton's style. Thought it was interesting how the world of the living was dark and drab, while the world of the dead was brightly coloured. Great contrast. The songs weren't bad, but very derivative of much of Elfman's older work, not only Nightmare Before Christmas. The plot was pretty interesting though, and there were quite a few funny parts, so it wasn't all bad. Overall this is a decent Burton flick, but doesn't even compare to Nightmare Before Christmas, which isn't one of his best films in the first place.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Animated Macabre,"It's difficult to find someone who hasn't heard of or seen a film that's come from the mind of Tim Burton. In a few short years, he's become a fixture of Hollywood with films like 'Sleepy Hollow', 'Big Fish', and this year's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' (all are fantastic, by the way). But for the first time, Burton pays homage to the style that put him on the map over ten years ago. He creates a tale that matches his definitive masterpiece, 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' (while he did not direct the film, he's credited with writing and producing roles in the pioneering production).Based on a 19th century European folklore, 'Corpse Bride' takes place in - you guessed it - a dreary 19th century European village. Victor (Johnny Depp) is a timid young man who has been arranged to marry Victoria (Emily Watson), and neither have met each other prior to the rehearsal taking place a day before the ceremony is to happen. With pressure from both sides of the family, Victor escapes the confines of the village and seeks a refuge in the dark and chilling forest nearby. While he practices his vows, he ends up marrying a corpse bride (Helena Bonham-Carter) after mistakingly placing the ring on a (seemingly) tree root (the scene of resurrection is authentically creepy). Victor finds himself mixed up with the Land of the Living and the Land of the Dead, where he must make a difficult and hard decision. It's a sweet tale of love lost, told in the classic Tim Burton style.Complete with an all-star cast, many of whom have already appeared in one or more prior Burton films, 'Bride' is led by Johnny Depp and real-life wife Helena Bonham-Carter. For Depp, it's his fifth time delving into a Burton piece ('Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Sleepy Hollow', 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'), and his first time landing himself in a role where only his voice is required - not a bad start I'd say. For Bonham-Carter, it's her fourth time with her hubby ('Planet of the Apes', 'Big Fish', 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'), and her contributions give her the standout performance. The supporting cast is just as good, with contributions from the likes of Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Tracey Ullman, and Christopher Lee.It's been five years since the last stop-animation feature ('Chicken Run'), and 'Corpse Bride' may just be the perfect rebuke to a growing industry of computer-animated films. It was a surprising move by Warner Bros. to entrust $40 million to Burton for the production, but it's clear that Burton is right at home in this disarmingly stunning film. He not only succeeds, he takes this 77-minute dramedy and spins it into a wildly entertaining macabre musical that's nothing short of genius. It's amazing that the most simplest of shots can be turned into a masterpiece, but Burton does just that. He once again proves his unique style, and it's undeniable, Tim's done it again.The bittersweet fairy tale exceeds on every level. Visually and atmospherically, it's another masterpiece. Burton paints death more colorfully than living, and the variations between the Land of the Living and the Land of the Dead are clearly visible, it may make one wish they were dead and could visit such a lively neighborhood where it feels like Halloween each and every day. Both the story and characters are rich, and the film progresses with such ease that the slim movie is, unfortunately, over nearly as soon as it begins. But worth noting is Danny Elfman, who has scored almost all of Burton's productions. He's had a busy year, what with 'Charlie' and now this, but Elfman finds himself with his most challenging job since 'A Nightmare Before Christmas'. Like 'Nightmare', Elfman not only scores the film, but writes a multitude of catchy and musically vibrant songs that enrich the film.It's a wholly Burtonesque feature that'll be sure to delight die-hard fans everywhere (myself included). It's stunningly beautiful and fun, but it also has a heart that's very much alive. It's a balancing mix of horror, humor, and love that'll win over the hearts of its viewers. The whimsical and eerie atmosphere is truly like nothing else at the movies today. At the hands of now-veteran Tim Burton, it soars into flight and never looks back. Sure to become an instant cult classic, it's a touching portrait of tragedy that just demands to be seen. Burton has rarely been in such top-notch form, and his 'Corpse Bride' is not only the best film of 2005, but it's the best film to come around in some time. It's not good, nor is it great. It reaches a level of pure brilliance and genius that few have ever even attempted. I haven't looked forward to dying this much in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Humor is not undead in Burton's new film,"'Corpse Bride' is an enjoying 77 minutes of an enjoyable romp through the world of the living and of the dead, full of a cast of endearing and not-so-endearing characters and occasional wit and humor. Although some of it is a little bit disturbing (dancing skeletons, a talking maggot, and the general theme of death), the film itself is light-hearted and witty. It's a generally pleasant little story with pleasant characters and events that have all gone wrong to bring them all together. (Right, so it is a little bit predictable in places, but it has enough to be thoroughly enjoyable.) I would recommend this film, and it is a good film to go and see at this time of year with the Halloween theme. Some people may find this film to be a little bit odd if they are unfamiliar with Tim Burton's films and style.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Highly average,"Animated Death never looked so good, but felt so dull. After over a decade of waiting for something as glorious and fun as The Nightmare Before Christmas I walked out of the theater last night feeling like a kid at Christmas who got a new bike with no tires. I'm left thinking either my expectations could have been too high or this movie just fell short of its intended mark.The movie and the animation are gorgeous, though it looks far too much like Nightmare to avoid comparisons and invoke expectations. The story is fairly basic and gets going pretty fast. Victor (Depp) is set to marry Victoria (Watson) in an arranged marriage. Victor is a nervous wreck about it and is a very jittery fellow. He doesn't have cold feet so much as nervous hands. Victoria is a flower in a family of poisonous weeds. She knows her duty and after meeting Victor seems very much taken with him. Its Victors nervous hands that set things in motion; while practicing his vows he mistaken places the ring on the finger of a murdered bride. From there the movie heads off into regular Tim Burton territory with fun creepy characters and imagery as Victor is pulled into the after life. Much like the world of Beetlejuice the dead walk, talk, sing, dance and are examples of how they died.The rest of the movie Victor is trying to get out of this world and back to his living girlfriend above ground. Meanwhile Victoria's parents find another suitor to replace the clumsy Victor. Once Victor learns of her new brothel he surrenders to something that's been right in front of him; He's got a wife and despite her being dead is really quite charming. He promises his love and consents to a ceremony to finalize their vows (and his beating heart). This is where the movie really shines. The dead return to the land of the living for this wedding of the afterlife. As the dead run amok and revisit old loved ones we get the only glimpse into the charm and fun Nightmare had.While the movie is actually pretty good and it is entertaining I think aside from letting expectations get in the way this movie suffers from two glaring faults; The songs and the lack of charm. The songs are like dead finger nails on a chalkboard none of them are as witty are fun as they should be to lighten such a dark movie. The lack of charm is something you wouldn't expect in a movie with Johnny Depp and Emily Watson, to say nothing of the rest of this great cast.I wanted this movie to succeed in so many ways, I love stop animation, I enjoy it even more when it's not all cutesy and has a plot. I want to see more studios pulling away from CGI animated movies and investing in such craft-work as films like Nightmare showed it could be again.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Love it!,"One word for the movie: Beautiful! Corpse bride is the best animation I ever seen. When I watched it, I didn't feel like I was watching an animation because It's too great! All movie is covered by Tim Burton's style, and ,of course Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter were brilliant like they always do. I think their voices are perfect for Corpse Bride. Every time I watch the movie again and again, I still have the same feeling like the first time. Yep, I was really haunted. It became one of my favorite movies and will never be replaced. About the movie,It only lasts 76 minutes but I could feel all in it. It opened by a very beautiful scene: a butterfly fly away and it ended by a butterfly fly away too. It's so meaningful! My favorite scene have to be the moment when a boy came closer a skeleton, everybody( and me)thought that the boy was so scare and the skeleton would harm the boy but suddenly, the boy shout: Grandfather! That's was a touching moment! And I like The Piano Duet scene too cuz it's so romantic,it maybe the most romantic scene I've ever seen. The ending, it's just beautiful and no word can describe it. Just see it yourself and you will find out what I'm talking about.. About the soundtrack, It's awesome! Danny Elfman did a good job again like he did with The nightmare before Christmas. My favorite songs are Remains of the day, Tears to shed, The wedding song. I was really surprises when I know Danny Elfman sing on Remains of the day and Helena really sing on Tears to shed. They're all awesome!!(But why Johnny Depp doesn't sing on it? I really want to hear his voice, maybe I 'll wait for Sweeney Todd) My favorite instruments are The Piano Duet, Victor's Piano solo, moon dance, main titles (Danny Elfman- King of Main Titles), Ball & soccer lounge (It's fun!), Into the forest (start slowly..then suddenly move), the Finale (perfect for movie's ending)...I have to say that I love all the soundtrack but I wish The piano Duet could last longer and have a truly ending. If you haven't watch it yet , you should go find a DVD immediately and you will not regret, cuz, like I said, It's a piece of genius!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The most bizarre children's movie ever!,"OK, let's start with the fact that I *loved* this movie, but it is, by far, the most bizarre and twisted children's movie ever made. I was discussing it with a friend of mine who argued that it wasn't a children's movie, but the reality is that it is designed for and geared toward children with MORE than enough to keep the grown-ups happy.I would put this movie on par with Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean's ""The Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish"". It's an excellent movie to bring young children into the twisted, macabre world that so many adults enjoy.I'm honestly tired of a lot of the ""safe"" and cliché children's movies that come out. This is exactly the type of movie that parents who fall outside of the box of mainstream normality have been looking for for their children for AGES.My only disappointment was with Elfman's song and dance numbers. His score, overall, does not disappoint, but after Nightmare Before Christmas, I have come to expect a little more than it seemed like he actually gave.Excellent movie for adults and children alike, but be warned, this is not a puppy and kittens kind of movie. If you're looking to bring your child (more) into appreciation of the macabre and twisted, this is the movie... if you'd rather they not find out about that sort of thing until they're older, you might consider going to see something else...~FG };^>",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Eh.,"I just watched the Corpse Bride for the second time recently and my opinion has changed much since I first saw it. This film seems like a 30 minute short artificially stretched to feature length. This would have worked beautifully as a short film.The plot moves along fairly predictable turns. I never was once surprised or intrigued with what was happening in the story. It's pretty standard fair. The songs by the usually flawless Danny Elfman are unmemorable and somewhat annoying. They seem shoehorned into the movie as filler to stretch the length. This really did not need to be a musical. I didn't like the villain much either, and not in the way you're supposed to dislike a villain either, I just thought he was tedious and once again, annoying. Most of the jokes were juvenille and just plain not funny.There is some wonderful animation in this film though. The underworld is wonderfully colorful and vivid while the real world is grey and Gothic. The voice actors do their best with what they can.Overall this film had loads of potential but it feels rushed and unfinished. This would have benefited greatly with a few rewrites.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
I loved it I loved it I loved it I loved it,"I just saw the movie and I loved it. Tim Burton is the man!!! The Nightmare Before Christmas was wonderful as was Corpse Bride. I couldn't stop laughing when I saw the dancing skeletons and when they were all singing. I loved it. As soon as I get paid, I am buying that movie!!!!!It's good to know there are still good original movies like this. It's also always good to have quality movies the entire family can enjoy. Tim Burton once again has created a masterpiece. Corpse Bride gets a 10 in my book.Johnny Depp, Emily Watson, Helena Bonham Carter, and the rest of the cast were brilliant. It's an instant classic.Did I mention I loved it!!!! Yes I did. I can't help it though. It was one of the best and funniest movies I have ever seen in my life.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Starts well but doesn't entirely maintain the momentum,"I was not a big fan of The Nightmare Before Christmas, which is why many years went by before I watched this movie. I was instantly taken by the film, which has a surprisingly quiet start for a Burton film. When things take a turn for the weird it is in a clever and entertaining way, and the three principals are all such nice, likable people.As the movie progresses, it gets more and more like what I remember of Nightmare, kind of noisy with an overload of ghoul-themed jokes. I began to just get a little bored. The film picks up for the last 20 minutes, but there's a chunk in the middle that felt overblown and directionless.There's more about the movie I like than don't like, but I wish it was more like its beginning than like Nightmare.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
What a waste!,"""Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice - wherefore art thou, Beetlejuice?"" That's actually a line from the Saturday morning cartoon show spun off from the original Beetlejuice movie - which is among one of the hippest cartoon shows ever made. As an ongoing series, it was able to develop the Land of the Dead, which could only appear as a back-drop in the original film, as a complete alternate universe. And it took chances - Beetlejuice ate bugs and vomited and even farted a couple times, while his Goth Earthling friend expressed her contempt for the boringly routine lives of her parents. It was an exercise in bad-taste-as-comic-gestalt, and it was targeted to young people mature enough to get in on the joke.All of this is exactly what is lacking in ""The Corpse Bride"". Given an opportunity to recreate the Land of the dead as a completely realized world unto itself, one would expect Burton to really give us a world we should like to visit (even if we also want to sure to leave anytime we wanted). Instead, Deadland here is again treated as a back-drop. And the story that unfolds before it is harmlessly sentimentalized and neither scary nor funny.Two definitive moments: Johnny Depp's character, supposedly a chief protagonist in the film, is not very smart, not hip at all, and incredibly wishy-washy - a complete waste of the vocal talents of Mr Depp. Second, the film's villain - a lame, predictable stereotype - if you have seen a couple Disney cartoons made after WWII, you could probably write all of his lines without seeing this film.What a waste! And stop-motion being as difficult as it is, it's entirely incomprehensible why Burton would throw it all away on such a wholly mediocre story with such dull, unattractive characters.The really sad thing is, this is aimed at children - but not the young hipsters who enjoyed the Beetlejuice cartoon show, but the great unwashed of Middle America, where people still think evolution is a dangerous idea.I suppose that, for children, this is harmless enough - but who wants a harmless movie about the Land of the Dead from Tim Burton? What a waste!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A beautiful and well executed story,"The stop motion in this movie is phenomenal, all the subtle expression changes and the like really gets across the character's emotions. The design is phenomenal of the contrast of the overworld all drab and grey and whimsical and ever energetic underworld. The core story is simple and each scene remains well paced and nothing over stays it's welcome. While simple as a narrative it works to the benefit of the movie as a whole. All the voice actors put their best foot forward with their roles and got across the emotion of each scene as well. Lastly the music tracks were for the most part stellar, the more upbeat tracks I could have done without but all the slow and somber tracks hit great.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Corpse Bride definitely Rises to the Occasion,"Halloween is almost here and there is no better way to get in the spirit than by watching Tim Burton's Corpse Bride written by John August and Pamela Pettler and directed by Tim Burton and Mike Johnson.Financial trouble in the family has forced two somewhat dull and unhappy people to be wed. Victor Van Dort using the voice of Johnny Depp and Victoria Everglot with the voice of Emily Watson are meeting for the first time only days before their wedding. Both have suspicions of one another which are demonstrated by Victor's inability to say his vows during their wedding rehearsal. This uncertainty causes Victor to stumble into the woods and change his fate forever.While perfecting his vows, Victor unknowingly slips a ring upon another's finger resulting in a marriage between himself and the corpse bride played by Helena Bonham Carter. From here the plot thickens and the magic continues to unravel.The animation in this movie is spectacular - it could almost be described as life-like if most of the characters were not dead. It is apparent through both the Corpse Bride and Tim Burton's last spooky computer animated movie The Nightmare Before Christmas that skeletons hold a special place in his fantasy world.The skeletons in Corpse Bride are very realistic and eerie. The recent dead appear a pale blue, those that have been deceased for a longer period of time have begun rotting away showing their skeletal interiors and those that have been dead for a while are nothing but bones.This movie is PG for some creepy scenes and frightening scenarios which might scare younger children and those faint at heart. However, this is a great film for everyone - not just children, families and Burton fanatics.Overall the Corpse Bride deserves three out of four stars. Tim Burton's wild imagination has proved magical once again. The Corpse Bride is not as mesmerizing as The Nightmare Before Christmas, but definitely worth adding to your DVD collection.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Immediate classic, one of the best!","This films is truly a immediate classic, plus it's so beautifully made, well organized, and just the best. Even though Tim Burton has made some dark films in the past, this a truly less dark. The story is based in France or England where a shy young man, Victor (Depp), is going to be married. His fiancé is Victoria (Watson) a pretty nice girl who has the meanest parents. At the rehearsal of their wedding, Victor is so nervous, he forgets all his vows. So they cancel the rehearsal till he learns and remembers them. One point, he is in the night of the forest, practicing them. He has the ring with him. He finishes his vows correctly, then puts the ring on a twig as if he were putting it on Victoria's finger. But by doing that, the twig was a rotten finger, thus he resurrects the beautiful but dead Corpse Bride. She is now his legal wife! He is terrified for a few days but starts to get used to her. Even though she's dead, she loves him. But Victor is worried about Victoria, who he should have married. What will happen to Victoria? What will happen to Victor? What will happen to the mysterious but lovely Corpse Bride? This is really an exciting story, it's a little grim but lots of fun. Well, I recommend you see it if you like ghost stories. But this is for all ages, kids will love it I bet. There's lots of singing (which is fantastic), dancing (skeletons actually dance), and well-picked actors for this movie. Back to music, Danny Elfman did an amazing job, the music is grim but so fantastic. It's really a wonderful film! Tim Burton did an amazing job on this one, its such a classic already!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Corpse Bride is Awesome!,"I was so excited to go see the movie since I saw the previews on TV.Corpse's Bride is a wonderful fairy tale, and one of the best films of the year!

I read quite a few bad reviews but I believe that it depends what type of movies you like.I would recommend it. I enjoyed it and you should see it regardless of what other people's opinions are. The story is sweet and simple, which gave them more time to be clever, and i cannot think of a better date movie as well. Tim Burton once again has brought a vision to life, and to make it run so smoothly on the big screen is a hard feat to follow. It is worth seeing on the big screen, or even seeing it more than once!

It's a Wonderful Death,"In 1993, Tim Burton changed the rules of animated cinema with The Nightmare Before Christmas, a dark, moving, wonderful 'toon musical.Twelve years later, he repeats the miracle with Corpse Bride(co-directed with Mike Johnson), another dark, moving, wonderful 'toon musical.The movie features Victor Van Dort(Johnny Depp), a young man who, despite being engaged to Victoria Everglot(Emily Watson), accidentally ends up marrying a Corpse Bride(Helena Bonham Carter).And that's just the beginning of a new exciting tour through Burton's original visions, which completely subvert the usual stereotypes about life and death:our world is pretty grey and monotonous, while in the underworld corpses and skeletons spend their endless time singing and dancing all night long(Danny Elfman's score and songs are not as memorable as the ones he composed for Nightmare, but still quite fascinating).Poetic, touching, funny and visually stunning, this film proves Burton has lost none of his talent and creativity.The vocal cast, including the director's regulars Albert Finney, Michael Gough, Christopher Lee and Deep Roy, not to mention the leading couple, is excellent, and some of them(Depp, Gough and Bonham Carter) are so good you end up feeling you're actually watching those actors, not just hearing their voices.Perhaps the best movie I've seen this year, at least for the moment.Everybody should see this as soon as they have the opportunity:Tim Burton's wonderland never stops satisfying the audience...",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A film to die for!,"This. Is. One. Of. The. Best. Films. Ever.Now we've got rid of the excessive punctuation, I, as a long term Burton fan, have been anticipating this eagerly since June. And I was not disappointed.An original plot line, something Hollywood is sorely lacking, excellent animation and brilliant vocal talents all combine to make this a truly brilliant film. At just the right length of 76 minutes, this could have been dragged out, but would have quickly become boring.Johnny Depp, famous for his quirky roles, does a very convincing English accent, and Helena Bonham Carter is perfect in the airy, melancholy role of the Corpse Bride. Emily Watson is sweet as Victoria, and Joanna Lumely, Albert Finney, Richard E Grant, Christopher Lee and Tracey Ullman are perfect supporting cast, to name but a few.The score by Danny Elfman is a wonderful undertone and as for the images - well, it's safe to say they breathe 'new life' into the dead.This is a must for any Burton fan and a definite one to watch for others.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The most enchanting film of 2005!,"No matter how pretty ""Finding Nemo"" looked, regardless how original the modeling clay of ""Chicken Run"" was or no matter how overwhelming ""Final Fantasy"" felt...the absolute best animation films come from the mind of cinema-genius Tim Burton. His new masterwork ""Corpse Bride"", as well as his older classic ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", uses the delicate stop-motion technique, by which handicraft puppets are carefully moved by the millimeter. This modus operandi is quite time-consuming and fragile, but the result looks utterly beautiful and ""Corpse Bride"" is a lot more elegant and enchanting than the most advanced computer animation movie! Aside from being visually impressive, Tim Burton's newest film is also extremely funny, well-scripted and very swinging! The story is set in typical Burton-world with grim forests, morbid characters and  of course  politically incorrect jokes about death and decomposition. Whilst rehearsing his wedding vows in the nearby forest, the timid Victor van Dort accidentally resurrects (and weds!!) the corpse bride who has been waiting on that same spot since she was brutally murdered on her own wedding night. Despite the fact that he feels sorry for her and wishes to help, Victor urgently needs to get back to the living before his arranged bride is given to another man. The subject matter all seems very depressing and tragic but  knowing Burton's style  it's an often cheerful and energetic film. Instead of portraying the world of the deceased as a sad place, it's a colorful party palace where skeletons and rotting corpses drink and sing all night long. Heck, their world is a lot more fun than the world of the living and you almost feel sorry for the living because their existence is so black & white. The voices for all the terrific characters are splendidly cast. Tim Burton regulars Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter do great and our director honors horror veterans Christopher Lee and Michael Gough with outstanding guest appearances. Danny Elfman's music is flawless as always and the marvelous end-sequence is the most touching moment in animation cinema ever. My only regret was that this movie is way too short  only 75 minutes  and I wished it went on forever.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful/Scary,"Well maybe not so scary, more creepy from times to times. But only in a good way. This movie is yet another great fantasy tale from Tim Burton. And it seems, that he has special skills for fantasy tales. Skills that seem to go amiss, when he's shooting Sci-Fi movies, but that's another story.Let's concentrate on this movie, a fairy tale starring his favorite actor Johnny Depp. But since it's an animated movie, it's his voice you'll get to hear. And since it's animated, Mr. Burton can again relish in big faces and big eyes. Something he is very fond of (maybe from the time he worked at Disney? I don't know, could be, despite the fact he left Disney as young frustrated animator). But it's the story that will get you excited, it's very crazy and seems to be in the same vein as Edward Sciscorhands!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too Dark to become an enjoyable memory (Screen),"Even it's my 2nd Tim Burton's of the year, proving that he is one of the finest director, Corpse's Bride is a major disappointment.Its flaws are its very dark mood and the lack of funny moments. Unlike ""Nightmare before Christmas"", which is its unavoidable reference, nothing here to balance the Gothic: a lavished town, greedy characters, a cold forest in the night, a chilly church, a sad love story... If the hope of the world of after life could bring more light, I don't find it poetic but ridiculous, tidy and boring (i don't like big band jazz). The exceptional fairy spirit of Jack Skelllington is dead, as well as the humor of the Bettlegeuse, Joker or martians....Well, except for a great score of the little Mozart (as always, and this time with a simple piano theme...), my only memory is all this sadness. As i am not depressive or Gothic, I don't think I will see it again.....",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Tim Burton has done it again!,"Tim Burton seems to be at his best with the slightly quirky, strange worlds he creates in film.

The parents seek status and money from the marriage, as are the parents of Victoria Everglot, his bride-to-be. While preparing for the wedding, he accidentally comes upon the ""Corpse Bride"", and his entire world is turned upside down! I really enjoyed the story here, the characters of Victor and Victoria are easy to identify with, the parents are easy to loathe but also to have sympathy for, and the comic relief is found everywhere to keep the dark background from overtaking the story. The animation and world created are superb, somewhat in the vein of ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", but still different enough to not be a copycat.

"Boring, uninspired and dull","I KINOW Burton can do better - this is what disappoints me most! The characters are uninteresting and really lifeless; even the living dead are really and truly dead. The Musical-Style with the singing makes things even worse. If Burton wants to copy Disneycartoons with singing and dancing,he should do so - if he wanted to make fun of them, he failed. The figures are not nice enough to enjoy looking at them - and they're not ugly enough to be interesting. I felt like looking at an introduction to a computer adventure and longed for a ""skip intro"" button all the time. ""Corpse Bride"" is not at all funny, not at all exciting, not even romantic or Kitsch... it's a pure waste of time for everybody who is over 10 years old. Even the kids will love ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" or ""Mars Attacks"" much more, I bet (like I did)!

"Clever enough, but...","...nowhere near as clever as ""Nightmare Before Christmas,"" though I'm not sure I can put my finger on why. Still, I'm not surprised that it polls well here on the IMDb, and especially with the female contingent; the ""good"" girl got her simple but goodhearted man, while the ""bad"" girl gave up what she wasn't intended to have, yet still got revenge on the party who betrayed her. Hard to argue with ""all's well that ends well."" I'm also not surprised to see that the 45+ cohort gave it the lowest marks, much lower than they gave ""Nightmare Before Christmas""---this one just isn't as clever by half (although it has its moments), which I will ascribe to Burton meddling with the directing of it, along with Elfman's average (for him) score and songs. Despite the improved stop-motion animation, which I loved, the imagery and story left a strong feeling of retreading of older material. In fact, the story itself reminded me of some old European folktale, whatever it may have been.Still, ""Corpse Bride"" has a lot going for it. The animation is exquisite and expressive, a joy to behold. The voice work is spot on, from the upper tier names like Depp and Watson right straight through to Enn Reitel's Maggot/Town Crier. Children under 12 might be a bit lost, but anyone with a love of animation will be pleased.

love it,"""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride"" is not the macabre horror story the title suggests, but a sweet and visually lovely tale of love lost. In an era when most animated films look relentlessly bright and colorful, ""Corpse Bride"" creates two palettes, and not the ones we expect. terrific movie so good would recommend it it's such a good Halloween movie I watched it as a kid and will continue to do so the movie plot is so original and even though it seems like a scary movie it isn't, it's got a whole story behind it which is truly great, and the way they designed the characters are just remarkable there's so much detail and color in everything they have put into it, it's not like anything else it's very unique and very intriguing",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
What the heck is Burton's message???,"I really looked forward to seeing the Corpse Bride, because of the nice trailer. I really did. I realized now after remembering the very kitsch and tasteless Edward Scissorhands and the cheesy and even more tasteless Big Fish, that Burton definitely is dreadfully mainstream. And his claiming that he sleeps at the Ritz in Paris before every French premiere of his films because it brings him luck (sic) did not help me in liking this man who thinks he is delightfully wacky and outside the mainstream. Anyway.So I went to see the Corpse Bride. And I got out of the cinema really angry to have paid, wasted, 8 dollars for this stupid film. I'll tell you what shocked me (because some stuff really shocked me, without even having to think about it). Roughly, the way women are viewed. Victoria, Victor's fiancée, is a nice girl, shy and kind, but OK, to the eyes of our society,(not mine)let's face it, she is completely tasteless and a bit stupid. That's one thing. Then comes Emily (is that her name?), the Corpse Bride. Roughly, a ""hot chick"" (isn't that what Burton wanted us to think?), the West Coast version of the hot chick, super big pink lips, small very small nose that makes us think she might have had surgery (maybe with the same surgeon that Mickael Jackson), a really thin and sexy (anorexic) body, but surprisingly, amazing big boobs!!!Well, the cliché of the ""perfect"" girl, at least perfect to the eyes of the basic redneck man. The film is about the struggle between the two women, one small and ""ugly"", the other one tall and ""hot"" (I'm using brackets because to me it's all so biased, this vision of what is beautiful and what is not). Another thing that shocked me: this stupid Victor, that Burton tries to introduced as shy and clumsy, innocent and sexless, who sees that two women are fighting for him, and he does not take any clear position for none of them. He likes Emily (we don't know if he has erections when he sees her, Burton's world wanting itself to be childlike -yeah, big boobs and two women for one man, that's really childlike!!), but tells her that he is to be married; and he likes Victoria (probably no erection, but who cares), but still cannot make a decision. Here it is: two women on their knees for one men...What the hell is that subliminal message??? At some point, I remember Emily the slutty making some irritated comments about Victoria, I think she even imitates Vicoria's (small and not sexual) lips, saying that oh, she is so nice and polite and etc.In the end the hot girl sacrifices herself for the ugly little girl (Glory to the fake boob hot Californian girls -ok, this one is not blonde, (because Mr Burton thinks he is doing some Gothic connoted movies, so she has to have black hair...-) .....Where is the moral in this???I sense that many people did not have the same feeling about the (subliminal) message of Burton...It's sad, because he thinks that he can make his audience swallow anything, even the bad things of today's society. Don't women have enough problems with the image they give? Do they need some so-called ""alternate"" movie maker to push the whole complex even deeper??Always have to be thinner, with more and more tendency to resort to plastic surgery to try to be perfect, and Burton glorifies this terrible vision of women (because Emily, with her ""death"" is crystallized in her perfect appearance, will never grow old, so she is the real heroin in the movie) I found all that disgusting, full of unwholesome messages... Yes, that's the word, completely unwholesome. Burton is nothing but an mainstream movie maker, in spite of what he seems to think. He seems to think that whatever he releases, people will follow him (in that he is smart, because it is actually what happens...), but I find him more and more ridiculous, and even more, pompous. His imagery is really shocking and out of place in a society that has already its flaws about the men-women inequalities. Does he want every girl to be anorexic and doing plastic surgery? You really are see-through, Mr Burton, and not everyone falls for that.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Corpse Bride: A Beautifully Spooky Fairy Tale By Tim Burton,"I heard about this film shortly after hearing about Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and thought to myself, ""Wow! Two Tim Burton films in one year, who would've guessed it?"" Then when I heard it was animated I was like, ""This sounds a little weird but okay."" Then the trailer came out and I was really impressed with the way this film will be animated. It uses the same technique of The Nightmare Before Christmas and the characters look unique and superlative. The day finally came when I saw the film for myself and I was blown away. The story of Victor Van Dort's marriage to a corpse is truly an original tale of macabre and matrimony. Helena Bonham Carter entranced my senses with her soft and beautiful voice and the music genius of Danny Elfman caught me by the ear once again with his mix of Edward Scissorhands, Batman and The Nightmare before Christmas. This film will most definitely win the award for best animated film this year at the Oscars. Good night and have a spooky evening.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
a strange love triangle,"Victor has been arranged by his parents to marry Victoria; who also is forced by her parents. Victoria's parents though have an agenda to this arranged marriage. They are falling from their aristocratic status and are verging upon being beggars; hoping to gain money from the marriage. Victor isn't in any rush to be married, but he does hold feelings for Victoria. During the rehearsal Victor forgets his vowels and makes a fool of himself. While walking through the forest he practices his vowels and while placing his ring on what he thought was a stick; he becomes married to the corpse bride; Emily. Victor is then pulled into the underworld; which surprisingly is more colourful than the realm of the living. Victor trys to run away from Emily but she is a relentless bride, stopping him from getting to the living and marrying Victoria.The Corpse Bride is a great yet strangle film on finding love in the strangest of places. Ending up being married to a cadaver is a great twist on the usual love story. Just like The Nightmare Before Christman, the stop motion animation is great, yet is more refined here and flows better and has much more detail to it. The blend of computer animation adds those touches that makes the animation flawless; its just astounding.All the character are wonderfully made. All the characters have been made to the extent that they basically become caricatures, bar from the three main leads who have been made more humanised; being that their characters are more innocent while everyone else is more jilted and two faced. The bleak, gray Victorian setting suits the story perfectly; suiting that rigid and conforming way of the Victorian life. The underworld is so bright and colourful; juxtaposing that notion there is more fun in the after life than in the living.The voice cast of Corpse Bride is great and perfectly casted. Johnny Deep is perfect as the timid Victor; he does have believable English voice. Helena Bonham Carter also is great as the Corpse Bride; making her so lively and a wonderful character. Emily Watson, Tracey Ullman, Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney, Richard E. Grant and the great Christopher Lee all flourish in their roles and really make them their own.Though this is a short film, its a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

What's that smell?,"No, I didn't like this film. I really wanted to. I was so looking forward to it. It looked wonderful. It stank.The Corpse Bride marks Burton's 2nd foray into the world of stop motion animation, a technique that produced the amazing Nightmare Before Christmas. A cult classic, if I may say so myself. One of my all time favorite movies.Johnny Depp plays the role of a bumbling fool (sound familiar?) in Victorian times, about to enter into an arranged marriage of social status and wealth. After a disastrous wedding rehearsal, Depp's Victor is stumbling through the forest where he unwittingly weds himself to the titular character of the film, the Corpse Bride (played by a sassy Helena Bonham Carter). Macabre, animated mayhem ensues...yadda yadda yadda.So what went wrong for the Bride? This film suffers from that fatal flaw that so many animated films these days fall victim to. The story, the characters, the heart, they all take a backseat to the whizz bang visuals on screen. Burton has no restraint as he dazzles us with breathtaking imagery that rival today's ubiquitous 3D fare for beauty and awe. The problem is, it gets old real fast. With no story to feast on, no characters to care about, it got boring. The chuckles and giggles that came from the predictable sight gags and puns petered out to silence halfway through.A classic case of all style and no substance. Slap in a number of forgettable musical numbers that merely seem to be an excuse to create even more on screen silliness and you have a bona-fide yawn fest.I know this all sounds harsh, but it was Burton himself who set the bar so high his first time around.

"""Why go up there when people are dying to get down here?""","When Maggot says: ""You don't know me, but I used to live in your dead mother."", you really cannot miss the man behind these lines. It is obvious that dark knight Tim Burton got something to do with it and his ""Corpse Bride"" is real winner. Visual masterpiece and I'm very unhappy that Academy didn't award this genius because his animated movie is so different from all others. But that day will come when Burton is going to get an Oscar. I'm sure of that.The story is about Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) who has to marry a woman named Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson). The marriage is set up by their parents before Victor and Victoria even get to know each other. Victor jumbles his vows so he goes into the woods to practice. When he finally gets it right, he says his vows correctly and places the ring on a weird looking twig in the ground. That happens to be a hand of Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter), so Victor is now married and he is taken to the Land of the Dead to join his new wife.Only Burton could direct this bizarre but brilliant story (with help of Mike Johnson) and this is movie for everyone to watch, with so many dark humor and so many funny situations. All funny moments are coming from the characters that are made perfectly and really every one of them has something special that makes him different from other. Parents (Everglot and Van Dort) are made like their only wish is to get some profit from marriage of their kids. Everglot's get money and Van Dort's get reputation. Barkis Bittern is very negative character and he's a true villain. All other characters are opposite of him. Victor is innocent and good, just like Victoria. Corpse Bride (her eye pops out just like Ragetti's in Pirates) has heart at the end and she's not that ""dead"" as it seemed. Elder Gutknecht, Skeletons, Black Widow Spider, Maggot and other crew are simply brilliant. Actually there are so many emotions in every character that that cannot be described by words.Burton connected everything with other movies. He assembled his usual cast - Johnny Depp (their fifth collaboration), Helena Bonham Carter (his wife), Christopher Lee, Deep Roy, with few new faces (Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Jane Horrocks, Paul Whitehouse...). I just have to say that all actors made their characters alive. Everyone did excellent job. Some scenes from Pirates can be seen here (eye, hand). Victor (Depp) lets butterfly at the beginning of the movie (in ""Sleepy Hollow"" Depp lets bird out of cage). Have you noticed that main characters have names Victor and Victoria (name of Blake Edwards musical comedy starring Julie Andrews; name comes from German original). Also Burton uses one of the most famous movie lines : ""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn!"" (from ""Gone with the Wind"") when old skeleton sees his alive wife. And there are lots more very funny and innovative scenes to be seen in this one.Special thing is music. Danny Elfman is great and all his musical numbers are simply outstanding (from first when parents are singing to my personal favorite when skeletons are singing ). Elfman is going to win that Oscar statue, just like Burton and Depp will one day. Oscar is not measure of a great director, actor or songwriter but I'm purposely mentioning Oscar as the higher standard of every person involved in movie. But as long as they keep up doing their job in the way they done it till now they are all winners in my eyes.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Corpse Bride,"I recently received this as a DVD for an early Valentine's Day gift. I watched it today, and thought it was great. It is up there with The Nightmare Before Christmas(1992) as a technical masterpiece. The major standpoint is Burton's return to stop motion, only this time around, there are a few minor computer effects. Great musical numbers from such characters as the Corpse Bride, Bonejangles, and the Widow and Maggot. Interesting storyline and lively characters make the grim and strict atmosphere more enjoyable and loose. Good voice acting and transition throughout. Very few gray areas, and a few laughs as well. Overall, a good picture from Burton. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not as good as I expected,"""Corpse Bride"" wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. I am usually a big fan of Tim Burton's work (and Danny Elfman's music) but ""Corpse Bride"" just didn't do it for me.Maybe it's that I didn't realize it was a musical, but the music caught me completely off guard. I had not expected that at all. The score was nice, but the songs were rather painful to listen to with less than stellar singers and extremely repetitive lyrics. In short, I have no plans to rush to the store and purchase the soundtrack.I've never seen ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" so I have no clue what it's like but I really, really hated the animation. It was awkward and took away from the plot (and not in a good way). I suppose that it was all done on purpose but still... It's full of the quirkiness that defines Tim Burton's work. Which can be a good thing depending on whether or not you enjoy that quirkiness. But I did really like how the Corpse Bride turned out. Very pretty. (If you can say that about a corpse...) =P For the first 20 minutes or so of the movie were really painful for me. The first song almost made me turn it off and the distracting animations were beginning to give me a headache. But I stuck with it long enough for the plot to begin (which in my opinion, took to long). The only reason that I kept watching was because I really couldn't predict the ending. Who would Victor choose? The Corpse Bride or Victoria? Victoria is his love, but he is also attracted to the Corpse Bride, making her the one he *should* marry according to Hollywood standards. (No I did not just give the ending away) in case you were wondering. The ""twist"" at the end concerning the Corpse Bride's murder didn't surprise me at all - I saw it coming from a mile away.""Corpse Bride"" wasn't all that bad - but it definitely wasn't as good as I thought it would. Tim Burton really let me down on this one. ""Corpse Bride"" earns itself a 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
I had SO many expectations...,"I didn't even pay for this and wanted to walk out. Maybe it was the smell of B.O, or the really bad theater, and then I realized, it was the REALLY BAD PLOT. Oh Tim...

Now, let's not play the whole sameness of names/sameness of personalities, but these characters could have fallen of the face of the screen and I wouldn't have been fazed. (This is coming from someone who STILL wants an Edward Scissorhands 2 where Edward falls in love with a granddaughter of Kim's who is an artist and she makes him hands--I spent all of seventh grade dreaming of this!) The only lovable and sincere character was the dog. The story wasn't even interesting. I'm sorry Tim, but whatever you had with Nightmare, didn't happen here.

Another one of Tim Burton's brilliant works,"Tim Burton may have flubbed with the remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Big Fish, but he certainly pulled no punches with this! If you liked Nightmare Before Christmas (NBC), you're going to love this! Let me count the ways: - More stop-motion animation! Difficult to do, VERY time consuming, and definitely a labor of love in this movie as well.Definitely a very cute, Gothic-y romance story - heavier on the romance than NBC, but it goes every bit as deep into the underworld atmosphere in this movie as they did with Halloween Town, and in some places, explained it further.Excellent musical score! - Gorgeous sets and Victorian atmosphere! - You'll definitely become attached to the characters - I won't give away the ending, but rest assured, you won't be disappointed! Bottom line, I found no flaws with this movie. Not something for the youngest children to go to, but if you're a fan of Tim Burton, animation, NBC, or just in need of a a romance film without excess sappiness, this just may be the film for you.

Beautiful death awaits...,"Nowadays, when every animated movie is made in computers, it's a fantastic relief that film genius Tim Burton still has his mind on puppet animation. Corpse bride would have been great in computer animated 3D too, but it would not have the soul that the puppets bring up to life in this masterpiece.Danny Elfman's beautiful songs and score fill almost every moment. From the piano solo by main puppet Victor to the last ending melodies, and I love every tune.The voices of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter almost seem to belong to the characters, and when Danny Elfman himself takes over the show with his bone-jangle singer everything feels just...right! Corpse Bride might be a bit short, but with a spirit as magical as this it doesn't matter.

'Mayhew! Silence that blasted coughin'!!',"Breathtaking animated beauty! Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is put under an arranged marriage by his parents with the similarly shy and sweet Victoria Everclot (Emily Watson). When Victor practices his vows alone in the woods, he inadvertently raises The Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) back from the dead, who believed he did in fact marry her. The idea was inspired by a 19th century poem and here there's a really fun contrast in the way the Land Of The Dead is represented in a vibrant party atmosphere and full of life as opposed the living who are dull and grey in comparison. Written by two of Tim's greatest collaborators John August (Big Fish, Frankenweenie), Caroline Thompson (The Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands) and Burton newcomer Pamela Pettler (9, Monster House) the script is beautifully kind-hearted and with a great balance of dark gallows humour and just plain funny lines delivered brilliant by the cast who are all distinctively grand! Visually it is astonishingly gorgeous, with trademark gothic sensibilities photographed by Pete Kozachik and a very talented film crew. The animation team are all individually very talented artists as seen in behind the scenes footage and the painstaking attention to detail is amazing. Most wonderfully, it features some of Danny Elfman's best work and a musical score that is heartachingly romantic and exciting; Victor's piano solo really struck an emotional chord for me at the age of 12 and it still does to this day",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A different take on the afterlife,"Director Tim Burton really knows how to make dark tones not seem all the dark. Look at one of his first examples in filmmaking; Beetlejuice (1988). Sure the character of Beetlejuice played by Michael Keaton was a little not your usual dead guy but there were actually a lot of laughs to be had. Same goes for this movie.The story is about shy man Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) who is having an arranged marriage with also a shy, sweet young lady named Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson). Unfortunately, Victor is rather opposed to whole idea because he just doesn't feel like he could be ready for such a commitment. So in a panic, he flees from the practice session to get some fresh air. While in the forest, he recites his marriage vows and accidentally awakens the corpse bride played by Helena Bonham Carter.Now that Victor has disturbed the dead he must make a choice to whom he will marry. All the voice actors give an excellent performance as their characters. Depp is great at making himself sound inferior and feeble as the meek Victor. Watson and Carter both play sweet female leads as well. Even composer Danny Elfman has voice role in this film. Quite rare if you ask me on Elfman's part. But his score is just as abundant like the rest of his collaborations with Tim Burton. This score well appreciated because of its sense of emotion and tone.The animation is great here too. It actually reminisces to Burton's film of The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town (1964) featuring stop motion animation. Obviously since the it was 2005 the filming techniques have become much smoother so it looks even better than before. The art department I could tell had a good time with this too. The difference between life and death are quite the opposite. Normal life is gray and dull while the afterlife is colorful and vibrant. Which could almost suggest that death is more fun but most of us don't have that kind of mentality.Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is enchanting and fun altogether. The animation is spectacular and the voice acting is wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Tim Burton, not the director he is seen as. he never was.","Why does everyone rate Tim Burton, clearly this film, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is testament to his lack of talent. why do we forget that this is the man who destroyed Planet of The Apes? anyway, my point is Tim Burton is not alternative or artistic to any degree that deserves the amount of recognition he is receiving. merely all he does with his films, is take a mainstream idea, an already conceived paradigm and subvert it slightly in order to give it an alternative edge in order for it sell better. he is the Good Charlotte of the cinematic industry. he is not a good film maker, merely good at marketing. i disagree profusely with the praise he receives for his (supposed) forward thinking artistic eye. Corpse Bride a cesspit of mediocrity that relied on a script driven by inane and poorly executed puns, and a visual style that clearly shows Burton to be plagiarizing himself. it is a sad day for the world when he is considered a master film maker and doesn't show the receptive powers of the general masses in a very good light. simply put, Mr Tim Burton is the ignorant man's Terry Gilliam.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Amazing story with amazing ending,"Tim Burton films are all very unusual and extravagant. His ""Corpse Bride"" is not an exception. This fantasy story is full of adventures. I like this film very much because of cute characters. They're like real people. Their features are the result of their past and the reason for their future.The story begins in a small Victorian town. Victor Van Dort's parents want him to get married to young Victoria Everglot, whose parents are poor nobles. In fact, the Everglots don't like this idea very much, because Victor is a fish merchant. During the wedding rehearsal he forgets his vows so Victor goes away to learn them by heart. He repeats his word aloud and put the engagement ring on a branch of tree like if it's a finger of a bride. As you guess, that branch is a hand of a dead woman, who raises up and decides that Victor is her husband now.The Overglot are worried about Victor's disappearing - they spent a lot of money on wedding and they can't postpone this event. Wait for a bit happy and a bit sad ending with unexpected turns.I like it not only because of characters, but the atmosphere and the main idea. Setting is amazing - scaring, foggy and Gothic ( black ravens are included). The comparison of the underground world and the real one is also interesting. Alive people are greedy, gray and gloomy, and the dead ones are kind, merry and happy. That makes us to think: ""What's wrong with us and why are we worse than raised corpses sometimes?"" This film can fit every audience - skeletons and corpses are very funny and they aren't detailed.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

an enchantment at all levels,"The year 2005 was excellent for Tim Burton. A few months after he filled us with joy with his stylish rendering of Roald Dahl's novel ""Charlie and the chocolate factory"", he extended the pleasure with this stop motion picture whose only fault is to be too much short. However, it's a feast for the eye and the mind.Sourced from an old legend according to which a young man accidentally has to marry a corpse bride (one recognizes Burton's inclination for myths and legends), ""Corpse Bride"" bears the trademark of its auteur, beginning with the backdrop and the scenery. A dreary, gray depiction of London tangled in Victorian values and bribery at the end of the nineteenth Century sharply contrasts with a bright, brisk representation of the great beyond animated with colorful, eccentric skeletons, living dead. Hell isn't a bad place to be, at least for th famous corpse bride who wishes to live forever with Victor. But the latter can't accept this and is determined at all costs to marry Victoria. Alas! Because they believe Victor dead, they want her to marry an unscrupulous rich man. The story is rather linear but filled with effective visual ideas, genteel humor and an indispensable dose of emotion (I must profess that I was moved when Victor was offered his cute little skeleton dog as a wedding present). And Tim Burton once said that monsters weren't so scary and felt lonely and sad. It's what we could put forward with the corpse bride who only wants to be happy through wedding.This film could be ""Beetlejuice""'s son because of the manner Tim Burton represents us death. I will just regret an end made with alacrity. But for the rest: sit and savor one more extra canonical work from an auteur.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I know you can't really compare the two movies as we all knew it wouldn't be as good as Nightmare but Christ he coulda tried harder. The voice casting,music and Danny Elfman are what make this movie really bad. The animation looks as if it has strong influence from cgi. It follows the basic Disney plot with slight hints of Burton holding the whole messy production together. Now to be honest the design and Victorian Tim Burton aspect are pretty cool even if it's just to flog crappy merchandise to a bunch of Goths. That was all that was good about that movie though which just proves as does Planet of the Apes that not everything that Tim Burton spews out for the public is actually going to be a masterpiece.

"lovely, beautiful... watch it!","You can only love this film. It's all perfect: the characters, the story, the soundtrack, the cinematography, the dubbing. My mum also, who doesn't like Tim Burton, loved this film very much. Victor (dubbed by Johnny Depp, Pirates of the Caribbean  Dead man's chest) and Victoria (dubbed by Emily Watson, Separate lies) are an engaged couple. Victor can't remember the wedding wording, and, trying it in a wood, he puts the wedding ring in a branch emerging from the ground. But the branch is a corpse bride's finger, so Victor finds himself married to a dead girl. The Corpse bride is dubbed by Helena Bonham Carter, who does a great job. Each frame emits sweet romance and dark romanticism, but it's never sugary and mawkish. It's Tim Burton to cube, you can perceive the same atmosphere as Edward scissorhands. The faithful Danny Elfman signs the splendid soundtrack and the funny songs. My favourite sequence is when Victor and the Corpse Bride play the piano, but also when Mr. Bonejangles and his skeletal jazz band sing to Victor the story of Corpse bride's sad end. The characters of the parents and the Archbishop Galswell (dubbed by Christopher Lee) are really funny. It's magnificent the comparison between the Alive ones' world and Dead ones' world. Dead ones live in a colourful and happy downstairs; upstairs, alive ones live among conventions and dullness.

While Ms. Watson has long been recognized as one of the most gifted, talented, and majestic actors working in any medium today, she proves here that there is literally no limits to what greatness she can attain.

One of Tim Burton's greatest masterpieces!,"I waited for so long that I couldn't even believe anymore that my expectations would be met by it. Thankfully, Corpse Bride didn't disappoint me. On the contrary, it's every bit as good as Burton's finest work. It has got the typical Burton-style, atmosphere and humour. How could I not enjoy it? The intro was beautiful, with the butterfly flying through the streets of a grim city, being just about the only living thing around there with some colour to it. What a beautiful art-style this movie has. I couldn't believe my eyes, it was breathtaking. Tim Burton certainly hasn't lost his touch. The first song didn't really sound that good to me(unlike other songs in the movie), but I watched it at night so I couldn't turn up the sound that high. The second time I watched it, it became clear to me how the sometimes odd lyrics(that didn't seem to fit the music at times when I first watched it), actually fit the music very well. It was just that these are kinds of songs I never heard before, so I guess I had to get used to it. The songs are constantly playing in my head now, they are truly great. The voice acting is top-notch. Johnny Depp does a fantastic job as Viktor van Dort, a nervous chap who is thrown from one unwanted situation into the next. Poor guy...Helena Bonham Carter as the Corpse Bride does a fantastic job as well, as she really gives life to the dead character. The parents are voiced by actors unknown to me, but they sound really good. Especially Viktors future mother-in-law sounded terrifying. Just like Christopher Lee as the priest, but he never fails to impress me anyway.Going back to the art style, that's really something in the world of the living, but it really impresses when you are introduced to the colourful world of the Land of the Dead. With the awesome mister Bonejangles singing a really cool song. The dead are a colourful bunch of characters too, so it's actually a bit depressing if a scene goes back to the world of the living again. But this has to be said: once the Corpse Bride gets into the picture, you are completely sucked into this modern fairy tale and when it ends you will say ""Wow, I have never seen something so amazing before, I want more!"" Before I end this review, I just want to say that Danny Elfman once again proves that he hasn't lost his touch. To me anyway, as I read a lot of people whine about his latest soundtracks. I think he gets better and better every time. His score and songs for Corpse Bride were amazing and sounded just as magical as his score for Edward Scissorhands was. What is a Tim Burton movie without a Danny Elfman score, anyway?",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A movie that you've seen countless times,"When I was at school, my teacher showed it to us in class. Later, when I was on the plane, I would watch it.

Tragic Waste Of A Beautiful Opportunity,"Let me give you a metaphor: You rub the lamp, and a djinn appears, huge and fearsome with the dust of the desert swirling in his breath. He says to you, ""Master, the doors of all the Thousand Worlds are open to you, and all that is within them is yours. Go where you please, do as you wish, for not even Death Himself shall bar your way."" And you answer, ""Could you take me to the post office? I've got some bills to send."" The Corpse Bride uses amazing technology and stunning visual mastery to do... nothing in particular. There's a lot of dialogue scenes. Beautiful, luminous, finely crafted puppets sit around in the living room and talk. This would be stupid even if they were capable of changing their facial expressions.The sets all feel like they're about five feet square. Every scene happens in a tiny little box. Other stop-motion features--Wallace and Gromit shorts, The Nightmare Before Christmas--haven't had a problem creating the appearance of scale. This one does, and I don't think it's a technical problem. I think it's a creative one.I'm not even sure why this film is a stop-motion feature at all. It doesn't need to be. The Nightmare Before Christmas pulled and stretched at reality with the bizarre things its characters were and did. The Clown With the Tear-Away Face! The Harlequin Demon whose mouth goes all around! The Two-Faced Mayor! Except for one overused joke with a man who splits in half, there's none of that in The Corpse Bride.Tim Burton and his team have completely failed to take advantage of the medium. I mean, that's why you turn to animation in the first place: to play with all the things that can't happen in our reality. They could have crafted anything! They could have put them anywhere! And all they did was create a bunch of pale people sitting around fretting.What a waste of a Thousand Worlds.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
corpse bride,"Corpse bride is an interesting and beautiful story. In this movie, Tim presents Death as something different than how we know it to be, and he tries to give us another perspective on death. As we know, everyone is afraid of death, but in this movie, Tim describes death as another world that is totally different than the living world. I think Tim wants us to realize that after death, the next life is very simple, without complications or hassles, and can even be fun! Not like the land of the living where there is a lot of spite and discrimination. In the world of the dead, the souls are one hand, they have the same feelings and concern and worry. However, in the land of the living no one cares about one another. In the afterlife, the souls live in peace, without guilt and without double- dealing. In conclusion, death as we know it is really dark and frightening and to imagine it in a positive light is very hard. However, in this movie Tim was able to erase the wrong concept of the death and inform us of a new meaning",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Properly amazed and just blown away,"I wasn't really excited about seeing this movie but my friend rented it and I could borrow it. Seen quite a few movies from Tim Burton now so I thought it couldn't be that bad. And indeed it wasn't. The movie starts rather slow (not King Kong-slow so don't worry ;) ) but keeps a very nice pace. Normally I stop a movie once to get some drinks but I just couldn't stop it. I was hooked by the beautiful story along with the truly awesome animations. It captivated me in a way I've not felt for a long time (well not that long, but justs sounds better), I can't put my finger on it but the movie just works, and that's what movies should do and directors should be able to accomplish. Corpse Bride is really a fine example of Burton's talent and I'm so glad I didn't ignore it and neither should you (you probably won't find a cure for cancer anyways in those 90 minutes you'd lose if you don't like it after all).Totally off-topic: In my opinion the corpse bride is quite hot really, in an animated slightly morbid way...

Unique and darkly romantic,"The ""Corpse Bride"" movie is another masterpiece from Tim Burton's dark, warped mind.The story told in the movie is very good and captivating. It is a story that you can easily immerse yourself into and a story that is romantic in a dark way. And it has that unique Burton touch to it, being dark, twisted, funny and yet straight and to the point.In ""Corpse Bride"" we have the usual outrageous and grotesque, yet lovable and adorable characters that only Tim Burton can manage to come up with. Just pay close attention to all the characters (also those that are not focus characters and just in the background), and you will see there is so much detail and personality added to every single character in the entire movie.Of course, the voice cast list is phenomenal, especially Johnny Depp as Victor Van Dort. His voice is so amazing in this movie. Not to mention names like Helena Bonham Carter, Tracy Ullman, Richard E. Grant, Christopher Lee, etc. The list of good names (and voices) here is just amazing. And they all bring a unique touch to the movie.As with the previous animated movie ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", the style in ""Corpse Bride"" is very unique, and there is that Burton sense of elegance to it. There is put a lot of thought and effort into the design and the creation of the sets. And it all works so well.I remember seeing it when it was first hitting the cinemas, and I fell in love with it instantly. This is definitely a movie that you should treat yourself to watching, if you haven't already seen it. I bet you will love it!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome movie the best of its kind,"This movie was awesome and the best of it's kind. Tim Burton bravo you did a fabulous job as always there wasn't anything not to like about this wonderful movie. Johnny Depp along with Helen Bonham Carter, Emily Watson,etc. provide excellent voices. There character in the voice made them seem more real and lively. Johnny Depp did the voice of Victor and wow was he fantastic. Johnny Depp gave Victor real emotions he seemed scared when he needed to be scared, funny, excited, and also serious. Helen Bonham Carter did a wonderful job her character brought the story to life. She is a wonderful actress and you have got to totally love her. Emily Watson was sweet kind and went well with the talented Johnny. She was probably the sweetest person in the movie I loved her. To finish PLEASE see this movie it was awesome. TIM YOU ROCK. To me Tim Burton is the best director ever he does the coolest movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A frustrating waste,"I went into this movie with very low expectations, and I was still let down. ""Corpse Bride"" is a frustrating experience because it takes a lot of skilled and talented people, then wastes their talents on a lazy, uninspired production.The script feels like a first draft, where someone threw in a bunch of half-baked ideas and meant to turn them into something good later, but he just never got around to it. For example: We first meet our hero, Victor, in a room with scientific gear, studying a butterfly. His interest in science never shows up again, even though it would be so much fun to see a scientist react to all the magic in the film. Later the spirit of Victor's dead dog comes back; Victor is delighted at first, then he just ignores his dog for the rest of the film.Victor's parents are earnest, decently-interesting characters who have a huge role for the whole first half of the film... then, suddenly, they're written out of the movie in the most random and stupid manner possible, never to be mentioned again.We visit the Land of the Dead, where some spirits party all the time, but other spirits work crappy jobs sweeping the streets for no clear reason. Are these spirits just stuck in this afterlife forever? If so, why are there only like 15 people in the Land of the Dead? The very end of the film suggests that they move on to eternal rest (or reincarnation? it's vague) after they find peace, but nothing else in the film ever even hints at this idea, so it comes out of nowhere in the last few seconds.This is a problem when Emily, The Corpse Bride herself, is a major character, but we never learn what she can or can't do. She can apparently talk to animals and do some other magic. It sure would be fun to see more of her magical abilities, but this movie just can't bother to use that much imagination.But I must give special attention to the biggest ""screw you"" to the audience: Victoria's subplot. To sum it up: She sees that Victor is in trouble; she wants to go help him, but her parents tell her to calm down and lock her in her room. So she makes a tense and daring escape! We root for her character and want to see her succeed! But instead, the first person she asks for help just brings her back home, and she's locked in again. The entire scene was a complete waste of time.This would be disappointing enough. But THEN, her parents tell her they will marry her to a sleazy new suitor. Victoria has been totally dynamic up to this point, and now she has more reason than ever to go find Victor and set things right... but she just gives up instead. The screenwriter got so lazy that he just made her clam up & obey her parents, even though this goes against everything we've learned about her character. For a short time, Victoria is the most likable, proactive character, and then she suddenly turns into a complete wimp.Unless you have very, very low standards, stuff like the above subplot will leave you feeling cheated, betrayed, and even a little disgusted with the laziness and shoddiness of the story.My heart bled for all the hard-working animators who put countless hours of work and effort into this film, only to create an embarrassing, ridiculous waste of time because the writing-directing team was so shamefully lazy. The same goes for the voice actors: most of the puppets are so sorely limited, it would be way more fun just to watch the actors saying their lines in a recording booth. (Christopher Lee especially suffers, as he ranges from bombastic to subtle, while his puppet character is stiff & listless.) It's a horrible waste of talent.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Tim Burton's Return to Form,"Corpse Bride is Burton's finest since Ed Wood. It's a sweet simple story about romance and sacrifice. And I have absolutely no idea why it continues to be overlooked. Yes it's not as technically impressive as Nightmare but I don't think it was supposed to be. Everything that made Burton's earlier films so great is here. Johnny Depp is once again in top form as the timid groom Victor. Depp takes what could have been a boring character and makes him very likable and endearing. Helena Bonham Carter provides the voice for one of her more innocent characters. You really feel sympathy for the Bride and want to see her get a happy ending of sorts. Other cast members include Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee, and the late Michael Gough who all give really good performances. Nightmare Before Christmas is still the masterpiece but this film is also absolutely wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A slightly stiff movie,"Tim Burton's previous big animation offering, The Nightmare before Christmas, was a pleasant enough offering. I never really fell for it as much as some of his devotees did, but I enjoyed its gloomy charm and the songs were fun. I was expecting more of the same sort of thing with Corspe Bride, and it seems that I wasn't far off.The story is about a young man, the son of a wealthy fishmonger, who is due to marry the daughter of an aristocratic, but poor, family. The wedding rehearsals are a disaster and, one thing leading to another as they often do in films, the poor chap ends up being married to a corpse. I know, it doesn't seem to make sense, but it does at the time, trust me. So, instead of spending his honeymoon relaxing with his new bride, planning their future together (and, presumably, trying to remove the smell of fish from the rental tuxedo), he is instead dragged into the netherworld. With hilarious consequences.Except there aren't really any hilarious consequences at all. To be honest, it felt a little (if you pardon the pun) lifeless. Johnny Depp is fine, not to mention barely recognisable, as the English-accented groom, Victor. Helena Bohnam-Carter (who assures us she had to audition for her husband, Tim Burton. Yeah right) is perfectly acceptable as the zombie newlywed. But, weird premise aside, the film is a bit predictable. There are some nice songs (though not up to Nightmare Before Christmas standards) and some decent jokes involving body parts and decomposition, but the story pretty much follows the path you might expect from a standard ""I married a dead chick"" movie.Wait for video.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Such a great movie!,"I loved this movie, its a classic. The animations are amazing, your interest will be on the screen for the duration of it. The voices are great for every character. Made me feel happy, sad, and at many points laughing hysterically.The musical score in the film is absolutely amazing, I can not see it being any better. As I said before, the voices are great, especially Depp, he turns in a very convincing performance with the shy and humble Victor. Every scene in the movie looks amazing, every little detail, just fantastic. The only thing I found wrong with the film was its length, too short =(. Highly recommended for everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautifully animated film,"Kudos to Tim Burton for creating this excellent animated films-this is his recreation of Andersen's The Little Mermaid. Amid many light-themed animated films, Tim Burton created the Gothic, gory world of the dead so convincingly attractive that the real world (the ""upstairs"") felt rather lifeless.His cliché use of colours and musics, to contrast the living world and the dead world, not to mention the subtle difference in animations of characters themselves, is very effective. Even Victoria looks and acts monotonous. Voice acting and animation themselves were top-notch, 'nuff said.I believe the true heroine of this film is Emily, the Corpse Bride. Despite being dead, she is full of... vibes, colourful. She's also virtuous, compassionate, talented... what more do you want from a heroine? All the other dead people were also very attractively positive, sociable, original, and humorous.The only problem I have regarding this movie, that prevented me from giving it 10, is that firstly, this is too short IMHO for such a great movie, and secondly, Tim Burton is never going to release The Corpse Bride 2.Highly recommended. Should have watched in a theatre, not in DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Visually pleasing, but lacks.","When I went out to see the Corpse Bride, I had medium expectations to prevent any kind of disappointment. But, alas, this movie still was short of something. Visually, it is very creative, but I was upset that Burton didn't stick to the same animation method that he had used for Nightmare Before Christmas. Everything looks too pretty (not as in pink and fluffy, but too airbrushed, I guess), and doesn't have that kind of tangible look that Nightmare Before Christmas or Vincent had.The story in itself is very lacking. There is no arc, so there is never any sense of excitement or peril. Everything goes by so quickly, and there isn't any kind of leading up to the ending. The ending also is not satisfying at all, in my opinion.If you're a REAL Tim Burton fan, not some Hot Topic teenager, then I recommend that for a Tim Burton fix you watch Big Fish, and just avoid this movie altogether.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Corpse Bride,"The Corpse bride is so detailed, you must watch this movie over & over. The living are so depressing, judgmental and full of deceit. The dead were so hospitable, full of life and feeling. The wealthy were poorer than the poor. The poor had more wealth than those in High Society. Society's standards killed the lives of the living. While death awakened the happiness in the dead.After watching ""The Nightmare before Christmas"". I realized both movies were about how life and death may not be what they seem, and may be closer than you think or want to accept. Plus It takes a lot of talent to make mutilated and decayed bodies to be the life of the party, entertaining to children without being scary and not a curse word in either movie. More family movies should be like this. Song, dance, and an odd concept that is genius once you get it. Also loved the butterfly opening and closing the movie.

Another Tim Burton Masterpiece!,"""Corpse Bride"" is an awesome movie! In a 19th-century European village, a marriage has been arranged between Victor Van Dort (voiced by Johnny Depp) and Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson). At first, neither Victor nor Victoria is excited about the idea of a prearranged marriage, but when they actually meet in person, the two cannot wait to become husband and wife. Victor is so nervous, he keeps messing up his wedding vows. He practices them outside. When Victor finally gets it right, he places the ring on a stick in the ground. Upon doing so, Emily (aka The Corpse Bride) comes out of the ground, because it turns out Victor placed the ring on her finger! The Corpse Bride claims Victor as her husband.

"Beautiful, skilfully made move, not just a copy of Nightmare!","After a number of great movies this year, I have to say that Corpse Bride is among my two favorites (Wallace & Gromit being the second one). And this is not just because I love stop motion films, but mostly because the film is a marvelous combination of a heart-warming story, likable characters (although completely made of rubber), and astonishing visual effects. After some disappointment concerning the Danny Elfman score in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (should I list this one as a third favorite?), I am glad to say that this time he delivers a soundtrack that can easily compete with his Nightmare tunes. Above all I find it very recognizable that Corpse Bride is not a copy of Nightmare Before Christmas but a new, innovative, and independent film of great quality and lots of fun!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Corpse Bride has got to be the wedding of the century!,"I personally loved ""Corpse Bride"", it had a very ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" appeal. Not only did it include great songs like ""Nightmare"", the voice talents are amazing. I got to hand it to Johnny Depp, he's a great actor and he definitely shows it in all his movies, well....the ones i've seen. I loved Helena in ""The Craft"" I thought she was very....freaky looking. She was excellent in this movie, brilliant work for the both of them. Also, I love Tim Burton movies, and this one has got to be his best, yes that includes the whole ""Batman"" series. When I went to see it in theater's, I didn't really quite know what to expect, but let me tell you, it's a great movie, filled with great songs, excellent voice work, and a terrific story. I love the story because it's unusual, never in the history of movies has a man been married to a female corpse before or vice-versa. Also I loved Michael Gough's character in the movie, who played Alfred in the ""Batman"" series. It was really nice seeing him, hearing him, in a movie again. I'm giving ""Corpse Bride"" a 9, because it's a great movie for the whole family to enjoy, it would've gotten a 10, but it wasn't the best movie that i've seen, but definitely up there with the best of them. Therefore, I suggest you see ""Corpse Bride"" because it's a wedding that you/I won't forget.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best movie I've ever seen.,"That's right. Tim Burton has done it again; created a masterpiece that literally pierced through my soul and left me completely breathless.Corpse Bride is right up there with Nightmare Before Christmas, people. The songs may not have been as catchy (look at the movie one more time, though and they'll stick to you like a dog on bones), but the scenery, the animation, the rest of the music and the plot more than made up for it. Yes, the plot was good. In fact, I very much liked it. I honestly, HONESTLY don't understand some people's problem with it :/Finally, to Tim: don't you ever, EVER stop making these kind of movies.

Now this, this took a regular plot (boy torn between two women) and made it something else entirely, something so unique, that I can honestly say that i loved it. The animation, blew my mind! It must have been 70 frames per min. The way that they designed all the character was so breath taking amazing that I think I can say i liked Victor's look better than Jack's from TNBC. The voice artiest they chose for this movie were perfect, I especially like Christopher Lee as the pasture, he was a good choice.

"Fun for adults, but not a kiddie movie.","Wouldn't you think having the word 'Corpse' in the title would clue you in that this is not a cutesy cartoon movie? Luckily it isn't too gruesome. What violence there is is more hinted at than shown and the undead are actually a lot more fun than the living. There were quite a few children at the showing I went to and there were only a few times when the younger ones became frightened. If you think hard enough there is a message about how true love means letting go and you can't move forward if you are holding tight to the past, but it's better to just sit back and enjoy the artistry of stop-motion animation and Tim Butron's warped view of love and life....and death.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Beautiful, but Just a Little Dead","3 Stars (out of 4)Tim Burton's newest film, The Corpse Bride, is all style. And it's a very inviting style at that. But like most Burton films, it lacks a little in the narrative. The film stars Johnny Depp as Victor, a young man betrothed to Victoria (Emily Watson). On the day of the wedding rehearsal when they both first meet they fall in love with one another, but Victor, being the clumsy person that he is, angers the priest who is trying to wed them because he just can't get his vows right (and accidentally sets Victorias mother on fire), and in distress after failing to impress Victoria he takes a walk. On this walk he practices his vows, and on the one time he gets it right he places the ring on the finger of what he thinks is a branch of a tree, but in reality its the hand of the Corpre Bride (Helena Bohnam Carter). Thus he is now married to a dead woman.Its generally difficult to comment on the acting in an animated film, but all the acting is fairly good, none of them stand out much though aside from Bohnam Carter, who shines as the unhinged, and falling apart Emily. The film is filled with some toe tapping songs, especially the number performed in the tavern in the world of the dead, telling the story of Emily the Corpse Bride, but for the most part the songs are not nearly as memorable as those of The Nightmare Before Christmas. The Corpse Bride, however, excels in comedy and visual style. Namely any scenes involving the members of the underworld are the most entertaining, with some of the dead characterized by how they died (chopped in half, shot through stomach, stabbed, decapitated, etc.).But the films weakness is its story. The setup is the strongest point, but shortly after we learn the legend of the Corpse Bride the movie gets stuck in a rut, and doesn't really seem to go anywhere. The characters mostly just walk around and do nothing to further the story at all, and the little movement that the story does go in is fairly secondhand. The biggest problem though is that the villain of the movie almost seems tacked on, and there is so little confrontation with him that he hardly even seems necessary at any point of the story. The good news is that the lack of story hard to notice because the movie does a good job of distracting us with such visual richness.Overall The Corpse Bride is a beautifully rich film, but just misses out on excellence because the story just doesn't really go anywhere. But for those waiting for another clay animation film they don't have to wait long, Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the WereRabbit comes out in two weeks...",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
forget Wallace and gromit. THIS is far superior,"Alright I admit it; I'm a Tim Burton whore. I'm also a whore for Johnny depp in that masculine hug way..*ahem* but this in no way reflects my opinion of this movie; it stands alone as a work of art, and should in no way be compared to a nightmare before Christmas or indeed any other work Tim has been responsible for before hand; this EVEN makes me forgive him for planet of the apes...THAT'S how good this movie is. The musical composition that Danny elfman has provided for the movie (the second collaboration with Burton this year) is fantastic; melodic, whimsical, melancholy comical and soulful, displaying the diversity of Elfman in all his glory, and just how well he understands Burtons direction and thinking at the time; I have to say, most of all I like the fact that save a few, most of the compositions use the piano and nothing else; it adds to the storyline and has a subtle hint of Russian undertones (of which the movie is based from a short folk tale of the same title).The movie itself speaks very valid points of view in this day and age; in a subtle way it leads you to the moral that marriage should only be entered into when two people are in love, and never lightly; Johnny depp is perfect is victor, as is Helena Bonham carter in the role of Emily, the corpse bride. Very touching, Very enjoyable and I would be very surprised if this weren't remembered as one of those animation classics in years to come that you sit kids down to watch.People, this movie is short but ten thousand universes above anything you've seen before; the animation methods are groundbreaking, and blows the combination that presents itself in the form of a yorkshireman and his dog far, far away.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tim Burton As Crazed Genius,"Ah, yes, Tim Burton: the Dr. Frankenstein of the movie industry. While his career has been mostly hit-and-miss (hit: this, ""Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""Beetlejuice""; miss: ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Frankenweenie""), that doesn't make his ability to work any less phenomenal. And while he's a far cry from the best director ever, ""Corpse Bride"" puts him somewhere up there.This amazing story is a very darkly comic musical about a man who unwittingly gets sucked into the abode of the dead... and a shocking contract with the tragic Corpse Bride! Oddly enough, Johnny Depp does his best work ever as a voice-only performance. Helena Bonham Carter, on the other hand, simply delivers a great quality to the Bride. What's great about this film is that it is just so like Burton, with its astounding Walt-Disney-meets-Edgar-Allen-Poe ingenuity. And to be completely honest, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is better, but ""Corpse Bride"" is much like Burton himself: not the best, but getting very near.

Can Tim Burton and Johnny Depp never fail?,"Tim Burton's 'Nightmare Before Christmas' was first class film-making, it was Burton after all. Corpse Bride, could it have been better? True, it's not for children, but how many Tim Burton films are? With a soundtrack by Danny Elfman, you can't go wrong, with a director like Burton, you're guaranteed a hit and Johnny Depp in the lead, which of their films has ever failed, need I say more? This year, it seems neither Burton nor Depp can do no wrong. The fact that the top cast of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter, Emily Watson, Joanna Lumley, Richard E Grant, Christopher Lee, Albert Finney and others are no more than voices, does not disguise their incredible acting or the natural appeal they bring to their characters. Johnny Depp for example, can you tell it's him? I advise everyone to go and see it, True it's not to everyone's taste, but even people who don't usually like this sort of thing, should find it a thrill. Burton and Depp you can't lose.

Best known for his films such as ""Batman"", ""Beetlejuice"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Big Fish"" and this year's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", Burton never fails to deliver a creative piece of film-making that brings something new to the screen.""Corpse Bride"" is no exception with its stunning artistry and animation accompanied by a solid story line, terrific music and star power voice acting from the likes of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson and Albert Finney. Check out some of the details of the animation - wood rot on the Bride's casket and intricacy in the costumes. The great Danny Elfman shines once again with amazing music and work as Bonejangles. The entire saloon musical fantasy is unlike anything ever seen on film.All the voice acting is excellent, but special notice goes to Helena Bonham Carter as the Corpse Bride, Jane Horracks as the Black Widow and the legend, Christopher Lee as the Pastor. Probably not for very small kids, but otherwise most kids, teens and adults should enjoy and appreciate this excellent, though short film.

Corpse Bride=D,"i just came home from seeing this movie with 3 of my friends although one of my friends claims she almost fell asleep the rest of us thought it was amazing. we were dancing to the songs and relating some of the lines to our own lives! some of the lines in this movie are amazingly funny!.....once you see the movie you will definitely understand. my favorite line was definitely between a husband and wife who were reunited after him being dead for 15 years....but thats all I'm going to say. the movie was great, I'm not quite sure why the little worm needed to be there but whatever the movie was great I'm very happy =D i hope everyone who sees this movie can enjoy it as much as i did, because if you don't then that is too bad for you to miss out!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tim Burton has done it again!,"An absolutely Amazing stop-motion animation movie! Tim Burton never ceases to amaze... A Very good cast does the voices, and the animation crew done a superb job from character and set modeling to the motion itself. Something that gave me a good laugh was a very small and nearly unnoticeable line in the movie - in which Mr. Everglot calls Victor (the hero) ""Vincent"" by mistake... This, as I believe, is somewhat of an ""Inside"" joke of Tim Burton's... since one of his early movies (short claymation movie) is called ""Vincent"", which is a real gem (should be a classic and taught in film-schools, in my humble opinion). In ""Vincent"" - the main character looks like an earlier version of Victor, something I noticed right away - just by looking at the ""corpse bride"" movie poster. I recommend watching both ""Vincent"", and ""Corpse Bride""... Actually - most of Tim Burton's movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Doesn't hold up as good as the other Tim Burton movies.,"This movie is a romantic comedy I think. A lot of will they won't they. The relationship isn't fully fledged out, leaving the romance pretty shallow. The comedic aspect runs on a lot of puns, so if you enjoy puns you will enjoy this. The musical songs are okay you will nod your head a few times, but can't compare to other animated musicals. The score by Danny Elfman is good, and the voice actors give good performances. In regard to the weird Burton vibes this movie doesn't have much. If you enjoy rom-coms you will find some enjoyment.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
An amazing gift from Tim Burton,"I found Tim Burton's _Corpse Bride_ more accessible than _The Nightmare Before Christmas_. This film is beautifully rendered, wonderfully voice-acted, and full of eye-catching visuals that will keep both adults and children entranced for the entire movie. Johnny Depp is perfectly unassuming as the ill-fated groom of two brides. Helena Bonham Carter gives the title character a wonderful sense of wonder. And Emily Watson is delightful as the original bride who must come to terms with what is happening around her. Burton has also gathered an amazing group of veteran British actors to bring the supporting characters to life. Danny Elfman's music fits the proceedings like a glove. The skeleton song brings to mind his old Oingo Boingo days, and the underscoring music soars and floats as needed.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but not great","I went to see the Corpse Bride yesterday, and I really liked it. It was no Nightmare Before Christmas, but it was still pretty good. I personally believe that I expected to much. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have always done wonderful together. But this was not quite up to the caliber of Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Some of the parts of this movie were very good though. And some parts were actually quite emotional. A lot of the time these emotions were ones of sadness. It was definitely worth the nine dollars, twenty-five cents it cost me to go see it. It was a very good movie, excellent for all ages and genders.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Corpse Bride was excellent, but a bit rushed and noisy.","I had high expectations for Corpse Bride, and it fulfilled nearly all of them. Going into the movie, I was aware of its short running length, and to be honest, this did hurt the film overall. Events happen very rapidly, and as a result, don't seem to be very fleshed out. The songs in the movie had great tunes and instrumentals, but more than once, I felt like I couldn't ""hear"" the words, because they came too quickly and too loud.The movie may have been billed slightly wrong, too, because it's much much more of a love story than a horror tale. I wouldn't see the movie unless you're okay with romantic comedies, because that is a big part of what Corpse Bride is. Some of the dead jokes get irritating after a while (there's so many of them) but overall they help keep the tone light and funny throughout.A major redeeming feature of the movie was the visuals. The stop-motion photography the film uses makes literally every scene a spectacle by itself. The Corpse Bride is oddly compelling, because she's deadly beautiful and moves with a strange grace throughout. She's a rotting corpse, but somehow Tim Burton made her lovely.Overall, I would recommend Corpse Bride, perhaps not for children (it isn't a kids fairy tale), but definitely for someone who enjoys the visual style as well as dark romantic comedies in general. Corpse Bride is just fun to watch, and the tunes (even though too loud at times) will keep you tapping. A very good movie and well worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Corpse Bride,"Corpse Bride, is set in the early nineteenth century and is about a shy and timid young man named Victor Van Dort, who is being arranged to marry a young woman named Victoria Everglot. While they are rehearsing the wedding Victor, can't seem to get his vows right so he heads off into the woods and practices placing the wedding ring on a bony finger sticking out of the ground. To Victor's astonishment out comes a living corpse who now thinks that Victor and her are married. The corpse bride takes Victor, to live with her down under but Victor, wants to go back and marry Victoria, but at the same time he is in a bit of a situation because he also accidentally married the corpse bride. Winner of The Future Film Festival Digital Award for the film's directors Mike Johnson and Tim Burton at The Venice Film Festival. Corpse Bride, is a great looking film and I really liked the stop motion animation they did for the film. The film is also stylish and very neat to look at, is entertaining, creative, charming, very inventive and it plays out like a fairy tale with a lot of macabre humour but is appropriate enough for younger viewers. Corpse Bride, sometimes looks and feels like The Nightmare Before Christmas, because of similar animation, style and music but on it's own this is still a good film which is visually fascinating and has a sweet story that I think will appeal to those both young and old. I have been a big fan of Tim Burton's for a long time and I think there is a very good chance that this film will be nominated at next year's Oscars for Best Animated Film, and I think it has a very good chance of winning because although I haven't seen any of the other animated films that have come out this year so far, this one has been the highest rated so I'd say it has really good chances and I would personally for one really like to see Tim Burton win an Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tim Burton Just Doing the Same Old Thing Again,"I saw this movie in the theater with my wife. There were at least 2 other movies I would have rather seen. She loved it, but me, well, I didn't hate it, but I didn't exactly like it either. It just seemed like a conglomeration of most of Burton's earlier works. People call Tim Burton a genius. He is talented at repackaging the same thing over and over, and getting lots of money for it, I guess. He's definitely NOT a genius. People keep comparing this to Nightmare, and rightly so. It came from Tim Burton, was claymation, and was about animated dead people. It did remind me a lot of BeetleJuice also. Dancing skeletons seem to be a popular motif in his movies. I guess what bugged me the most were the characters. They completely lacked depth, except for maybe the main character, yet her back story was sorely underdeveloped. WAS she killed by her groom to be, or a stranger? WHY was she killed? Was the bad guy who tried to wed Victoria the groom to be of the corpse bride AND her killer? Why did he want to kill Victoria so badly? It doesn't really matter. Another reviewer was nitpicking the plot of this movie, saying things like ""How does the corpse bride know all of the dead people if she was under a tree all of the time?"" I started to wonder, then thought, ""The movie is about animated DEAD people! It's fantasy! On a good note, the animation was well done, but in 2005 that's no big feat.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worth paying for!,"When seeing 'Corpse Bride', it is hard indeed to not think of Tim Burton's previous animation, 'Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas', in terms of comparison. My friend said to me before I bought a ticket that she had seen both and preferred the latter to the former so far but, in her mind, they all were equally enjoyable.Once finish watching, I cannot not resist comparing the two, as she did. Nevertheless, I do it with a different sense. Instead of considering which one is better, I rather think that both present us what is missing in one another. 'Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas' is undeniably visualized about the complicated world of Tim Burton himself of which many people  if not his fans - think as abnormal. To me, it becomes outstanding and appealing despite full of darkness. I can see from the elaborate production how much idea and energy all the crews have put down in order to approach such level of expression. However, its content (story, plot, theme) is less attention-grabbing compare to this latest 'Corpse Bride'. In 'Corpse Bride', the content makes the film closed to the traditional drama which I would have planed to produce with human's acting if I had been the director. But the director(s) chose to deal with the stop-motion technique. Interestingly, the way the characters were animated immensely contributes to the illustration of the content. That is beyond marvellous! Instead of the pure form (colourful stop motion), it is the content - strengthened by this cooperative form - that captured my attention from the start to the end. It makes me want to know how that seemingly irresolvable conflict will end.Yet again, this piece has guaranteed the attractiveness of stop motion. It will never fail to stun, fascinate, and grab our attentions as long as the filmmakers know how to make use of its useful and imaginative value, like Tim Burton and, his co-director, Mike Johnson have done with the film.

Better than Nightmare Before Christmas.,"It is lovely to be back in the ""animated"" world of Tim Burton again. His vision are so much more vibrant, unique and Burtonesque. I love all his feature film as well, but this is just something only he could envision and create. The backdrop of the story is set in the Victorian age (hence both the character names) and the story focuses on the quite inept Victor that is to be married to Victoria. It's a fixed marriage and the aristocratic families think that this will make them take the climb into the hierarchy of high society. Neither Victor of Victoria are ready to be married but when they meet their feelings are redeemed. As mentioned Victor is quite a clumsy guy and messes up everything that is possible to mess up during the wedding rehearsals so he is sent away to rehearse his vows until he knows them. He goes into the woods and recites them over and over. Problem is that when he places the ring on a branch (that turns out to be the hand of the dead Emily) he is married to her and brought to the land of the dead. So starts the predicament. The film uses black and white to show the cold shallow real world, and colors to envision the very lively and honest land of the dead. This works well and it's a beautiful movie in all regards. A great story and flawless presentation of it with all the moods one would suspect from a Tim Burton title. A tad short but that OK with such a great viewing pleasure. NOT to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mediocre,"Anything to which Tim Burton puts an effort immediately piques my interest, however I found myself quite disappointed with this animated endeavor. The story is slow moving while the characters do not particularly garner your sympathy. The plot is a tired one - of a fumbling British guy who could simply solve the hardly-believable predicament in which he finds himself, with a sentence or two. As a musical piece with the talented Danny Elfman, I found one song to be likable, whereas the rest are easily forgettable. A decent family film for a rental, but would not hold the interest of little ones. Parents should realize, especially from the title of the film, that death, dying and decay are prominent subjects and be prepared for such.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
What a delightful surprise,"Tim Burton's movie was typical of him. Very well done, some themes could be anticipated. The story was fun and interesting and good for many age groups, although I saw a toddler in the theater and wondered what his mother was thinking. The animation and effects were fantastic and entertaining. A delightful movie to watch! The story started out a little bit slow but then picked up speed. I loved the segway into Gone with the Wind. It had a somewhat predictable ending, but it was well done and the actors/actresses did a great job with their parts. I would recommend this movie for anyone looking to have a good time and enjoy a day or evening out.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not what It was Sought Out to Be...,"Whenever you thought of Corpse Bride, you thought of Tim Burton. Whenever you thought of Tim Burton, you thought of The Nightmare Before Christmas. When you think of Corpse Bride, you shouldn't think of The Nightmare Before Christmas, but for some reason everyone does.I can understand how people think these two movies are alike, because they're basically the only animated films by Tim Burton, besides James and the Giant Peach. However, Corpse Bride is the first to be Directed by Tim Burton. Nonetheless, these movies can't be considered ""as good"" as each other. Nightmare Before Christmas is a film that you will remember and watch for the rest of your life. Corpse Bride is a movie that you see because it looks like The Nightmare Before Christmas. Corpse Bride is a bad movie being compared to Nightmare Before Christmas so often.The story is a little more complex than a normal children's (Disney) movie would be, however it has a simple outlook. A man is being wed beyond his will to a bride who, likewise, is against her will. Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp) reveals his nervousness during the rehearsal, and later travels through the woods practicing his vows. At a particular moment, he suddenly gets his vows perfect, and recites them aloud. When he announces that he will ""give her this ring"", he places it on what he believes is a small tree branch resembling her ring finger, in which turns out to be a dead woman's ring finger who is buried. She comes alive and cries out ""I do"" to Victor, and now he is wed to a deceased woman, hence, Corpse Bride.Victor is now contemplating what he must do to fix this mis-marriage, and find his wanted bride, Victoria (voiced by Emily Watson). Seeing as this is a children's movie, or just a movie nonetheless, it won't be as easy as thought. Seems like a typical quest for the plot of a movie.Corpse Bride was short, only 76 minutes. This prevents the movie from having less twists in plot and gets to the finale quicker. Having a short movie may keep the children interested through a longer majority of the movie, this is a positive outcome. To me, it made it less interesting. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Love that united the Worlds or the Magnificent Tim Burton: Part five,"The musical. So we got to the next masterpiece of maestro Tim Burton, which you can talk about for a long time and drown in endless argument, but which is worth seeing for yourself at least once in order to understand how beautiful this cartoon is. Personally, I watched it at least six times in different periods of time, and each viewing knocked out emotions, although you already know the whole story from beginning to end. And here's my brief opinion for you - The Love that united the worlds. It was very difficult to look for flaws in this work of the maestro, and serious quibbles could not be found, but some points are still worth mentioning in a separate paragraph. And this should finish the introductory part and move on to the merits of this gloomy puppet masterpiece.So, here they are:
1. Scenario - the action of the cartoon will take place in a European city of the second half of the nineteenth century. A young man Victor, who comes from a wealthy and obscure Nouveau riche family, marries Victoria, a representative of an impoverished ancient aristocratic family. This marriage will allow both families to ""improve their affairs."" And no one is interested in the feelings of the young. Of course, Victor is embarrassed, as a result of which he runs into the forest, where he says a wedding dinner and thus marries a corpse, which turns out to be a beautiful bride named Emily. Now Victor has to get out of the world of the dead and sort out his feelings for Emily and Victoria, because the latter loved the hero with all her heart. Yes, we have a simple dark and fabulous story of sudden love, diluted with the world of the living and the world of the dead, a sudden tempter, excellent drama and great songs, and, of course, the indescribable atmosphere of maestro Tim Burton. The ending of the story turned out to be partly happy, partly sad, but full of satisfaction and absolutely everyone will like it (if not, then you are a callous person, fu to be like that).2. Mockery of society - in this work, the maestro clearly slips the notes of Bernard Shaw, namely a mockery of the Victorian society of that time. Although hypertrophied, two classes of society were shown - ruined aristocrats, who only had a family estate and an ancient surname and the bourgeoisie - in particular fishmongers, insanely rich, but not having a high social status, so only a profitable marriage can fix it. In the cartoon, we see a genuine relationship between these classes - almost open hostility and malicious ridicule, but in order to achieve their goals, they are ready to make this alliance. Plus, it is perfectly shown how marriages were concluded before, where the feelings of the young were not paid attention at all. Now it seems wild, but then it was in the order of things. And I don't say anything about the world of the dead at all - it looks almost the best place in the world here, although this is done only for contrast. And in the world of the living, calculation rules everything, which is a clear example of the pastor of the local church, and the rest of those in power are no better.3. The characters - both the main and secondary ones are worked out very well. The viewer does not know anything about some of them at all, but one glance may be enough to understand who this character is and what to expect from him. Here, both external data and the manner of behavior play on the image. Both families, the pastor, the herald, the visiting lord, the inhabitants of the world of the dead, the spider and the worm, the butler and so on. Yes, not all of them have names, but their images are so vivid that they are remembered for a very long time.4. Music - Danny Elfman did a great job creating compositions for this masterpiece, and the result was worth it. After all, this is not just a cartoon, it's a musical in which the characters sing, and they sing great, and without high-quality music this would not have happened. Emily 's song is especially close to my heart ""It doesn't hurt me at all"" and two compositions on the piano (the first is a solo by Victor, and the second is a duet by Emily and Victor). And from the song ""It doesn't hurt me at all"" I couldn't even restrain myself, and let out a tear, and not even one. Emily's fate and pain touched me too much, and I wanted to go up to her and hug this unfortunate girl tightly, who fell victim to monstrous treachery and a broken heart. Yes, and funny songs turned out very even. Be sure to listen to the music from this cartoon separately - get a lot of fun!5. Humor - and humor found a place in this dark tale by Tim Burton. He is a match for everything that is happening, not everyone will understand his individual moments, but in general he is good. And for fans and fans of the maestro, there are several surprises prepared here. Personally, I liked the humor, and there is nothing extraordinary here.6. Puppet animation - if you watched ""Coraline in the Land of Nightmares"" and ""The Nightmare before Christmas"" (yes, to whom I say this, everyone has watched them), then you will instantly recognize the style and even some dolls. To shoot such cartoons is a titanic work, no less than plasticine. After all, they require a huge amount of time. Tim Burton had a big budget (forty lemons), the support of the studio ""Laika"" (which specialize in puppet cartoons), experience in the work of ""The Nightmare before Christmas"" and a whole year for the production, and then had to make copies of the main dolls, so as not to delay filming. That's why the story is so simple and concise. And in general, puppet cartoons are a rare guest on the big screen, because the audience is not very eager for them, so the payback varies. In this regard, Tim was still lucky, because if this cartoon failed at the American box office, then it performed quite well in the world (it brought, though not much, but a profit). Therefore, I can only praise you for such a bold work.7. Magnificent atmosphere - here is not just an atmosphere, but the atmosphere of the atmospheres of Maestro Burton's works. A strong predominance of cold colors, mostly of all shades of gray and blue, the general gloominess of the city, the almost complete absence of smiles on people's faces. A lot of frightening moments (especially those related to the forest). Add here Elfman's music, excellent scenery, and the puppet animation itself - and you will get a role model. An example to rely on when creating such puppet cartoons. The atmosphere is at the highest level. Just at the highest!I even have a DVD with this masterpiece, where, in addition to the cartoon itself, there is a whole bunch of additional materials that have not even been viewed yet, but this gap will definitely be filled, it's too curious how all this was done.Now about some points. Yes, if you start to find fault, then all the fabulous and gloomy gloss will fall off. After all, if you turn on logic, the script will slowly but inexorably crumble under the weight of facts and twofold arguments. But I absolutely do not want to do this, because the advantages of this work more than outweigh those logical moments that will come to mind for every thinking viewer.Separately, I want to cancel the magnificent cast that took part in the voice acting of this cartoon (Johnny Depp, Christopher Lee, Emily Watson, Helena Bonham Carter and others). Special thanks to the Pythagoras studio for the high-quality Russian dubbing and adaptation of the songs.We will skip the picture ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", because I already had a review for this movie, so next time we will talk again about the musical that was staged by maestro Tim Burton according to the old London legend about the bloody maniac.My rating is 10 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Nightmare After the Nightmare Before Christmas,"Tim Burton's ""Corpse Bride"" is a Gothic tale of a sensitive young man who chafes at the distinctions between living and dead. Considering that pretty accurately describes Burton's previous ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" and that ""Corpse Bride"" is animated in the same stop-motion style, the gloomy director seems to be creating a sub-sub genre all his own. It's too bad he didn't take the time to flesh out (no pun intended. Seriously) ""Corpse Bride"" a bit.There's a lot of visual invention in this film  not surprising in a Burton effort  but Tim and team seem to have spent all their energy on the visuals of ""Corpse Bride,"" not noticing that their story is patchy and scatter shot. Young Victor and Victoria are introduced by their domineering parents just one day before their arranged marriage. Surprisingly enough, they quite like each other, making it all the more tragic when Victor takes a walk in the Dark Scary Woods to practice the vows he keeps flubbing in rehearsal. The film then settles into a standard ""Boy Practices Vows, Boy Unwittingly Marries Rotting Girl Cadaver, Boy Tries to Escape from Land of Dead and Anthropomorphic-Maggot-Infested Girl"" story. It's here the film gets all muddled. It takes a while to establish that Victor is trapped in what we're belatedly told is the land of the dead. Except he and his late honey can cast a spell that allows them to go back to the land of the living. And the entire population of the underworld later decides to pop upstairs because, um, they feel like it. We find out that poor bride to be Emily was killed  somehow, for some reason  while waiting for her intended in the very wooded spot where Victor makes his ill-conceived marital declaration. Although fated to lie in wait for her betrothed to declare his love, she also apparently lives in the bustling world below, which appears to be a pretty hip place to spend eternity, with its be-bopping jazz cat skeletons and party-on atmosphere. Meanwhile, on the surface, poor Victoria is about to be forced into marrying wealthy, and likely homicidal, Lord Barkis.This stuff seems not very well thought out. ""Corpse Bride"" has flashes of inspiration, and some moments of sharp wit. Victoria's mother, breathlessly told by her daughter that Victor and a dead girl climbed through her window, scolds ""he was in your ROOM?!"" And Victor's own harried mother can't imagine ""what corpse would want to marry our Victor."" Yet for the most part, ""Corpse Bride"" seems to be making things up as it goes along. Being animated, it feels obligated to sprinkle in a few entirely forgettable songs, as well, interrupting what little narrative flow it establishes.A lot of work and care goes into a film like this. Unfortunately, the only thing of which ""Corpse Bride"" seems sure is how it wants to look. It's easy to admire the craftsmanship behind the film, but no amount of technical expertise can make up for a movie that's just largely so unclear and uninteresting.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Eerily beautiful, but not quite perfect","""Corpse Bride"" is the kind of movie that makes me proud that I've never gotten too old for fairy tales. And as long as Tim Burton manages to keep his head in the clouds, I doubt I ever will. This movie is so soothing, so heart-warming, but at the same time it's also very dark. Take that literally in fact, black is the primary color. The animation is absolutely wonderful, but the movie never tries to sell that as an achievement of its own. Mastering the effects is only useful when you combine it with good writing, and Tim Burton seems to be one of the few great directors that actually seems to remember this. What a beautiful story this is, in some ways ""Corpse Bride"" is the kind of movie Disney keeps failing to make. Purely for the sake of nitpicking however, I would like to point that a) the movie seems really short to me (not even 80 minutes) and b) the ending is somewhat disappointing. Apart from that, this thing is pure magic.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Creepy and beautiful,"Tim Burton's work will probably never be described as banal or ordinary; rather, he is merely the poster child of inventive, creative cinematic storytelling. Corpse Bride is told using stop-action animation, but using more-advanced methods than those in Burton's legendary The Nightmare before Christmas.Victor (Johnny Depp) is a shy, clumsy groom to be who has trouble saying his vows during the wedding rehearsal. After flubbing his lines once too many times, he dashes into the Victorian night and practices them while walking along an icy, moonlit path. After Victor places the wedding ring on a nearby branch and recites his vows, a figure rises from the frozen ground - a corpse bride! The Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) thinks she's found her true love in Victor, and she spirits him to the Land of the Dead, populated by myriad dancing and talking skeletons. But Victor doesn't love The Bride and pines for his own lost bride, Victoria (Emily Watson). Complicating matters further is that their marriage was to be one of convenience, as Victoria's family needs the money that Victor's family might bring.The movie has many eye-popping (ha!) visuals, including the Bride's own eyeball, which seems to pop out every so often, and the sheathing and unsheathing of a long sword buried in the back of a skeleton made to resemble Napoleon Bonaparte (known as Bonesaparte in the credits). Wonderful musical numbers abound as well, featuring the beautiful voice of Danny Elfman - especially a complex jazz/scat number.It's really tough to find fault with any of the voices, which feature a number of former Burton collaborators, such as Depp, Elfman, Christopher Lee, Michael Gough, and even Deep Roy, who played the Oompa Loompahs in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Although this film was up for a Best Animated Feature Oscar, don't think for a moment that your three-year-old is going to like it, musical numbers or not. The tone isn't as dark as Nightmare before Christmas, but the settings sure are. I mean, the movie takes place mostly at night, either in a dark forest, inside a dark, stark mansion, or the Land of the Dead. Not exactly the place you might find pastels and a lava lamp.Watching Corpse Bride, it's easy to forget it's not animated in the traditional way, or even the nouveau-artiste, computer way. Fourteen puppets of the Bride and of Victor were used in the making of this movie, and some 109,000 individual frames were filmed. The attention to detail is preposterously exquisite and should leave the average viewer properly dumbfounded.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A wonderful and wholesomely dark family film!,"Corpse Bride is full blown Tim Burton goodness, and to think this film came from the same guy who brought us Batman back in 1989, Batman Returns in 1992, and returned to his stop-motion roots with Corpse Bride; it kind of brought his making of Vincent in 1982 full circle with 2005's Corpse Bride, co-directed with Mike Johnson.In 2005's mostly Disney-dominated landscape of animation, films like Warner Brother's Corpse Bride and Aardman and Dreamworks Animations' Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were Rabbit showed that the 'Mouse House' had its dominance challenged in ways that were comparable to Shrek changing everything in 2001. And was it nice seeing a stop-motion film that was wholesome and lightly spooky have critical and box office success to match any Disney film at the time. Tim Burton always relished gothic stuff and he gives its land of the dead a technicolor twist and makes the land of the living drab and grey; kind of adds ironic subtext to life for some people and a nice twist on the supposed drab associations of gothic imagery.As a stop-motion fan this film was definitely a treat, and it's always satisfying seeing a director that can do both live-action and animated feature films justice: and you can still tell it's distinctly Burton-esque from top to bottom.Corpse Bride is good family entertainment even with its death-inspired imagery and it's probably a therapeutic film in terms of coping with loss and moving on. But hey, maybe it's just me.Corpse Bride is solid entertainment that stands up in the world of animation and an important piece of stop-motion canon. 4.5/5 stars. 9/10 IMDb points.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"!

Can a heart that's stopped beating be warm and gentle? Corpse Bride shows it can be. How can a person, who's already brutal and coldblooded, even die? well, just wait till the Maggot gets to him. Oh, the Maggot - first guy with estonian blood to play a character in a Tim Burton movie. even if it is just a freaking'worm...ahem, maggot.generally I liked this flick. some are disturbed by too many too powerful songs - well I thought there were a couple of spots that were missing a song.

Very weak,"Tim Burton's Corpse Bride proves that a bad movie cannot ride out on the nice visuals or unusual filming techniques alone. A poor, poor rehash with tricks taken out of the same hat as his magnificent, stunning stop-motion puppet animation Nightmare Before Christmas - with nothing more or fresh to add.The story is this film's main weakness - it is so utterly primitive, rehashed, and flat, they didn't even bother adding a single twist along the way to make it interesting (for adults, anyway.) Seeing this movie adds nothing new to the Nightmare. A disappointment of big-screen proportions.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A beautiful love story with that signature Tim Burton spooky twist,"Corpse Bride tells a charming story of Victor (Johnny Depp) a shy groom, who is engaged to Victoria (Emily Watson). However, Victor gets himself into a tricky situation when he practices his wedding vows unintentionally in the presence of a deceased young woman (Helena Bonham Carter) who subsequently rises from the grave thinking they are now married. Though this film is a romantic story filled with loveable characters, this does not take away from Tim Burton's signature creepy aesthetic that make his works so iconic.I am a huge fan of this stop-motion animation style, and this film certainly delivers with its stunning attention to detail and innovative use of colour. Utilising colour as an important story-telling mechanism, Corpse Bride is mainly monochromatic and cold when in the living world and, very thought-provokingly, vibrant and warm when entering the underworld. This certainly makes a strong impact, although as the viewer I suppose it is up to you to interpret what this may mean. Nonetheless, all the shots are breathtakingly beautiful, in both the living and dead world.This is certainly one of my favourite films to watch during this spooky season - you can't go wrong with a Tim Burton movie at Halloween, especially with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter so fantastically embodying the lead roles.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Happy B'day J.Depp,"I'll never forget the day Warner Bros. Turkey surprised me with an invitation to an early screening of Corpse Bride, just 17 days before its November 2005 release. It had been years since I'd seen anything like The Nightmare Before Christmas on the big screen back in '93, and let me tell you, Corpse Bride absolutely blew me away. I ended up watching it in the cinema a good 15 times, maybe more.Today, I'm revisiting this Blu-ray in honor of Johnny Depp's birthday. The man is a master at creating unforgettable characters, and even though he's just a voice in this film, he still manages to completely captivate us.The fact that it's stop-motion is already a huge plus for me, but Corpse Bride doesn't just rely on the ""look at all this hard work"" gimmick. It's got a fantastic script, and the music, oh my god, the music! Danny Elfman's score is absolutely enchanting, perfectly capturing the film's whimsical yet melancholic tone. It's the kind of soundtrack you can listen to on repeat and never get tired of.But let's not forget about the visuals. The animation is simply breathtaking. The puppets are so expressive, and the sets are so detailed and atmospheric. The Land of the Living is all drab and dreary, while the Land of the Dead is bursting with vibrant colors and quirky characters. It's a feast for the eyes.And of course, there's the story itself. It's a bittersweet tale of love, loss, and moving on. It's funny, it's heartwarming, and it'll definitely tug at your heartstrings. The film's themes of death and acceptance are handled with such sensitivity and grace, making it a truly unique and unforgettable experience.Corpse Bride is a film that I keep coming back to time and time again. It's a testament to Tim Burton's genius and the incredible artistry of the stop-motion animators. It's a film that deserves to be cherished and celebrated, a true masterpiece that will continue to enchant audiences for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Lively Dead! (moofie review),"Only Tim Burton can make the world of the dead seem like a fun place to be! Which is why I think the movie is titled ""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride"", rather than just ""Corpse Bride"", which might be mistaken for a schlocky gory flick.The Corpse Bride is about the misadventures of the shy son of a wealthy fishmonger, Victor, as he is accidentally married to a corpse bride. The corpse bride, although dead and blue, is not cold, unlike some of the living (who have grey skins). Rather, she is passionate but bears a heavy heart.The movie also features dancing skeletons, and a worm who tries to pass off as the Corpse Bride's conscience.The combined efforts of Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and the other talented voice actors make this a highly enjoyable movie. Also being filmed in stop motion greatly benefits the film as it gives it more depth and texture than one that relies heavily on CGI. The narrative is also good, and the characters are livelier and more believable than some movies with real actors.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Huge Disappointment.,"Saw the movie this afternoon and really disliked it. I've never found Burton to be a very coherent storyteller and this one reaches new lows. Part of the problem WAS the songs which, apart from being very hard to understand, were musically forgettable.And compared to the incredible wit (visual and verbal) that Pixar has made its trademark, this movie seemed woefully unfunny. There was barely a chuckle in the theatre this afternoon.Having said that, I did love the design of the characters, but once I realized that they weren't going to say or do anything interesting, my mind began to wander.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great and emotional,"I was surprised by how emotional this film was. From what others told me, I was expecting some sort of inferior The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993).

A very good watch,wow Tim Burton has done it again. This film was fantastic. The way it was black and white in the beginning and then when he died it was all colorful. IN this movie it seemed if you were happy (like the butterfly in the beginning after being set free) you were in color.I loved the drawings in this movie they seemed so life like while keeping it cartoonish. I ex specially liked the corpse bride (emily) her face and clothing were beautiful while keeping it in check that she was dead and rotting. I loved how half her body had skin and the other did't't really like he leg was bone and her arm and her eyes pop ed out and her rids stuck out. I also loved the maggot that gave her advice and when the maggot and spider sang the song together. It was creepy but so cool.This movies ending was so cool but so predictable as soon as you saw the shadow of the man who killed the corpse bride you knew who it was and that he was going to marry the living girl. Also you knew he wouldn't marry the corpse bride.I loved this movie and could go on forever about it.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Difficult to review. Some good things, some bad.","The main characters are the main shining point for me; Victor is awkwardly adorable and Emily, our corpse bride is utterly charming. Both Johnny Deep and Helena Bonham Carter do a wonderful job with the voice acting.The rest of the characters are like the plot... expected. Almost Disney like. The good guys are good, the bad guys are very bad and thankfully they get their comeuppance in the end.The music is a bit all over the place: the piano scenes are hauntingly beautiful, to the point I'm always annoyed when they're interrupted. The background music is atmospheric and exactly what I expected of a Burton/Elfman paring. But, with the exception of the intro scene, all the other musical numbers reminded me too much of Nightmare Before Christmas, without being as good.However, despite its flaws, I loved this movie. I doubt it's going to be a yearly re-watch but I would happily recommend it to anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Can a heart still break once it's stopped beating?""","Tim Burton and Mike Johnson co-direct this fantastically atmospheric, stop-motion animated, musical version of a 17th-century Jewish folktale.

As they embark on their new 'life' in the Land of the Dead, Victor learns that Emily was murdered on the night of her elopement by her fiance. As Victor continues to investigate he discovers that his original fiancee, Victoria (Emily Watson), is about to marry Lord Barkis Bittern (Richard E Grant). Victor descends into depression at the news, but events take an even more unexpected turn... The cast is great (with the principals supported by Christopher Lee, Albert Finney, Tracey Ullman, Paul Whitehouse, Joanna Lumley, Michael Gough, to name just a few).

Hollywood churns out more trite garbage- Nightmar b4 xmas redux,"Stupid kid movie masquerading as something sly.Certain parts of this movie hit the mark and are funny and creepy and weird all at the same time. HOWEVER the majority of this CRAP is your standard Hollywood paint by numbers ""let's rehash what worked last time and make sure it is accessible to our target audience"". It's the basis for many crappy movies served up to our happy suburban slaves who are torpid and bereft of any taste whatsoever- as such, they gobble this slop up like hungry pigs.Anyways, the plot of this movie is that our hero travels to beetlegeuse/nightmare b4 xmas land of the dead(yes we have seen it before folks, and funnier and better).This happens because he proposes to a dead corpse unwittingly so they are to be married- meanwhile his other forced marriage awaits him in the land of the living...So we are presented with lots of cutesy/morbid scenes that prove to Tim Burton that more of the same doesn't count as being edgy. This movie has all the edges of fat man's sock and it smells as bad.If you are handy with the fast forward button you can see some funny musical bits.. but mainly this is dull and reminiscent of many movies that came before it that were much better.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
loove this movie,I do like this movie better than Nightmare Before Christmas. Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors and him as a voice actor is amazing!!

Wonderful! except for the songs and story,"It's too bad that movies depend on plot at all because if they didn't this would be a really great movie. It was visually great and the characters even seemed to be 'acting' with their mannerisms and facial expressions. With the exception of the piano pieces, which were quite nice, the music (specifically the songs) were terrible. Also, the story doesn't really seem to make sense.Tim Burton and Danny Elfman fans will love it though, and claim it's great, but they won't be able to tell you why the story and songs are great, so be wary! There is a reason. They aren't great. It's too bad really, because a lot was done that was right. The visuals were good, and the Victorian England setting seemed spot on. I did love that Town Crier, and I hope that they make a comeback.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

I saw the trailer back when I was first watching Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in theaters, and I was nearly scared out of my wits (I was about 10 years old that time). After I saw it a couple months ago, I was pleasantly surprised the same way I was surprised at Charlie and the Chocolate Factory among others. The actors were top notch, the animation was great, and the music was decent. I especially liked Helena Bonham Carter's performance as the Corpse Bride, even with her singing voice. If you can get passed the creepy title, you'll definitely love this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why Go Up There When People Are Dying to Get Down Here?,"As a child, one of the many reasons I loved Christmas was the many stop-motion animated specials that were shown at the time. But with the advent of CGI and other special effects of the like, the stop-motion art has nearly died. But luckily the genre has a savior in director Tim Burton who created A Nightmare before Christmas back in 1993. Over a decade later he Burton put out his second full length stop-motion animation feature film The Corpse Bride.And since this is Tim Burton, the story is macabre and somehow sweet at the same time. The story takes place in Victorian times focusing on the arranged marriage of Victor, Johnny Depp in his sheepish Edward Scissorhands mode, and Victoria, voiced by Emily Watson (Punch-Drunk Love), yet somehow a joke was never made at this similarity. Unlike many arranged marriages, the two are smitten wit each other but this makes Victor a little too nervous as he messes up rehearsal. So he heads off to the woods to practice his vows only to unknowingly put the wedding ring on the finger of the undead who becomes, naturally, his corpse bride, as voiced by Helena Bonham Carter (Planet of the Apes, the Marky Mark version) and hilarity ensues. To all the dues that had to explain the stripper at your bachelor party, try explaining to you fiancée how you ended up married to the undead the night before your wedding.The puppets themselves were brilliantly crafted and very similar to those seen in Nightmare with a lot of very tall, very skinny or very short and very obese characters. Each and every puppet that shows up on screen is so entertaining and detailed in their own way they each could have warranted their own movie. The motions of the puppets are very slick and are not at all choppy like the old Christmas specials. There are plenty of plot twists to keep you guessing who Victor end up with and even if you are like me and are able to guess the big twist early, it still doesn't take away from the story.The only problem with the movie is the stop-motion animation does get a little old as the film progresses. Maybe the Christmas specials had the right time frame with a half an hour runtime. But that is totally made up for in the DVD extras as there are seven mini-documentaries that run about five to ten minutes that show the behind the scenes on how the movie got made. Those alone make the DVD alone worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""Corpse Bride"" Dead on Arrival: I'm Sorry, but I Will Not Eat Tim Burton's Sh*t.","To Hell with Tim Burton. To Hell with him and his Gothic garbage. It's old, it's tired, and I, for one, am sick of it.These were the thoughts coursing through my head after watching Tim Burton's ""The Corpse Bride."" Now, please understand that I like Tim Burton - I admire his unique visual style, loving ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,"" ""Ed Wood,"" ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns,"" ""Sleepy Hollow,"" ""Big Fish,"" ""Mars Attacks!"" (quite underrated, I believe), ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and ""Beetle Juice,"" but unlike all those Hot Topic idiots out there, I won't enjoy a film just because he had a hand in it.I found that ""Corpse Bride"" featured wonderful animation and great voice casting...and, well, that's about it. Even the music, once again by Burton-favorite Danny Elfman, was hardly worthwhile. The movie had four songs in it, and only one was actually worth listening to (""Remains of the Day""?). I believe the great composer is capable of much more, though it's hard to tell because the production quality of the songs in this and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was awful - the vocals in the songs was drowned out significantly by the music, rendering the words almost indecipherable.The movie had a pincushion of a plot, hardly flowing at all. Victor (Johnny Depp) jumped from Victoria (Emily Watson) to Emily, the film's title character (Helena Bonham Carter) and back again so many times in the 77 minute-long film, it was almost laughable by the end.It was almost as if the writers gave the animators a draft of the script, and then when it came time to finish, the animators asked for the final draft, and the writers collectively shrugged, saying, ""Eh, no one will notice."" (Granted, perhaps the humorously short runtime was the only real saving grace of this ""film""...still, 77 minutes is still painfully long for a bad joke.)Oh, and the end: utterly ridiculous and completely nonsensical; it wasn't ""magical""...it was just plain bad writing. This God-awful attempt at a fairytale-like ending made me question just when ""rebelling against Hollywood"" became synonymous with bad movie-making.While I do enjoy most Tim Burton's films, he is definitely not the omnipotent film-making powerhouse Hot Topic wants me to believe he is, wowing everyone with each and every movie he helps to create; he can cure cancer for all I care, but I will still never forgive him for ""Planet of the Apes.""",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

"CORPSE BRIDE : Visually Stunning, Outlandishly Funny, & Emotionally Honest...","CORPSE BRIDEThough I was very excited to see it, I was unsure of what to expect when I watched CORPSE BRIDE because I've been somewhat underwhelmed by most of Tim Burton's current films. BIG FISH was merely okay for me, and CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY was visually stunning and had some great elements, but was marred by some terrible creative decisions.However, CORPSE BRIDE proves to be Tim Burton's best film in years as it combines an outlandish visual style, a crazed storyline, blatant caricatures, and a very genuine emotional storyline to make a highly entertaining film. In my honest opinion, CORPSE BRIDE would be the most worthy winner of the Best Animated Feature Oscar this year.CORPSE BRIDE has a lot in common with it's biggest rival, WALLACE & GROMIT. Both films embrace outlandish stylizations and wring every last bit of humor out of the possible visual imagery. However, where W&G had a lackadaisical wit about it that pretty much left an emotional story on the sidelines in exchange for endlessly entertaining stupid humor... CORPSE BRIDE manages to also involve an emotionally involving story and characters with a good deal of depth.In CORPSE BRIDE, the physical characteristics embody the voice over work beautifully and the film is always incredible to behold visually. But the best quality of the film is that it does not simply rely on the visuals and humor. The film takes time to explore the longings and desires of these unrealistic characters in a very realistic way... and as a result of Burton's direction, we are able to both care very much for the characters, but also laugh at how ridiculous they are.The voice-work in this film is spot on all around. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Emily Watson all add fully realized portrayals to the 3 leading characters... while Tracy Ullman, Albert Finney, and Johanna Lumley provide brilliantly overcharacterized comedic voice work for their supporting characters. In my opinion, CORPSE BRIDE has taken the energetic visual spunk of the common recent animated films... but it has also added a more creatively and fully developed screenplay than most others. And the adding together of so many wonderful parts leaves the audience with an overall delight of a film.... A- ...",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The deader the better,"In a world where so many animated films are effortlessly vibrant and soaked with bright candy colors, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is a dark, yet rarely dreary exercise, with dark subject matter taken in a harmless and fun form. The story is cute, the voice acting has a fine elegance to it, and the mischief and cinematography is delightfully cinematic.Any expectations of frightening sequences or nightmare-inducing scenes can be safely discarded upon arrival. While the film is sometimes dark, it is never haunting or indelibly scaring and, I firmly believe, the more films you've seen the more inclined you are to enjoy it. I recall references some early twenties and thirties films and including one famous line uttered from one very famous film.The story revolves around the shy and clumsy Victor Van Dort (voiced by Johnny Depp), who is preparing for his arranged marriage with Victoria Everglot (Watson) in a Victorian Era Europe. The Van Dorts are a wealthy family, while the Everglots don't have a dime to their name, and marriage will hopefully buy them a better spot on the social class level. When Victor ruins the potential wedding, he is sent off to better prepare himself where he practices his vows in the woods, placing his ring on a curled stick only to have it come alive as the ""Corpse Bride."" The bride is voiced by Helena Bonham Carter, in a beautifully fitting role, as she believes Victor sincerely meant to marry her. Things become conflicted, but thankfully, never resemble a shouting match like an episode of Maury.The stop-motion animation is absolutely wonderful. An artful and divine masterpiece. Characters are created in true Tim Burton fashion; tall and lanky, as if their arms are black-coated toothpicks and their heads small mounds of clay with a touch of fantasy. What is even more amazing is what Burton can do with such tiny characters. There is a scene early in the film where Victor plays a lovely song on the piano, as Emily waltzes down the stairs quietly so as not to disturb him. The scene is complimented by utter silence and simplicity, not to mention beautifully crafted romance before the subjects even meet each other. Not to mention, Danny Elfman's score, like always, is ravishing and perfectly concatenates the vibrant experience that is awaiting the viewer.At a mere seventy-three minutes without credits, Corpse Bride has the look and feel of a potential Television program for the unique viewer. It races past, and with a basic yet imaginative idea, its possibilities never feel gridlocked to the ordinary. It's hard to believe it took four writers (one of them the late Pixar voice actor Joe Ranft) to write such a concise work for the eyes and the mind. If there's one petty complaint, it's that even at a slender seventy-three minutes the film starts to become much of a muchness and the drab look does wear on the eyes. What could've been a tedious exercise is still worked fittingly into a stop-motion film from a director that has proved in the past he can deliver a brilliant one.Voiced by: Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Tracey Ullman, Paul Whitehouse, Joanna Lumley, and Albert Finney.

Disappointing. I was really looking forward to this,"Tim Burton's career as a filmmaker has been almost bizarre as the subject matter of his movies. He's created some absolute masterpieces that will be remembered as some of cinemas greatest achievements, Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas and Batman. But after he made Ed Wood in 1994, something happened to his style. Gone was the mystical, otherworldly glow you got after watching one of his films, which was replaced by a feeling of either short lived glee (Mars Attacks) or utter confusion (Sleepy Hollow, Planet of the Apes) This summers movie season was one everyone eagerly anticipated. We got not one, but TWO Burton movies, both starring Johnny Depp (a winning combination to be sure), and one was a stop motion animated film. Seeing as Nightmare Before Christmas is my favorite movie of all time, i was so excited i nearly wet myself (too much?)but alas, Charlie &TCF came and my friends (all avid Burton fans) and i were thoroughly disappointed at the way Burton just threw bizarreness at us in order to cover up the fact that the story was a travesty to everything Roahl Dahl set out to establish. making Wonka into a big weirdo doesn't add to his charm and mystery, neither does giving him a back story.but this is a review for corpse bride, isn't it? the movie tries, but unfortunately, its kinda like watching a movie where the director tried to copy Tim Burton's style, except this IS a Tim Burton movie. the plot itself is fine, but there needs to be more character development. were given all these amazing, funny characters and then nothing is ever done with them. their'ye either dropped entirely (what happened to victor's parents""?) or given such terrible lines their role is completely unnecessary (victorias father/ the priest). things only get worse when we descend into the afterlife. part of what made nightmare so great was the townsfolk of Halloween town, who were all given unique personalities, and they all had moments in the film where they got to steal the show. in CB, we get a couple of interesting characters (the best being ""Paul,ze Head Waiter!) and then a bunch of wise-cracking skeletons. the only character you ever really feel attached too is Emily, who is a sweet, endearing girl who naiveness and charm makes up for the fact that she is constantly rotting.The voice work is done well, Johnny Depp isn't given much to work with, but he does well at making Victor into a lovable Wet noodle. Helena Bonham Carter is sweet like a little girl and Albert Finneys voice is so outrageously sour, you wish he had more lines to say. The music is standard Elfman stuff, but the songs!!! MY GOD, WHAT WAS HE THINKING. CB has possibly the most forgettable and unpleasant score in a movie i think i have seen since those strait to video Aladdin movies. I'm sure Albert Finney and Joanna Lumley can hold notes, but why they weren't allowed to is beyond me. the opening song in a musical is supposed to set the mood for the whole movie, ""According to Plan"" does not accomplish this in the least. The song where Danny Elfman was the skeleton got irritating before it even started. What i want to know is, why does Johnny Depp not get a song, but that *bleeping maggot does! Overall, Corspe Bride really let me down. It was supposed to be Burton return to form, but instead its a tired retread of everything he did in his earlier movies. Yes, we get it. The afterlife is funny and creepy, gross thing intrigue you. We know that now. Give us something new, we know we have it in you Kazz's Rating 5 out of 10 Upon watching this movie, my girlfriend asked me ""Is their something wrong with Tim Burton? Like is he sick or something?

The history is about love from finding the right one, and luckily for Victor (the main character, a little shy and insecure) he don't make any efforts because his coming marriage was arranged, and although his doubts about this kind of things can work, his fiancée (Victoria) is really nice. But by the other side and after a little bit of problems that occurred during the marriage attempt, Victor finds himself married by mistake with the corpse bride (that although dead, is really pretty and kind).At the end, you don't know if Victoria or the corpse bride should marry with Victor (personally I prefer the corpse bride, but Victoria comes first, so...), but whatever is a nice ending...a great movie for enjoy, with a weird but simple great history, great voice acting and more.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Popular Review of Corpse Bride,"""Corpse Bride"" (2005) is a movie that will have your eyes constantly popping out of your head with amazement, similar to how the Corpse Bride's (Helena Bonham Carter) eyes constantly pop out of her own head during the movie. Director Tim Burton never fails to leave his audiences in awe with the fantastical nature of his films. With the incredible Expressionistic animation and hyperbolic appearances of the characters, the audience can't help but be engaged in the movie's exciting flow of the events. This film features Johnny Depp as Victor Van Dort and Emily Watson as Victory Everglot. Knowing Johnny Depp has any connection to a movie is already a good sign. It is the perfect movie to watch if you enjoy horror, comedy, and/or romance- Yes, this movie has it all! The film presents a depiction of the world that will not only have you reevaluating your daily life, but will also have you ""die"" laughing at its humor. This movie is perfect for getting you into the Halloween spirit, but is honestly enjoyable anytime of the year. I would recommend, so go out and watch!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
how is this a movie?,"this is not a review on the actual movie itself. this is a review on Tim Burton. i have had enough. how has a man been able to take movies with the most basic plots, and screw it up completely. Charlie and the chocolate factory is supposed to be a movie about a little boy who's dreams come true when he visits the chocolate factory of the world renowned Willie wonka. not that hard of a plot. the only thing that kept me in the theater was the thought that Willie wonka, might go Michael Jackson on the kids. it was my fear for their safety that kept me in that theater. again, planet of the apes. the whole concept was in the title, a planet populated with apes. so why did you feel the need to expand on that idea. i didn't that a man could take a film as bad as planet of the apes and actually make it worse. the only thing that has kept him in the game has been johnny deep. i think its about time you retract your claws and let him go about his career. since this is the comment area for corpse bride, i guess i might review that too. Tim Burton had a little success with nightmare before Christmas, could be because he didn't direct it. so he thought he might do the exact same thing, but throw johnny deep into the mix, and it will be twice as good right?...wrong. it was absolutely awful. the one thing i got out of seeing this movie is that i learned that the hands on my watch glow in the dark, cause i was counting the seconds till i got to leave. my suggestion is that Tim Burton should crawl back into the crack pipe that he came out of.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
A genuine masterpiece,"When I saw this movie for the first time I was around 7-8 years old and I immediately fell in love with it.
I recently watched this again with my young cousin and I found myself moved several times during this movie.The delicacy with which Burton narrates a story that takes place between the world of the living and that of the dead is utterly sublime. First of all, what struck me a lot is that the living world is dark and grey, while the dead world is happy and colorful.The film lives on a delicacy able to entertain and move, and that is difficult to describe in words. It is a film that should be seen at least once in a lifetime, and that lends itself to numerous reading plans: a child will perceive it differently from an adult, but in both cases it will remain a great film.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just rent The Nightmare Before Chrismas,"Tim Burton strikes out with this one.The plot is unbelievably weak. A young man, son of the nouveau riche, is to marry a nobleman's daughter. He's very shy and though he's never met her, he likes her, and this makes him bumbling and nervous. While practicing his lines for the ceremony, he slips a ring on a corpse's finger and she comes to life and takes him to the world of the dead, where he is seemingly trapped.The corpse bride herself is a character of so much personality that she totally destroys the plot. She's insane and is keeping the man from his true love... which would make her a good villain. She's also been wronged and is innocent and is attractive, which make her a good love interest. This is where things really get screwed up: the whole idea for a movie this careless with plot is to stick to a formula. Unfortunately, it's the formula these days to deviate from ""the formula"" so the whole love interest part of the story gets completely screwed up and makes you kind of hate the main character.The songs are dull, obviously meant to stretch the movie to be an acceptable length.But most of all, there's nothing very impressive about the visuals in the movie that wasn't vastly better in The Nightmare Before Christmas. The land of the dead, frankly, isn't that appealing. Everything moves way too much, it's jarring. And the only moments that really look good are ones that borrow directly from The Nightmare Before Christmas.Don't bother. Tim Burton's successes have all had interesting and unusual stories with characters that made sense and that we could relate to, but not The Corpse Bride.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Burton's Brilliance,"Who would've thought that an animated children's movie could depict the legend of the Faustian bargain without being horrifying for kids? Well, Tim Burton managed to do so in his film ""Corpse Bride"" (2005). Now, I'm not into scary films at all, even the slightest bit, but Burton impressed me with his inclusion of suspense and some scary elements through his inclusion of the land of the dead, while being able to tell a fantastic story of two young people and their rocky road to being wed because of their involvement with some characters from the land of the dead.Set in a Victorian era village, Victor (Johnny Depp) and Victoria (Emily Watson) are forced into marriage by their money-hungry parents. Burton's portrayal of the greedy parents of Victor and Victoria stand out in their physical features. They're given huge heads, probably to symbolize their self-importance and selfishness, which makes them look pretty funny in relations to their skinny, long limbs. Selfishness is a huge theme throughout this film and its displayed in an ugly, sad way, by being characteristics of people in the living world that is gray, lonely, and disconnected. Maybe Burton was also trying to teach kids how greed isn't a good quality to have? Kudos to him if he was trying to teach children through his film!Burton's film was unexpected in so many ways, which we can see through the ironic differences in colors of the living and dead worlds, as well as the vibes and togetherness shown among st the characters. His decision to do so really brings out the themes he is trying to show to his audience, children and adults, of the greed we see in society, which many of us are guilty of, and how ultimately money and materialistic wants aren't worth much when you don't have people that you love, where we see some elements of the Faustian bargain coming into play. I guess that's kind of corny to say but it's true and Burton does an excellent job of showing this! Even if you aren't into children's animations and/or scary films that Burton is also known for, I highly recommend this film because he is honestly an artist when it comes to incorporating mature elements into kid's movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Visual Joy To Watch,"Corpse Bride (2005, Dir. Tim Burton & Mike Johnson)When an arranged marriage between Victor Van Dort and Victoria Everglot reaches the rehearsals, Victor starts to worry. Spending time alone in the forest, Victor decides to practice on his own. Everything seems to go well, until he accidentally puts the ring upon the hand of a corpse. Before he knows it, Victor is in the land of dead and now has a corpse bride. Whilst everyones worries about who Victoria will marry in the land of the living, Victor desperately finds a way to get back.One of the joys in the film world today, is having Tim Burton creating films. The are not just entertaining because of the script or the acting, but because of the amazing visuals he brings us. This film is no different, as the colours are chosen well. Whilst the land of the living is very dull and dark, the land of the dead is a world of vibrant colours. There is a very small amount of stop motion used these days, which is a shame, as it's amazing to see. The level of detail in them is outstanding and there is so many possibilities of models to be created. This voice artists in this film are well chosen. There is the usual Burton choices such as Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Christopher Lee, who like always brings to life such marvellous characters. The music in it is catchy with some lovely tunes, and there's lots of fun here for all ages.""Just remember, when you want to come back, say ""Hopscotch."""" - Elder Gutknecht (Michael Gough)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very very good one of the best kids movies out there,"I'm going to try and stay away from spoilers, this movie is amazing. It makes a really heartwarming story of love, without spoiling anything there are a couple twists and some really cute moments, the ending is really emotional and almost made me cry and for an hour and 17 minute movie it manages to tell a really somber and really well written story. Due to its length there are some issues like certain aspects of the world not being fully explained and characters not having quite enough chemistry however, it still manages to make an amazing story despite the length I definitely recommend this for anyone who likes Tim burtons work, especially nightmare before Christmas the movie has a great message for anyone any age and is a great movie beginning to end. Another small nitpick is it is a musical and some of the songs aren't great, but the story more than makes up for it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Corpse Bride:The Doc's Review,"From the genius who brought you Nightmare Before Christmas comes this piece of regurgitated trash known as Corpse Bride.Not only is the film poorly written but the jokes (if you can call them that) always run completely flat.The storyline has potential but ultimately fails to keep Corpse Bride above the crap o meter.It's simply ridiculous and totally unfunny.A lot of kids won't get the humor and the adults who do will find it generic and stupid.The characters are all built up with a good personality but don't use it to their advantage.The character Victoria's parents looked,and,spoke in a way that could have been funny...IF THEY TRIED TO BE FUNNY!!!The cinematography for the most part is very good i'll give Burton that his visuals are always top notch but without a story that's at least mediocre (which Corpse Bride does not)the visuals aren't even a good excuse to see the film.I went it hoping that the man who created some brilliant movies would give me another great film but sadly i have no praise for Tim Burton when it comes to Corpse Bride.A very big disappointment and a huge let down for me.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful,"Tim Burton's Corpse Bride was a film I was really looking forward to seeing, I thought it would be amazing. But o boy was I wrong. It was decent but nothing else at all, and maybe not even that. The story was not that original and not that good. It had been done plenty times before to success and I guess they thought they could do it one more time. Why couldn't they have just come up with something original for a change. The performances are very good but also nothing special or original in the voice industry.Johnny Depp and Albert Finney are both some of the greatest actors ever to live and this is a big disappointment for them. Emily Watson and Helena Bonham Carter are both also very good actors but pretty much fail here. The direction too is unoriginal and not great, in fact it is even worse than the story and the acting. Tim Burton is a good director and I fail to understand how he got this done. The visual effects I guess you would call them are amazing, the stop-motion animation is flawless. It could bee worth seeing just because of the animation if nothing else because it really lacks anything else good. Rent The Nightmare Before Christmas.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An excellent animation for adults,"This film, very popular during Halloween, tells a funny story which runs around a young woman who was murdered in her own wedding day, and that still hasn't lost hope of getting married. Directed by Tim Burton, has a screenplay by Caroline Thompson, Pamela Pettler and John August, and the voices of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Albert Finney and Christopher Lee.Tim Burton has a taste for strange and ""out of the box"" films, with unusual scenarios and bizarre characters. This is a well made script, with original ideas but functional, where everything fits as it should be. The selected voices belong to actors who usually collaborate in projects of this director, especially Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, director's wife and herself an actress of great vocal talent. None of them stayed behind expectations, having done an excellent vocal performance. The animations are very well done, using the stop motion technique, a lengthy process that, in this case, obtained a final result of high quality, which certainly benefited from the experience previously performed in ""Nightmare Before Christmas"". The integration of musical themes in the plot was well done, making us remember the tradition of musicals. The soundtrack, by Danny Elfman, makes here a very interesting result.Despite being a animation film, is for adolescent and adult audiences, and blends harmoniously animation, morbidity, joy, music and romance. Worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good for Die Hard Burton Fans,"This film has all things you come to expect from a Tim Burton Film. We have all the usual actors lending their voice talent, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter along with Hammer Horror alum like Christopher Lee and Michael Gough. Combine that with a bit of Danny Elfman and you have all of Burton's trademark crew. Along with them it has his unique blend of humor and horror. The animation is immediately recognizable with that claymation style similar to ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""Frankenweeinie"" or ""Vincent"". So, chances are, if you are a fan of his work, you will get a real kick out of this film.OK, not meaning to bury the lead, other than being Tim Burton, how is the film? It's fine. The songs are nothing remarkable, but they're good. The voice acting and animation is very good. It is the story where the movie has its greatest faults.The romance follows a lot of the typical rom com tropes. Any twists and turns the movie makes are all very predictable for anyone who has ever seen a movie before. There are some solid jokes, but a lot of them are dead on arrival. A lot of the story seems to wander. Our main character Victor is being chased but manages to find time to take a break to play the piano. Victor as a character comes across very wishy washy. He flip-flops more often than a pair of sandals. And the whole conflict is resolved insultingly easy.I stand by, if you are a fan of Tim Burton, and like his style and humor, you'll enjoy this film. But, if you are judging the movie on its own merits, it's just fine. It has a short runtime, so it doesn't overstay its welcome. It may have some heart, but there is very little meat on this corpse.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Corpse Bride delivers a true audiovisual delight. Be it the mastery with which the story is narrated, the striking music or the charisma of its characters","Based on a popular Russian-Jewish tale, The Corpse Bride brings together all aspects of what is expected of a Burtorian feature. Directed by Tim Burton and Mike Johnson, the film mixes dark concepts with children's playfulness, which only Burton can produce. Inserting his gothic streak into a fabulous story, Burton manages to bring out the best in him in a safe but well-appointed place that converses directly with the viewer. His trip already introduces the audience into a dull, apathetic version of a small Victorian village, preparing for a big social event. The entire construction of the environment decays into a bluish gray, which reflects the morbidity of the oppressive environment that it seeks to represent, bringing a dark aspect to characters that emit little life. Which creates a tremendous contrast to the World Of The Dead, which is eloquent and playful in color, where the dead truly come to life before our eyes.Victor finds himself caught between the two worlds, being the key player in the entire concept of the film. During his time in the world of the living, the young man is clumsy and uncomfortable, always with the overwhelming morbidity of a born pessimist, but during his stay in the world of the dead, the character comes alive and has an active voice, which evolves into a grand crescent. Depp, so used to the role of weirdos, delivers all the weirdness needed to build the character, showing an impeccable ability to embody what was proposed to him. Victor needs to get married, just as Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) has her share of responsibility - if his family seeks respectability by joining a traditional family, hers urgently needs the fortune of the nouveau riche to avoid bankruptcy. The motives that spur your parents on are vile, mean, and self-serving. The two, however, can have little opinion, because just as they do not know each other, they cannot say whether or not there is a possibility of a real attraction between them.The world beyond, glimpsed after the addition to the plot of the title character - played with vigor by Helena Bonham Carter - is much more attractive and dynamic. Then comes the film's curious contradiction: if the dead seem much more alive than the very ones whose blood is still running through their veins, why return to that everyday existence? And once established the relationships that arise between the male protagonist and his two brides - and real, innocent and adorable, and the zombie, determined and owner of his will - how to choose logically, if the emotion involved tries to drive us away with real effort from the reason?The title character is so sweet and charming that she manages to win us over in an impeccable way. Emily is so thirsty to experience love that she smothers her lover's free will, clinging to anyone who shows her affection as she struggles to show off her qualities. But it's exactly when she lets her guard down that they surface, bringing an emotional connection not only with the protagonist but with the audience. It is with her that we witness the emotional charge of the film, in addition to the massive flirtation with moments of pure terror that show us a darker side of her persona. None of this would be possible without the impeccable performance of Helena, who brings life to the death of her person.Tim Burton decided to make the film with stop-motion, a technique of filming with plasticine dolls, because he thinks that when interacting with his characters, the atmosphere is made up of more creativity. At first glance, it might sound boring to see a movie with such puppets. The director shows the opposite of what we might think. Maybe if it was done in graphic animation, the demo wouldn't be as dazzling. The black humor, so latent in the work, is presented in a magnificent way. Whether through physical jokes, using the decomposing parts of your characters, or the discomfort of situations, everything is masterfully orchestrated. The comic friends and the games with the macabre bring in a great dynamic, right when the film decides to collide their worlds in a powerful and fun way, reversing everything that was expected for the meeting.Aesthetically similar to Jack's Strange World, The Corpse Bride uses the same animation technique to tell its story: stop-motion. The art direction of this feature film (which includes, as I explained in that review, the very look of the characters) is simply spectacular: from the compact appearance of Lord Everglot to the lanky figure of his obnoxious wife, every inhabitant of The Corpse Bride universe relies on a striking and particular appearance. Victor, with his angular face and constantly pained expression, goes so far as to resemble his voice actor, the talented Johnny Depp (who creates a fragile and insecure voice, perfect for the character). Meanwhile, the title character displays the right balance between grace and bizarre, as her symmetrical face includes details that remind us of her cadaverous nature, such as purplish eyes and a deep cut on the left side of her face.The sets, in turn, follow the particular logic of Burton's mind, always influenced by the Gothic-Expressionist conception, and abuse unexpected angles and dark corners that fill the viewer's imagination with their meanings and secrets. This time, however, the filmmaker surprises us by establishing an inverted logic in his color palette: while the world of the living presents desaturated colors that almost transform it into a black-and-white universe, the 'city' of the dead reveals It is filled with vibrant colors that make it a warm and joyful place. This duality, exposed by colors, shadows and animations, brings such a powerful dynamic that it raises even more the criticism passed by the film. Everything in the world of the dead is grand and full, while the world of the living is contained and sparse. Victor's familiar theme has a more mournful tone than Emily's tragic death, which is spectacularly narrated in an exquisite musical number.One of the best things about Corpse Bride is called Danny Elfman. In addition to the mind-blowing visuals, the enchanting photography and the perfect and very funny dolls, it is the musical sequences composed by the former leader of the band Oingo Boingo that correspond to many of the best moments of the production. With a narration punctuated by these musical interventions, Elfman repeats - in an improved way - what he had done before in many of his partnerships with Burton: he gives the music an importance that goes beyond mere props, positioning itself as a relevant part of the plot and guaranteeing the full attention of the spectator, who eagerly awaits the next songs and what they will represent within the filmic context. Compositions with piano and perfect framing with the voice and feeling of each character, perfectly corresponding to each moment and situation that the film was broadcast. For the humor, drama and exposure part of the story, the soundtrack was fundamental. In other words, it couldn't have been better!Nothing in life is perfect, however, if ""The Corpse Bride"" were bigger, it would come closer to such a feat. The film is short, leaving some of the story aside. Perhaps because it doesn't make the film tiresome and more accessible for younger ages. The fascination for the animation technique almost makes us forget the problems that the film also has. The story doesn't present any more daring (apart from, of course, the premise of the film), with a highly conventional ending and no major surprises. Such is the eccentricity of the theme and the name involved in the project, it was to be expected something more unusual, spectacular, but that is not what happens. The outcome is simple, direct, predictable, and with its tricky lessons.Extremely engaging and emotional, Corpse Bride delivers a true audiovisual delight. Be it the mastery with which the story is narrated, the striking music or the charisma of its characters, the plot conquers its audience while showing a refined technique that transcends its age. Full of duality and with a powerful message, the film presents us with a charming work that brings out the best of its director: his heart. Even though it may have used and abused its potential to the fullest, credit cannot be taken from its makers, as they deliver an incredible iteration to animations, creating morbid environments and scrutinized with the best of tragicomedy, in addition to using each other very well.

The usual Tim Burton fare,"I enjoyed Corpse Bride, I think it's a good film with a very interesting style. Not as iconic as a Nightmare before Christmas but still good. It's ultra gothic, which I think is where Burton excels the most and it's very dreary. Even the alive characters look mostly dead.The voice cast is excellent, it always amazes me when Johnny Depp puts on another voice so expert you can't even tell it's him. I loved the main cast a lot here and it was nice to see Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson and Christopher Lee have a role.The music is good but no masterpiece tracks here.The plot has a great premise but can come across a bit barebones and would have benefited from a bit more depth, Victor and his alive bride to be Victoria only really share two moments together in the entire film!8/10: A good watch, and it's under 80 minutes so kids hopefully won't get too bored.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good Halloween film, nothing else","Corpse Bride is one of those almost classic movies you should watch on Halloween considering you're not too into horror movies. That's kind of the specialty of Tim Burton: he makes dark movies emo or goth teens are way too invested in. I don't know if it has to do with the plots or the aesthetic.But the aesthetic of Corpse Bride is amazing: almost colourless land of the living, the colourful and fun land of the dead. The characters look amazing, everyone looks different and has different shapes of their faces and body. It's a nice change from typical animations, but of course the main characters are tall and skinny with the typical Burton styled faces: pale skin, huge eyes with dark circles around them. Still, every little detail in the animation is amazing. I could talk about stop-motion animation all day long, but perhaps not.Danny Elfman's music is pretty but generic. It's been heard over and over again. Sure, Victor's Piano Solo may give the viewer goose bumps, but other than that, every song feels like it's been done so many times before. The soundtrack is alright, but could be way better.The story is interesting and well-written. It's short, and many things are left unexplained, but it's better that way. It's good that it ends quite suddenly without anything like ""FEW WEEKS LATER"" because that would kind of ruin the moment. The movie is about what it is about, it doesn't need anything else. The structure of the story is very similar to The Nightmare Before Christmas. No, it's not entirely the same, it's not ""copied"", but it has some sort of parallels and symmetry.Corpse Bride is a good movie to watch around Halloween, but that's about it. I can't imagine watching it during the summer or anything. Corpse Bride has charisma, unique aesthetic and astonishing setting.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

a Tim Burton charmer,"Much like his ""Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride"" uses state-of-the-art, stop-motion animation to tell a cheerily morbid story - this one showcasing bodies in various stages of decomposition larking it up in a musical comedy underworld. Think of it as a role-reversal version of the myth about the god Hades and his reluctant bride Persephone, kidnapped from the land of the living.Victor is a painfully shy and awkward young man who is about to enter into an arranged marriage with an equally shy young woman, coincidentally named Victoria (even more ""coincidentally,"" the movie takes place in the Victorian Era). However, on the eve of the wedding, Victor finds himself ""married"" to a dead woman whose frozen corpse he stumbles upon in a nearby forest. Victor is immediately whisked away to the Land of the Dead, where skeletons sing and dance, and where maggots and black widow spiders offer words of advice for the benighted newlywed couple. Much of the story involves Victor's desperate attempts to flee the scene and Victoria's concomitant efforts to bring him back to the land of the living.The talented animators have had a bit of ironic fun with the visual palette, bathing the scenes set in the real world in a ghostly-blue pallor, while bringing the Land of the Dead to life with vibrant, splashy colors. In both foreground and background, the animation has a clean, uncluttered look, with the exaggerated, severely angular features of the characters providing amusing commentary on their personalities. The dialogue is clever, sharp and witty, and the musical numbers have a buoyancy and bounce to them that help keep the morbid subject matter palatable for all but the very youngest audience members. The film is also blessed with fine voice-over work from the likes of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Tracey Ullman, Albert Finney, and horror movie veteran Christopher Lee.""Corpse Bride"" is a relaxing, unfrenetic treat for those on all points of the life/death continuum.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

9/10 Kind of short. But Overall a Great movie,"Cropse Bride (2005). Alright. Let's talk about this amazing Tim Burton film. So as a film reviewer. I'm going to tell you all my likes and dislikes. And then I will give you my final thoughts and my over all rating. I'm going to be doing this for all of the movies and other things that I review here on IMDB for now on. So here we go.""MY LIKES & DISLIKES ""
So first off I just wanted to point out and say that this is on of those movies that make you feel a lot more better about death. This movie didn't only like really move me in such a positive way but it also gave me amazing feelings that I have never felt before in my life. All of the characters where so well casted and all of the voice actors where perfectly chosen for them as well. And not only that. The way that this was animated was fantastic and the CGI was pretty decent as well. But the one thing that sticks out in my mind is the Music and songs. Oh my gosh that is another thing about corpse bride that made it all worth it. Two of my favorite songs that I have heard where ""Remains Of The Day."" & The Wedding Song."" But as far as the other songs go I didn't get a chance to hear them. So the cast was very well casted and perfect choices. So as far as my dislikes go there really isn much that I can say negatively about this movie except for the fact that it's kind of a short one. But it really doesn't matter to me because I really did enjoy the movie and I will watch it again. And honestly that pretty much all the dislikes that I have. Except for the fact that I do have a couple of other things that I dislike about it but I don't know what they could be at the moment.""FINAL THOUGHTS & OVERALL RATING""
So what are my final thoughts on Corpse Birde (2005)? Even though it was kind of short. I loved every second of it. This is probably another one of this movies that is a fun and good one to watch during the halloween and fall seasons and it's a great one to watch with the family as well. I'm not going to spoil anything here. But the ending to this movie was something that will probably be with me forever. So if any of you guys haven't seen this movie then it's defiantly a must see during halloween and so on. And not only that. I do recommend giving it a watch! So my final rating is going to be a solid 9/10. It is Kind of short. But Overall a Great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
What did I just watch?,"Now now before I make my review I just want to set the record straight I know there are lot of Johnny Deep fans and Tim Burton Fans both men do great at what they do and it has been a while since we got a Stop Motion movie so the more of those we can do the better off we can be.However Corpse Bride is sadly not a movie I would consider to be either good or bad it just one of those movies that left me shocked and appalled and I'm stone cold series about that.But there is quite the powerhouse in the voice acting department Johnny Deep, Christopher Lee,Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson,Tracey Ullman, Paul Whitehouse, Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney, Richard E.Grant,Michael Gough, Jane Horrocks and the cast does do some good voice work I'll give it that.The stop motion animation works for the film and in some ways it almost feels that the actors did some motion capture but that's my opinion.But the movie had so many gross moments that make you go ""They put that in a Children's movie""? I couldn't believe at the scenes I saw that were gross to the point I turn away. A good bit of this movie I had to turn away because I couldn't believe at what I saw.I know it's Tim Burton but come on everyone has their limits and this one push me to my limits it just after seeing what I saw in this movie I couldn't believe this movie got away with that. only watch it if you're a fan otherwise it will just make others go What?I give Corpse Bride an 5 out of 10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, sepulchral fantasy","Practicing his wedding vows in a creepy forest, Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp) finds himself accidently betrothed to Emily, the titular character (v. Helen Bonham Carter), who years earlier had been murdered on her wedding day. Similar to Burton's earlier film 'Beetlejuice' (1988) and the more recent animated films 'Coco' (2017) and 'The Book of Life' (2014), ""Corpse Bride' presents an amusing view an after-life populated by a variety of energetic dead people. The imagery and spindly or rotund characters in the film are similar to 'A Nightmare before Christmas' (on which co-director Mike Johnson worked) or, in some cases, to Terry Gilliam's iconic animated sequences in 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' (1969). The story is slight but entertaining (although the narrative is fragmented a bit by the musical interludes) and the voice talent excellent.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Review is by 5-year old son,"I think you should definitely watch it.It's really good. 👍
The music is really good, it's by Danny Elfman.It's a little creepy, but I didn't get scared too badly.My favorite character is Victor.He plays the piano well.There are other characters that play the piano well also.There's definitely lots of skeletons in the movie, and a lot of them sing and dance. This has got to be my favorite part of the movie.It really really freaks me out.I've watched this movie a lot the past few days and I've really enjoyed it.It's sad at the end, but overall it's a good movie to watch.I really want you to watch it, and it's rated PG so kids like me can watch it too.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stop-motion perfection,"Poor old Victor just can't get his through his wedding rehearsal, can't remember his lines, bumps into things, sets the bride's mother on fire. It is all enough to send anyone running for the woods. But Victor has fallen in love with his arranged bride-to-be and sets about practicing those vows. Only problem is that, in doing so, he manages to marry a dead woman; the Corpse Bride. And she has waited long enough for a husband, and so does not intend to let this one get away.I really enjoyed this film. Visually it really is stunning. The stop-motion figures look fantastic, the bride in particular. The songs I wasn't overly impressed with, but they did the job. What I did love was the Victorian attitude of Mrs (Lady?) Everglot, with her constant disapproval of her daughter and her impropriety. You know, like being able to talk without gasping as she isn't wearing a corset.The story is based on a Russian folktale, which in turn was based on anti-Semitic practice of waylaying Jewish wedding parties and murdering the bride.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Corpse Bride- Wacky Claymation Meets Thematic Masterpiece,"Corpse Bride is half haunting horror and half wacky musical. The combo may sound strange, but director Tim Burton makes it work, as our heroes Victor (Johnny Depp) and Emily (Helena Boneham Carter) jump back and forth from the underworld and the land of the living. I normally don't like musicals, as the silly choreographed dancing and straightforward lyrics rarely add much to a movie, but there were certainly some redeeming qualities to this movie's show tunes. The swing jazz of the underworld had far more life than the cold hearts of our above ground antagonist (Richard Grant's Lord Barkis) and the uptight Everglots (Joanna Lumley and Albert Finney), and Emily's laments pulled at our heartstrings.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best of all the Tim Burton animations,This is most assuredly the best of all the animated musicals produced by Tim Burton. The story is quite simple : a reluctant and gauche fiancé in an arranged marriage flees to the woods and inadvertently rehearses his wedding vows in the presence of a deceased woman who believes he meant to marry her. The ensuing drama is highly entertaining and can be watched over and again. The usual collection of memorable songs ensues and the finale is worthy of watching time and again. Even though the characters are mere cartoons the vocal acting is so superb that each character is believable and memorable. I confess that I regularly re-watch this film whenever times are 'blue' because it lightens my mood. This is among my favourite animated films. I advise a new viewer to watch it twice or thrice to catch the special nuances of the story. This is as good an animated film as many of the best 'live-action' dramas and does not age with the passage of time!,9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another gem!,"I saw this recently at the local $3 cinema with my son of 12. We had a great time with the script and the visuals. Tim Burton really knows how to tell a story and get you involved with the characters. Some of the lines were very British and I wonder how many people in the US got some of the jokes.Some of the scenes would be a bit scary for younger audiences but that should not stop you from renting the DVD (which I put down as a must buy). Younger children will also enjoy some of the musical numbers which break up the movie quite well.The other interesting thing was that the voices of the characters were supplied by a cavalcade British actors who are not really that well known in the States, refreshing for an ex-pat.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Similar to The Nightmare Before Christmas,"Even though I pride myself in being a Tim Burton fan, I never gave Corpse Bride a chance until recently.I recently went to Brussels to see the Tim Burton's Labyrinth experience which had of course Corpse Bride on display. I then promised myself I was going to watch it.It wasn't until a good two weeks ago on a 12 and a half hour flight that I gave it a chance.I expected less of the movie in terms of visuals but it was actually pretty good! The storyline itself I found to be very good as well, this movie would be categorized as a musical.In terms of the colors and the claymation style I found it to be very similar to one of my favorite movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas. The storyline did not disappoint until the very last ending.I will definitely rewatch this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
excellent movie...must watch...,"Just watched this movie in 2016...& i still cant believe that this movie was made in 2005.Nice Plot...good music..lovely & believable characters (even though many of them not even human)If you like to watch STOP MOTION movies ...then is excellent work. The representation of lead characters of movie is really very good, even though its STOP MOTION animation flick...Really enjoyed this movie.. The music & songs were also good & bit funny sometimes. This movie is good combination of thriller, romantic & emotional ride..",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A disgrace to all animated films,"I really don't know how on earth this was given 7.5/10. We were made to watch this at school and everyone i spoke to thought it was rubbish. The only person who liked it was the person who it belonged to. I just don't get it. There are so many great films out there with lower ratings than this trash. Look at the first American pie, one of the funniest films ever yet it gets less than 7! what is that all about? Don't get me wrong I'm not just into teen films. I do like animation films like shrek, toy story and other classics but the corpse bride is just rubbish. How on earth they got a great actor like johnny depp to do such an awful film i don't know.Bottom line this film sucks!",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
