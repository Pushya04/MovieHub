"Will Smith is Oscar-worthy, no doubt about it.","Here's the deal: It's real, it's heavy, and it's inspirational, but NOT AT ALL cheesy. Don't like that? Don't see it. I won't say much else. I will say that Will Smith was shockingly good now that he's paid his dues with ""Men in Black"" and ""Bad Boys.""I was very happy that this film never got political and blamed Reagan for the number of ""down on their luck"" people that were shown, nor was the race card ever pulled out. It was also refreshing that Smith's character never blamed anybody for his troubles.It's very funny at parts, but be prepared for some serious drama. In no ways is it cliché or contrived or boring. Let's just say that's it not Oliver Stone dramatic. This truly is a must see. To say ""I laughed, I cried"" would be really lame. It is the truth, though.We know that Scorsese's crowning achievement ""The Departed"" is going to take the cake at the Oscars, and I won't be complaining. But this movie deserves to be experienced and taken in by the masses.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Almost too heartbreaking to be uplifting even if it ultimately does it, but still engaging and driven by another very good performance from Will Smith","Chris Gardner is a struggling salesman who finds himself having to look after his son when his wife gives up and leaves him. Using his charm as much as his academic record, Chris wins his way onto an internship programme of twenty, with only one job at the end. He has the determination to make it but with no salary and almost no income from his sales efforts, Chris finds himself homeless and increasingly desperate as he tries to keep up with his peers by day and survive the rest of the time.This is an unusual film that, were it totally successful, could be called a victim of that success. Certainly the story it is telling is uplifting and very much testimony to the determination and courage of one man to make it despite tremendous odds. OK so he is not diving into burning buildings to save babies but it is still an engaging and inspiring story because of the sheer endless scale of the challenge and disappointment. It also helps that the sheer weight of soul-destroying challenges that he works through makes it almost impossible for all but the hardest hearted viewer not to feel happy for Chris when he finally makes it (as we know he ultimately will, or else his story would not be a film!) even if ""making it"" is ""making money"", which some viewers may find to be not totally worthy in itself. Ironically though this same weight of events also works against the film because it does make it a consistently hard watch. It is praise in a way because I personally tensed up with every added sorrow and this happened because of how convincing and heartbreaking this festival of misery and unfairness was.A massive part of this working as well as it does is Smith's performance. I last saw him in I Am Legend where I thought that the narrative development in that film totally undid his wonderfully convincing performance in the first half. Here again he is quite brilliant  utterly convincing, showing a flicker of spirit deep within him while also clearly showing each kick, each challenge on his increasingly worn face. Smith junior could have been one of those terribly cute-kid type roles but just about avoids it. Sure he is cute but he is not annoying, mainly because of how natural he is. I think he is really helped by the fact that he does seem to be able to act (or at least ""pretend"") but more than he already has a relationship with his father that feeds their on screen one. They work well together but ultimately the film is owned by Will Smith, who is great.Overall then this is an engaging and ultimately inspiring film but not one that is a lot of fun to watch. By virtue of how convincing Smith and the overall delivery is, I felt the tension in my own body, felt the crushing blows of each misfortune or challenge. It helps the film in a way but it did seem like the ""uplifting"" material is a long time coming.",,Anonymous,Biography
Take your parents to see it over the holidays,"I was fortunate to see this movie in a screening. I really enjoyed it, and felt that it lived up to the teary and heartwarming trailer. While the movie has an uplifting ""go for your dreams"" message, the deepest theme is that of family.Will Smith did a great job as the father trying to protect his son from their circumstances of becoming homeless as much as he can, while at the same time trying to work in the competitive world of stocks as an un-paid intern. Jaden Smith was outstanding as the preschool-aged kid who knows things are going wrong and tries to have a stiff upper lip, but just can't do it all the time.The story is very touching and was close to home for me. My family has been through some tough times, and this movie just reminded me of how much my parents struggled to provide for our family and yet kept life fun as much as they could. I am excited to go see this with my parents as a way to say thank you.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS : Transcends The Dangerously Sappy Formula With Genuine Emotion...,"THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESSGoing into a film like THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, the audience can basically assume that in the end, that happ""y""ness will be found in the end... leading to a tear-jerking finale of overwhelming emotion. As one would expect, that's exactly how THE PURSUIT OF Happiness ends, but even though there is virtually no level of surprise, this Will Smith vehicle somehow manages to stand above similarly themed sap-fests.THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS tells the true story of Christopher Garndener (played by Will Smith in a very touching performance), a down-on-his luck salesman who finds himself raising his son on his own in the hardest of financial times. In an attempt to make life better for himself and his young son (played by Smith's real life son Jaden), Chris embarks on a demanding internship at the firm Dean & Whitter. It's an unpaid position with no promise of a job afterwords, but Gardener sees it as his only choice and despite being homeless and broke, he carries out the internship with determination to be the one man chosen for a job with the firm.The movie follows a very conventional format, but it does so in a refreshingly unconventional manner. Gabrielle Muccino, the film's director, embraces a grittier look for the film and wisely chooses to not emphasize the emotions at every possible moment. Too often a film like this seems to be gunning for tears from it's audience at every possible moment, but Muccino shows genuine restraint and instead lets the drama play out very naturally.Many times throughout the movie, it seemed impossible how difficult this poor mans life... and knowing that this actually happened to someone makes the film all the more powerful. Will Smith grounds the familiar story with a quiet, humble, and stoic determination to succeed that is only overshadowed by a love for his son. Smith conveys the conflicting feelings of love, failure, stress, and anger without ever losing the gentle hearted soul that makes Christopher Gardener. One of my largest reservations about the film was the casting of Smith's real-life son, however it turns out to be a very wise choice. Jaden Smith is so at ease acting opposite his father that he succeeds in avoiding the cloyingly annoying sweetness of most child actors. It's a very natural relationship between the two that works very well.THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS transcends it's conventionally inspirational story by taking many unconventional approaches as mentioned above. However, there are a few moments that stand out as slightly manipulative... in particular, a sequence in which Smith and his son spend a night in a subway pretending to hide from Dinosaurs. However, in a genre that is usually overflowing with sap, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS makes it through the majority of its 2 hour running time without overdoing it. For that, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS exceeded my expectations, and Smith's performance is deserving of award-consideration at year's end.... B+ ...",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing!,"I have been a fan of Will Smith for years and I have to say this may be his best film yet! ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is just a wonderful (based on a true) story, full of adventure, hope, and pain. I saw the movie last night in a packed theater. Big Willie Weekend has returned, and for good reason! It's a great movie to see during the holidays and definitely a tear-jerker! Perfect for a date, a night out with friends, or even with family. If you ever thought Will Smith really couldn't act (and shame on you!), you'll think otherwise once you see this movie. You can really feel what he's going through just by looking in his eyes. And Jaden Smith is too adorable! Their on screen chemistry is almost unbearable to watch! Go see this movie! Great acting, great directing, great writing...you won't regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good inspirational story,"By far, the meatiest acting that Will Smith has tackled. He takes down the ""Big Willie"" style and is just a plain old average Joe. He is like many people, intelligent yet underachieving. It isn't until he is put out on the street that he stops with the get rich quick schemes and tries to find a ""real"" job.Smith's son Jaden is very natural in the film. That can be directly attributed to Will playing his father. Will be interesting to see if Jaden is that good playing opposite someone else. Still, he gives one of the purist performances of a first-timer in quite a while.Specifics of how broke the character really was has been debated, but I don't think that takes away from the film. There is a sense that the film could have gone a lot darker than it did. It always seems to build up to opening that door, but never quit steps through. I think all in all that serves the movie well, though some may have liked to seen more struggle.Great stuff, Will can do anything he wants. Now he just needs to try and tackle the western genre again, this time with a suitable story.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Pursuit of Capitalysm,"""Happiness"" is equated with being a successful capitalist. The film is as narrow-minded as its protagonist. Why is life so extraordinarily difficult? This is is not explored. Are there other alternatives to the life he has chosen? Not at all. Will Smith's performance is the only thing holding this tacky film together. He is a two-dimensional man in a one-dimensional world. Remove the cohesion of his performance and the film becomes a series of set-pieces on overcoming adversity. The film is called The Pursuit of Happiness when what he is actually pursuing is a job, which in the film brings him nothing but misery and difficulty. The misspelling of ""happyness"" comes from a mural on his son's kindergarten wall. Ironically, the only thing resembling ""happyness"" in the film is the man's relationship with his son, which is strong and intimate throughout, not something he really needs to pursue. Are the filmmakers aware of this irony? It seems unlikely, considering the film's thesis is: work incomprehensibly hard and maybe you will get a job in which you have to work equally hard for the rest of your life. The perfect anti-capitalist weapon for those able to stand outside of the film's emotional manipulation. For those who buy the emotion wholesale, they are given no reason to do other than continue their pursuit of happiness without actually being able to enjoy it. Because life doesn't have a ""happily ever after"".",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Meaningful and Uplifting,"My husband and I had an opportunity to attend a screener of this movie last night. We had seen several commercials and a trailer for the film and we had high hopes, we were not disappointed. Many times ""inspired by"" films feel like hard sells or bids for Oscar glory. ""Pursuit of Happiness"" is none of that. This is an honest, meaningful film that will stay with you long after you leave the theatre. The viewer becomes fully invested in the struggles of Chris Gardner and his son. Will and Jadyn Smith deserve huge kudos. The real-life father and son dynamic enriched the film and don't know if other actors could have been as powerful. Be warned, there are several tissue inducing moments.

"Great performances, inspiring story","I was involved with one of the first test audiences almost a year ago, and came away quite impressed with the acting performances and heartfelt punch of Pursuit of Happiness. This is easily one of Smith's best films, as he pours his heart and soul into the main character. While the plot may remain a bit transparent, it leaves you asking the question of yourself - how long would you keep battling to get what you really want out of life? I plan on seeing the film again when it releases to the general public, and am very interested to see what changes were made after running it through the test screenings. As I saw it then, it needed very few, if any, changes.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best movie ever. recommend 100%,"In this journey through the struggles and trials that single father, Chris Gardner, has to take, you see the real side of hardwork and integrity. Chris Gardner, played by Will Smith, Is just trying to give his son a good home as he's on the pursuit of happiness. This movie doesn't only show the hard work of a single parent, but it shows that no matter how hard you get pushed down, you should always get up and keep going. I love the strong connection that the father and son roles have in this movie, it seems so real, and that's because it is! The father (Will smith) and son (Jaden Smith) are father and son outside the movie realm too. Actor, Will Smith, shows his true emotional side during this film, as if he was actually going through the situations occurring in the movie. There couldn't have been a better cast picked for this movie, the pain, struggle, love, and hope seem so real as if you're watching a documentary on someone's life. Smith, usually looked at as a comedic actor, shows what he can really do by jerking the tears from the audience's eyes.",,Anonymous,Biography
"A Touching Story of Perseverance, Commitment and Objective in Life","In 1981, in San Francisco, the smart salesman and family man Chris Gardner (Will Smith) invested the family savings in Ostelo National bone-density scanners, an apparatus twice more expensive than x-ray with practically the same resolution. The white elephant financially breaks the family, bringing troubles to the relationship with his wife that leaves him and moves to New York. Without money and wife, but totally committed with his son Christopher (Jaden Smith), Chris sees the chance to fight for a stockbroker internship position at Dean Witter, disputing for one career in the end of six months training period without any salary with other twenty candidates. Meanwhile, homeless, he has all sorts of difficulties with his son.""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is a touching story of perseverance, commitment and objective in life, and one of the most beautiful and enlightened biographies I have ever see in a movie. The survival capability of Chris Gardner and his love for his son are fantastic examples in a world where we just read and see disgraces in the newspapers and in the television news. The DVD presents the real Chris Gardner, who found the investment firm Gardner Rich in 1987 and became a wealthy man, in the credits, and I loved the last scene when Will Smith and his son crosses and looks at Chris Gardner wearing a suitcase.

"heartwarming, tender, comforting","I was a little reluctant before watching this movie, I have seen ""Seven Pounds"" recently, and found it disappointing (although saved by good acting) which, together with my low opinion of Muccino's Italian movies, contributed to my doubts on The pursuit of Happiness, but I had to reconsider my opinion, since I really appreciated it, and was able to stand the huge amount of advertising on Italian TV, which often destroys the pleasure of watching any movie.The plot is evidently but not annoyingly marked by the solid American belief that man's efforts and commitment lead to success, with that maybe too optimistic faith that everything will turn better, and your sacrifices will once get the deserved prize (although life often shows something different), but there's no pretence of too much didascalism, it's a quite realistic portray of the hardships of life, with a happy ending aimed at leaving the audience with some self-confidence and trust in others.The overall impression of anxiety, with all that running after people, appointments, occasions, is softened by some tender moments between father and son (at times melodramatic, but never too melodramatic) and also relieved by funny moments.The movie gets to leave to viewer with a positive sense of fullness of life (it could be titled The Pursuit of Life, since life, not only happiness, is to be pursued in every aspect), of the necessity to find a reason to go on, both for yourself and for the dear ones, with a strong meaning that there are really few valuable things in life, all the rest is pure nonsense. Really contrasting with Seven pounds, where a man, on the contrary, gives up and chooses death, leaving the viewer with a sense of sad surrender and illogical, besides humanly disturbing, self-abandonment.Will Smith truly fits the role, abandoning his rather blank face à la Fresh Prince of Bel Air, he offers a very effective and convincing performance and the young boy playing Christopher is really cute.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Gentle, funny, original and touching","When i first walked into this film my expectations were not high. I assumed it would be a very sentimental occasionally humorous, feel good film but in the end it became so much more.Within about ten minutes I realized that I was in for a very special treat. Chris Gardner is a smart man, determined salesman, and a devoted father. However when his sales slowly decrease so does his money and he finds himself struggling to cope with his rent. On top of this he finds himself juggling his son (played by Jaden Christopher Syre Smith ) a stockbroker internship, and a life which ultimately is looking bleak and unfulfilled.His determination to stay on top of life is uplifting. Will Smith portrays "" Chris Gardner "" in a way which I could never have seen him act. A surprise, but a very welcome surprise nonetheless. The movie is set into chapters of Chris's life. He is the narrator in places as well, where he talks about life, his story and the pursuit of happiness. Which is also the main message of the film, that happiness is something that cannot be found but merely pursued. There is perhaps only one negative point about this film. Which is at times it is a little clichéd. The whole idea has been done before and some parts are a tad predictable but to be honest i enjoyed this film so much i barely noticed.

"Genuinely moving, and tear-inducing, tale of one man's struggle against absolutely everything.","As the main protagonist in Gabriele Muccino's unsentimental film points out  ""The pursuit of happiness"" is written in to the declaration of independence. Happiness might not be, but the pursuit is. And I suppose the point of this film is to show just how miserable that pursuit can be  as all manner of things go wrong for Will Smith, son Jaden, and ever-bitchy wife (Newton).Chris Gardner is a salesman down on his luck. Having invested his life savings in techno-marvellous (but unnecessarily expensive) bone scanners, he finds it extremely difficult to sell enough just to feed his family. His wife (a thanklessly bitchy role for Thandie Newton) has clearly had enough, and threatens to leave if Chris doesn't pick up paychecks any time soon. One day Chris sees a grin-infested man exiting an exquisitely swish sports car on his way to work. In a chance encounter, he queries to him as to what he does to earn such luxuries. He responds, ""I'm a stockbroker"". And from there, Gardner decides to pursue his own version of ""Happiness"", albeit through a very hard route.For the most part  The Pursuit of Happiness is more of a disaster movie than a fish-out-of-water tale. After getting accepted for an internship at a stockbroking firm, the film operates as a series of events in which absolutely everything conspires against our hero and his son. From mad hippies attempting to steal his bone scanners to getting arrested for not paying parking fines, the film  despite being inspired by real events  depicts some ridiculous situations that send our hero near to the brink of bonkers. Yet despite this, The Pursuit of Happiness never feels forced, perhaps thanks to the fine performance of its lead. Smith is on fine form, as is his son Jaden, acting with a natural charm and verve that presumably runs in the family. In between the moments of anguish and desperation are some truly moving moments of father-son bonding, one of which involves our two hapless heroes having to spend the night in a train station toilet, to avoid snoozing in the street. But by the end of the film you should feel no shame in shedding a deserved tear for Gardner, as the movie manages to avoid the kind of schmaltzy sentimentality that rolls the eyes against so many other Hollywood films, for a truly heartfelt ending that gives our characters the kind of reward they have worked so diligently for. It is a hard watch at the best of times, but will win you over in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

best acting performances of the year so far,"This year is but 9 days old, and I already know I have seen the best movie of the year. The history books will show that this film was released in 2006, but nothing from that year can compare to this either, so it is in my opinion the best movie of two years! Will Smith plays a struggling single father trying to make the best life that he can for his family and for himself. The part is played to perfection, and shows a true master of the craft. His comic timing is still evident in the lighter moments, but it is his sincerity in playing a man with no options, no family, no help and little hope that shows him shining.Special praise should also be reserved for Will's own son Jaden, who plays Christopher Gardner Jnr. Some people hate child actors, but its perhaps that they are not good child actors... Jaden is a great one. I challenge anyone to point to a scene where he even gives the slightest of hints that he is acting... perhaps it was perfect casting to put a real father and son together here, as they are an outstanding double act playing themselves in different, more downtrodden circumstances.I rarely give movies a full 10, but this throughly deserved it, and should be an example to us all on how movies should be made, and even how we look at our own lives and wonder if we are living up to our own potential in our own ""pursuit of happiness"" Outstanding.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Inspiring story of pursuing happiness.,"Based on a true story, Will Smith stars as Chris Gardner, an investor hoping to make profits in a device called the ""Bone Density Scanner."" But, he has not been making much money out of it, resulting in his wife leaving him and his kid, and him losing his house and finances. He is forced to live out in the streets with his son, and his hopes pins on his internship at a stock company. Gardner has to go through six months of training and to sell his devices before he can be a paid stockbroker.A solid drama with some descent acting, this movie tells a great rags-to-riches story, where a person could start out with nothing and work his way to the top. It gives an important message that everybody in America has the opportunity to pursue happiness, and it is up to that person how he/she plans to pursue it; nothing should be handed on a silver plate. Smith did great depicting this in his Gardner role.There are some powerful, yet disturbing scenes of him going through hard times, like the scene where Gardner and his son had to spend the night in a public restroom, and when they were thrown out of their rented motel. Yet, Gardner's perseverance in earning that career despite hard times makes this an inspiring story. A highly recommended movie.Grade A",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

It is not just the movie of the holiday season, it is a spectacular story. The parts of the movie that have been criticized, mainly by those that have yet to see the film, are easily negated by watching the movie. The story wasn't about Mr. Gardner and his wife/girlfriend-it was about him, his son, diligence, hope, happiness, and so much more. It is so refreshing to be inspired by a film again. There was plenty of chemistry between Gardner and his son. Will Smith can act. Like he says in the movie, and I'm paraphrasing, ""People will tell you that you can't do it because they can't."" That's what I say to anyone who questions the writing or directing of this film. You mock what you cannot do yourself. This is utter brilliance, ten stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Interesting: A Feel-Good Movie About How Effort Pays Off, But Happiness Is Something We Never Truly Acquire","The Pursuit of Happiness is a film that finds suspense and drama in the smaller things in life, and instead of inflating the drama of a more action-packed or special-effects-driven story places us in the shattering turmoil of an everyman's hard knock life. This is my favorite thing about the movie. We are engrossed in the action that takes place in the frantic day-to-day struggle for a man to simply be happy, which in the context of the movie is to be financially comfortable with a roof over his son's and his own head.The film is a vehicle for Will Smith, not to mention his cute and smart young son whom co- stars, and it's likely a demonstration of his range. During his career, he's grown as an actor. In his earliest movies, he was very stiff, very scripted, and now he is very graceful and very becoming in his roles, and The Pursuit of Happiness is a show of the extent to which his talent reaches.It's a very well-written and well-directed film, very light but also very tight and emotionally involving, and it's quite refreshing. The only inconsistency is perhaps the almost unreal and hurried finale, but a flaw that can be easily overlooked, as it provokes the audience heavily and doesn't come without grace. The film is an uplifting holiday season return of the great feel-good film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Much More Than I Expected.,"Seeing the pain in Will Smith as he jockeys for position in a dead-end world is certainly worth the price of admission. This is the tale of a man who has been dealt a bad hand by life, but has never had the courage to start over. He goes from hospital to clinic, trying to sell a bone density scanner that really offers little new to the science of diagnosis. When he ends up as sole support of his little boy, he must change his life. He has seen the happy faces of stock brokers leaving their jobs with smiles on their faces, he decides this is what he would like to do. He has an amazing mind for mathematics and feels he can parlay this gift into a career. The problem is he must continue to eat and find a place to live. There are times when things get maudlin and a bit far fetched, but it does grab at the heartstrings and does present a man who faces off against forces we've all dealt with. It's an unfair world and the haves really become obvious to the have-nots.The acting is superb and overcomes the the plot's weaknesses. Smith's young son is a quite a charmer. He is at times bullheaded and immovable. At times he's a bit too good to be true. It's a very nice movie overall, with a good message. Maybe that's all it should aspire to be.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Movie For Its Times (And Perhaps Beyond),"Back in 2006 when this film was released, the United States economy was headed towards the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930's. ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is a reflection of those hard times.For a basic plot summary, this movie (based on a true story) focuses on Chris Gardner (Will Smith), a salesman who can't seem to make ends meet. His products are not selling and his wife Linda (Thandie Newton) wants to leave him. Caught in the middle is young son Christopher (Jaden Smith). In a sort of last gasp effort to make a better life for his family, Chris decides to accept an internship as an investment banker under the tutelage of Jay Twistle (Brian Howe). It is truly a make-or-break effort that will require even more sacrifice in the short term. as the internship is unpaid (but may lead to stable employment).The themes central to this film are ones that most viewers can relate to: working hard, making sacrifices for family, and contemplating the hard choices in life. This is why the movie packs such an emotional punch. We all see (or would like to see) a little bit of ourselves in Chris Gardner, and that makes us root for him to succeed in life all the more. His seemingly endless setbacks only deepen that emotional connection.It helps that the acting in ""Pursuit of Happiness"" is top-notch, with the crown jewel being the chemistry between Will Smith and real-life son Jaden. Theirs are the emotional backbones of the story, to be sure. In recent years, Will Smith has seen his career hit a significant snag, but rest assured that this is him at the top of his acting game.""Pursuit of Happiness"" is also able to connect with viewers on a personal, day-to-day level. Perhaps in a future United States where the economy improves, these themes won't be so readily apparent. But even now (and especially in 2006) those hard choices that Chris must make I'm sure mirrored many individuals in America. Tapping into current culture can be a powerful thing on the big screen, and this film realizes that potential to the max.Overall, I very much enjoyed this viewing experience. It isn't quite good enough to go into my ""All Time Favorites"" category, but it easily does enough things write to be an emotional, meaningful film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's pointless!!!,"It's quite simple. This movie has no point.You know the ending before you are 10 minutes in. In fact, you could have written the entire script on the back of a napkin during your lunch break. Only you would have been hard pressed to come up with a story quite so bland and unimaginative.What is worse is that this is a film that effectively praises the central character for dragging his child onto the street to satisfy his own pursuit, not of ""happyness"", but of money in his pure greed to get a job with a big money finance company.Will Smith simply plays himself, to the point of falling back on his Prince of Bel Air vocabulary on more than one occasion and Thandie Newton does her best to portray a character with no depth.The occasional 80's reference scores nostalgia points and Jaden Smith delivers what little is asked of him but overall this is 145 mins of my life that would have been better spent doing the ironing, and probably more enjoyably spent at that.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
What is happiness ? Is it : somebody not living in misery ?,"Everybody knows that Will Smith is a great actor.It is rather unfortunate that his greatness as an actor has not been revealed in escapist films like Men in Black and Wild Wild West.Pursuit of Happiness is a film which has showcased his real acting talents.As the film is about an American dream or what it takes to achieve an American dream,it would be nice to discuss something about Italian director Gabriele Muccino.He is not an American yet he has been able to create a beautiful,honest visual document about what it means to be happy in USA.This has happened as foreigners in America have a fairly good idea of what they are supposed to do in order to succeed in a great land of opportunity known as USA.There is no hidden political message in this film as it makes it clear that a hardworking individual can succeed/will succeed no matter how great the obstacles are.This is what happened to Chris Gardner in real life.This is a nice film which does not try to get neither sentimental nor maudlin as watching it we get joy as we laugh and cry at the same time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A movie reflecting the struggle for life, with a never ending will to survive","Wow, what a great movie and what great actors are Will and his son. Brought to the bottom of life and still believing in that one goal, with honesty, Willpower, hope and believe for a better place on earth. Thank you for giving me more than 2 hours with a wonderful movie in a life that sometimes is as hard and unfair people can't imagine, but always worth living if we do believe in our strength and faith and luck to meet the right people at the right time at the right place.Will shows us, despite all his problems which seem to occur always at the wrong time, that standing tough how hard things might be in life is the only way to survive.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant,"How could you not post a TEN (10)!To this awesome movie?? One of the best movies ever :) Will Smith, is really one of the best actors, and his son asswell. Great movie 10 / 10! Reminds me of my life, appreciate for what you have, and try to go beyond your capability, never ever give up and one day you will have everything for what you imagined. Your biggest Goal should be to follow your dream and give up for nothing else expect for your dream! The movie is really heartbraking, at some parts you can really cry, im not kidding. Wills Smiths kid is really funny he's a great actor just like his father, it was a brilliant idea to make a movie with two family members in it. I like the idea that it is based on a true storie, but my question is, 'is that true'? But i will say it again Brilliant movie to watch. I would recommend it to all people.!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Inspiring, but the film's message is flawed","I was made to this film by my girlfriend. She didn't really have to persuade me hard, the truth be told, as I probably would have watched it on the movie channel when it came on there.I thought this was a good film. Will Smith really has come a long way since his fresh prince days and is throughly watchable. The underlying message of the film is too reach for your goals, too never give up and that if you really want something and really try for it, and give it your all, then you will get it.Good film, good message. It makes sense to me. Its inspiring and I hope its something that encourages people to really go for something rather than settling for second best.My only problem is this. Will Smith had a son. He had a responsibility to his son and appeared to be a good father in the film that would do anything for him and so was prepared to sacrifice everything for him, including living in a homeless shelter. I cannot understand, if this story is indeed true, how any father can risk everything including his son for the sake of his dreams? Surely he could have left his son with his wife whilst doing the unpaid internship and if everything succeeded as it did then he could get his family back. I just fail to see how the message of risk everything can be a good one when you have responsibilities to your children. One should never put one's own ambitions above the need's of one's family.Or did I miss something?",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
very good movie,"you see a common man fighting with day to day problems for his family .. fighting for a smile on his son's face,,he has done nothing for him self.just for family or u can say for his son. when you have a absence of happiness you understand a real value of happiness. i like the movie because it shows that how happy we are compare to chris in movie.we generally give up trying if we get one or two failures.. but one can learn not to give up trying..acting of will smith as a common man is good.. i personally worked as a sales person so i know how much pressure on mind..his kid's acting is good as well.. really it's an Oscar movie ..",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
My True Inspiration,"I have just watched ""Pursuit of Happiness"" and could not prevent tears running down my cheeks.This movie reminds me of my struggles.I am a student from Kenya who came to Middle Tennessee State University on a track scholarship.Unfortunately I did not perform to the expectation of the coach and he cut my scholarship in my freshman year leaving me with no direction or anyone to turn to.Like Will Smith in this movie,I realized how painful it is not to have anyone to turn to for help.I am alone here,ten of thousands of miles from my family.I was kicked out of the dorm,no money in my pocket,no where to go......(I learned the world is so cruel and unfair sometimes).With prayers and running up and down trying to make ends meet,God did a miracle and a good samaritan/friend helped me financially stay in school the following semester.I looked for jobs but only managed an internship because of my residency status which prohibited me from working off-campus.This internship is what makes me be in school today as I look forward to my senior year.I have to work so hard to pay for school and other bills as well as working hard in school. Chris Gardner is seen going though all this in this movie.I felt like this movie was meant for me.All I have been through is what I saw Chris Gardner go through.I once didn't have a place to sleep just like Chris Gardner and his son did and had to spent the night in some nasty unimaginable places. This movie is the most inspiring and touching movie I have ever seen.Just like Gardner's achievement,the movie tells me that nothing is impossible no matter what some people think.One lesson I learned in this movie is ""Failure isn't about falling down, it's about staying down"" ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is a brilliant masterpiece of Will Smith work.Two thumps way up.",,Anonymous,Biography
so-so,"I got to see this on the plane for free, and it was a fine alternative to sudoku for a couple hours. The plot is entirely predictable, which I think is forgivable in a triumph of will story, but all the little steps along the way were also quite cliché, which did seem a bit lazy on the part of the screenwriters. I know that this was based on a true story, and it is always interesting to see how much creative license is taken. I actually think that the movie made Chris Gardner's journey look much easier than it probably was. For example, IMDb says that his son was actually only 18 months old, which adds diapers to the situation. And with the exception of the scene where they spend the night locked in a subway bathroom, Will Smith keeps himself a bit more cool and collected than you'd expect from even an extraordinary character like Gardner. Overall, an OK movie, but not as astounding as you'd hope for such an interesting true-life story.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Fantastic,I'd really recommend this film as it is inspiring. It makes you think about the hardships that others go through without giving up and teaches you that when the going gets tough you have to keep on going! Will smith and his gorgeous son gave a fantastic performance and I felt the heartache this man went through to get it. As its based on a true story and not on some silly idea dreamt up by some guy in a studio I think that makes it even more worth the watch because no matter how painful it gets you have to keep watching cos you feel you need to know that this guy and his kid made it in the end! I recommend it to everyone. Careful though arm yourself with tissues!!,10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Very Inspiring Film,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Will and his son did a fabulous job. I was really touched by the underlined encouragement not to give up despite any trials one faces. This movie has encouraged me to continue as a college student. I have faced my own trials and tribulations since returning back to school as a 30-year-old. I thought the director did a great job as well. Everyone should see this movie, especially those who are struggling to be happy and need the reminder that ""you are not alone"". Chris Gardener's story shows that some of the people we see that are successful have not gotten where they are because it was easy. The movie highlights the fact that we can make the choice, though difficult, not to let our negative past and present circumstances determine the outcome of our future.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Soulful Inspiration: You care and you cry,"This movie was more than I expected. I am a pro photographer and I am very critical of the director's work. Firstly, this movie has a quick pace about it. We are never left with a sappy feeling. When scenes ARE slowed down our heart feels truly empathetic to this father and son duo.This, above all, is a personal movie. We are entertained by how a struggling father entertains his son and keeps his son happy through a number of sad situations. And then we are delighted by how the son keeps the father happy, as young as he is. And because these two ""Muskateers"" show caring for one another, we care about them. They are two good people. And we want good people to succeed!By the way, there is no violence in this film, only some anger. You won't see them become criminals to survive either!You will be involved throughout this film with their trials and errors. You will cry and care and hope WITH them, not just FOR them because you WILL be involved in scene after scene. The time will fly.The director surprisingly chose to use a gritty grainy color film style which increases the realism of this movie. The handy-cam, a walking camera, adds style to the realism and rush of this movie due to some deliberate jerky camera movement in a handful of minor scenes. When Chris Gardener (Will Smith) asks someone to pay back a small loan of money($14), you feel like you are standing right next to Will Smith as he begs. And regarding the rushed feeling: Fathers just don't have time to be fatherly, make sales calls without a car by riding the bus, and survive homeless on the street all on the same day.Will Smith's emotional range is wide here. He has a little of that comedian, that optimism in him, but he shows his universal soul. This is what amazes audiences. The new Will Smith, actor of drama. And the Italian director gave him time to emote! Therefore, you will be delighted with his nuances of emotion from scene to scene. This film is comfortably realistic. Will Smith deserves an Oscar for acting.The music is all good: Steve Wonder, Gospel music from Glide Church; not one mediocre tune exists in this film.San Francisco as a setting will thrill those in the mid west with tall views of the city and Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. But this story is not about showcasing places as you would see in a James Bond movie. Rather, you will be taken into Glide Memorial Church where the City's homeless are feed food and soul gospel music. Concentrate on the emotions of the audience, it is so, so real. And yes, I have eaten there and stood in line there. There is no sense that poverty is simply a fleeting condition.Your good spirit will save you. Personal diligent effort will save you. And Will Smith takes it as it comes. And there are no guarantees your pursuit will end up in happiness. It is not decreed in life, or the Constitution, and it is not decreed in this movie.The supporting actress was so realistic. She challenges Will Smith with her impatience. You will be rooting for Will Smith and you will care that these two characters, father and son, find their rainbow: which may only be as humble as finding appropriate employment. Will Smith is never foolishly arrogant. To be so would raise the odds against his survival. The miracle here is how you end up crying for someone that simply accomplishes that which we take for granted, something so mundane as getting a job.This film looks like a documentary at times.No person seems trite: The landlord is not a parody or a character of a landlord, you know that he is a real person with his own problems. The people are not extraordinary people, you believe them as they are, whatever they are. No one over acts. You are never distracted by a ""false"" character, not even the ""Time Machine Man"". And you wonder if maybe these people are actually non-actors chosen to do what they already do in their ""real life"". But it is a fact that the homeless people in the movie are actually homeless people employed to be in the movie. I live here and I was an actor in the movie. I know this to be true. There were only 3-4 people who acted homeless in this movie, and you know what, their scenes were cut.This is not a cleaned-up Disney movie. This movie has soul and spirit. It is funny and ironic that the one obscene word is uttered by the 5 year old child. And there are some light hearted jokes that will touch you.If you liked the movie ""Seabiscuit"" you will like this movie. You will root for this ordinary person as he pushes his spirit against extraordinary odds to survive and to attain his vision of success. But this movie is not dead centered around survival, and the homeless scenes are few. We are really drawn to the conversations between the father and son. And the kid is cute and smart. You never feel he is reading any lines. This movie is really about the relationship of the father to his son.The book reminds you that even if you only attain ""baby steps"" towards your goal you are on the path to your own success. You are reminded that if you are an ""A"" student, you need to have a humble caring attitude to succeed too. And Will Smith is humble here. Oh yes, he gets angry and he isn't perfect....and his emotional range is wide. He deserves an Oscar for truly carrying this film to its perfectly happy destination.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Truly great,"Will Smith plays Chris Gardner, a struggling sales man that is doing everything he can to keep his act together, however,lately he makes little to no money and the bills keep piling up.His wife,tired of the situation leaves him and goes to New York to work in a restaurant.Subsequently everything that could go wrong does go wrong and Chris and his young son end up homeless.Now his only hope is to succeed at a stockbroker internship at Dean Witter and be chosen to work there which would turn his life around...Based on a true story, The Pursuit of Hapyness has all the right ingredients, plus Will Smith's performance is not only perfect but probably the best of his career.He may not choose his films very wisely but the man can definitely act,for instance, there's a very emotional scene towards the end of the movie,it lasts less then a minute but it is some of the finest acting I've seen lately. The on-screen chemistry between Will Smith and Jayden Smith is great and makes the viewer really care and root for the characters.Overall its a great story of hope, of working hard to achieve things,of not giving up... I dare you to watch this movie and not feel like you can do more in your life, that you can and should go after your dreams and not settle for anything less.9/10",,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliantly Understated Classic,"I rarely find myself in awe of an actor's ability, but Will Smith solidifies his standing as one of Hollywood's finest talents with his performance in this gem. It is especially impressive when you consider his career started when he was basically drafted for a lightweight sit-com from a teeny-bopper rap duo because he displayed charisma and humor in his MTV videos.His poignant portrayal of the struggling, yet determined, Chris Gardner is one of the single most inspiring on-screen performances of the past twenty years. I initially saw this on a cross country airline flight with its inherent distractions, so I did not fully appreciate it until watching on DVD again last night. The entire performance is brilliant, but the defining moment is when he is huddled with his son in a locked restroom at the subway station when he has nowhere else to go. Without uttering a word, he had my eyes welling with tears - and I generally do not get weepy during movies. If you are not touched and inspired by this movie, check yourself for a pulse, and if Will Smith is not, at the very least, nominated for Best Actor, they should just cancel the whole Oscar ceremony.Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, step aside and make room. Will Smith has made himself more than worthy of being regarded as one of the truly elite performers.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Every individual specific regarding the film works undoubtedly brilliant. The Genre, Mise-en-scene, Ideologys, Media Language, Representation and Narrative gel comfortably into one emotional tear jerking spectacle. As the narrative progresses and audience follow Chris's life, they are almost drawn into events, surprisingly sharing the pain, laughter and emotional on screen state off screen.

"Not terrible, but I had mix feelings with the story","This movie has quite a depressing story, but certain aspects of it annoyed me. The story was intriguing, but one of the things that annoyed me was how Chris Gardner was making his family suffer by that one stupid choice he made of purchasing those scanners and probably choosing the wrong career path. I felt like he could've made more sensible and realistic decisions of making money. I know the story is partially based on a true story, but I can't feel sympathy for a guy who would make his child suffer and be homeless with him rather than giving him to someone who can look after him properly. Also what I can never understand is how a mother would ever leave her child.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Man wants luxury, has trouble getting it","The Pursuit of Happiness is this year's Academy Awards entry for ""Cloying, Sappy, Feel-Good Film of the Year"". Ostensibly, it tries to show us the trials and tribulations one might have to face to pursue a simple thing such as happiness. The point is achieved, QED and all, by its tenth minute as the film heaps plague upon plague on the hapless protagonist. Remember The Passion of the Christ with its spiked whips, betraying best friends, and sadistic guards? A more modern setting for it might have been the ""cruel"" world in which our hero struggles to make ends meet. By the end of its two-hour running time, even the most naive and maudlin members of the audience will have long lost any signs of compassion and empathy.The film follows Christopher Gardner (based on the real-life millionaire entrepreneur) as he struggles with homelessness, fatherhood, and poverty, while trying to get his foot in the door of a brokerage firm. We see him longingly look at fancy cars, lush green lawns, and big houses, wondering when he can be in that position. The film is a two-hour chronicle of fate dealing scourges and whiplashes to this unfortunate man who only wants happiness through untold riches. One has to be a cold, heartless pessimist not to want him to win, right? Um, not so. Really, are we supposed to root for a guy whose idea of happiness is Merc convertibles and box-seats at a football game? Is someone like that really going to be happy after he gets that?That the film is based on real-life events is hardly an excuse for the loads of clichés thrown in. The film almost begs to have its poetic license canceled as it tries every hackneyed trick in the book. The film takes predictable turns at each step of the way. At every step, Chris Gardner finds himself on the wrong side of Murphy's Law, being afflicted with almost every bad thing that could happen. Nauseatingly affected attempts to tug at our heart-strings fail miserably after about the hundredth time they are shown.The film comes with all the trappings of a big-money production. Crisp camera-work (including the handycam-effect that seems to be all the rage these days), excellent lighting, and suitable music (although much of it is of the uninspired, feel-good kind), grace the film as well as any other output from those well-oiled machines. But none of that is enough to save this lumbering morass that begs for our pity and concern, when it almost has the opposite effect.No kidding, folks. There is nothing in the film beyond what's in the seven words of the summary. I don't imagine it being too much fun for most to sit through a film to know that some guy, somewhere had a terrible time getting rich.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Arguably, Will Smith's Best Performance!","Since it is based on a true story, all of you who would want to say it is a cheesy story, can keep your big mouths shut. I've heard this kind of allegations before, against some of the most beautiful of movies.Leaving out a few minor goofs, here and there, the movie is flawless. The movie is about a man's journey through different phases of his life, looking for that tiny little phase called happiness. We all go through the same phases maybe with a little difference. The movie shows the pain of defeat, despair of loss, boredom of routine, and ultimately the peace of victory. It never goes overboard to show, how sad a man's life can be. Even amidst the saddest phases, there are moments of hope, wonder, inspiration, a little bit of help or a shove towards the right direction. Similarly, even when things seem to look good, a blow falls. What it stresses on, is how far one would go to realise his dreams. How much, would one be ready to withstand but still keep going, holding on to the little positives that come up here and there. How much, or how long, is one ready to believe in the Self.It also beautifully portrays the father-son relationship. Personally, I think a little more stress on just the father-son relationship would make me love the movie even more. But, then again there's no limit to what one wants.I say, once again, Will Smith did an impeccable job. The little kid was also great. The chemistry between the two actors was splendid and undeniably REAL.One of the best movies I've ever seen!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Breathtaking,"Pursuit Of Happyness ReviewBy Brianna Fuentes
March 18, 2022Busy streets, families in despair, eager to find a career to save themselves and their families while also trying to find genuine happiness plunges viewers into the peak of Capitalism in America. This is what the movie Pursuit Of Happyness directed by Gabriele Muccino portrays. This movie is based on a single father who is doing everything in his power to give his son and himself a better life during a struggling era. From job to job, not getting near end's meet yet still being able to feed and hire a babysitter for his son while out working. Will Smith, who plays as the main character, Chris Gardner does an amazing job with the emotions in this movie. He does his paper so well, it seems as if he's not even acting, like her actually is the person he is portraying. Also having his own son, Jaden Smith, play as the actor, Chris Gardener's son, makes Will Smith play his real father figure and has more of an emotional connection to the movie. You feel as if you're there, wanting to help, yet you're just behind a television screen. That is as raw as the movie gets.In 1981, Christopher Gardner and his wife and son lived in a small apartment in San Francisco. Linda, the mother and wife, was not pictured much in the movie due to separating and leaving the home. Already in tremendous stress, Chris had to double his finances in order to maintain the roof over their heads, car, and his five year old son's needs. Chris worked with a company that sold Bone Density Scanners to doctors and hospitals. Back in this time, technology was increasing as x-ray machines were becoming the new normal, so selling those scanner's was hard as it is since no one was willing to pay for an older machine. Selling 3 of his company's scanners was how he was able to get paid, however he was only averaging at least 1 a month. Month after month, money became a greater issue and became the reason why Chris lost his apartment. So now, father and son were left to live in the streets.Worse came to worse, and Chris and his son became homeless. Chris just thought about work and his kid every single minute of the day. Everyday, having to rush to the homeless shelters, just so that they were able to secure a bed for the night, not knowing where the next day would take them. Chris didn't have high hopes of getting any jobs he applied for, although he was extremely talented and intelligent in math. However, he knew deep down that one phone call could change his life forever. Back in 1981, it was extremely hard for people of color to become employed. Chris Gardner, being a black man, had it way harder than any other person. Black people are discriminated against every single day just because of the color of their skin. This movie does a good job bringing awareness of the racial injustice that still happens to this day. He then knew all those cold nights of despair were leading him to the life he knew he was meant for. Running to tell his son, all he could do was just hug him. At that moment, you can tell he was genuinely at a point of happiness, something that he was losing sight and hope of. Knowing everything he did for his son, was finally coming true. That point in the movie is where you just fall in love with the storyline, which is a true story in fact. Nothing will ever amount to family, love, and possibility. The Pursuit of Happyness gives hope to people of color, that we too can find our happiness. We belong in this world just as much as any other human being.This movie really emphasizes happiness. In order to become genuinely happy you have to endure some hardships whether it's a tiny incident or a huge stepback. Everything truly happens for a reason. In this movie, Chris came from nothing, fighting his way through life in order not to make him happy, but to make his son happy and secure in life. Coming from an absent father, Chris wanted to do everything and anything possible for his son, which meant working and sleepless nights, all that paid off in the long run. This movie is one of those that you will never forget. Cherishable and also relatable to many others who have either first hand gone through the same or watched their guardian or parent do what Chris Gardner did for his son to them. It will definitely make you shed some tears, but will make you realize that anything is possible if you put your mind to it, nothing is impossible. The love and commitment a father has for his son is enough to chase after any dream. It's a story that makes you want to find your own pursuit of happiness.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Grreat,"All I have to say is this movie is one of the best this year. I couldn't believe how good Will Smith did in this film. I also couldn't imagine a bone density scanner salesman lived a part of his life this way. Sleeping in a bathroom at a Subway station! On top of toilet paper! It made me feel good that I sleep in a bed at night! I do hope with an inspiring story like this, that he gets nominated for an award. I was very surprised at the end when he gets a job offer at Dean Witter-Reyonolds stock company...I think this was a big, drastic change in his life. I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who wants to cry.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Realistic portrayal of urban life,"This film is about a man's struggle to find happiness by chasing his dream to become a stockbroker.Throughout most of the film, we get to see Will Smith being very poor and have very bad luck. It is a realistic portrayal of how urban life can be for many of the lower socio-economic class. I am sure Will Smith's character gets a lot of resonance in the viewer's hearts. The interaction between Will Smith and his wife and son is also good. His wife (Newton) is disapproving and distant, while his son is warm and adorable. Their interaction is cruelly realistic.The plot is good because it is not as predictable as the average comedy. We don't get the happy then sad then happy pattern, instead we get a sad sad sad then happy pattern. It is good the Hollywood tries something new! Will Smith's acting is excellent. The final scene where he is very happy when he hears some good news, we do not get a hysterical happiness. Instead, it is subtle and from the heart. It is a very impressive portrayal of happiness.This film is definitely worth the watch!",,Anonymous,Biography
A little too dreary.,"For a film that deems itself uplifting, The Pursuit of Happiness is quite depressive. Most of the movie (""most"" meaning not half but about 9/10 of it) deals with Chris Gardner's (Will Smith) struggles with poverty, the raising of his son Christopher (Jaden Smith) and his tired wife (Thandie Newton). Chris' pursuit gets very long and by the time we get to the end, the reward is not at all worth our wait. Besides, we knew it was coming.Chris longs to be a stockbroker. He marvels and the lifestyle that comes with it. He has no education above high school, he has one suit for special occasions and sells out-dated bone scanners to hospitals which do not want them. However, this is a true story, so instead of being improbable, the plot is feasible.What gets out of hand is the adversity Chris faces. Steve Conrad, the screenwriter, goes out of his way (really out of his way that is) to emphasize the fact that this guy had it tough. Don't get me wrong, this is necessary in order to fully appreciate the feel good ending, but too much is too much. His wife leaves him, he gets kicked out of a few motels, takes his son to homeless shelters, then ends up staying in a subway bathroom, all this in a background of more oppression and intimidation at the broker firm.I thought the film would make me feel good (not that I'm feeling bad or anything, I'm just saying), but there's too much going bad for Chris and only at the end do we get the emotional, tear jerking moment. And let me say, it's not that spectacular. Take The Shawshank Redemption for instance. Andy, the main character, wasn't continually put down, yet Shawshank has one of the best, most memorable emotionally uplifting endings in history. We got uplifting moments during Shawshank, which is what Pursuit omits. The key is not to keep beating down your main man in order to have an effective ending.Will Smith's performance makes the movie worthwhile. Not at all over-the-top, it is just masterfully controlled. We totally buy his character. Too bad Pursuit is so dark and dreary.Happiness is spelled wrong in an early scene to show that Chris hasn't found true happiness yet. He asks to spell it right so as to not lead his son into error. Funny, I would have asked to make the whole movie right, because it is spelled all wrong.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Feel Good Movie For Whom? Narcissists?,"Chris Gardner is a man on a mission............ to make a better life for his son....even if it kills the kid!!! If this is what passes for a ""feel good"" movie in the 21st century....we're all damned to hell! I got no inspiration from a film.... showing a father... too stubborn and prideful to do what was best for his kids comfort and safety! Inpirational films feature sympathetic characters, who have run out of options, yet overcome adversity anyway! Chris Gardner, as portrayed in the film, had many options that he didn't bother to explore, because of his foolish pride, his stubbornness, and his quest for the fat buck! He could have allowed his son to go to NY with his ex-wife, but chose to use his child as a pawn, to punish his wife, for bailing on the marriage! He had the opportunity to let his son stay at a shelter for abused wives and children, ensuring his son'e safety, but again...his foolish pride wouldn't permit it, and Gardner thought it was better for his son to sleep on a public restroom floor, than for them to ""be apart""! Maybe someday, someone will come forward, to tell the real story of how Gardner got into such a financial hole in the first place. His lack of sales success, and his wife working double shifts as a waitress, isn't a justifiable reason for the kind of money woes they were in, as the movie began! My father had to retire in 1969 due to a heart condition, and my mother managed to take care of a mortgage and bills, a sick husband, and raise 4 kids, on a full time waitress' salary.....so I don't know what Chris Gardner and his wife were doing with their money! An apartment in early 70's San Francisco, was a hell of a lot cheaper to afford, than my childhood home on Long Island....and my mother managed!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

10/10,"I hardly watch a Hollywood movie but this movie was recommended by many. And now I would like to recommend this movie. At least once in time, this should be watched I think that this movie teaches young people and adults a very valuable lesson in the movie. This is a family movie, the family should always have faith in one, moreover, a father and son should always have faith in each other. I have learned from the society that there is always one thing, that father and daughter & mother and son this are the most common happy relations, but this movie has changed the perspective of accepting the things only society speaks.""If you like it, then have it. No matter what I say, no matter what everyone says.""
This is a story of a man living in mediocrity, working as a salesman and despite facing several problems on every front of his life, He dares. Dares to dream big. This is an admirably unsentimental biography with an amazing performance. It's an excellent movie that shows if you work hard for something you will get success. Will Smith and his son, Jaden bring to life the true story of a father-son family, struggling to step up from the bottom rung of the ladder. I believe that kids should watch this movie, so they will realize that they are blessed in their lives, and it's not easy for parents to struggle always. This is a movie based on a real-life experience. Will Smith does an incredible job as well as his son Jaden. He had his son in this movie that's why it was easier for Will Smith to put himself out there emotionally. You can feel the emotion and are rooting for his character through the movie.Jaden Smith is adorable. He delivers an endearing performance as Gardner's son, Christopher, in what turns out to be a simple, sentimental, but ultimately inspiring movie. The film deals with a particular perspective, focusing, as the title implies, on the constitutional right to ""pursue"" happiness, rather than the right to be happy. In this manner, the movie can avoid focusing much on racism and how that factors into achieving the Dream. Instead, the relationship between father and son, through all the ups and downs of family and economic instability, take centre stage, with lovely results. ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" counts how Chris, compromises by some bad luck, a few stupid moves and a shrew for a wife, Linda, loses his apartment and, with his 5-year-old, Christopher, joins the ranks of the homeless, if not the hopeless. Evicted from the mainstream and bounced from shelter to shelter, Chris holds firm to his dignity, resolve, faith, love and independence. Money matters in ""The Pursuit of Happyness,"" as it does in life. But it matters more openly in this film than it does in most Hollywood stories that set their sights on the poor, largely because Chris's pursuit of happiness eventually becomes interchangeable with his pursuit of money. He doesn't want just a better, more secure life for himself and his child. The ending (I won't give it away too much) had the tears flowing, tears of happiness of course. I recommend this movie to everyone who loves movies that have a real storyline and leave you with a good feeling. This movie is worth taking the time to see. Will Smith is an incredible actor and the real person whom this film was made around must be proud. This movie is gonna play with your emotions. You are gonna cry, laugh along with the characters.""You deserve to be happy"". (4.21.17)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Big Will for a win!!!,"I wasn't familiar with Chris Gardner's story before this movie. I think it's a great story. The struggles he face seem hard to bear. But, believing in himself got him through it. Everyone has that capacity no matter their color, background or religion. Those of you that only see Will Smith as an actor that can only do comedy are sadly mistaken. He will win an award for this role. I'm sure of it. I feel it in my bones...as the old folks use to say. Movie goers need to open their minds to actors or actresses range on screen. Thank God they believe they could do it. Look what Jamie Foxx proved. Who knew Robert De Niro could be so funny. That little Ronnie Howard would grow up to be an award winning director. Maybe, just like Chris Gardner they are able to dream and dream big. To make those dreams come true it takes hard work. My motto is if you're going to dream you might as well dream big. Good luck to this film and all that took part in it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Smith is in a Pursuit for an Oscar,"Will Smith's screen presence, despite its clear Oscar yearning, far surpasses this films capabilities on its own. Directed by first time English-language writer/director Gabriele Muccino, this sappy, even cheesy at times, epic drama about one man's determination, is brought to classier heights through Smith's authentic performance. Never going out of character or being ""Will Smith"", Smith's performance in The Pursuit of Happiness, incorrectly spelled purposely, is reminiscent of his role in Michael Mann's Ali. Smith's role as a father, trying to take care of his son, played by real-life son Jayden Smith, definitely brings the father-son chemistry and struggle to tear inducing moments more genuinely. Thandie Newton, who seems to be playing the same unappreciative non-understanding wife, she did in Paul Haggis' Crash, brings nothing new to the table other than a refreshing sense of loathing.Based on a true story, Pursuit of Happiness has clearly been embellished, allowing Smith and son to really shine in moments that were probably otherwise boring and less intimate. It is the close-ups, the all affectionate moments that Smith pours his heart into, that really push this movie beyond its regurgitating material and into an emotional spin of consciousness. During the films 117 minute running time we are introduced to Chris Gardner's (Will Smith) daily life, which really lends to our understanding of the delicate life this man and his son lead. Many people will obviously be bitter about the manipulative plays of the filmmakers, that through charismatic on-screen presence and tears, will make you sympathize for someone who otherwise would not be sympathized. There is some truth in this, but try and enjoy the movie for how it makes you feel, even if it is using every trick to bring out those usually buried feelings. At least it is evoking something, whether it be fabricated or not, the result is still genuine.In the tear jerking, man crying tradition, The Pursuit of Happiness has all the comedy and drama woven neatly into this time old story of a screenplay. This film will definitely hit home for many, being that this is such a widely common topic, and the fact that family struggle is universal. There have been films like this before it, and there will be films like this afterward, but I believe that the stunning performances, and smoothly appropriate camera work will set this one aside from the rest.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tugs at the moral heart strings as if it has immediate access,"Once in a while, a film will subtly waltz by and sweep you off your feet leaving you with a keen sense of assurance and hope. The Pursuit of Happiness manages to do all that without seeming indulgent or heavy-handed. The film is based off of Christopher Gardner's memoir of the same name, about a stressed father who overcomes the largest of obstacles in order to provide him and his son with the life they have always wanted.Will Smith plays Gardner, a confident, everyman who has invested his family's savings into bone-density scanners that give a picture slightly deeper than an x-ray and cost twice as much. They are defined as ""unnecessary luxuries,"" and many hospitals have turned down Gardner's offer, much to his dismay. Gardner's long-suffering wife, who finally walks out on him, is played by Thandie Newton. Newton's character is aggravated at his overpowering idea that ""things will get better,"" and wishes he'd live in the moment and admit the chips are down. Their son, Christopher Gardner Jr., is played by Smith's son Jaden Smith, in his first film role. Smith shows signs of possessing a charismatic enigma, that few newcomer childhood actors can replicate. He is funny, sweet, and sometimes eerily passionate about his character at such a young age.The film follows Gardner's new job as an intern stockbroker, a job that is tiresome, involving, and utterly restless. The job can only be overcomplicated when you're looking for a place to eat and sleep every night, taking care of your plucky and adventurous kid, and fighting back at a society that has become arrogant, derogatory, and shamelessly cynical. This is perhaps Smith's most involved performance to date. It seems the only way Smith could play the character so well is if he had some sort of experience like Gardner's. It doesn't seem like you could just jump into the role of the man so effortlessly, but in order to efficiently pull it off, you would've had to go through some emotion-testing event in your life similar to his. I don't know why, but it just seems that way.Besides the performances being simply mesmerizing by everyone involved, the film has a good sense of honesty and realism to add substance to the story as well. Far too often are we faced with films that evoke happiness, or happiness in this case, as the thing that gets handed to us in a bright package. The Pursuit of Happiness works so well because it shows the true side of life. That we as humans might go through a number of failures before we achieve what we want, and even when we get what we want, might even still not avoid some failures. After Gardner gets the job as a stockbroker, he still goes through a lot of tribulations and aggravating circumstances in order to keep his new job. Sleeping in a homeless shelter with dozens of other strangers, having little to no money in his wallet, and knowing he can't provide for his son like other fathers are just some of the things that would drive an ambitious father up the wall. Perhaps his choices can be criticized, like letting his son sleep in a germ-infested bathroom, but his persistency must be commended.There is one scene in particular that is very moving and it is the scene where Gardner and Jr. experience ""time travel"" in the subway station. The scene is so involving, simple, and effective. It's a scene that could've bled corniness and ridiculousness, but almost tugs at the heart strings. And that's what The Pursuit of Happiness does; tug at those moral heart strings not insultingly, but as if it has immediate access to them. And I think it's safe to say that many films know there's an easy entrance to those strings, but few choose to take that exact route.Starring: Will Smith, Jaden Smith, Thandie Newton, Brian Howe, and Dan Castellaneta.

You'll like it a lot better the first time you see it,"The first 30-45 minutes of this movie really reminded me of The Assassination of Richard Nixon in that both protagonists are struggling salesmen with poor judgement and even worse luck.But for the most part the film becomes predictable. You know what's going to happen, so the question is does the rest of the movie carry you along and do you enjoy the ride. For me I started to lose interest. You really only see one side. We're supposed to feel for the protagonist and his son. Okay, I got that from the first few moments of the film, but it just continues on with a one-sided story as if the audience is supposed to believe there is a great conspiracy and the world it out to get him. I can maybe watch 30-minute show of car accidents but after that I start thinking ""is there anything else?"" In some ways I could relate to this movie. I had been raised by a poor single parent, and as a young adult I was the poor boy surrounded by rich people so in those ways the movie kept my interest.It was good movie, but in the end I have to ask myself if it's one that I'm likely to watch again. The answer is I'd probably rather watch The Assassination... again. So I give it a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Sad, in the unfortunate, crappy way","There are undoubtedly two camps of people who watched this film: those who start to tear up at the very hint of a Very Special Movie, and those who rely a little on logic and, I dunno, sense; those who, that is, want the movie to work a little to earn tears, not the other way around.Guess which group I'm in.Chis Gardner (Will Smith) is a salesman of sorts - he sells scanners to medical professionals that are supposed to be more detailed than x-ray machines, and much more expensive. He bought a whole bunch of them years ago and has been selling them to doctors and hospitals ever since, only sales have stagnated somewhat, and he's struggling big time. Now, me, in this situation, might, perhaps, get another job, one that paid something, anything to keep food on the table for my wife (Thandie Newton) and son (Jaden Smith).But Chris isn't like me. Instead, after bumping into a rich-looking white dude, he decides he wants to be a stockbroker and applies (after many contrivances) for an internship at Dean Witter. Only, oops! It's not a paying internship! But Chris doesn't know that, and neither does wife Linda, who works double shifts at a hospital. Are you seeing the picture here? The mother works her hands to the bone, the dad is a shiftless loser who can't sell crappy scanners that no one needs, and what's the wise papa do? Why, chases a dream. Because if there's any time that's just made for chasing dreams, it's when you have a wife and kids and are a couple months behind in your rent and haven't paid your taxes yet for the year.Naturally, after Chris makes this decision and when the scanner sales slow down even more, Linda has enough and bolts for some nebulous waitressing job on the other side of the country. Up until this point, she was easily the stronger, more viable, and more responsible of the parents. But then we wouldn't get this touching plot of a father bonding with his son, so out goes Linda. (Yes, I know this is based on a true story, but I imagine some of these plot devices are fictions from the screenwriter.) Speaking of plot devices, as Chris blows off landlord after landlord, he and young Christopher are kicked out of their home, and then a motel, and they sleep on buses, in bathrooms, anywhere. This is supposed to show how Chris will suffer for his son, that he loves him so much and is trying so hard to make his life better. The trouble is, nearly all of Chris's problems were caused by... you guessed it, Chris himself. We can all relate, I'm sure, to The Man keeping us down; we struggle and make a little progress, only to be pushed back down by creditors, Johnny Law, our bosses, and so on. Sometimes fate does conspire against us. But it didn't feel like that was wholly the case here. Chris is outraged to get a notice from the IRS placing a lien on his bank account. Why is he outraged? Linda even reminded him to take care of the taxes, and Chris actively said he'd just keep filing extensions. This is no one's fault but Chris Gardner's.The trouble is, you really want to feel for Chris. He knows that if he works hard and is fortunate, he can emerge from the unpaid internship with a paid job as a broker at Dean Witter. A great goal to have, of course. It just seems strange that he felt that the most viable option to him was to work as a stockbroker. He couldn't take a menial job or two to scrape up enough money to pay taxes or, heck, rent a room? God forbid. In a telling scene, Chris explodes outside a mission that had just announced it had no more room. I'm paraphrasing, but as Chris argued with a man who'd cut in front of him in line (thus denying him entrance to the mission), he mentions that he had to run from his job to get to the line in time. Whoa, wait, hold up a sec there, Chris. You're in a line of homeless people. You might not wanna mention that you have a JOB. Most of the rest of these folks, you see, don't have a job. That is why they are homeless. You came off as a major jerk. Again, not someone worthy of our pity.So who is? Christopher, the young'un, surely is. What's he done to deserve this crappy parenting? His mom basically abandons him with no fight at all, and his dad chooses a tenuous unpaid job over a paycheck. Jaden Smith was critically lauded for his wonderful work here, and he was much more deserving of an Oscar nomination than his old man, who seemed to be praised merely for not playing Will Smith. At least we didn't get yet another rendition of Smith's ""Oh, HELL no!"" exclamations. But the kid was very good, and adorable to boot.The rest of the cast isn't on screen enough to make much of an impression; they're all just window dressing to the relationship between father and son. James Karen is unintentionally amusing as the Great White Father to Smith's broker, needlessly upping the smarm factor. Because, you know, brokerage firms never seem to have enough smarm.All in all, a disappointment unless you just treat it as a low-grade TV movie about someone persevering against long odds, cheerfully ignoring the fact that those odd were made long by that same person. Bear in mind, though, that the movie is merely based on a true story, that many liberties were taken to accentuate the supposed struggles of Chris and Christopher.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
People outsmart themselves when watching this movie...Just enjoy,"Why do all the haters of this movie say similar things? Because they are outsmarting themselves. If you have never been poor them you shouldn't even be commenting on the movie. The movie isn't saying if you work hard you will get everything you ever wanted. Its simply showing a man struggling to make it and feed his kid, with a dream to be able to better provide for him. Its not about becoming materialistic, but without some damn money folks, life is in fact, a hard ass rock. Will Smith is in fact great in this movie and I and many others can relate to be talented but without much money. Many idiots are rich and many smart people are poor, while many rich are indeed smart and well deserving and many poor are idiots and well deserving of their place with money.

The 'Gardner' who took care of his garden...,"...not like Voltaire's Candide but like a man with enough wisdom to know that you never get nothing with nothing, and enough candor to believe that everything is possible if you put your determination into it. Sounds corny? Not really.You know a film has hit the right chord when at the ultimate moment, your brain is flooded by a triumphing sentiment of sheer satisfaction and you're not just empathetic toward the hero, but almost telepathic. When Chris Gardner, Will Smith in his most spectacular role, learns that he's hired by the stock broker company he's been dreaming of ever since a smiling Porsche driver told him it was his job; at that moment, I could pinpoint every single thought that went through his mind, I could literally taste the tears. Any lesser film, going for cheap sentiments, would have made this an average feel-good crowd-pleaser but Smith's humility and the way he manages to channel every emotion through his eyes was simply mind-blowing. I didn't expect I would connect to a character so rapidly and intensely and it happened to me back to back this week, with ""The Pursuit of Happyness"", and before, ""Sideways"".Now, it's easy and convenient to label Gabriele Mucino's film as an average rags to riches story, Chris Gardner has become a guru for wannabe successful people. But this would be doing a great disservice to the lesson his life provides by reducing it to the fact that he became rich after being so poor, the soul of his victory lies in his struggle. What made him a rich man is the same spirit that was driving him when he was miserable and while I followed his bad streak all through the film-to call him unlucky is the understatement of the year- I was convinced that the guy had the right stuff, as a father, as a man. And in a time where Hollywood movies are full of stories with brutal fathers, what a change to have a good, decent, honest, hard-working, humble man who takes care of his son at the same moment where it's the mother who throws the towel. Thandie Newton gives a remarkable performance in the film's more ungrateful role, being selfish for lack of patience and irresponsible for lack of strength, she's her first victim.The mother's character is even more interesting because it mirrors our own mentalities; some accuse the millennials to feel entitled and as a man approaching his forties, I guess I wouldn't have made the same decisions than Chris, if I had to go through an internship without being paid, I might have knocked to another door (and somewhat I did refuse tempting internships for better paying ones but in industries I didn't care of)... if I missed an important meeting, I might have blamed bad luck, but Chris seizes all the opportunities and never lets anything work as an obstacle. Watching the film, I tried to memorize which moments where the most pivotal and you could narrow them down to four or five, Chris giving the money to the CEO, while he needed it to have a roof for the day, an apology for the missed meeting, a cab ride where he could demonstrate his skill at the Rubik cube and get the interview, and finally, having the right punchline during that same interview when asked why they should hire a man coming with jeans and all soaked with white paint.Chris' determination is a rollercoaster but the film never falls in the trap of sanctification, it's all dealt with rationality. Chris' efforts are due to his fatherless childhood, he must always be present for his son Christopher (Jaden Smith), whatever he does is for his son. He needs money so badly for a roof that he learns how to save money, how to be efficient at his job to get out before the others, how to respect timing, when he gives the money to the CEO, his teary eyes for such a small gesture gives you an idea of how precious money is and somewhat it's that state of sheer poverty that also consolidated his moral strength. It was a matter of survival and Chris fulfilled the seminal role of a father, which is to be both benevolent, protective, disciplining with his child, and ensuring a sane link between the family and the external world. Chris can also be severe with his son, and as the story goes, his easy going nature fades when he's confronted to overwhelming obstacles.But somewhat, since we know the outcome, we're not surprised, the determination is almost foreseen with the X-ray machine running gag, that big medical ""gizmo"" he must sell to earn a few weeks of living is a real hot potato that is almost unsellable, until it becomes a matter of life and death when he has no income, the more difficult it gets, the more precious these objects are, and being stolen one is something he can't afford and if one doesn't work, well he must fight the way to make it work. As he said in the interview, he might not have the answer but he has what it takes to find it and he's convincing.Many people would have dismissed one tenth of what he went through his life, thinking they ""deserve better"" while Chris certainly deserved more than anyone to succeed only he faced the adversity and the fog of crap he went through, he triumphed with peril and his story doesn't glorify him but his perseverance, it's not about believing in your dreams because Chris didn't know he was going to be rich, but it's about being decent, and responsible and going till the end, Chris has many breakdowns but he never gives up, he's a class A father and as a struggling father myself, I think I just found myself an inspiration.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is the BEST movie of the decade!,"'The Pursuit of Happiness'. The movie is about the pursuit of happiness, of joy.This has to be my All-time favourite movie and one of the greatest movies of all time. I love this movie a lot.The emotions, the struggle, the pain, the Happiness, all of these seem so real that they really bring the deeper emotions hidden within you.This movie is super perfect. The acting is flawless, Will Smith was fabulous as Chris Gardner, he definitely should have got an Oscar for this role. Jaden Smith was equally amazing and does great acting. The other actors were also very good especially Thandie Newton and Brian Howe but Will Smith really stole the show with his amazing expressions of joy and pain. This movie is so great and my favourite because the storyline is very good and it teaches us how to live life to the fullest even if you are in the worst of your situations.It definitely made me cry after the last scene where Chris Gardner finally gets his job and shows his inner strength and joy of achieving of what he had been trying for so long. The movie must have got an Oscar. It is a MUST-SEE movie for all people to understand life as i did. Definitely 10/10 for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hollywood emotional impulses ring hollow,"It is important to note that The Pursuit of Happiness is ostensibly a rags to riches story, despite spending almost its entire runtime kicking Smith's ass and just generally be a real downer. Unfortunately, there's no room at all for Smith's personality to shine through, and then from there it's almost as if he's more concerned about getting an elusive acting trophy. While the child thesp is a real find being Smith's son, his verbosity eventually gets annoying succumbing into the trap many young actors fall into.As for it's auxillary messages (every movie like this needs at least the one), it really doesn't get much through considering that every stranger Smith's character meets seems sorta pleasant, polite or just plain ignorant but most strikingly, with no preconceptions of race and class being highlighted despite Gardner's background. It just shows Chris Gardner as a good man, great father, even better worker who's just unfairly yet to find a place in this nice little world. As for it being a comedy, the only thing jaunty about this film is the spiteful little percussion that plays as a frantic Gardner runs after his livelihood time and time again. Very calculating. Very cloying.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

ScreenSyndrome.com Review,"Based on a true story about a man named Christopher Gardner set in 1981, Pursuit of Happiness is probably one of Will Smith's best performances, one that stands unique to the rest, and once again he shows us how powerful his acting ability can be, when accompanied with an incredible story. Written by Steve Conrad (WeatherMan, The Promotion), and directed by Gabriele Muccino (Seven Pounds), comes the story of a man struggling to make ends meet, in which almost every choice leads him down another road with a problem to solve and overcome, while maintaining the will and strength to never give up on what you want.""Never let anyone tell you you can't do something. If you want something, go and get it"". Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is full of wise wisdom, but sometimes is influenced on his own fears and inabilities that make him doubt, making it difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Chris is a struggling salesman who has invested his life's work in a medical device known as a ""Bone Density scanner"". Unfortunately, he has discovered that his investment is short lived as doctors describe the device as a ""luxury"" rather than a necessity. Gardner's wife (Jada Smith, Will Smith's wife) is completely irrational and clearly selfish, leaves him and their son to fend for their own, of course only after mocking and talking him down, as he tells her his dreams and his efforts of where he is trying to get. Eventually forced to live out in the streets with his son, Gardner takes an internship position at a Brokerage firm, in which he must work and train for 6 weeks without pay. We watch as Chris and his son struggle to deal with the tough times, racing to get in line for shelters, and rushing through work, while staying up nights on end studying and preparing for the finals, in which the company selects only ONE applicant out of 20.While the movie is indeed filled with sadness and despair, there is a deeper yearning to see the beautiful pieces of work and storytelling in this film. I urge those who may be discouraged with sad tales, as *spoiler alert* things to end on a beautiful happy note.* The film not only exhibits extremely skilled acting and a wonderful storyline, but also is full of incredible cinematography work. Filmed by Phedon Papamichael (Director of Cinematography, Descendants, Walk the Line, Sideways) there is some amazing eye candy. The framing and the locations are incredibly well captured and add so much more to the flow and feel of the film. You will truly be immersed into this film, just remember, it's OK to cry a bit just close the blinds :p.Untitled-2 On my ""rating"" scale, (this is totally just my opinion), but I put this in the Must Watch category, giving it a 5/5 for the quality in acting and storyline and the final product. Anyone who sees this film as weak, obviously has no heart, or cannot deal with such stories as they seem to think ""this could never happen"" or ""this isn't real"". On the contrary folks, this is based on a true story, and I bet it happens every day on various levels (perhaps not as large as a brokerage).http://www.screensyndrome.com/pursuit-of-happ/",,Anonymous,Biography
"Some good parts, some bad","I recently just saw this movie because I had heard so much about it. I think the whole message of the movie was amazing and the whole story line itself was true, anything is possible if you try. The only thing I would change is the run time of this movie, it seemed to drag on more than it needed to be... In the end, I thought this was a really great emotional movie and both Will Smith and his son did amazing jobs pursuing their roles. Will Smith himself did an amazing job portraying Chris, this definitely to me was one of the most deepest roles I've seen him play yet from everything else such as MIB and it shows that he has grown up a lot more. In conclusion, this movie is an amazing movie which carries a strong message in it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Well Acted, Emotional Drama,","The Pursuit of Happiness is a terrific movie with a well developed storyline and a very talented cast. It's an inspiring true story about a salesman who went through real struggles in order to care for his son and make it in business, it's sweet, emotional and hard to watch at times as we see just how much this man had fallen, we are taking in almost immediately, supporting him all the way through. I would have liked to see more scenes between Chris and Linda, their relationship could have been developed much more before she leaves as her intentions were a bit unclear because of just how little Linda was actually in it, as well as that, Will Smith and Thandie Newton played off each other very well and it would have been great to have more of that. Will Smith's performance in this movie is outstanding and easily one of the greatest in his career, he loses the charming, macho persona he normally has to play a humble, down to earth man, and it really felt Smith was more comfortable in this role than any other, that he could really relate to this man. The relationship between the father and son is beautiful, undeniably sweet, it certainly helped that Smith got his real life son, Jaden Smith, as you could feel the genuine love between them. Emotional, dramatic and inspiring, I would recommend the Pursuit of Happiness to anyone looking for a good drama.A single father struggles to raise his son while working as a salesman.Best Performance: Will Smith",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
I don't quite get this film.....,"I loved the performances, of course. But I didn't quite understand the pointwork hard, suffer and it all will change? About as depressing as a Leonard Cohen song, there really is no epiphany. It could be God, it could be the Devil, but something usually shifts. At one point, it might be God as the Gospel choir reaches into the heavens with the crescendo of human voice, but that ain't it. You know the guy is a kind of genius and it only will take time for someone to recognize it, but then, that is not quite fair---not everyone has a gift or genius for something. And it seemed he made bad choices. Why work for as a paidless intern when your family is starving? Had he never heard of a job? Seems with this apparent talent, he would have been employed readily. I am all in favor of willing suspension of disbelief, but this movie maybe crossed that line. It simply didn't make sense. At some point, with this litany of bad luck, you have to ask yourself, why? And maybe that's what's lacking, a spiritual angle to this, something other than pining for the American Dream and as in all American movies, getting it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A powerful message about commitment!,"As the real Chris Gardner states: ''Its not basically a ''from rags to riches'' story, but a story about commitment, about standing up when everything around collapses, about smiling even when you face frown eyes...

ChatGPT Recommends Before A Job Interview,"I wrote off this movie in 2006 as another dumb Will Smith vehicle meant to appeal to The Academy crowd. Back then I had a decent job, friends, and home ownership was possible. However it's 2025 now, I've had to work harder than all of my peers, and I've lost out on jobs due to modern ""hiring standards"" (let's call a spade a spade, it's systemic prejudice targeted at specific group of people); the biggest difference between me & Will's character is that the kid would have been old enough to drive by the end. This movie perfectly encapsulates this struggle, from the desire to 'do better', the way problems compound upon themselves when you're poor, watching the confidence of people who supported you erode through failure after failure, the terrible and stingy person you become when stretched to the absolute limit, and failing to provide for the people (in my case it was pets) you care about most while they ask why things are the way they are. 'Pursuit of Happyness' perfectly encapsulates this struggle.Things are bleak, but I have an interview for a great job at a lucrative company coming up and I need to ""get out of my own head"". After explaining my situation to ChatGPT it recommended I watch this movie to get into the right mental state before the interview. I'd probably suggest to anyone in a similar situation to do the same. There are a lot of people out there who've never had to go through this, and they're more like me in 2006, so I would expect them to think the movie is whiny and pandering.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pursuit of Happiness,"The Pursuit of Happiness I had to google the name ""Christopher Gardner"" after seeing the movie. Because the movie is inspired from his life  a true story! Christopher Gardner is a associate producer along with Will Smith of this movie. It has been just 8 months since the autobiography hit the US markets  that people are able to see its movie. That was quick I say  a good marketing and investment on trying to make oneself immortal on screen. Well done Chris Gardner.Before I write the review  I would like to say that the concept of ""Happiness"" is so different in western society. Trying to be something or someone (one dreams of) to be HAPPY!?? Is that happiness? I do not understand that part. But the movie gives a message  ""Chase your dreams and be happy!"" Does not it sound like an American cliché? Yes it is  so is the movie.Will Smith plays a 'High density resolution X-Ray machine"" sales person in San Francisco, who is in pursue of THE happiness that he sees on people's faces. He lives a drudgery life, in a shabby small apartment and wants to take decent care of his son  Jaden Smith - when his wife, Thandie Newton, leaves him without any earnings, without a place to stay but a DREAM to make it big some day.The whole movie is about his struggle - till the very end when he passes and is selected by a stock broker firm.The way the character is shown facing one ordeal after another, I could not stop thinking that - is this character stupid or dumb or both? I know that many people face much harder challenges without chasing called ""dream"". Knowing that fact - I did not feel much empathy for the character because a lot looked self created to me. But I got the point the movie is trying to make  and I realized it when the tears started rolling my eyes when it is told that Chris has got a job. It was worth all the trouble going through to achieve that happiness. Today Chris Gardner is one the most respected self made entrepreneur in US.The movie making is perfect. I liked the outdoor shots of San Francisco skyline that are taken wonderfully. It is Will Smith's movie all the way. Jaden Smith and Thandie Newton as son and wife have also done a decent job.The amount of time Will Smith is shown running in the movie is crazy. For every other occasion he starts running! Good effort  imagining the number of takes each shot would have taken during rehearsals and filming.A good ""feel good"" movie  that would surely inspire many African Americans to dream big.Just a trivia  for the first time in Amsterdam, I saw more than 20 per cent of the audience from African origin. Will Smith seems to be popular among them and a current running comedy series on UPC channel of a much younger Will Smith is another proof of the same.(6 Stars)",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"The ""one in a million"" dream will never end","Two movies, one topic. I have watched ""The pursuit of happiness"" first and ""Los lunes al sol"" (http://www.IMDb.com/title/tt0319769/) a couple of days later. Both movies have the same rating on IMDb.com and this is frankly not the case. ""The pursuit of happiness"" is a remix of the ""one in a million"" idea: one guy against all odds, facing the worst situation, makes it. I know this is a true story, but the story of *just one* who ""makes it"" (which can be compared to a lottery win - because how *many* people are out there trying?) may lead to the illusion that - as long as you ""want"" - you *can* make it. Sort of ""hang on"" movie. ""Los lunes al sol"" instead shows you what happens to the rest - to the non - Chris Gardeners of this world and is much more realistic.

A movie with all the emotions...,"The ""Pursuit of Happiness"" has everything a movie should have.

Hollywood should take a look at more real stories. Most people don't want to see the 15th remake of a movie. Just give the public the story of real people in real situations. I guarantee success.Smith delivered the performance of a lifetime. I liked him as an actor before this movie. I'm in awe of him after this performance. There is not much else he could have done to make his character more believable. His real son was a wonderful addition as his character's son.I don't critique every aspect of a film.

Willpower at its apex!,"Will Smith's pursuit of an Oscar might be accomplished for his stellar & heartbreaking work in the sappy, but then again feel-good, flick ""The Pursuit of Happiness"". The film chronicles the true story of Chris Gardner, an economic-struggling medical equipment salesman in the 70's who eventually becomes homeless and has to solely care for his young son Christopher. However, this constant persevering Gardner obtains an unpaid internship at a Dean Witter brokerage firm in his pursuit of his happy dream job as a stockbroker. The film's focus on the kinship between father & son through turbulent times was conducted with the right notating heartstrings. Kudos goes out to Screenwriter Steve Conrad for playing the right heartstring scribal tunes. Will's real son Jaden Smith plays Kid Christopher. Mr. & Mr. Smith pull it off to proclaim their work as the best father & son acting duo performance in cinema history.

It's a film you really want to like...,"Expect to cry when you see this film for the first time. Some of the scenes are very emotional, and very sad as well.

It's a movie you really want to love.Will Smith gives a stunning performance as Chris Gardner, a man living on the streets with his son as he tries to get hired as a stockbroker. Smith's performance is beautiful and he truly gives the performance of a lifetime. His pain looks and feels completely real. He deserves the Best Actor Oscar. He's that good.His performance is only made twenty times better by the touching and truly amazing story. For a long time, it seems that nothing can go right for this man. It seems that the world is really against him. He loses everything- yet he still has hope. He holds on to that distant hope that drives and connects with us all. That distant hope that he feels translates to the audience in a way that we can hardly understand. We only know it's a feeling that we don't want to ever lose. We all can feel lost and out of luck at times, but this inspiring film tells us we have to keep moving and keep trying. There is hope in the distance, and though the struggle may be fierce, when we reach that hope it's worth it all.So, yes, this is a movie you really want to like, and it is very easy to do so.

A great movie that you cannot miss it!,"It is really a good movie. I think that no matter how hard you devote, what difficulties you will encounter, just believe in yourself that happiness and dreams will become yours and come true one day. Don't care about others' depreciation and stand up again when you fail. Just like what Chris said to his son, ""Don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something, not even me. You got a dream, you got to protect it. People can't do something themselves, they want to tell you that you can't do it. If you want something, go get it."" In fact, happiness is always there, outside the door, but we never open the door for it and refuse it to come in or didn't seize it and treasure it when it passed by. Therefore, we have to create our happiness and grasp it immediately, not let it vanish before your eyes.This movie uses the way like telling a story. It doesn't have fancy special effects to present this movie. But there are lots of ideas to show implications, like the wrong spelling about happiness . I think it is really a touching movie to see how a father supports his family and takes care of his child.

Terrific movie,"This is a must see. There are several messages here, the most important- FAMILY. That stands out above the rest but the others are important too, will and determination in the face of adversity. Grace and respect in spite of every reason to show hostility and resentment.Will Smith has always been one of my favorite actors and this movie transcends all others he has done. He was believable and made you feel you were actually watching the events happen. Thank you Mr. Smith! I know this was ""inspired"" by the real Chris Gardener and not exact, but it was excellent and now I need to read the book. There should be more movies based on real life experiences. They provide focus and help us to realize what truly is important, not to mention they make you feel good. MOST enjoyable movie.",,Anonymous,Biography
Now THIS is a 'true underdog story',"And, as such, it follows the basic guidelines of the arduous journey from misery to happiness. This type of formula is typically very thankful to translate to film, easy to make and ready to be milked for sentimentality for all its worth', which director Gabriele Muccino dutifully does. That is not to say 'The Pursuit of Happiness' does not deliver what it set out to do, for it wholeheartedly does and then some.Based on a true story, the pursuit of one man to reach the American Dream in San Francisco in 1981 tells the cloying story of Chris Gardner (Will Smith) and his son (Jaden Smith) living in shelters, spending nights on paper towels in run-down, seedy public bathrooms and generally suffering daily hardships by the bucketload. Chris is a good man, but his wife (Thandie Newton) cannot cope with his empty promises and economic struggles, so she splits and takes off to New York City. Now Chris is left with their five-year-old son and an unpaid internship at a prestigious stockbroker's firm. You will be pressed to find a more likable character in film this year, and Will Smith plays him until your heart really breaks for him.But in my opinion, this is no breakout ""epiphany"" role for Will Smith. The truth is that he has always been a strongly capable actor, although it is of course usually within the comedy field. In the comic moments of the film (and there are definitely quite a few), his funny bone translates excellently. In the drama side of the tapestry, he performs well enough  but it is a thankful, rewarding character to portray, much like 'The Pursuit' is a thankful, rewarding film to make owing to its underdog formula. It is, in this way, the type of film that safely elicits a few tears, chuckles and smiles but ultimately offers no revolutionary insight or social commentary in the way that The Great Gatsby aptly addressed the fickleness and simultaneous necessity of the American Dream.The real treat is possibly Jaden Smith as little Christopher, and it becomes apparent that either the Smiths have groomed this kid for low-key, understated acting from a young age or that he is a true natural talent  or both. Perhaps his performance is nothing mind-blowing, but it is so rare for child actors to perform this subtly. Usually they fall prey to desperately cutesy or annoying antics, but Jaden Smith does not. ""Simpsons"" staple Dan Castellaneta also chips in aptly as a mentor at work of sorts.If I have been too unclear or critical so far, let me say that I enjoyed this film immensely as a diversion. This does not change the fact that it is trafficking too heavily in stereotypes and Hallmark staples such as ""Don't ever let anybody tell you that you can't do something"" (yes, Will Smith actually says this at one point) or that it rigorously rubs Chris' misery in our faces in every step of the way, even though we clearly got the gist of his miserable conditions early on in the film. It's almost shamelessly cuing viewers in to feel by unpaid parking tickets, taxes, homelessness and a leaving wife to top it off. The fact is that the film expertly camouflages most of its shortcomings and the end result is even, solid and compelling.'The Pursuit of Happiness' emerges as a safe but inspirational tale that is undeniably readily-molded for both public praise and Oscar buzz. It is difficult NOT to like a film like this, and the pursuit is no exception at all.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
I really like this movie,I really like this movie! It was really sad and really sweet. It had a great meaning of hope and stuff like that. I can't believe this actually happened to someone! I can't imagine someone having to live in the bathroom and trying to survive for himself and his son. See this movie. I was about to cry when Chris and Christopher were in the bathroom. There was a lot of hope and trust in this movie which is something that really motivates people. If you're not into sad movies then I don't suggest you see this movie but it did have some funny jokes. The jokes that Christopher did were so funny and very original.I can't stop thinking about this movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Watch Will Smith struggle to make money for 1 ¾ hours to feed his real life son, because he made a bad investment","I wouldn't count this movie as one of the all-time greatest. It's average and watchable but not more. Will Smith acts decently well and he's looking good with the afro and mustache. The story has some good moments, but it doesn't really happen much for it's length.

A incredible story of a man seeking happiness,"This movie is a great piece of work. It ended 5 minutes ago now, and i'm really stunned. Will Smith's performance of the talented Chris Gardner, is as mentioned by an other user: Oscar material. Chris is a average Joe who's not being noticed for the person that he is. So Chris lacks one of the most important parts of his life, happiness, or Happiness as I like too call it.When I saw the movie, I loved it. It had the perfect mixture of sorrow and happiness, binded together like an excellent and beautiful box of smiles. Weird explanation, but I can't find the right words for this movie.It doesn't matter if you're into action, thriller, comedy's or whatever, this movie will affect you no matter what. I've seen everyone of Will Smith's movies, and this is by far the best one.This is a movie I will recommend to everyone I know, so they can experience what I just did 10 minutes ago, it was like everything made sense in my life. So I end this review by quoting Chris Gardner ; ""Don't let ANYONE, tell you that you can't do something"", because that is the feeling I have now, I will never give up something easily again, and I'm thankful for the life I live today.I recommend this movie with all of my heart! -Anders H",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great story - long winded,"The story of one man's struggle and pursuit of happiness in the face of economic adversity is never more compelling than that of Chris Gardner. Unfortunately, when translated into film it delivers a depressing, drawn-out movie.Simply but, the actors were perfectly cast and their performances were extraordinary but the lack of dialogue and characters makes this the African-American equivalent of Cast Away, only it's a true story.The movie dwells too much on minute details of despair and overlooks the incredible achievements which are accomplished by Gardner. Will Smith and Jaden Smith were incredible though.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Pursuit of Money,"Though I think the movie was made with good intentions, it is sad for me, to see that none of the involved could foresee how it would turn out to be such a- Wait, forget it.Now that I have written it, I think it's worse.It seems to me that these people seriously don't think the way I do, and the way i do is i dislike equating happiness (""All those happy faces"") to having a job. Moreso, a ""good"" (as in getting a lot of money) job.I mean, I know one has to live - but the film is grossly assuming people have perfect lives if only they'd have money... or maybe it is simply centering on the ""getting a job"" theme but it certainly mixes that small part of life with other themes that also certainly don't have ANYTHING to do with that. Maybe it permits to live, but there are definitely more important things, at least for me.Also, the movie is just too typical, and even though I admire Mr. Smith's character's struggle to just get his son a life he wants him to give, it smells of that too well known, rancidly recycled American dream. Maybe it was a real story (what's real?) but don't you think they should have taken more care, for example, on the relationship between father and son; maybe wife too? It's so taken for granted... he's a good father, little child loves him, if only, oh poor him, he had a job. THEN EVERYTHING COULD START GETTING BETTER.And that's the thing: It could. But so many times it doesn't. With a title like ""The pursuit of happiness"" one could only imagine so many things... maybe it could be more appropriately retitled ""to start the pursuit of happiness"". Yeah, we need money, arguably a job, but then? What? I admire the intention of saying ""if you want it, go get it"" - but it is dangerously close to a brainwashing video from a workplace with a capitalist philosophy doing heavy revisionism to get people to PRODUCE MORE!!! LOVE YOUR JOBS! MONEY IS GOOD! MONEY IS FREEDOM! MONEY IS HAPPINESS! ...that's it, suffice is to say, i didn't exactly like it. Except when Will Smith cried... he's a good crier.And Gabriele Muccino - if you read this: don't lose yourself on Hollywood, please.Cheers",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

I mean yes,we all face trouble all the time but what would you do if you have no money left,no friends,no place to spend the night in and a child aged 5 with you all the time?

A Powerful and Moving Film,"This film is truly an inspiration for everyone. I had to repeatedly close my mouth as I was gaping so much throughout.While knowing a bit about the background of the character played by Will Smith I knew that everything would turn out right but to see the in between bits and how they were overcome was fantastic.The trailers do not do it justice and if they make you want to see the film then you will be blown away by it.The relationship between Will Smith and his son was touching in places and realistic.Truly a must see film.

Man tries to overcome odds and bring up his son,"This film is very watchable, but has one major problem that makes it impossible for me to rate it highly. It's basically a copy of the classic Italian realism film from the 1950s, Bicycle Thieves. The plot is almost identical - just swap Will Smith's radiation machine for a bike and give it a modern reboot with some minor changes and you've got a box office hit on your hands. There is one major difference between the two films - one will do down as one of the greatest in cinematic history, while the other will soon be forgotten. One's McDonald's, the other is Mitchelin starred; one's a tear-jerker, the other's a heavyweight tragedy. The Pursuit of Happiness has the relationship between father and son at its heart. It's about the dad trying to hang on to some threads of dignity and maintaining a relationship with his son while faced with crippling poverty. But the film is painted on a small canvass that fails to really tell us anything worth holding on to about human existence. Whereas Bicycle Thieves is the true story - it shows how many of us live on the margins of society and how luck, good and bad, can decide the course of our lives. In telling us this it tells us so much. I'm unsure what Pursuit of Happiness left me with apart from some fake tears.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"empathy for the struggling working man - connect with it, if you can","Sometimes (maybe often times, or not even 'maybe') it really does make a difference when you see a film at a particular time in your life. Case in point, this movie, which got Will Smith his third(?) Oscar nomination playing a down-on-his-luck father trying to support himself and a five year old son and hustling medical equipment while also being an intern at a brokerage. At the time I think I saw the trailers and the reviews and thought 'eh, looks like Oscar-baity pap, pass.'But also at that time - and here I'll get personal so bear with me - I was actually doing not too badly post college; I didn't have any debts then (my parents said they'd take care of any student loan debt), and had a steady job with my family's business. Since then the family business closed, I went to work at another place that didn't work out, drove a cab for a while, and now I'm working as a deliver driver for a diner - and during this going to graduate school for screen writing, getting that, and then getting saddled with the student loan debt (and debt from financing for the most part myself for a feature film, which is a story in and of itself for another time), and then becoming an adjunct professor, which is not as steady an income as it comes. This may be in too much detail, but the point I'm trying to get at is... life is a struggle. Things aren't always handed to people, and this isn't necessarily a race thing (I can't say for certain if Will Smith's character Chris Gardner was white things would be necessarily easier - certainly being black in America makes rising to the top harder, again another thing to talk about for another time and maybe I'm not the one to write about it, at least not right now).The struggle of survival is something that crosses lines into something that is fundamental, and certainly it requires some empathy - I don't think this is necessarily for the sociopaths out there, or people who might dismiss it for, say, a guy like Smith who has wealth playing an 'average Joe' - but I think it hit me harder having lived through a life where having to work day by day, having to make bills down to the last minute (or maybe not paying them quite on time), and simply the sheer horrible-indifferent beast known as *bad luck* made me see Gardner even clearer than when I was fresh out of college.Now, does this make The Pursuit of Happiness some instant classic ala Bicycle Thieves, also about the constant, existential ""pursuit"" of staying alive moment to moment and beat to beat? No, not quite. But then I didn't quite expect that anyway; this is following a character through a longer timeline anyway, as Gardner is at this firm as an intern and sometimes his luck as he has his son (along with his son, played by Jayden Smith at a time when he was more natural an actor than now it seems), and so the rise-fall-tiny-rise-fall-fall-fall-eventual-YES-success story is not too hard to see coming around every turn of the corners of the film. This is also not to say it's not hard to compare it to De Sica's film (also by the way this comes from an Italian filmmaker transitioning to Hollywood): one scene where Gardner and his son are at a restaurant with a moment of respite from life with a meal see a better-off family in the place and looks are exchanged. Class structure in action.But it's the emotion that's poured in by Smith and how everything is kept at this 'what-do-I-do-next, and then what' narrative that goes between what Gardner has to do and how he *must* always be a good father (this, too, creates some drama), that makes the film work so and connects with me. I don't have a son but that doesn't mean I can't empathize with this part either (ironic to see this here and then ten years later Smith as Deadshot with the 'all for my daughter' part of his character that didn't ring as true, but I digress). He's playing a regular guy who is smart and listens and tries to do his best, and yet he doesn't make him a superman. He can get hit by a car while trying to get back his medical device a homeless man took from him; he can get stiffed $14 from a local ""friend""; he and his ex (Thandie Newton in a wonderful if under-utilized part); he can get angry or distracted at the wrong times. If we empathize with him it's because his character *does* have flaws and has to work through them to get where he needs to be (or as he says, he has to work so much harder just to get ahead).So, again, this may come down to timing for me connecting with this so much - maybe at another time I'd think 'oh, please' - but at any rate, Smith gives a performance that is perhaps his most convincing as a dramatic actor, with flashes of his charisma but channeled into someone who is more like the audience at large coming to see him than those surrounding him in lush Hollywood. It's imperfect and occasionally sentimental, but it rings true more often than not, and that counts. It's a nice block of studio neo-realism, if that contradiction makes sense.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great film,"I really enjoyed this film. It kept my interest and I appreciated that although many bad things happen to the main character, he never lashes out or gives up. The lack of violence, sex scenes, and drug/alcohol use is refreshing. He cashes a check in a liquor store and when the clerk asks him if he wants anything else, he says no. Not what you would expect in a film. Usually the character would get drunk, etc. He is also discriminated against, but doesn't complain; he just smiles. The fact that he worked so hard and also took care of his son and studied diligently were very moving to me. This movie inspired me to not give up on improving my own life. However, success and happiness are soley equated with money in this film, and in real life, yes of course, money is important, but it alone doesn't make you happy. The spiritual side of this character could have been explored more. He obviously had a ""the glass is half full"" attitude. And there is a scene of him and his son at a church service in a homeless shelter, but otherwise this aspect of his life is not explored. This is a simply lovely movie that I highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Depressing, but inspiring tale of hard work and dedication","The Pursuit of Happyness is a movie that tells a true story about the most difficult time in a man's life. His struggles are tough, and it's never what I'd describe as a fun film. I appreciate seeing how a man works through the dark times in order to come out in a better situation, because it shows the value of hard work and dedication. The power of all this is magnified, and the stakes are increased, because he is raising a child through it all. I was a little put off by the fact that he probably wasn't providing a better home for his son, and by all rights should have sent the son to live with his mother if she had a stable living situation. However, I do know it might have killed his determination and by letting the son go, he might have never seen him again. Also, many of the complaints that I would have about the actions taken by characters in the film have to be forgiven simply because this is all grounded in the real history of Chris Gardner. There is an authenticity to the story-telling here that reinforces the fact that it is a true story. While I'm sure they took some artistic license, it still felt grounded.I'm on the fence about the narration in The Pursuit of Happyness. I almost feel like it should have been done by a third-party narrator, rather than Chris Gardner himself. Also, titling different parts of the film as though they were chapters in a book did nothing for me. However, I appreciate the shorthand they were able to achieve using narration. It could be hard to visually show some of the things that set the main character apart from the other interns, so explaining it in a couple of lines helps a lot. I think Will Smith delivers an amazing performance as Chris Gardner, and this is a difficult role to master with all the emotional beats in the film. But in my opinion, the entire movie is a bit too dour. I know the point is seeing the hard road taken to achieve success, but we get such a brief moment of joy, that it can be tough to wait until the movie gets there. I still appreciate The Pursuit of Happyness, though, because all the despair makes the ending that much more powerful, and it's hard not to cry. It's not exactly a movie I'll want to seek out for multiple re-watches, but it is a solid story.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

The real story should be shown to parents on how not to raise your children and the compromises that must be made professionally in order to provide safety and security to children. Two jobs working blue collar would have kept a roof over the child and food on the table. Chasing dreams can come later when your Child's needs are first secure. Also, the minimum internship hours in the 80s for a stockbroker were 80 to 100 hours a week.

Will Smith and Will Smith Jr. propel this dismal tale of poverty full of gritty realism but an overload of drama,"Watching the Pursuit of Happiness, we were looking for the main character's pursuit of happiness as well. In other words, this is a very harsh film, very brutal in terms of reality and the way life is without the luxury of money. Thanks to a stellar cast, good direction, and a nice script, The Pursuit of Happiness is a good film that is hard to look at just because it's so tough, its so hard to see. This trait serves as a double-edged sword, as the realities need to be displayed on movie screens more often, but it comes at you so often that it becomes harder and harder to watch, and it drags a bit in certain moments. Nonetheless, this is a must-see for anyone that needs a little inspiration, of for anyone that might be taking their life for granted.The Pursuit of Happiness follows the gloomy life of Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman losing money, and losing the respect and the love of his wife, while at the same time worrying about the future of his son. He is forced to move constantly, at times doesn't even know if he'll have a home in the evening, all in the meantime he is trying to sell dated products and also attempt to become a stockbroker. With the odds against him, Chris fights for his pursuit of a good life for him and his son.The best part of the movie comes from the writing. The writing team crafts a script in which it showcases the true, true victim of the story; not the main character Chris, but his son. Chris' son, named Christopher, is shown as the one that suffers the most, as his future is seen in jeopardy, his mental and emotional status at the brink of destruction, and hope in his life fading away very quickly. Steve Conrad's script also displays that it wasn't just the world ganging up on Chris, but Chris making bad decisions as well. Last but not least, it's not a bitter social commentary with hidden propaganda; people are poor and starving for a reason, and the rich are enjoying the fruits of life for a reason. Chris soon realizes that pursuing happiness relies on constant determination and maintaining optimism.Will Smith delivers his best performance of his entire career as the under pressure father. Already proving himself in action, comedy, and romantic movies; Smith surprises with a heartbreaking and emotionally-moving portrayal of Chris Gardner. His excellent chemistry with his on-screen son can be traced to the fact that it's his real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, who also gives a decent performance for a first-timer. Unfortunately though, acting isn't consistently great, as the wife, Thandie Newton, gives us a very mediocre presentation. One nice surprise is Homer Simpson acting; Dan Castellaneta has a role as Alan Frakesh, one of the big boys of the company Chris is trying to work for.This film's biggest strength also turns into its biggest weakness. While it is indeed incredibly realistic and can perfectly tear out your heart, the barrage of unfortunate events just continues piling up. Then, with a running time of almost two hours, it starts to drag and can hurl people towards immediate depression. Humans can only take so much bad news at one sitting before reaching for a sharp object. To top it all off after so much drama, sad, tear-jerking moments, and instances that force you to wipe the tears from your face; the movie is over. When the opening credits last longer than the conclusion, we have a major problem.Bottom Line: Excellent script and good acting is barred by poor editing, a long running time, and an ending that comes almost at the blink of an eye. Will Smith gives the performance of a lifetime, his son excels as well, but the story is far too sad to be inspirational, which is what Smith and his cast was not aiming for. Kudos for the tough, edgy look at the homeless life, but with a third act that was dragging, the appeal starts wearing off. Cutting the length, leaving out some of the bad events from the movie entirely would have improved the film, and made it a bit more motivating. Advertised as a dramedy, and comes off more as a gloomy drama than anything else; which is both a good and a bad thing. The Pursuit of Happiness: A story that isn't life-changing, but is a decent example as to what can happen to your life with a bit of effort and perseverance.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing Performance by Will Smith,"""Inspired by a true story"" always makes me kind of nervous. It's as if the filmmakers are falling back on the fact that it's a true story, hoping that the truth of it will pull our heartstrings, rather than the actual story. The Pursuit of Happiness admittedly suffers from some of these weakness, but mostly overcomes them, particularly in the person of Will Smith, who delivers the best performance of his career.Chris Gardner is a man who is struggling financially, because invested in bone density scanners that most doctors do not find to be too useful. He has a wife and kid, both of whom must deal with Chris's difficulties as he goes through life. One day he happens upon a man who is a stockbroker, who tells him that to make it in that field, he only needs to ""be good with numbers, and be good with people."" Soon after Chris pursues this career path, but he still must deal with his family's financial troubles, and selling the bone density scanners. The movie follows his struggles.The story of Pursuit of Happiness is solid, but it feels kind of pointless. By the time the movie was over, I felt moved by Chris Gardner and his plight, but I wondered why someone had chosen to make a film of him. The end of the movie gave a couple of facts about how Gardner, the actual man, and it kind of justified why the story had been told, but ultimately, it failed to resonate. If a lesser talented actor had been in the role, it would have failed completely.Will Smith's performance is breathtaking. He undoubtedly gives the best performance of his career, and it might even possibly be Oscar-worthy. I wouldn't be surprised if he was nominated, in any case. He fully inhabits his character and never once slips up. His tragedy feels very real, very present. Only because of him does this movie work. He brings out the best about the movie, and even if one thinks the rest of the movie is worthless, his performance alone is worth the price of a movie ticket.I respect Will Smith. He went from being a rapper to being someone who will probably be nominated for an Oscar. This is a very difficult transition for a musical artist to make. He has even earned the respect of critics and audiences. Even if the story of Pursuit of Happiness is sub-par, it deserves praise for bringing out the best in Will Smith.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent message of Hope,"I am 66 years old. I have never written a comment on this site. Yesterday I saw the movie with my 23 year old granddaughter. We loved it. Following the viewing, she commented, ""Qhen we have hard times, we can remind ourselves of this movie and its message."" Most people would have given up somewhere along the way with all of the obstacles that befell him while trying to seek a successful career. He never gave up and Wow!, did it pay off to stick it out regardless of the logs in the road.This movie leaves you with a message you will not soon forget.

Happy? Well...,"A philosophical question and a very western idea that human beings are perpetually in pursuit of happiness. Frankly speaking, happiness is not the final goal of life, rather, ""joy"" is more profound psychologically and physically.Really, work hard and persist and American Dream will come true is what many US citizens believe in. Yet, there are too many cases of disillusionment, he succeeded and congratulations to him, but that's not about every one. I gather that the happiness (or happiness) here means that he is out of monetary plight. My more serious question: has his wife returned to stay with him and the kid? Personally I don't want to be any Chris Gardner because happiness is so difficult, so cruel to obtain. In my own experience (I did had hardship/difficult time in life), after so much hard time, I don't feel especially ""happy"" when the hardship's gone or when what I wanted came to me, the only feeling was, and always was ""tired"" and ""exhausted"" but not happy.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
What would have happened if he failed?,"This film is inspired by a true story about a man going from economic nothingness to being rather wealthy and simultaneously trying to raise his little son. It's got some very heavy scenes, very well acting and good directing but for some reasons fails to deliver.Imagine yourself being in this man shoes with the same problems. What would you do? Go out and try to find a job in the stock market? Let's assume that you would. The most important question then would be: What would happen if you failed? What then? Exactly how would you bring food to the table? I don't know how accurate is the movie compared to the real story but it is quite simply not easily accepted. If he really did that, he is one of them examples not to be followed. Although he succeeded and made a good life for him and his son, his reasoning is questionable. His story is one of personal luck - great great luck, mind you - but in similar cases the first thing a parent should do is to ensure the well-fare of his or her children, not chase some dream for better life. If you succeed at the first, then and only then go after the second.The movie is not bad, it's actually quite good, but the aftertaste is the big problem. A movie of this kind must portray first of all responsibility towards your loved ones. This one is not. It's one thing to write a book, an autobiography specifically, but a movie is going to be heard and seen by a tremendously lot more people than the book. It seems nowadays that money are more important than your family in the minds of the film-makers.Sorry, but i will pass....",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
God bless the man who takes good care of his family...,"No matter what color you are, or where you are from, anyone can appreciate Chris Gardener's trials and tribulations. As many have said you can't help but to be inspired by this true story of devotion.Sitting in the theater with my wife, I (not only) like Will Smith teared -up I was simply worn out, 30 minutes into the movie! The things that Mr. Gardener suffered all in the line of his life's duty was more than some people could bare. There's no doubt about that. Will was outstanding as the father of the small child and the husband who's wife couldn't wait another minute. Think about what she just gave up. Not only her son, a good boy, but a good man who ultimately would not quit. I understand from his interview that he is a multi-millionaire now. After all that. In the light of many circumstances that would depress the hell out of any normal man or woman. He was evicted, jailed, hit by a car and lost a shoe, while on his lunch break and on and on it went. As I watched him I was inspired greatly! As my wife said ""Look at his attitude and the way that he 'carried' himself through all of it. He didn't bring on the fell sorry for me thing."" That truly he would have had every right to disclose his problems, but he simply kept on keeping on, until....-he won!!I think every good American should watch and get inspired by this story.

Good Film,"A very good film. Although, I have to admit that I felt more inspired and uplifted by Akeelah and the Bee. This story was from Chris Gardner's point of view. It was his triumph. Will Smith did an awesome job portraying a man struggling to find success for himself and his family. But, I think his son, Jaden Smith, stole the show. I'd love to see him in his own film. His acting talent is outstanding. There should be a film made from a young, African-American boy's perspective. He could definitely pull it off. Akeelah and the Bee definitely paved the way for that kind of film. Go see The Pursuit of Happiness. It's a feel good movie. Take the whole family and enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Very powerful,"This was one of the best movies I have seen.....everything from the storyline to the acting to the setting was excellent. There were a number of scenes in this movie in which nothing was said verbally (scenes on the streets of the city) but which spoke volumes about the world we live in. Happiness was different than your typical rags to riches movie, especially the ones that involve African-Americans. No one was living in the hood, involved in illegal activities, and trying to make it as an athlete or entertainer. I think a lot can be learned about what it takes to make it in this world from this movie (determination, opportunity, charisma, position, luck). Many people (those who have not always been upper middle class or rich) will be able to relate to this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The pursuit of happiness,"The Pursuit of Happiness is a movie based on a true story. The protagonist, Chris Gardner, is no doubted a success; the movie focuses on how he got to success. Nobody is born to win but learns to. Sometimes, people consider themselves a failure even before they try to be successful. To excel is not as difficult as we think. Maybe we just need to find out what we are really good at, create ourselves chances, and the most important, someone who will persistently trust on us and stand by our side.Chris told his five-year-old son, Christopher, never let others told you that you couldn't do something, not even I. How important sticking to your dreams is. How many times in life we're deprived of our dreams, sometimes even by those loves us dearly and we love wholeheartedly? Why we are easily persuaded to believe that we are incapable of something? Maybe that's exactly how we're driven far from who we want to be. Tell ourselves ""I can do it"" and then prove it.Chris is doomed to be distinguished because he is the kind of men who tend to create chances for themselves, sharing the taxi fees, telling the truth, showing his sincerity, no hanging the phone between calls, promoting his program in the box of football stadium audience. Poverty, lack of education background, even car accident, nothing's gonna stop him. If he was blocked, instead of an excellent stock broker, he would have been a poor salesman in little needed medical bone density scanners until today. Comparing with him, we are too easily to be frustrated and retreated, aren't we?Chris could fail without his lovely boy, Christopher, who believed what Chris said even after his mother left with despair. Together, father and son struggled through homelessness, jail time, tax seizure and the overall punishing misery. ""Do you trust me?"" ""Yes, dad."" It's the ""yes"" that supported Chris to overcome all the roughness and insist on what he's fighting for. The beloved boy would grow up and change his mind. The role his father plays would fade with time. Maybe someday, he would no longer need his father as he did in childhood. But what matters. The memory of the time they shared together would last forever; their love and care for each other would last forever.The success of Chris Gardner is a legend, a miracle, but not an accident. Each of us can make it too. The difference between winners and losers is to do or not to do. Let's just do it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

This Part of My Life,"Greetings again from the darkness. This film has the feel of a Disney movie where the story is just too unbelievable for real life. The difference here is that it is the TRUE story of Chris Gardner. Sure, the story is entirely from his point of view and the only bits we get of his wife are as an angry, bitter, fed up Thandie Newton who just boils over with disgust at her life with Chris.The pleasure in this film is watching the scenes with Will Smith (as Mr. Gardner) and Jaden Smith (his real life son). The spirit of these two and the perseverance the display are very uplifting. Nice support work is offered by Dan Castellanata (voice of Homer Simpson) and Kurt Fuller.Director Gabriele Muccino steps into his first mainstream Hollywood film and does a pretty good job in most scenes. The ""action"" scenes of Smith running in the streets are a bit hokey, but I really enjoyed the more personal moments. Overall, pretty good film of an amazing story. Also, don't miss the real Chris Gardner walking past Will Smith and his son at the end ... during the best ""knock-knock"" joke ever!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Despite featuring a few heartwarming moments and fine performances, the film was uninteresting and forgettable","Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is the type of guy everyone knows and most have been at one point in their life or another - the working poor. He's smart and diligent but unable to catch a break and falling further and further behind in his responsibilities to everything except his young son (Jaden Smith) whom he'd promised to always be around for, no matter the circumstances.The Pursuit of Happiness is heartwarming in parts but as a whole, the film wasn't very engaging or memorable. The whole thing just felt too manipulative and I think they tried way too hard to get the audience to feel sorry for the main character. For instance, the first half of the film was mostly depressing to watch because the ""hero"" of the movie was in a bad state so it was hard to watch him suffer. We had to see all of these unlucky scenes and moments where Chris just couldn't catch a break. It got really annoying after awhile to have the film show all of this and it just proved that it was clear pity draining.The direction proved to be quite lame and it was a big reason to why the movie wasn't very appealing to me. The pacing was on the slow side and it was unbearable at times. This had to do with the fact that the main character himself wasn't very likable so it got tiring to watch him for nearly two hours. We were supposed to root for him which was easy to do because of his situation but I never really viewed him as an interesting person and he was actually pretty selfish. He took on a six month internship which didn't pay any money and he was surprised that his wife wasn't happy with that decision. Even though everything worked out in the end, I don't believe he should have taken that job because his family was in a bad situation already. I admire his determination to get out of the unfortunate situation but not the way he chose to do so.The most positive thing about the film was the relationship between Will Smith and Jaden Smith. I know that they are related in real life so filming these scenes was probably an easy thing to do yet they did have an appealing relationship and watching them together made you root for Chris a little more because you want the best for the kid. However, I don't believe Will Smith deserved an Oscar nomination. He was really good but there were better performances from 2006. Thandie Newton deserved a razzie for her performance. She was ridiculously over the top and very fake. She had no control of her emotions and was just generally awful. Overall, The Pursuit of Happiness features a few heartwarming moments but for the most part, it didn't really appeal to me. Rating 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

I sometimes seriously think of writing a book called ""The Land of No Opportunity"".

Intense!,"""The Pursuit of Happiness"", directed by Gabriele Muccino (who I thought was a woman by hearing his name), and Italian-born director, who, until now, has only done Italian films, is about just that: pursuing happiness. The funky spelling in the fourth word of the title is taken from a daycare center in the movie, run by Asian-Americans, who have a less-than-perfect understanding of the English language.Will Smith (that's right, the Fresh Prince) plays Chris Gardner, a dedicated but unlucky and unsuccessful up-and-coming businessman living in San Francisco. In 1981, when the film takes place, he is selling an X-ray-like machine to doctors, most of whom turn the product down. With his wife (Thandie Newton) working double-overtime, the three person family barely makes ends meet. (The third individual is Christopher, a five-year-old played by Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, Mr. Smith's own son.) When Chris' wife leaves him, he makes the elegant but crazy decision to take care of Christopher, while trying to get a competitive internship at a brokerage firm. Because of the lack of need for Chris' medical equipment, and the fact that he doesn't get paid for the internship, Chris and Christopher leave their apartment, move into a motel, and, eventually, and only for a night, into a public bathroom at a BART stop.What makes ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" such a great film to watch is because of Mr. Smith's performance. It is so intense, so utterly watchable, that it makes the film. Many scenes in the film, however, involve Mr. Smith running from place to place, without a lot of time to spare. I question the necessity of these scenes; they clog up the film, and make it seem as though the filmmakers were not confident in Mr. Smith's acting ability, so they shot a few minutes of his sprinting. Well, they are proved wrong time and time again over the course of this 110-minute film. Will Smith should garner at least an Oscar nom for his brilliant work in this film.Steven Conrad, whose last screen writing gig was ""The Weather Man"", a much darker, more cynical and crass black comedy, seems back on track with this film. However sappy the film is, and it is some, Mr. Conrad reins himself in whenever he feels the urge to uplift, and, as Chris says at one point, ""bring me back to Earth."" While this ""Earth"" is a moderately over-dramatized and somewhat-silly one, it pulls us in, and keeps up the pace for nearly two hours.This is a sublime film, though it is a little dramatized, and somewhat overly sappy. I won't spoil the ending here, but let me tell you, the ole' waterworks were going at a milllion miles per hour for the last ten minutes of the film. When Chris' wife is walking out the door, he tells her to ""get happy."" When I saw this film, I did.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The scene in subway bathroom touches me so bad....,"I always keep these lines by Chris in mind: "" Don't ever let somebody tell you...you can't do something. Not even me.""
"" You got a dream, you gotta protect it. People can't do something themselves,they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want something, go get it. Period.""Sometimes, over generous economic background, over comfortable living conditions, and too ample time to waste contrarily get us losing faith and motivation of striving and advancing, as well taking time for granted rather than cherishing it.A stockbroker internship position at Dean Witter
might be one of the many opportunities for other interns. However, as for Chris, that was the one and the only hope. So he exerted all out to grasp tighter this opportunity than anyone else. He constantly believed in there's way out and kept showing the best of him, and finally he made it.
Though there were tons of crappy, awful, terrible days and nights back then, those are the motivators and nutrients continuously push us to be better ones.
I think Chris still view those predicaments as his gift ,counts the blessings and never takes them for granted.No matter how we define our ""happiness"", there is one thing that the movie have us to bear deeply in mind: "" Would rather strive but fail than living in the regret of not taking actions.

Let's just say that's it not Oliver Stone dramatic. This truly is a must see. To say ""I laughed, I cried"" would be really lame.

The Pursuit Of Happiness Much Better Than Expected,"The Pursuit Of Happiness was much better than expected mainly because of the great performance by Will Smith who continues to show his talent as an actor in this film. Director Gabriele Muccino has done an admirable job of making this movie based on an inspiring true story about a struggling salesman who tries to find a steady job so that he can support him and his son after losing nearly everything but finds a chance to get his life back on track with a stockbroker internship at Dean Witter. Will Smith is fantastic as Chris Gardner the struggling salesman giving one of his best performances in this film. Smith continues to show why he's one of Hollywoods best actors today in this one. Well done. Will's real life son Jaden steps into the role of his on screen son Chris Jr. and he is equally impressive. They both have great chemistry together and because they are rally father and son they didn't have to try hard to make that believable in the movie. The rest of the cast are good in their roles. Thandie Newton makes a brief extended appearance as Chris' wife who leaves him. Newton may lack screen time but she's still effective in the role. The pacing for the movie was a little slow at times but it does offer some humor, drama, and a touching story about the bond between a father and his son which makes up for it's one flaw. Overall The Pursuite Of Happiness was much better than I thought it would be. The movie has drama, some small doses of humor, characters we come to care about, and terrific performances by the cast especially Will Smith who makes this inspiring true story enjoyable to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Everyone should see this movie,"The Pursuit of Happiness was a terrific movie. Some people have said it was boring, whoever said that needs help o.0. This movie was very moving. Will Smith is Oscar material, and it was a good move to cast his real son in the movie, that made it even more believable. Some parts, I swear I was about to cry. Throughout the entire movie, all I thought was, ""Man, give them a break!"", which obviously meant I cared about the characters, which is what a good cast is supposed to do. We know Will Smith as more of a comedian, but he took on a more serious side in this movie. However, there were a few funny parts, and Christopher (his son) had some brilliant lines. I love this movie, I think everyone should see it. It really makes you analyze your life, I mean, if you think it's bad now, you probably don't have to sleep in a bathroom.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful emotional movie,"Will Smith is at his best. He never played a role like this one before, and he certainly does it very well, in my opinion it would be worth his first Oscar this year.It is a motion picture that makes you cry, laugh and admire this little guy who is just struggling ten times more than the others and still trying to handle everything...the story is full of feeling, and the father-son combo Smith is just as genuine as they could be.The only weak point in my view (maybe as an European): while the story is very nice, it seems a bit too optimistic and focused on the typical American dream scheme: just believe in yourself and you'll be rewarded.But in the end, a very nice movie you'll have to see!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Two Thumbs Up!!,"Definitely one of the best movies of the year. Will smith outdoes himself in this movie. And his son is a little charmer. Every one needs to see this movie. Most of the movie is very sad, but the acting is wonderful. It is in my idea Will's greatest movie. His son also is a great actor and I am sure he will have future acting roles. This movie definitely deserves two thumbs up and a lot more. I see so many Awards coming its way. I was so surprised by the acting in this movie. I almost cried quite a few times. It felt so real. I guarantee every one that sees this movie will be touched. It is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Review for The Pursuit of Happiness,"We have so many definitions for the word ""Hero"". We call hero people who can save our world, because they are just, brave, and they will fight to the end even though they sacrifice themselves. For example firemen or soldiers are natural heroes we can't help but cheer on. There are also some people who are average folks struggling to pay rent and care for their children. They are all around us and we can also call them heroes. The movie: The Pursuit of Happiness is a very good movie to describe those folk heroes. I recommend this movie because its true story, of the great acting of Will Smith, and it can bring us hope for a better life.In the movie The Pursuit of Happiness we can see how a good man tries to make an honest living and keep his family together during hard times. Gardner and his wife Linda have a five-year-old son who is named Christopher, and they don't have money because Gardner and Linda have sunk their savings into a truckload of high-tech bone density scanners. Gardner planned to sell these machines to hospitals. However, they have trouble selling it because most hospitals don't want buy his product. Soon, Gardener's family gets into a poor situation. In this time, life for Gardner's family become more and more hard. Gardner and his son start to leave their home. No matter how hard it is to live, Gardner never gives up, and he tries to make a better life for his family.The movie: The Pursuit of Happiness is produced by Columbia Pictures; the director is Gabriele Muccino, and the lead role is played by Will Smith. The Pursuit of Happiness, set in 1981, is inspired by the real life story of underdog Chris Gardner, who rose from being homeless to become a stock market tycoon. It really happened just in our daily life, and this showed that there are everyday heroes. In this movie we can see the superb acting of Will Smith. He shows every little emotion in great detail, and his vivid acting can touch every audience. I heard about many people crying when they watched this movie because of the impressive plot and Will Smith's perfect acting skill.From The Pursuit of Happiness we can see that we all can be a hero if we keep fighting and never give up for life. In the movie Gardner is hero for himself and his family, because he makes his dream come true by his hand. I can still remember that Gardner cried twice in the whole movie. The first cry is when they don't have money to live in a motel, and they just sleep in the subway's bathroom. When he looked at his son he can't help but cry, and in that time he swear to try his best to give his son a better life. The second time when he cries, he gets the job which can help him to make the dream come true.I strongly recommend this movie to you, because of the impressive plot, the great actors, and the positive energy. We can clearly know from this movie that however hard life could be, if you keep fighting and never give up, the happiness will knock on your door.",,Anonymous,Biography
Anything is possible with a positive attitude and faith in God.,"This movie has been an inspirational one.

Just AMAZING,"This movie is just a masterpiece! I cried during the movie, and after watching it, I changed my mindset about so many things in life. After this movie, I started to realize the minor things that bother me in my everyday life are nothing compared to what Will Smith's character, Christopher Gardner, is facing. I am glad that Will Smith played this role as he portrayed the character in such a great way. I think that no other actor could have done it so. Will Smith was so into his character, and he played all the emotions of sadness, anger, nervousness, and happiness in so many great ways that I just can't forget them. Smith is a great actor, and this movie is the perfect example of how from having nothing a man can achieve greater heights and yet still be a man! Christopher Gardner is a role model for many desperate and hopeless people. If you ever feel that you can't achieve your goals- just watch this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Horatio Alger blah blah blah boot-straps blah blah blah,"Through will-power, single-minded focus, and a determination to provide for his son the father he himself never had in his youth, Chris Gardner does all he can to turn a life of seeming ineptitude at all things into something that ""Civilisation"" values: earning power and a grasp of those things which make an existence ""a life"".Part ""Mary Poppins"", part Mickey Rooney / Judy Garland 'let's put on a show in that old barn' styles movie, this is filled with enough happiness (sic.) for anyone to have a diabetic attack during. Those of you looking for re-assurance in the superiority of the free-market economy and/or the American way of life (cf: Mr. Alger, Mr. Hughes, et al) will be more than able to present this at your next meeting of the local Rotary or NRA.Good performances from all, with only the wife to annoy (and she's the weakest one  and nearly the sole female  in the bunch), you'll be impressed with Smith as well as the phenomenon playing his son.Watching this in January of 2009 makes one wonder what would happen if this was attempted from the same starting position today instead of the early 1980s of Reaganomics, and the thought that 'all it takes is just determination and your efforts will be rewarded makes the cynic apoplectic, but this is better than reading the Wall Street coverage of late, so suck back a bottle of Chablis and line of coke and re-live those crazy days of 20 years ago when 'greed was good'.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just a great Movie,"No spoilers, as I want people to go and see it, just a thoroughly class movie. Excellent acting, particularly between Smith and his son, depeciting a very harsh reality of life at that time.Please take the time to watch this movie, whether you think about the message it portrays or not and believe me there are a lot.Smith should get at least an Oscar nomination for this. I have always liked him in his roles, even if some of them were less than stellar movies, but this one I cannot fault, it is a moving portrayal of the real story that you can't help but feel involved in and still in parts Smith manages to bring in the lighter side of things.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Heartwarming Story,"This is one of the best films to come out this year. Will Smith is again able to show us how versatile of an actor he is. The other actors in the film (including Will Smith's REAL son, debuting as his son in the film). This movie is first and foremost a drama with tidbits of comedy. The ""Pursuit of Happiness"" is a heartwarming tale of a man and his son living through, well, life. Smith is down on his luck in the fast-moving life of the early '80s. This movie is able to at the very least, give the viewer at least a welling of tears- either by sadness in the scene in the public bathroom or extreme joy for Smith's character in the end. Highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great film... and not as heart-wrenching as I thought,"The reason this film is so good is because it is a simple film with a simple message: (For most people) Life isn't easy...things don't just land in your lap. You have to work damn hard and if you are lucky you will be successful. And if you are successful, you might even be happy. Which is wonderful! Not to say people don't find happiness without success and money.... but by god it helps! :) Will Smith is fantastic. I've always been a fan but never really considered him to be a great actor, more a great entertainer. I always thought that he was on screen how he is in real life and never really had to try too hard at acting. This film proved me wrong. He is a brilliant actor in a brilliant role with a brilliant son who is also.. brilliant! This film isn't something that will change your life or be considered amongst the great films but if you want to watch a great story acted well then this is the film for you.It is not as sad as everyone makes out. Yes I bawled my eyes out whilst watching it but it's not the saddest story ever: there are worse things happening in the world than people who can't afford their rent. But let's not get political.Cracking film. Go and see it. My guess is that Will Smith will be pipped at the Oscar post by Peter O'Toole (if they are both nominated) but he won't care.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Charming, moving, well-written, and well-acted.","With any luck, this movie will sadden you, depress you, anger you, make you laugh, and make you ecstatic. This is a great choice for pretty much anyone to watch.Will Smith plays a man whose life never seems that it can get any worse, until it does. Repeatedly. All that apparently separates him from a beggar on the street, is his unquestionable self-belief, a black suit & tie, and his obvious complete and utter devotion to his son. The movie never really stops to blame anyone, or anything, for this man's misfortune... no matter how frustrating it is. 'Que sera sera', and life carries on. This requires a lot of self-restraint, both on the part of Chris Gardner, and on the part of the viewer. :-)Realistic? Who knows. It seems to have been based on a true story. This life isn't what most people go through, which is why it is so amazing to watch. This movie will suck you in, and call upon you to feel what Chris Gardner and his son are going through at every moment. Hopefully, you'll be greatly rewarded. I would recommend for anyone to go and see it!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Smith breathes life into his film in a way few actors have this year, though ultimately this is a predictable pursuit","When a big, likable star goes ""serious,"" it seems that everyone must pay attention. This is the case with ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" (yes, ""Happiness"" with a ""y"") where box office superstar Will Smith ditches the action hero get-up and the comedic angle of ""Hitch"" for a serious turn as a real person. Due mostly to his superstardom and the fact that he hasn't tapped into this kind of role (or at least not recently), Smith is getting early awards attention for his role, as distributor Sony is pulling out all the stops to assure the star his second nod (following his revelatory turn as Muhammad Ali in Michael Mann's engaging but overstuffed 2001 biopic ""Ali""), and Oprah Winfrey has also jumped on board in support of the star.In spite of the movie's insane predictability, Will Smith makes the whole ordeal work. His on-screen charisma and likability add to a performance that shows his entire range as a dramatic actor, which was unknown in his previous roles. He carries the movie from start-to-finish, successfully giving the audience a likable hero to cheer for. It's certainly a powerhouse performance, and he pulls it off convincingly enough for the movie to click. It's really Smith's movie, and he ends up doing a lot with it. While it's not his best role (a title that still goes to his portrayal of Muhammad Ali), it's certainly among the top of his career. As far as effort and skill goes, this is arguably Smith's most ambitious turn to date, and he is in every way the movie's ""MVP."" The decision to cast his son Jaden as Gardner's son in the film was very wise, as the two have perfect chemistry, believably playing out the father-son relationship. Sadly, the rest of the cast is flat, even the usually dependable Thandie Newton, who is annoying and somewhat miscast as Gardner's wife.As was said before, it's Smith's performance that carries the movie, elevating it from average mediocrity and making its flaws less visible. The script gives way to strong material for Smith, but not really for anyone else. To be honest, the rest of the characters seem like the kinds that are just randomly tossed into the film for filler purposes. The film also spends so much time on Gardner's personal conflicts that there's never really much insight on what he had to do to get the job. The audience is supposed to take the Dean Witter big-wigs at their word that Chris is diligent and- more importantly- the best choice for the job, as there is very little time spent on what he must do to earn the job. The musical score is also overly obvious and derivative, and it ends up getting in the way of important scenes. (For example, an inspirational tune plays in the background while Gardner advises his son to ""never let anyone tell him he can't do something"").The one thing that ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" sadly cannot be redeemed for is its constant predictability. Though it has to be expected (if the movie didn't end like about nine out of ten people who will see this movie think it will, there would be no reason for its existence), there isn't a whole lot in the film that cannot be seen coming from a mile away. Though the real Chris Gardner's story is uplifting and inspirational, it- like all such stories- doesn't transfer over to celluloid as well as it sounds when told in the form of a book or a news segment. Granted, it's not as annoying or tedious as other such ""triumph of the human spirit"" films, but anyone who sees the film will pretty much know what to get going in. It helps that it's easy to feel good for Gardner given his reasons for what he does and that he achieves it not only for himself, but for his son. However, that still doesn't change the fact that it seems to load up on the clichés and provide very few surprises, though it still somehow manages to stay likable and appealing in spite of its flaws.For the most part, ""Pursuit of Happiness"" clicks. After it's past the 45-minute mark, it moves quickly and is an appealing, mildly uplifting movie, though the ending is abrupt and it takes a while to really get going. It's being sold as a ""feel-good film,"" and though the movie tries its hardest to depress the audience for the first 105 minutes before lifting its spirits in the last five, it's a safe bet that audiences will walk out feeling good for what Gardner has achieved. Though it's not really anything special, Will Smith does a very nice job, and as such, single-handedly makes it a reasonably good way to spend two hours. Essentially, Smith takes his trademark life and breathes it into the film in a way that few (if any) actors have managed to accomplish this year. For that- if nothing else- ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is worth a look.Review by W. Slinger, written for film site www.boxofficefanatic.com",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Very much uplifting,Unbelievable!!! One of Will Smith's best movies thus far. Jayden plays an amazing role. I definitely think these two where perfect for the roles. It's a must see. Definitely worth $9.00. I gotta say it was a bit long. By the time my clock showed almost two hours I was wondering when Chris Gardner would get taken out of the bad life he had been living. There definitely are a few times when you gotta pull the tissues out. It's very touching and knowing that its a true story makes it even more touching. I saw the film with my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it. He was so glad we had picked that movie.

Nice film!,"Based on a true story, The pursuit of happiness is a film about poverty, family, parenthood and emotion. Starring one of Hollywoods great action stars 'Will Smith' in an unlikely, but very well acted and convincing role.Will plays the part of Chris, and thirty something ""machinery salesman"" with a high IQ and no money. Trying to better himself, Chris applies for an internship as a stock broker in one of Americas premier firms.When his wife leaves him, he's left to take care of himself and his 5 year old son Christopher and with no money, they hit very hard times.Even given it's emotional story line, it somehow manages to be a somewhat light hearted, easy to watch movie. Nothing here is overly complicated and in some ways it does lack a bit of depth. Smith is excellent (as always) and plays a very convincing role. However, the real star of the film is the young debute Jaden Smith. His mannerisms and timing are perfection and we can expect to see much more of him in the future.Comparisons will probably be drawn between this and Erin Brockovich. So, if you liked that, definitely check this out.Not a classic, but a very enjoyable film.If you like my review, join me as a friend at www.myspace.com/texuspete",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

awesome,"The Pursuit of Happiness is about Christopher Gardner, a man who went through many trials and tribulations to be successful. He was born to a mother who spent time in jail and experienced abuse. He did not know who his father was; his mother's abusive boyfriend threw that in his face every chance he got. Chris joined the Navy as an adult and began medical training. He got married and had a son. His wife left him due to financial issues. The experience of having no father allowed Chris to be a good father to his son at all circumstances. After seeing a red Ferrari, he wanted to be a stockbroker. He worked towards that, homeless and all. That shows determination and motivation; to work towards a goal when it seems almost impossible. After being hired by Bearstone's stock company, Chris gradually succeeded as a stockbroker. He later went on to open his own brokerage firm. I think the message to readers is to not give up when things get difficult and that success is worth working hard for. I think the book is a good book for teenagers who want to know where they want to go in life. People who hadn't really been through anything should read this book and realize how fortunate they are. I think this book teaches readers that they are one choice away from being in Chris's former predicament. I like this book because it shows the steps Chris took to become successful. The book didn't just go straight to the success story. I recommend this book to high schools, colleges, and correctional institutions and jails should offer this book as an option because it gives off a good message.",,Anonymous,Biography
Pursuit of Happiness,"I'm not the best movie critic, and generally can find a million things wrong about a movie but ""Pursuit of Happiness"" had to be one of the best films I have seen yet that can mix in light- hearted humor, but also show an intense situation that makes you sob. Near the middle of the movie when they ""go back in time"" and end up sleeping in a ""cave"" (aka run-down subway bathroom) I was bawling. Why did this little boy have to live in poverty? Why did the Chris Gardner have to work so hard yet get no salary? These, and more, questions ran through my mind during that scene on. However, near the end of the movie when he is punching his fist in the air, ""This is what I call 'happyness'"" I looked over at my godfather and he was crying, which really made it even more emotional. It also mixes in humor such as the little Chris' jokes, ""There was a man drowning [...]"" and ""Shelby comin' round the mountain when she comes!"" or my favorite, ""Nobody who? . . . oh! I like that one."" I enjoyed how they showed many parts of his life, ""This part of my life is called; Being Stupid.""Thoroughly this is an all-around 'feel good' movie that inspires you to go and help someone in a situation like that.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"After Ali, comes the Pursuit ...","... of Happiness. And yes the title is deliberately misspelled (you will get it, after you watch the movie).

I just could tell, that it was Will Smith's real life son. And that shouldn't be a bad thing, but it got me out of the movie a few times. Not in one of their best scene though (which plays in subway tunnel).Will Smith himself, said in an EMPIRE (magazine) interview, that he was really fond of the idea of the movie.

I thought the design and shooting was a little bland but this film is set in a big city so not much you can do with the mood.I give this a thumbs up if you are looking for a film to sit and watch with a group of friends or family. But a thumbs down if you want something a bit more arty or challenging plot.,6.0,Anonymous,Biography
great movie,"This is a great movie that has a generous amount of heart and feeling in it. That the movie is based on a true life story only gives it that much more impact. This movie can give you hope that the ""american dream"" can be realized even against such enormous odds as he faced. This is a movie every family should see. It will lift your spirits. Will Smith does a terrific job of acting, maybe his best ever. He should certainly get an Oscar nomination for his performance. The setting takes place in San Francisco and the Bay Area in general. It reminds us that so many of our big cities have sub-par housing for the poor and needy. This movie also makes you realize the tensions families go through to make ends meet in our modern society.

I wanted to stand and cheer for this man!,"It seldom happens that I walk out after seeing a film, inspired by the characters, their tenacity and courage. However once the lights come on after this one, I felt this great power inside of me to make a change. Sometimes we don't really appreciate how lucky some of us everyday that we have a place to sleep, eat and a family to turn to.Chris Gardner was able to make to most of his opportunities and never give up even in the face of losing everything. This man, was not a genius, born with some incredible gift. He is like any one of us. Striving to make the best of himself, giving it a go and always knowing that anything is possible if you try.The film, aptly directed by Gabriele Muccino brazenly tells the story of Chris and his son trying to make a living in the world. Chris is finding it increasingly difficult to pay the rent add to that the costs of childcare and ensuring his son has a good education. His wife (ferocious and heartbreaking played by Thandie Newton) has little strength and hope left in her and has given up hope completely. Despite this, Chris marches on and into a job at Dean Witter. He's a bright guy and applies himself diligently and earnestly. He uses every opportunity he gets to accomplish is goals, practically doing what needs to be done all while keeping his head afloat from poverty. Most of all, he never backs out when things get tough. By example, he teaches us some heartfelt and reliable rules about life.I thought it a little strange that an Italian would direct a film starring a black American about the hardships of living in suburban U.S. However when you watch the film, you realise it could be taking place anywhere in the world. This is a story about the steadfastness of a man trying to cope in a system that has abandoned him, where hope is scarce and precious. It is a story of hope, anywhere in the world. Add the shimmering luscious score by Andrea Guerra, I did feel some resemblance towards the films Il Postino and Cinema Paradiso, but this film never shies away from harsh realities and avoids sentimentalism abundant in those films.1980s San Fransisco and the bay is beautifully showcased by the shimmering waters and azure sky, set against the rolling hills and eclectic mix of Victorian and modern architecture. Seeing the city made me revisit some picturesque scenes in Vertigo where Jimmy Stewart is cruising around on the tail of his mysterious Carlotta.As many reviewers have already noted, the story never panders to blame, pity or politics. What is more inspiring is that Gardner never uses these excuses to stop him from doing what needs to be done. He always carries himself with confidence, integrity, a smile and fighting spirit.While some people may take the simplistic view that money is the be all and end all to happiness, the truth is that in order to live and sustain oneself in a developed society one must play be the rules of work to live. It is also necessary to understand that capitalism is necessary to sustain a wealthy economy. This film shows us the darker side of such a society but how each person can still make their dream if they work hard and have hope.I was deeply affected by the courage of Smith. He has wonderfully evolved since his early days as the skinny homeboy in Fresh Prince proving his versatility and maturity and the transformation is impressive. His character was tremendously brave, bold and inspiring. The qualities that made him a good person, good father were the same ones that told him never to give up. The chemistry with his son was tangible, raw and wondrous. Both of them deserve Academy awards nominations next week. They serve a testament to anyone who needs a chance in life just to live.I loved that quote that Gardner bestowed to his son when it seemed there was little hope in sight. It basically summed what he was trying to achieve in the film. But it was so simple and true that we should all apply it everyday - ""You want something? Go get it. Period."" I'm not an emotional person, but by the end I was cheering like no other AND had tears in my eyes. Truly inspiring.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Movie You Will Love,"The Pursuit of Happiness was a very good movie. The plot was good and clear. The movie had you into it the whole time. It was a very emotional movie but also in a way uplifting. It was a great portrayal of a true story, and it made the viewer feel and really care. The acting was not second rate but good quality, but that is something that should be expected from Will Smith movies. Will Smith's versatility as an actor was especially magnified in this film. He showed another side of his talents that made you feel. Jaden Smith did an amazing job in his role and sort of captured the hearts of the viewers and helped develop the element of love and reality in the movie.

Why not?,"In life, there are certain moments that when you look back on them a smile plays around your lips. For Chris Gardner, looking back at 1981 will bring a smile and a tear.The Pursuit of Happiness stars Will Smith in his most sincere and serious role since 2001's Ali. Here we find Smith as Chris Gardner, an out of luck salesman who is desperately trying to support for his son Christopher, played by his real life son Jaden Smith, and his over worked wife Linda (Thandie Newton).One day while on his way to try and persuade some doctors to buy a portable bone density scanner, Chris runs into a well-to-do stock broker who seems to have it all. The car, the job, and the happiness Chris is searching for. From that moment on, his determination cranks up higher than ever to try and land a job as a stock broker.All the while Linda is slaving at work while trying to deal with their debt and her husbands failing sales career. Fed up with his far out dreams, she needs to get closer to reality by leaving all of this behind and starting a new in New York City, even if it means leaving behind the husband she once loved and the son she can't care for. Chris and Christopher now must fend for themselves against the harshness that is life.Italian director Gabriele Muccino had not directed a movie in the states previous to Happiness. With the help of writer Steve Conrad (The Weather Man), the film was pointed in the right direction. Inspired by a true story, there is no better person to fit the shoes of Chris Gardner than Smith, someone who is not shy on letting his emotions spill out onto the film.First timer Jaden Smith is a blessing for the film. One of the main characters, Jaden had to take on a demanding role, at times emotionally stressful. I'm sure having his papa there was a big help. The two have the perfect on screen chemistry that is intense, memorable, and down to earth. There is a definite bond, for obvious reasons, and it shows on screen.Although the story is one that is not so foreign, it is still uplifting. Like last years Cinderella Man, Happiness takes on the ""underdog"" genre cleverly and passionately. It is a heart melting tale of one man trying to survive in an urban jungle that is just waiting for the cards to fall in his favor for once.Certainly there are a handful a year that aim at pushing this message of ""never give up"" and ""keep on dreaming"". Some just don't quite succeed be it the acting or a weak and over used story. Happiness fits the mold, not breaking it, but certainly filling it to the brim.Happiness works on an emotional level. Smith carries the picture from beginning to end. Never once breaking character or going over the top. You won't find groundbreaking filming techniques, but that's not to say that the film doesn't look nice. The music too goes right along with the story, seemingly bringing out the emotions of the characters.In a world where people can be so cold and so harsh, there are those who survive and thrive amongst us. Not everyone has there life story told on film. Some with the most incredible stories go unnoticed. But there are those that don't and these are the stories that inspire and keep us believing in ourselves. This film, this story, answers the question, ""Why not?""",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A film that justifies fascism and offers to support it,"It (The Pursuit of Happyness) is disgusting for ideological reasons - that the authors of the film show a terrifying system of inequality, where people suffer from poverty as something unchangeable and offer to build into it and play in these rat races, instead of fighting to change such a vile system. It was created by people and people can change it. In many countries, there is no such inequality as in the United States and in Europe, the state helps people, there is free medicine, education, unemployment benefits and generally humanism. In the United States, a terrible predatory system of social Darwinism, where the life of the poor is continuous suffering (this is not the case in European welfare States).And instead of destroying this cruel system to the nines, as do healthy Directors and offer a humane alternative, the authors of this abomination show how the main character is diligently embedded and supports this fascism",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Pursuit of Happiness,"This movie was a really good movie. It really opens up your view of the world, and how sometimes things aren't really as easy as they look. It follows the life of Mr. Gardener and shows the hardships he has to overcome in able to make a better life for him and his child. It is really emotional and great to watch. Your attention will be captured the whole time.

Simply Magnificent,"Without a doubt one of the finest movies I have seen in a long, long time. Partly due to such a story of hope and the struggle of life with which I'm sure many people can relate, but mainly because of the way in which the story was told and acted.Smith is superb in his role, you really do forget about his true status in life, and believe he is the man he is attempting to portray. It's always nice to see an actor who has played many different roles in his career, truly shining in a story which many people will take optimism and encouragement from. The rest of the cast including Smiths son play their part, and it is hard to fault any member for their performance.There is no question about this films potential for award success, Hope, Despair, Humour, Real Life, all told by a truly great movie.Definitely worth seeing more than once.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

an extended version of its trailer,"The Pursuit of Happiness is an extended version of its trailer, which pretty much already tells the against-all-odds story of how a down-and-out salesman (Will Smith) chases after a job that he has no background on while caring for his son (Jaden Smith).Based on the life of Chris Gardner, The Pursuit of Happiness tells of how he overcame every daunting obstacle in his life by sheer perseverance. Despite all the terrible things that just kept happening to him, he never wavered his focus on what mattered most: to be a good father to his son Chris Jr.Gardner wasn't perfect all around, but he showed how he achieved the American dream (hence the repeated references to the Declaration of Independence) by making the best of whatever situation he was in and doggedly pursuing his ambition to have a better life for him and his son. Even in his desperation, he found solace in the Declaration: ""And it was at that time that I thought about Benjamin Franklin. Him saying that we have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And I thought about how he knew to put the 'pursuit' in there, like no one can actually have happiness. We can only pursue it."" One particularly emotionally-charged scene was when father and son were playing ball, and Gardner warns Chris Jr. not to spend too much time with basketball because his son wouldn't be good at it anyway, because he wasn't good at it either. When Chris Jr.'s glee turns into a hurt mope, Gardner realizes his mistake and tells the five-year old, ""You have a dream, you gotta protect it. People can't do something themselves, they wanna tell you that you can't do it. You want something? Go get it. Period. Don't ever let them tell you what you can't do."" It was refreshing to see Smith play something other than his usual romantic lead or wisecracking action star. In Pursuit, he is bravely out of his comfort zone, without humor as a fall back. He does his dramatic scenes convincingly with help from his real-life son (with Jada Pinkett Smith). Smith proves that he is ready to pursue acting for real with the same bulldog determination as his character.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Reality Check for an Ungrateful World,"I read some of the comments that were posted on IMDb sadly enough I do not agree with 100% of the negative comments. I decided to have my own opinion of this movie so me and my college friends went to see the movie. I was upset because of the way that people felt around the world about this movie that was heartfelt and yes heart wrenching; but for way too many people it is a reality. When I was growing up I remember days that we had water and peanut butter and crackers but I was grateful for everything my parents and the Lord provided for us. I was never a depressed person, sad sometimes but who's not. The movie is not about you being happy throughout the whole entire thing, Blood Diamond was a very sad story, and in the end I felt for those who had endured such pain and persecution.In the pursuit of happiness and blood diamond I was not extremely happy or falling over with laughter at the end. But I realized that I live in the state of California and I don't need or want for anything; I'm a college student at an excellent University here. But, watching Blood Diamond opened my eyes to what those HUMAN BEINGS in Sierra Leone endured for years. We should be more concerned about the life lessons in these movies than Will Smith just getting the job at the end. I don't think that is all they wanted you to see or feel and learn in that experience. We should have been happy that a real man wanted to take care of his son and he was trying to provide and protect him from what he could. I feel as though if you didn't leave the movie a little changed, or when you saw a homeless person outside on the street or at a restaurant you didn't think to stop and give them your change, or go into the McDonald's and consider buying a cheeseburger for them to eat. How dare we sit there and critique someone's life story, you never know what people really go through. And if you were sad during that movie, I'm glad you should think about others the next time you leave your home. Because I know I had to console a friend who had to stand in line with her father for a box of food from a church when she was younger; I don't know what that's like and I don't want to know and would never want anyone to experience that. All-in-all I think that you would enjoy the movie The Pursuit of Happiness, those who don't like Will Smith probably enjoy watching Arnold or Sylvester Stallone movies in which you can really understand them. Mr. Smith gave an excellent performance and so did his young son. I think he is a great actor to have portrayed such a character and never come out of his role. The story should be told that you can do whatever you put your mind to and whatever your heart desires you have the will power to do it. I hope that we can all learn from this experience, you never know it could happen to you.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good movie about struggling in life ...,"This is a character-driven movie and it succeeded well. I enjoyed watching Will Smith's character as he faced day to day challenges with grace and humility. Somehow, it was reassuring to see the kind of people that we can be when things get hard.Basically, this is the story about a man whose financial crises and failing marriage finally cause him and his son to face increasing hardships together.Will Smith puts in a great performance. Even while his life is crumbling around him, Smith's character comes across a real. Somehow, he (the character) maintains an upbeat attitude to make money and deal with his son. His son (played by his real son Jaden) also puts in an endearing performance.Like many similarly-themed movies, this film is focused on one part of the character's life. After becoming interested in the characters, I would like to have seen the movie continue onwards past the point that it did. Yet, there's only a limited amount of time to work with in any movie - so that's understandable.If you're interested in a watching a movie about the human-spirit in the face of adversity, this is a good movie to see.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Mawkish, lumbering dross","I viewed this film cold, knowing nothing about it, and left it cold. The tale of Chris Gardner,played by Will Smith, a down on his luck black travelling salesman, making good as a Stockbroker has narrative potential. But Director Gabriele Muccino, whose track record is hitherto with foreign language films, squanders it.I didn't really like Chris Gardner.His pursuit of the stockbroker ""Dream"" is at the expense during the film, of a squalid life for his young son. His wife, played by Thandie Newton,has a horribly underwritten role. her inability to look after their son, at least in the short term, is never clear.His co workers at the stockbrokers are all pretty shallow, and objectionable characters - is this really the dream that he is chasing? The narrative hinges on an ever increasing series of disasters and hurdles which impede his ""pursuit of happiness"". Yet the uplifting element required to counterbalance this in the minds of the audience never really works.At 117 minutes the running time is a good 30 minutes too long. After 90 minutes I found myself saying to myself, ""look he gets the job at the end, can we just finish now?""Essentially episodic in style, there are some good moments, and good characters, but Muccino fails to ""join up the dots"". For a film so dark and downbeat, racism and the cynicism of the financial world gets a super-gloss. The happiness that he finds at the end is a Stockbrokers job which subsequently earns him millions . Wow.A total miss fire. This story should either have been rewritten as a straight comedy - and it could have worked as such, or as a cinema ""verite"" piece, warts and all. It wasn't, so it fails.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Giving this movie one star, only because it makes you sad is not a good reason!","I went into this movie thinking it would be another attempt for Will Smith to show people he is a serious actor. For some reason I have never been able to take him seriously, ever since the fresh prince. Smith portrays his character in such away that you actually believe your watching the event yourself. Will Smith not only deserves a golden globe but an Oscar. Jaden Smith also found triumph in his big screen premier. The film is not only a biography of one person, but a documentary of poverty around the world. This may all seem great but the one thing that truly blew me away was the directors use of metaphor. Life is like a rub-ex cube, you must sacrifice a small piece to evidently reach your goals.

Will Smith chasing happiness...,"""The Pursuit Of Happiness"" is a good based-on-true-story drama. It is the story of Chris Gardner struggling to make a living and literally pursuing happiness. Lead actor Will Smith gives a good performance. The movie succeeds because it never gets cheesy. I was afraid that the movie might be ruined by the last scene being cheesy but the scene is not cheesy at all, very well done.*spoilers to come* ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is about the life of Chris Gardner, an intelligent and hard working man. Despite his intelligence he has to really fight himself through life. This is not a movie on poverty, it is a well-narrated biography but looking for answers to questions like ""What happens to people who are not as intelligent and persistent as Chris Gardner?"" / ""What happens with those who try hard and still fail? Are they unable to reach happiness?"" / ""Can poor people not be happy?"" leads you to disagree with part of the movie's premise.""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is far from being a masterpiece. It is predictable, there are numerous differences between the movie and the real life of Chris Gardner, all of which can be considered to be in a way harmful to the movie's authenticity and, as mentioned before, the concept of happiness represented in the movie might be a bit too simple. These are the negative points one can find. On the other hand you will find many, many positive points, such as the performances of the actors (Will Smith in particular) and the good storytelling, that ultimately outweigh the weak points.Gripping, moving, inspiring drama.

It hides behind a persona that it's a sensitive and touching look at a man's struggle to change his financial circumstances. It really is not. Will Smith is a terrible actor in the sense that he tries too hard to impress that he leaves the audience exactly with that. He's trying too hard. Casting his own son in the film takes it a notch lower. What is it with Hollywood and nepotism these days? Can't they find a good child actor not related to anybody in this movie? Its not that making a film about struggling to make money is bad. Its making a film about struggling to make money and making it look deep and life affirming now that's really bad. While watching this film I kept trying to find an inner meaning other than what was already the shallow plot. There isn't. In my opinion, they should just call a spade a spade. This film is like Wall street minus the sex and drugs. At least Wall street wasn't trying to hide under a veneer of being a ""sensitive"" film. It was brute and shallow and that made it a very powerful film. In the Pursuit of Happyiness it was just merely shallow.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
I will re-watch it once in a while,"The movie is classic 'if u work hard enough, you can achieve your dream' however, the quote itself is definitely deceiving. I'm in middle class, my mom, who is the main financial provider, her business is basically gamble (the risk, not the actual job). So we always have the possibility to loose everything in one day, or not, it happens really quick. Luckily, so far, with all her 'wining' I'm able to live a somewhat peaceful life. The point it, during this peaceful life, I understand how original capital can help you. For example, in the internship part in the movie, for Chris, it's his life job, aka, he needs that to survive, to raise his son, But for someone with enough capital, its only a 'co-op program' , an experience, with such capital behind, they can take the risk of making mistake. Which is extremely important, because people with not enough capital, cannot even afford such mistake. They cannot afford to risk it, because behind them, is their family. It is heart wrenching to watch the movie, because to be fair, it somewhat oppose the idea of 'if u work hard enough you will achieve your dream' since we do not know the scale of 'hard', ""selling"" blood for money, that is not a normal 'hard'working, however, under the society structure today, it is seen as 'we have to what we have to do', no, we should not normalize it, we should not keep setting the bar lower and lower. Sacrificing your health, to survive, this idea itself is conflicted. In overall, I do recommend the movie, but I think I will rewatch it a couple time to find out why it seems a bit wrong.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A self-help film which gets better with each subsequent re-watch.,"The story of Chris Gardner transcends time, nationality, and race.

Child Abuse,"Pursuit of Happiness, The (2006)** (out of 4)Will Smith plays a struggling salesman who puts everything on the line trying to get a better life for his son. OK, I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan of Will Smith but there's no denying that he does a very good job here. I wouldn't say it was worthy of an Oscar nomination but he's still very good. In fact, he's the main reason to watch this film because I felt the rest of the movie falls flat on its ass. The film is a certain type of tearjerker but it's one of those films that I'd call a tearjerker-off. I really didn't like the character Smith played and in fact, I couldn't give a damn if he got his dream job or not. I thought the character was rather mean spirited in several scenes and in all honesty I thought the man was a worthless bum. Strong words? Perhaps but as Joe said, why in the hell didn't he ever get a job? His wife was working double shifts yet he couldn't get a real job to take care of his son? It was nice seeing James Karen of The Return of the Living Dead but the rest of the film is just a blah.",,Anonymous,Biography
Mediocre weepie lifted by a great performance,"Will Smith finally proves that he is capable of carrying a movie with his acting instead of his bravado. While the film itself holds little surprise, Smith is truly a revelation.This is the kind of movie you usually don't really need to see if you've seen the trailer, as it does exactly what it says on the tin and little else. Smith's character, Chris Gardner, is a destitute man working his ass off trying to get a job as a stock broker by doing an unpaid internship, while trying to look after his five year old son. The story is little more than a rewrite of the same old themes of love, persistence, determination and faith in the American dream (the pursuit of happiness). There are times when the film becomes contrived, as problem after predictable problem is dropped is Gardner's lap.In spite of these somewhat obvious flaws, the film succeeds due to a consistently engaging and sometimes deeply moving performance from Will Smith, who inhabits his character completely. There are none of the token Willyisms here either, which was a brave move for all concerned, a move that paid off very well. It's nice to see Smith get his second Oscar nomination, as he fully deserves it for lifting this otherwise mediocre weepie to near greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Money is everything,"I loved it because you can really engross yourself in the film... but also look at it as an outsider. The story acts as a litmus for an atypical couple that get wound up in the emerging American status anxieties. This sort of thing reminds me of my English projects in high school.It also accounts for an economical discussion about taxes versus safety nets.For all those commerce people out there, I'd rate it as economics on an emotional scale. Love economics. i.e. The consequence when the increase in work does not reflect in a greater marginal increase in 'utility'. This movie is a must watch for people like me who do believe in the power of money.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An inspiring albeit grueling cinematic experience,"Will Smith was nominated for an Oscar in his role as Chris Gardner, a struggling medical device salesman in 1980s' San Francisco who one day gets the inspiration to better himself by becoming a stockbroker for Dean Witter Reynolds. Gardner is a real person who years later reaches his dream of fortune through his own investment firm, and even fame as a motivational speaker and philanthropist.It all makes for an inspiring movie albeit a grueling one. Like The Last of the Mohicans, the lead character finds himself seemingly in a constant full runin Chris's case either to catch a bus, put a dime in the parking meter, pick up his son Christopher at day care, meet an appointment, prevent his landlord from evicting him, and so on.When not running at full-tilt boogie, Gardner encounters one major obstacle after another.Sales of his network-marketed portable bone scanner are slow (yet it doesn't stop a hippie chick or an old crazy man from trying to steal it), he's behind on the rent, his wife Linda (Thandie Newton) leaves him, his son's day care center pacifies the kids with daytime TV drivel and sugar treats, friends stiff him on debts they owe, the city impounds his car... and that's in the first five minutes!Seriously, the movie does a fabulous job conveying the frustrations so many well-meaning lower-income people, particularly minorities, face as they try to get ahead. The IRS even attaches his meager bank account for back taxes!And seeing a young man Jay Twistle (Brian Howe) emerge from a streetside beautiful red Ferrari, Gardner asks the man what he does. Stockbroker. He sees his break. He manages to convince Twistle to give him the opportunity to take the training course and become a fulltime stockbroker. Two problems: a) Gardner doesn't get paid for taking the course, and b) only 1 in 20 graduate to become employees.Naturally, due to the extra time needed to study as well as to take care of his son, Gardner falls behind in other areas of life such as selling bone scanners. He's evicted and for a time becomes effectively homeless. A scene in the movie conveys the desperate condition of such people as he and his son fall into a line for The Cecil Williams Glide Community House simply to have a bed and three square meals for that day. ...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A great man's tale,"OK where do I start first.This movie is about the story of how Chris Gardner went through hardships, from being homeless to a successful stock broker who is worth millions today.Will Smith has put some great acting into the film for the part of Chris Gardner. It is a touching tale of how he kept his son beside him, found strength when he has almost nothing else to his name and stood up against all odds that were thrown before him.The movie was good and inspirational, some parts were funny, some parts were heart wrenching. However the movie lacked in telling the story of how Chris Gardner was treated by his step-father, or how because of that he resolved to end the cycle of abuse that was passed down from father to son. If that was added to the film, it would have been more touching and emphasize on the love he had for his child.Other than that, great movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Happiness = Ferraris,"I was disappointed with this one, mainly due the film equating happiness with the pursuit of 'ferrari-esque' wealth and the sacrifices one could make to achieve it. Also, for the time it was set in, nothing was said about the 'black barrier' that Gardner had to break in regards to his goal of becoming a stockbroker, a predominantly white industry. His wife was pretty marginally drawn, and most others were one-dimensional at best.It had that whole inside-joke feel of a wealthy man saying 'hey, i'd like to finance a movie about my life, is will smith available to play me?', but lacking in the charisma or actual humanistic challenges set out in a movie such as 'Ray', where this movie seems to have seeded from. However, if you are a Will Smith fan, it's a nice job from him.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

"The ""one in a million"" dream will never end","Two movies, one topic. I have watched ""The pursuit of happiness"" first and ""Los lunes al sol"" a couple of days later. Both movies have the same rating on IMDb.com and this is frankly not the case. ""The pursuit of happiness"" is a remix of the ""one in a million"" idea: one guy against all odds, facing the worst situation, makes it. I know this is a true story, but the story of *just one* who ""makes it"" (which can be compared to a lottery win - because how *many* people are out there trying?) may lead to the illusion that - as long as you ""want"" - you *can* make it. Sort of ""hang on"" movie. ""Los lunes al sol"" instead shows you what happens to the rest - to the non - Chris Gardeners of this world and is much more realistic. The fact that ""The pursuit of happiness"" was nominated for an Oscar confirms that we are encouraged to watch movies which consider the fate of one, not of manys. Absurd.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
True story about a man driven to survive & keep his son from seeing the harshness that surrounds them,"This movie--based on a true story--concerns a man's struggle to juggle his time, his job, his marriage, his debts, and his aspirations to be a stockbroker. But above and beyond anything else, he wants to be a great father to his 5-year-old son. He wants to be the father that HE never had and always wanted. But, how can one man do all this when he (and his son) are driven from their apartment into the streets and forced to live in public bathrooms and churches? How can he live like this and still keep his son from feeling this trauma too. The answer seems to be imagination, bluffing, and a lot of love.This is a man driven to survive and keep his son from seeing the harshness that surrounds them. While watching this movie, I was reminded of Life is Beautiful in which Guido Orefice tries to make his son think that living in a concentration camp is fun.But here, homelessness and fear replace the concentration camp of LIB. If there is one image of this movie that will remain with me forever, it will be that of Will Smith running, always running against the odds, through the streets of San Francisco.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Beautiful, Inspiring and Touching",I must say that i always thought that Will Smith could act beyond action and comedy. Well as usual... i was right... not to be arrogant. But i have just watched this film and it has truly inspired me. The Pursuit of Happiness taught me the lesson that no matter how far down the well you fall there's always the bucket next to you. Smith's performance in this caused me so much empathy for Gardner that i felt as though a human being just can't endure this and still retain it's sanity and drive. However the TRUE story managed to push through this and cause such a feeling of 'Happyness' that i felt as though my head would explode with joy for this person who had stayed so sturdy throughout this and come through. There is so much more i would love to say about the way this film touched my heart but i just don't have the time If i may give congratulations to Will Smith for performing so Oscar-ably and Mr Gardner himself for enduring all of that strife while holding a metaphorical roof over your young son no matter what.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty good,"Will Smith is one of my favorite actors. Not because I think he is one of the greatest, but every movie he's been in, I've enjoyed, and there's quite a lot of those films. This is the first film I've seen with him where it's not about action; it's all about the drama and reality of one man struggling to survive through a financially tough time.In probably his best performance yet, Will Smith plays Chris Gardner, a truly lovable but flawed man who is trying to get a job at an internship while not receiving any salary and simultaneously trying to keep his son safe. From a house to a motel to a bathroom, Smith evokes emotions I've never seen before, and it is very effective, especially in the scene where he sleeps in a bathroom and silently cries with his son on his lap.The story is also nice; I wasn't absorbed by it but it entertained me throughout its duration. It moved at a steady pace and things constantly happened, holding my interest. What makes it sad is that it's a true story, so this gives it some credibility.Other than that, I hate to say the movie is no more than average. The kid is a nice actor and all but does have an occasional bratty moment that made me want to jump inside the movie and slap the kid upside the head for being so naive. But then again, he is a child and certainly more simplistic than his father who knows the emotional dangers of his situation.So the movie did keep me entertained and I will probably buy it unless I find something better. I liked it and you will too, but it's not something that makes me want to watch it over and over again. 6.9/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
So lengthy and full of nothing,"Great performance by Will Smith for sure.But the movie is just so predictable, long; and shows to you multiple times what you can grasp at once: he is struggling! The end is beautifully acted but it comes more as a liberation than a surprise, as the absence of progression or real character development bores you through the movie.Adding his child to the movie: a marketing coup? The duo works out quite well but the child's acting is limited to sleeping, being patient and nice...The movie is an interesting way to show you the spiral of exclusion or poverty, but the message is not subtle or interesting enough to sparkle your interest. Save two hours!",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Definitely worth watching,"Before i started to watch the movie i couldn't help my self not to look at the ratings. i found out that it was and i guess still is on the box office best list in the current month. Mind you that i had no idea about he nature of the movie when i started to watch it. i thought it was going to be one of those blockbuster hits with no sentimental and educative meaning. Boy was i wrong. the movie is a great example of what a man can do with faith, persistence and guts. the great men of this world weren't always great. they too had to climb there way out of the gutter and into the starlight. the whole movie is about telling man not to give up no matter how hard things seem. and there will be times in your life when you will say to yourself: i can't do this anymore, it's too hard. well take a look at this movie and you will see what hard is. and mind you, this is a true story. this man lives today on this earth.i have a couple of remarks though. for me the movie was too sad at times. just when you think things are going forward things just stop and shift into reverse. the man can't get a break in life. it's just one problem after another.to conclude i would just like to say that i didn't comment on the technical side of the movie because that's not the way i look at movies. ""Oh man, who shot this movie. the cameraman sucks. and what about the sound editing..."" That's not me. i look at the story. The idea behind all the technical stuff. that is what makes a great movie. the production, sound, cast... they're all secondary(not to diminish the quality of the cast or anything). This is a movie about life as we know it. some know it more than others, some less. The main message the movie wants to give is that wherever you are and in whatever position you may find yourself no matter how hard it might seem, Keep fighting for your dream with all your might and don't let anyone tell you different.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great Acting!,"I gave this movie 10/10 based solely on the acting. I though all the actors were exceptional - especially little Jayden (whose talent, sadly, seems to have evaporated now that's he's a young adult). And Thandie Newton, whom I used to regard as a well-below-average actress, was absolutely marvellous in this (though her character was severely under-developed). Will Smith was semi-believable for one -- playing an actual character (as opposed to just being Will Smith, like in most of his movies).As for the movie itself... well, it's a somewhat touching story, and the lead character is likable and charismatic enough to make you want to root for him, but, lets face it, - the story is over-dramatized. It is highly unlikely that something like that would happen in real life.There were several things that weren't explained properly. For example, - why continue renting a two-story house if you're 3 months behind with the rent already? What's wrong with getting an apartment, or even a room in a house with shared facilities, for example? Thousands of families in the US live in conditions that are much worse than Chris's, and many of them are single parents -- some with several children.Why continue selling something that you can clearly see does not sell? What's wrong with getting a job -- any job? At a supermarket, warehouse, or even as a janitor or something; at this point, for Chris, any income would've been better than no income at all.How come someone as smart as Chris ended up in these circumstances to begin with? Plus, I did have a problem with the message of this movie, which clearly is: ""money equates happiness"". Chris's idealization of the wealthy (and his trying to get next to them by sucking up) was a bit disturbing, actually.Well, the message could also be interpreted differently, of course -- ""shoot for the stars, be the best you can be, don't settle for less, etc."", but I didn't really see it that way. Why couldn't he just get a regular job, or even try and start his own *legitimate* business? All that energy spent on trying to sell those useless devices... surely, with his smarts and charisma, he could get any other job or do well as a business-man.But stock broker? It is not exactly something I would call a profession, and it's certainly not something one would refer to as ""honest"" or ""hard"" work -- not sure what reason, other than the obvious one (i.e. money), one could possibly have to aspire to work in a boiler room, making money by ripping off others...Given these arguments, you start to question the integrity and likability of the protagonist. And also - the climax was somewhat disappointing.But anyway... it's definitely an entertaining movie, well-worth seeing. And, like I said, the acting is impeccable.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Will Smith's Pursuit of Happ'y'ness will make Your Cockles Feel Plenty Warm!,"Directed by Gabriele Muccino, the intentionally misspelt The Pursuit of Happiness opens in 1981 as we meet Chris Gardner (Will Smith) barely holding on to normal life as a husband, father and seller of bone-density scanners that few doctors need and fewer can afford. We see from the get-go his devotion to his son Christopher (Jaden Smith) and his shoe-leather perseverance with the scanners; we also see his nit-picking, wife Linda (Thandie Newton), who hangs around just long enough to abandon him for a better life back East. Chris copes as best he can: trying to make the rent, failing to make the rent, moving into a motel, trying and failing to make the rent there.A glimpse of hotshot stockbrokers driving hotshot wheels sparks dreams of capitalist glory that Chris pursues despite every conceivable setback. He schmoozes the suits at Dean Witter with his forthrightness and flair for Rubik's Cube. Chris finally wangles himself a six- month internship as a stockbroker, with a long-shot chance for a job at the end. The catch is that there's no pay. Now he's a solo parent, and his son misses mom and the apartment Chris couldn't pay for, and none of the chirpy suits at Dean Witter realize that brisk, affable Chris is scraping by on nerve and small change. We see him rear his son with a nurturing, steadfast love that sustains them both when they've hit bottom on a bed of toilet paper, even enlisting his son's ingenuous imagination to patch their spirits together. Chris is acting on all fronts - cheerfully boosting his son's morale, while pretending nonchalance with his colleagues.In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats and missed opportunities, all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something. The film is tied together by director Gabriele Muccino's adept direction, which keeps proceedings substantial but never melodramatic as he juggles the disparate story elements with more than enough dexterity. Will Smith gives a selfless performance as Chris Gardner, as he conveys the gradual erosion of a man's self- worth. An actor with almost quantifiable likability, he relinquishes his 'actor-ly' vanity and creates a real, complicated and not always sympathetic figure. He plays Gardener with such wry, resigned matter-of-factness that you can't help but root for him. Unsurprisingly, he has a natural on-screen rapport with Jaden, who is himself absolutely endearing in his role, and their powerful father- son bond is genuinely moving.The Pursuit of Happiness is a go-for-the-gold heart-warmer affirming that anyone can pull himself up by the bootstraps and make something of himself. It's an earnest, modest, heartfelt little ode to paternal love that will warm the cockles of our hearts, and even a recalcitrant Scrooge may sniff back a few salty droplets.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Propaganda for ""The American Dream""","The movie is fairly entertaining and well acted but in my opinion still far from being a great movie. A great movie should have a deeper meaning and a sense of realism, especially if it is said to be based on a true story. The Pursuit of Happiness however is far from realistic and much more of a propaganda for the beloved ""American Dream"". It might partially be a true story but it is a very exceptional one and even though it's of course nicer to watch something like this I personally feel that this movie pretends to be a deep going and biographic movie while actually only being a feel-good flick for the idea that everybody can make it if they try and work hard enough.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

There are some very poignant scenes which every parent who has ever had to protect their child from their own fear and sense of failure would fully understand.I would recommend this film to anyone who feels like life has gotten the better of them.

Wonderful..,"Pursuit of happiness made me cry relentlessly. Because at the time I watched this movie, that was about 3/4 years ago, my situation was very close to that of Chris Gardner. I managed little by little to get out of this hardship since then, things are still so tough out there but anyway this is not the subject. 2 scenes particularly moved me to tears, I don't want to spoil so will not tell but man, how I felt the pain and frustration for Chris and his son! Having lived something near similar, I related so much to the main character. This is a movie about poverty, fight, love, determination. I'm glad they make movies like this, movies that show the truth of life, the reality of what perhaps millions of people endure every single day, at this very moment I'm writing this review: the lack of common basic human resources that allow one to keep going, a minimum of food and shelter for the night! The problem is that even after seeing this movie, those who can rescue the most destitutes may or may not bother doing it. I give the movie a 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Perfect,"I would like to have left this appreciation as the simple summery above 'Perfect' but I know IMDb will want me to right more.But this film was simply perfect. It had everything going for it.A passionate Italian director in the form of Gabriele Muccino.Outstanding casting from the leads down to the minor uncredited roles.Will Smith absolutely nailed the lead roll in this true story of the rags to riches journey of Chris Gardner. Will clearly respected the real life character and working with his own son to make this film made the father son relationship scenes so much more comfortable than they could have been with an unrelated young actor.British actress Thandie Newton also crossed the Anglo American divide on a par with Renée Zellweger to play Christopher's (Chris Gardener Jr's)less than devoted mother very believably.The ending was inevitably as predictable as the Titanic's with a lovely nod to the real life hero of the film at the end, but it is the journey to that ending that this film is all about.This is a feel good film that works at every level. It will inspire many not to give up on their dreams and give those that have already tasted success the opportunity to reflect on the good fortune in their lives.I recommend watching this at the end of a tough day when you want uplifting.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Calculated Hope,"'Pursuit of Happiness' certainly isn't one of the best movies of the year, but it delivers on its promise of being one of the year's best feel-good stories. There's something so genuine about it, that it's nearly impossible not to be won over by its charm and heartbreak. Will Smith delivers a terrific performance, one of his best, and ultimately helps override one looming question: How could one person go through so much?Chris Gardner is a struggling husband doing his best to provide a decent life for his wife and young son. But sometimes, trying just isn't enough. When his wife picks up and walks out of his life, it leaves Chris and five-year-old Christopher alone and without a home. Chris becomes determines to do something with his life, refusing to live a life from paycheck to paycheck. He finds hope in the stock broking business, and soon embarks on an internship that'll test not only his character, but his ability to be a father. Yet through all the hardships, the trials and tribulations, Chris weathers through. He seeks refuge where he can, and not once does he give up as he strives to overcome his obstacles. But the question remains, will it be enough?There's nothing in 'Pursuit' that we haven't seen before, like the sugary-sweet birthday card we get from our grandparents every year. It goes down easy, and for a brief moment makes our day a little better than it was. But there's something about those cards that don't get old, no matter how many times you hear its saccharine message. And so, you understand what 'Happiness' is all about. We've grown up hearing success stories, how someone with nothing became someone with something. For Chris Gardner, I do wonder how much of his story has been embellished. But in the end, does it really matter? If all we're supposed to take away from the film is that, whoever we are, we can make something out of ourselves, should that really matter? No, probably not. And sure, we can focus on how unbelievable it may be that one person suffers so much in a single lifetime, but that'll get us nowhere. We have to accept 'Happiness' for what it is: something that for a brief moment makes our day a little better.Without a doubt, the best thing about the film are the incredible performances it churns out. Not only from Will Smith, but its supporting cast as well. Thandie Newton is back after her Oscar-worthy performance in 2005's 'Crash', and it's great to see her again. Though she doesn't have a great deal of screen time playing Gardner's wife, her talent is certainly felt. Such a wonderful talent, I don't understand why she doesn't receive more attention than she has in the past. One person who shouldn't have to worry about that is Jaden Smith, real-life son of Will Smith who plays Chris Gardner's son in the movie. He brings to the film a sense of innocence, and genuinely becomes the part. It probably didn't hurt having his dad on set everyday to act with, who himself delivers one of the best performances of his career. Will Smith brings life to Gardner's story, and helps give it a sense of reality instead of becoming just another TV-rate production. Perhaps not Oscar-worthy, but very notable.'The Pursuit of Happiness' represents the American Dream, and Italian director Gabriele Muccino takes that idea and runs with it. And does he ever. It's a flawed film with a so-so script, but nonetheless will have moviegoers across the country standing up and applauding. It's a moving story, even if it teeters on the edge of melodrama. It embodies determination and hope, ideals that America was founded on hundreds of years ago. Ideals that still ring true today, and can still go towards crafting a solid movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good.Period.,"I've mentioned in many occasions that sometimes it's good to let yourself go with a film, let yourself carry away by a story even when you know exactly what's going to happen. Well, if you know movies, you'll realize that you know the whole development of ""The pursuit of happiness"" when the film begins. Of course, it's such a touching film that I don't even have to recommend that you let yourself go, because it will come automatically.Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is a fighter who wants the best for his family and tries hard to get it but apparently is not enough. His wife (an overacted Thandie Newton), incapable of dealing with the poverty they're immersed in, leaves him. Chris doesn't make much (in fact he's due with the rent and there are scenes where he just has five dollars in his wallet and he has to run from a taxi driver because he can't pay), wants to keep his son Christopher (Jaden Smith) who goes to a caretaker that has the word ""happyness"" misspelled on a wall. ""It's with an I"", he tells the janitor. Chris deserves a shot like the one he eventually gets.A movie like this one needs to establish familiarities, because it's about family, and probably Gabriele Muccino, whose wonderful ""Ricordati di me"" deals with family, was a wise choice for the job. He shoots the city, accompanying Chris in his endeavors and takes the time to show us iconic characters that will appear from time to time throughout the film; like a bump who thinks a product Chris sells is a time machine, or a couple of hippies who steal this product from him. Muccino also makes sure that we believe the father-son relationship that defines the film, filming the kid with tenderness, as we see a shot of him walking alongside his father, but we see the kid's face and body and only the father's waist and feet.But it would have been the same if Muccino hadn't paid attention to this 'family' issue, because the chemistry between Will Smith and his son is instantaneous, natural and the main reason to watch the movie. Smith, a charismatic, versatile and popular actor, gives here what I can simply define as a winning performance; because he wins as an actor by fulfilling a new challenge, his character wins in the story, and he wins the audience, that is amazed by scenes in which Smith and his son, and no one else, generate magic.Going back to what started this review, I ask: does it matter that ""The pursuit of happiness"" is inspired by a true story? Yes, because it instantly changes the perspective of the viewer, who will deliberate how 'true' the events presented are. I believe that if I'm going to let myself go, a movie has to be fair with me; this means it has to keep things between the limits of reality, and if things happen that are too unreal, there only has to be few of them.""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is unfair to the viewer, because it plays with him by repeating situations that at some point he has to stop believing; or at least that's how I felt. Is it possible that man doesn't find a pen in his own house after his wife has taken everything and has to go to a store around the block to write a number down? Yes, it's possible, but I couldn't find it believable after all the similar extreme situations that the film's main character had been constantly going through before that exact moment.I don't think this is a bad or a regular movie; I think it's a good movie. Period. Could it have been great? I really don't care, because the fact that it's based on a true life story and Smith's performance make it more moving, and because Steve Conrad finds a great help in the narrated parts of his script, that make the repetitive parts of the movie seem less repetitive.Also, I don't doubt the real Chris Gardner went through all these things; maybe it was just too much to include in a two-hour movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best inspirational movie,"Chris Gardner being a broken man he never gave up on life. His wife left him, financially broken, lost the apartment, actually lost almost everything that brings him happiness. But as a courageous man he never ever let the life's challenges to win.
Even though his wife has left him because of his financial instability he never left his son. Such a good father. Normally under such situation the man meets other lady and starts new affair. But he never betrayed his love even though Linda left him. Once Christopher asked Chris ""Did mom leave because of me?"", as a experienced man about the life, Chris gave the most admirable answer I have ever heard, ""Mom left because of mom"". I have never heard such a beautiful definition for quitting a relationship until I watch this wonderful movie!
Chris once said in the interview that ""I'm the type of person if you ask me a question, and I don't know the answer I'm gonna tell you that I don't know. But I bet you what I know how to find the answer and I will find the answer"". I think even that only saying describes him best. Even though he didn't get a salary in the internship he never gave up the chance. Worked hard even without drinking water or hanging down the phone's receiver by the same time he looked after Christopher as best as he can as a good father!This movie actually gives us he best life lessons!.

Nothing Against This Film; Everything Against This Film,"Will Smith may have been good in this film. It may have been effectively made, acted, produced and directed. A well packaged product.

It allows us to leave the theater clucking: ""Yes, if only all those black fathers would do this, they'd be fine, maybe even rich. Its really all their fault.""

Can lift the spirits of a dead man!!,"Watching this movie is like watching a movie on a country achieving independence after a long struggle. A movie that should form a part of the syllabus in schools, colleges, rehabilitation centers, etc. Parents should show this to kids not doing well. During these times of job losses and lacklustre business environment the world has been going through for the 12-24 months now, this movie should be aired everyday! (I'm lucky to be holding on to my job yet :))2 parts like any movies - story and the movie per se. I cannot appreciate the greatness of the life story of Chris Gardener without sounding clichéd and boring. It's a story of perseverance, unfettered killer determination, hope, helplessness, confidence, optimism and love for family. The real story is probably even more depressing and gripping due to the longevity of the tough times Chris Gardener went through. Stories such as this can even lift a dead man's spirits!The movie is just about the story - the story is the hero here. But all credit goes to the director and the actors for not spoiling a legendary story and doing all justice to it.The movie is nothing of short of wonderful and respectful. Respectful for the justice it has done to one of the most inspiring stories the world has ever witnessed. Very powerful screenplay and performances gives the movie the much needed spirit. Both Smiths have given their career best performances. Will Smith's performance can draw you from where you are in to his world and let you go after 2 hrs with refilled sense of optimism, inspiration and confidence.Parts of the movie will make you cry because Gardener cries / suffers, make you smile because he smiles, gets you worried because he's worried and finally ""pursue happiness"" because he does it. Gardener's little facial expressions and changes in body language are worth a million words. The everlasting smile on his face and the positive energy he exudes when he meets people despite the fact that he was sleeping in a public toilet at the railway station the previous night or he was arrested for failure to pay parking tickets teaches one a lot. While it may not mean that he's actually happy or positive or hopeful (and in fact it actually does not mean that as his anxiety and worry about his future and his kid's future is being easily given away by his eyes), it certainly means that he believes in fighting. That last scene where he gets his job takes the cake. Like he says in the movie ""this part, this little part"" deserves standing ovation.The whole movie was something I could relate to though by no means was my experiences anywhere near Gardener's. But the last scene reminded me of similar emotions I went through and similar reactions I had when something similar occurred in my life.One of the handful of movies that had a lasting impact on me. It is not a 2 timer, 10-timer or something. It's a multi timer. It's like a medicine that's got to be taken whenever the going gets tough. Learnt a lot from this movie. To mention a few - ""there is no y (why) in happiness"", ""happyness is something that can only be pursued but not had"".Kudos to the team that made this movie. And salute Mr Gardener.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The Pursuit YES, the Happiness NOT","Will Smith puts forth his best performance since his gut-wrenching portrayal of ""Muhammad Ali"" in Ali and his son, Jaden Smith gives one of best child performances in the past decade but all those things don't mean this is a great picture. The film tells the story of Chris Gardener, a single dad who has had a few too many bills pile up and decides on a career change. He becomes an unpaid intern at a prestigious stock firm and his only source of income is selling microscope machines to doctors and hospitals. During this time he has tax problems, home issues, family separations, and many other things that could plow down the spirit of any human being. The story is entirely predictable and it's just the performances that pull you through.I feel the movie flaws in the fault of the writer, Steve Conrad who has written past misfires The Weather Man and Wrestling Ernest Hemingway. The film is ""inspired by a true story"" and he made it into this unbelievable, downfall after downfall film that features Will Smith running entirely way too often and luck getting worse for no apparent reason. Logically, life does throw you curveballs and coincidences do happen, but come on, the audience isn't stupid. We need a bit more substance than that.Been homeless? Parents struggle immensely raising you? Feel like you're doing good in life and then something comes and knocks you down? If you answered yes, to any of those questions, then you should be touched by this picture. The sequences of Will Smith becoming homeless and watching his spirit collapse with his son sleeping in his arms in a bathroom stall is really heartbreaking. Due to Smith's powerful performance you feel the fear and anxiety right beside him and that daunting wondering of what to do next.The true revelation of the picture comes from Smith's young son Jaden Smith. May be more of the ""cute kid"" factor but I walked out of the theater thinking of him the most. His ""knock knock"" jokes, crying over his Captain America and general enlightenment of his father are the most poignant piece of the film. When the experience of the movie is over you want to know very badly where his son is and what he is doing. Jaden Smith created that for us; that love for little Christopher and wanting to teach him life lessons and make sure he doesn't get plowed by the negativity around him.Italian Director Gabriele Muccino played the film extremely safe with shot to shot dialogue and leaving no room for artistic imagery. But it is a solid effort and I wouldn't hesitate to see his next American film. All in all, The Pursuit of Happiness is a movie that a family could enjoy together and it will make you grateful for what you have but take it all with a grain of salt. This film stretches the mind and not in a good way.Grade: **1/2/****",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Despite being an average film, Will Smith does a very good job and is worth seeing.","Life is not easy for those who are poor and have to fight every day to support their family, pay bills, and eventually improve their lives. This film gives us a pretty good mirror of all the difficulties that a man like that can live: from the ever-imminent bankruptcy, through precarious and poorly paid jobs and ending up in the breakdown of the family, he lives everything we could consider a nightmare.The script is one of the strengths of this film, thanks to a painfully realistic story that will probably make many people see themselves in the characters. There's a bonus here, which is that the film is based on a true story. There are some points that, if we think about it, can raise some pertinent controversy, such as the case of the dispute over the child between father and mother being ""won"" by the father, while the mother only seems to care about herself. Even today, there is a lot of pressure (including from the authorities) for the mother to have the preference in disputes of this type, which does not always work and is highly discriminatory for the parent. The precariousness of work is also addressed here, with the character going through enormous difficulties to get some money from her unhappy and miserable job.Will Smith is the soul and body of this film, in every way. He is more than the protagonist, he carries the film on his back in one of the best dramatic performances of his career. And I feel quite free to say that, since he was never an actor I really liked to see perform. We can debate whether the actor really deserved the Oscar nomination for Best Actor here... but I think that's the only thing up for debate, the rest seems to be consensual. Next to him is his real-life son, Jaden Smith, who doesn't do more than he really has to, but is young enough to really impress us. The rest of the cast is average and doesn't do much for the film, if you look closely.Technically, the film is pretty average. The soundtrack doesn't do much for the film, the sets and costumes are pretty much what we would expect and the filming locations overlook many of San Francisco's most iconic and identifiable locations, so I never remembered that the film was set in this city. . The cinematography is also average.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

This film deserves more attention and more prizes. Jaden Smith is also playing a huge and difficult roll in the movie, and in my opinion is the best acting he ever had in his movies so far, even tho at a young age, playing such an important roll he did great.

Great Performances from Will and Jaden Smith,"While ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" sometimes falls into schmaltzy, over-the-top drama, what really saves it is the acting by Will and Jaden Smith. The film is set in 1981. Chris Gardner (Will Smith) invests all of his money into a stock of portable bone-density scanners, which he hopes to sell to doctors. Unfortunately, these prove very difficult to sell and eventually, his wife becomes fed up with the financial hardships brought on by this hare-brained scheme and leaves him and their young son Christopher (Jaden Smith). Eventually falling to the point of poverty where the father and child have to live on the streets, Chris determined to claw his way out of this hole.Both actors really sell us on the hardships and moments of joy that their characters experience and it's satisfying to see them make their way through countless obstacles. As the movie passes by, you get more involved in it and you will be left cheering when they triumph over adversity. A movie that isn't as good would have added a villain or a rival for Chris Gardner (Will Smith's character) to compete with and this character would predictably have turned around at the very end to help our hero succeed. While this movie isn't perfect it doesn't fall into cheap and obvious trappings such as this. It's also a good film about a strong (and pretty realistic) father and son relationship, complete with all the not so glamorous patches. (Dvd, October 8, 2012)",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

No excuse to mess your life!,"It is really a hard life, and it is the struggling in this hard life makes this movie sense of tensity. Not everyone living in refuge fates to gloom for the whole life. The thing I saw from the film is a tough man, a responsible father and a clever working guy makes his every effort to survive. I kind of sympathize him at first, however after giving another thought, damn it, I was the man who should be sympathized. No matter how hard life he was suffering, how mess situation he experienced, what he is doing is nothing else but keeping going. He is really battling with the time and the life itself. What's more, he cannot only concern himself. Normal guys maybe have already go mad due to the hopeless life, but for Chris he can not lose hope, because he is the hope for his son.The picture described how a man compete with his life, change his fate, and be a real admired man. He gets a little son, fortunately, the little man is not naughty at most time. What I want to say is, for most people who under pressure like him, they are probably irritable. Maybe some of them will give up the life the family even themselves. So it doesn't matter to say you even get a child to take care. Chris makes me memorise another father who gives his son happiness even they are on the edge of death everyday, it's really a great paternal love. Here is a little hint, the movie is made in 1997 Italy.I think the emphasis of this movie is to cheer people up, maybe the director has already predicted the economic recession happening two years later. It's really helpful to hopeless people, to pessimistic individuals to cheer them up. Telling them calm down and carry on.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superb!,"This is a very heart warming movie based on the life of Chris Gardner starring Will Smith. Will Smith has perhaps done the most challenging role of his career and he has done it with finesse and the Oscar nomination is well-deserved. Full credit to Will Smith for a job well done and to the entire team as well including the child actor.I guess I need not describe the story for it should be well-known. Briefly put, it is about a man named Chris Gardner and his battle to fight the crisis in his life to come up on the top. It is the story of his struggle to set his life right.And here is a small address to some of the critics who believe the movie sends out the wrong message. What wrong message? That pursuit of pecuniary independence is the pursuit of happiness? This is utter nonsense. The movie in fact encourages one to fight no matter what and find the happiness they are looking for. And yes, about the importance of money, we all know it is important in the structure of the society that we have created for ourselves. My strong opinion is that it is only the most pessimistic of persons who can ignore all the strong messages in the movie and argue (not discuss) about this ""message"" issue.A must watch for all Smith fans and the ""real-life inspired drama"" genre of movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
inspirational drama,"A sentimental biography drama focusing upon the life of Chris Gardner where he finds life difficult with his family and his job.Will Smith (Independence day) takes up the role and his strong positive portrayal of Gardener was enough to earn him an Oscar nomination. Deserving definitely but this year I believe will go to Forest Whitaker. No disrespect to Smith who was fantastic as Gardner and he definitely captured the true meaning of this film, which was emphasised through the hope and desire of his character.The film is consistent enough with entertainment throughout, the occasional joke making the audience chuckle if nothing more but mainly this film is all about how difficult life is for many people. It's strong; it's passionate and justifies the drama genre.Though Smith has said in interviews he did feel upset when filming particular scenes when juxtaposed with his own son, occasional scenes are hard to grasp and are not presented as strongly as they could be.It is heart-warming on occasions. There is nothing wrong with the story as such, as it's based on the life of Christopher Gardner. Some scenes are hard to comprehend in realistic terms and I was very shocked to find out it was a true story after watching certain scenes believing at the time that it wasn't realistic. It is strong on many occasions, especially the relationship between the characters.Many audiences can use Gardner as an inspirational role model as even when he is down he has the courage and confidence within himself to know that they are going to make it through no matter what.It's a great inspiration for someone like me who can be negative on occasions and to look up to someone like Gardner is great as he is what a negative person would look for in a role model.Smith deserves his Oscar nomination as he does make this film at most acceptable.The plot does lack on many scenes and is not stressed as much as it could do but otherwise the film conforms brilliantly to the drama genre and is a definite watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Predictable feel-good movie,"At the moment I am in a similar situation as the lead character was in this film, so that is why I was interested in this flick. I am about to make a gamble myself and do an internship without pay just to get some work experience under the belt, just like Chris in the film.Chris had it tough, real tough and has Murphy's law against him as well; when everything can go wrong, well... but with perseverance you can get you a long way. I hoped to get some inspiration from this film, but it didn't really happen for me; mainly because the story was a biography and you kinda know how it is going to end. He is going to get lucky and the many people who didn't, are not in the spotlight and won't get an own movie. Maybe a movie should be made about such a person for a change.Anyway, I am happy for Chris and I hope I will one day follow his footsteps and be successful just like him. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Depressing,Depressing wannabe-tearjerker Oscar-bait vehicle for Smith.Full of plot holes you could stick a Dean Witter skyscraper through.Jarring continuity error in the first minute and its downhill from there.Bay Area has millions of people yet Smith always seems to run into the bums with his property. (Trying to avoid spoiler).The closest the screenwriter has been to poor people is when he took a wrong exit off I-10 in his Mercedes.Central casting was asked to send every stereotype in their catalog.And guess what? The much-vaunted kid can't act.The only thing that made me cry was the realization I'd wasted my time.See it at your own peril. Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooring!,2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Inspiration at its best..!!!!,""" Don't ever let someone tell you, you can't do something. Not even me. You got a dream, you got to protect it. People can't do something themselves, they want to tell you you can't do it. You want something, go get it."" this dialogue of chris gardner to his son truly touched my heart. In our real life to we face many disheartened remakes that we cannot do this we cannot do that but its up to us whether we really want to achieve something or not.Pursuit of happiness shows the anger ,courage , desperation of a man to achieve his goal despite of many odds he face he never backs down.His hard work and presence of mind made him achieve which seemed impossible knowing the fact of his poor educational background without any financial support and without any companion.Grab the opportunity that ever comes to your way.His only companion was his 5 year old son christofer who acted in a very mature way by supporting his father despite of being homeless.The dialogue in the film were well written and delivered perfectly by will smith .He really made me clap at the end of the film. A truly inspiring film .Go for Pursuit of happiness.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

He is a sales representative trying to pursue a decent future for his son and wife. The family's economic problems stack day by day which results in his wife leaving him with custody of his son.His life was dreadful already which declines even more as they are abandoned from their home and have to wander around homeless. City shelters happen to be a good day as they have to live in washrooms on an off day. He starts his journey to a better life and while this happens, the father-son bonding shown is wholesome and emotional.He gets an internship in a stock firm where he competes with 20 interns to make the job permanent. The determination in him leads him to get a job and having to pursue things with even more virtue. He ends up becoming the owner of a multimillion-dollar firm.

Brilliant,"This is a must watch for all those people who like good cinema. Will Smith has pulled his best performance ever. He has adapted the character to perfection. After his role in 'ALI' I think he has improved a lot and this movie shows how. The supporting cast have also justified their performances. Its a true story so it has all the flavors of life.

A must watch!,"More than a film it serves as an educational piece for people who fail to recognise the importance of their financial resources, especially those who neglect to express appreciation for their precious privileges.Although, it's hard to blame them as one may not grasp the value of wealth until they have endured hardships regarding the same.Experiencing a depleted bank account, lacking shelter, struggling to provide food for one's family, and being unable to clothe one's children are all circumstances that can shed light on the importance of money and above all creation of wealth.The story effectively portrays these struggles, with Will Smith delivering a performance that feels both genuine and compassionate. Through moments of sorrow and warmth, audiences are presented with valuable lessons to contemplate upon.If only the screenplay maintained its pacing, and gave the supporting cast a bit more material to work upon, I would have been more generous with my final rating.Nevertheless, it's a must watch!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Pursuit of Pointlessness,"Why write a review when there are 551 already written on the same film ? Well, what pushes 550 people to write yet another review on a film that has been publicized everywhere and that everyone knows about ? That would be rather pointless, wouldn't it? And so TPoH is a seriously pointless film; Chris Gardner (Will ""Welcome to Planet Earth"" Smith) is your average college hippy, who has a brilliant idea, gets married, and rather rapidly becomes flat broke on the grounds of his brilliant idea being ""bollocks"", as Blackadders would say; Reduced to misery, and left by his wife to raise his child, Gardner gives his best shot at success by joining a trainee stockbroker program, all the while trying to scrounge a living; The focus of the film is a good 90% on how Gardner tries to appear a clean cut, serious businessman to his clients and bosses while actually being a miserable wretch. Then, through mostly chance, and maybe a very small amount of human talent - of which we all have some - actually lands the job.Then why ?Why make a film about it? This man is not, in any way better than any of us, or even better than any other stockbroker (joke); My guess is that mr Welcome to Earth wanted a platform to win an Oscar with. A sample of the film's dialogue:Random Actor 1 : *long, well written character-building monologue*Chris Gardner : ""Yes sir, Thank you sir""Random Actor 2 : same as aboveChris Gardner : same as above.This mess of a film is two hours of glorification of the supporting actor, and a major fail for Smith, an actor whose career includes such unforgettable films such as Hanckok, I Robot, I Am Legend, and another large bunch of really bad Hollywood stinkers. If only he stuck to comedy, Smith *might* have a claim to being a serious actor, but trying to be a serious actor, he shot himself in the foot...Awesome film to bring your girlfriend to, extremely boring and uninspiring for anyone else, except maybe children, who watching this might want to become a - white, preppy, high class - stockbroker.5/10, for having a script as entertaining as waiting in line at the toll booth.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Inspiring movie but really profound.,"OK so I found out about this movie and decided to watch hoping for a get rich recipe or some unforgettable advice... Wasn't exactly as I thought it would be... The journey of Chris Gardner is so long and filled with drama...This guy was so powerful to pass through this... Will Smith portrays is to convincing.. I found it sad at start then was impressed by him going on, using every bit of thing in his life that he could turn to advantage... If I would have to criticize something, it would be the fact that the movie didn't show enough Chris's life after being accepted into the firm...Some cheerfulness would have been great after all the suffering... For me, this movie was an inspiration because I realized how much I have compared to other people...Yes I know we need to focus on the people that have more than us, but when you see something like this, you realize your life is actually a dream.

"Not a Fan of Drama, But Will Smith is at his Best","The Pursuit of Happyness is the consensus best Will Smith non-action movie, with Will Smith even being nominated for an Oscar. This is a very emotional film supported by the fact that the Gardners are father and son in real life. All actors put 110% effort into making The Pursuit of Happyness one of the best dramas of 2006. The reason I gave it a 6 is because despite the quality of acting, a Biography/Drama combo is not the type I get excited to watch. I can recommend The Pursuit of Happyness to most viewers as it is a highly revered movie and one of Will Smith's best, but it happens to not be my type.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Pursuit of Happiness,"This is an easy film to watch and to understand but at the same time it's so extraordinary you have no idea.

It is one of the most inspiring movies ever which sends a message that we must never quit or disappoint from our live but we have to keep fighting until the end. It doesn't mutter if you are rich or pour but it mutters if you have the strength to keep moving forward and follow your dreams and ambitions.

A very touching story tinged with the greatest themes to convey to the viewers.,"You got a dream?You gotta protect it.People can't do something themselves they wanna tell you you can't do it.If you want something go get it. -Chris GardnerMy experience with this particular movie was a heart-rending one.I decided to watch this with my mother after her recommendation and it turned out to be an emotional roller coaster.The movie is about this man named Chris Gardner who is trying to make ends meet by selling a bone density scanner.However, things are getting harder and harder for his family as it's been a long time since he last sold one.We basically follow his life as he strives to both achieve his dream and stay afloat.what really surprised me was how much I cared for these characters and how emotionally attached I was to them.I would never expect to feel this man so close to my heart and cheer for him throughout the film.After a certain point,I always had to wipe the tears off my eyes while hugging my pillow and being depressed.The soundtrack was not as good as I hoped it would be,given the fact that when a sad scene was coming up they would play a groovy kind of happy song?.. I don't know maybe that is just me.Still,it turned out to be a masterpiece and the best kind of motivation with the messages it was trying to convey to the viewers.To make a long story short, it stresses the importance of pursuing your dream,it makes you think about the meaning and the perception of what happiness really is and leaves you feeling stunned of how conceptual it was.I also loved the relationship between him and his son because it felt really balanced with its ups and downs.I would recommend this to pretty much anyone especially young people like me because you will definitely be inspired to work your way to your goal.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Will smith makes the movie,I saw this movie yesterday and thought it would have been better but it was too kenetic with Will Smith running around catching buses and picking up his kid(more about him later) and trying to get to the shelter it was exhausting to watch. That said He carries the movie and his kid was irritating always complaining it put me off. His wife at the beginning was supportive but turned in to a real bitch! I know this was based on a true story but it's almost hard to believe but hats off to the real Chris. Great Bay area locations esp. the one at the beach alone with the Golden Gate in the background.

A Timeless Film,"Will Smith plays the role of Christopher Gardner, a man living from day to day not knowing where he and his child will live. This role really challenged Smith's ability to act beyond the guns, the explosions and the punchlines that are usually in Smith's movies. All that lies in front of him is a camera and his emotions. You can literally feel the pain that he goes through as you see it in his eyes. Will Smith isn't the only one who deserves credit, his amazingly talented young son Jaden plays Will's son Christopher. Jaden's character is the fuel that lights his father. His maturity goes way beyond his age and you can feel the love that he shares for his father.This movie is absolutely inspiring and should make us appreciate the luxuries that we all have. The movie truly touched me and everyone that I have watched it with, this movie definitely needs to be in your movie collection.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Is it necessary to repeat the same situation ten times just to give the audience an idea of the hard time he had along with his kid? Also the relationship with his wife is weird.

Heartfelt Movie,"First and foremost Will Smith is an amazing actor and also an amazing person. They couldn't have found a better person to play his role. This is such a powerful powerful piece.This is based on a true story and it's so inspiring. Will Smith plays Chris Gardener and Will's son, Jaden Smith play's his son in the movie. I think what made this movie feel so real and made will at his best was that his son in the movie was really his son in reality. You could see the emotions and the character in Will's face. It was so sincere! This movie is about a man who would not give up! No matter what life threw at him, he came, he saw, and he conquered. He was homeless and that's difficult enough but being homeless with a child is way beyond. He does everything he can to make a little money and finally does the unthinkable.This movie is an eye opener and will have you feeling good. Personally, one of the biggest reasons why I love this movie so much is because I was homeless and I had nothing at one point. I saw this movie before I was homeless and during my time of being on the streets I thought about Chris Gardner and how he made it from nothing to something. That helped pushed me to better myself and do something with my life. Like Chris Gardener I went from being poor to working and having a stable income. Unlike Chris I'm not even making nowhere close to what he's making haha.

"Believe it or not, this really happened!","The misfortunes that befall Chris Gardner wouldn't seem out of place in a Victorian melodrama, (he's like Eliza on the ice), if it were not for the fact that they are all true, true in so far as the film is 'inspired by real events' which is a cop-out way of saying 'based on a true story'. Gardner is a classic example of the schmuck who made it, the Little Joe with Big Ambitions who went through every adversity and finally realized those ambitions. His was the ultimate 'rags-to-riches' story and it really happened. Did it happen quite like this? And even if it did, is it a story worth telling? I couldn't help wishing it were all fiction and they would embellish it in some way. There is only so much running around with x-ray machines and studying through the night by torchlight you can take.The film is curiously unsentimental which may not be a bad thing, (better, I suppose, than the usual maudlin tear-jerkers Hollywood turns out), but in refusing to give in to cheap sentimentality it becomes strangely uninvolving. If you go to the movie knowing anything about Gardner you are unlikely to care to much how he makes it through.The blame for that can hardly be laid at Will Smith's door. Smith makes Gardner a very real, very fallible human being, a 'good man' with enough genuine idiosyncrasies that he never comes across as totally likable either. He's the kind of man you might not want to have to sit down and have dinner with. The closest the film comes to being an honest tear-jerker is at the end when Smith's elation is only fractionally removed from a kind of breakdown. It's a wonderfully moving moment, the best in the film, and those few seconds alone were probably enough to give Smith a crack at the Oscar. Otherwise, it's just another 'inspirational' movie, a kind of poor man's ""Kramer versus Kramer"", (wife leaves him; he has to bring up his little boy alone), with too many soaring, up-lifting ballads on the soundtrack.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Movie Review,"Best movie ever. Recommend 100%
In this journey through the struggles and trials that single father, Chris Gardner, has to take, you see the real side of hardwork and integrity. Chris Gardner, played by Will Smith, Is just trying to give his son a good home as he's on the pursuit of happiness. This movie doesn't only show the hard work of a single parent, but it shows that no matter how hard you get pushed down, you should always get up and keep going. I love the strong connection that the father and son roles have in this movie, it seems so real, and that's because it is! The father (Will smith) and son (Jaden Smith) are father and son outside the movie realm too. Actor, Will Smith, shows his true emotional side during this film, as if he was actually going through the situations occurring in the movie. There couldn't have been a better cast picked for this movie, the pain, struggle, love, and hope seem so real as if you're watching a documentary on someone's life. Smith, usually looked at as a comedic actor, shows what he can really do by jerking the tears from the audience's eyes.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A nice movie, but the tip of an unpleasant looking iceberg","This movie is very nice; it's uplifting and makes you feel good. But is that what we need? The problem of homelessness is huge in this country and focusing on one positive story to the exclusion of hundreds of thousands of heartbreaking experiences of misfortune, drug use, bad luck, government disinterest, and general misfortune seems to be misleading. Having been homeless in San Francisco, I know the state of desperation and how unfortunate many people there are.

Inspirational,"For anyone who's ever been told they were not good enough or they couldn't do something, this movie brings new hope to many. In a world where people are constantly told they aren't good enough there finally comes a story that can make you truly believe that you can. Featuring chemistry that only a true father and son can produce, there are moments in this film that will remind them of moments with their own parents no matter their background. For all the great things about this film there are (of course) a few tragic flaws, these are not with acting or premise, and perhaps it can be blamed on watching to many movies, however I found the plot a tad too predictable and some aspects where over done. Definitely recommended by me to anyone who wants to leave the theater with a ""feel good"" attitude. May all your adventures be Excellent, Chris",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Movie Review: The Pursuit Of Happiness,"It is a struggle to sit through two hours watching The Pursuit Of Happiness. The film is painful to watch. The movie aimed a sharp arrow right at your heart and there was nowhere to run. The Pursuit Of Happiness is inspired by the true story of Chris Gardner, a Wall Street legend. In this heartfelt two hours you'll find Chris Gardner pursuing his happiness as he kept running and running from one part of his life to another.""Happiness"" here is spelt with the letter ""Y"" instead of the letter ""I"". Chris Gardner (Will Smith) complains about the spelling of the word that was painted outside a childcare centre where he goes to pick up his 5-year-old son, Christopher (Jaden Smith), in the beginning of the film.Chris Gardner was an unhappy man. He's a salesman for a bone-density scanner that doctors think it as a luxury medical item and thus his poor sales record. Poor sales mean no money and no money means no love. That is how the story goes.Constantly challenged by the lack of security, Chris Gardner remained strong, largely motivated by his sense of responsibility to his son. Linda (Thandie Newton), his wife has chosen to leave him. Without a shelter over his head and without money in his pocket, he made the biggest decision in his life to go on an internship with Dean Witters as a stockbroker. This is his ticket to a place he calls ""Happiness"".To get there though was no walk in the park, Chris Gardner's character was tested on every level. Often he is seen in a state of desperation and despair, but he never gave up on his dreams. He has a talent, and that talent was perseverance while at the same time he was smart. The only problem was that it was uncertain whether he could rise to that potential. The internship program would take six months, and there was no salary. At the end of those six months only one out of the twenty in the program would be hired. Now, what kind of a person would take such a risk? The answer would be a ""Stupid"" person. Stupid is not the same as being silly or being an idiot. To move forward, perhaps it is wise to first acknowledge your stupidity.In any good film, there ought to be a defining moment. When Chris Gardner told off his son while his son was enjoying playing basketball, he reflected and he said this to his son:""Don't ever let somebody tell you you can't do something, not even me all right""""You got a dream you got to protect it. People can't do something themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it.""""You want something, go get it. Period.""Is this movie any good? It's good. Period.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

If i could judge i would vote for will smith's Oscar..but who knows..Enjoy !,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Pursuit of Happiness  or the happiness of pursuit,"(Karthik Narayan)My good friend joked, ""Is it the pursuit of happiness or the happiness of pursuit?"" Well you never know what happiness is... Two songs that come to my mind are: ""It's all about the Money"" by Meja and ""Ka ching"" by Shania Twain. Though both songs have different perspectives, the idea is simple  is money happiness?How can you find happiness in a place that can't even spell it right?  Chris Gardener just opened up my mind to the question of what happiness is. I managed to ask a few people just to get vague answers like  what you like vs. what you get is matched and the result is happiness or otherwise.Is money happiness? Is fame happiness? Is glory happiness? Is being able to match wits with the best minds in the world happiness? Is merit happiness? So many questions with no answers.But then I remember the opening lines of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Douglas Adams) which reads  ""This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.""So in the hope that this movie would help me find the answer, I sat through the troubles of Chris Gardener (Will Smith) and his cute son (his real life son). What I saw was the hardship of poverty; how in spite of not being able to make ends meet, a person can come out and win in life. And most importantly, how society looks so happy when you are not able to even understand what it means to be so.Life is like bending a steel bar. A steel bar is so rigid that you need to exert yourself to try and bend it. Happiness is the result of hard work. When the attempt to bend blends with a positive result, we would become happy. But happiness doesn't end with bending one bar.There is no recipe for happiness. It is not just an emotion  it is the purpose of life. Why do we pursue happiness  to complete our otherwise incomplete life? Why do we live? It is not to wait for death, but to bring joy into the lives of many people including ours.Will Smith continues to impress many of us in this movie. The movie isn't a blockbuster because it was full of violence, abuse, expletives  the theme is simple; the actors are simple. Sans heavy makeup that make them handsome.Will Smith's transition from a cool guy to an actor who can taste and display emotions of normal people is groovy.There are some instances when you don't know whether to laugh or to cry  these provide comic relief from the otherwise serious turn of events in the movie.The message is simple  have dreams, never give up and follow those dreams; you will get to where you want to be.This movie will provide you happiness when you find the DVD and after you are finished watching it, a smile that says it all.How this missed getting into the Top 250 movies of all time is a wonder! More miracles, such good acting went unnoticed at the place where they gave away awards for so called ""Bests"" of the year 2006.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
an American dream told the Italian way,"Nobody could deny this story is heartwarming and deep; it's only too tear jerking, too much looking, feeling and sounding like a Hallmark card. It gets to generate some pathos - on the other hand Gabriele Muccino is one of the best Italian directors - but drifting too much into melodrama. It certainly works, giving a wonderful portrait of fatherhood as well as an authentic manner of dealing with father/son relation. Smith, along with his child, succeeds in delivering an emotional performance, real and believable; someone said ""The pursuit of happiness"" is a nice - but not wonderful - fairy tale in a realistic way and I might agree on this opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

An Inspirational Film That Will Leave You Clapping,"The drama The Pursuit of Happiness is directed by Gabriele Muccino and stars Will Smith, Jaden Smith, and Thandie Newton. The film takes place in 1980 San Francisco.Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is a middle aged man who sells bone density scanners for a living, which does not serve his life style very well. He is smarter than most, and is very good with people. That is why when he sees a man parking his sports car he asks him what his job is. The man just happens to be a stock broker so Gardner decides to apply for an internship program which gives out no pay. When Chris's financial situation gets so bad his girlfriend (Newton) goes to New York to get a better paying job leaving Chris and his son (Jaden Smith) alone and broke. Chris must get the stock broker job to give his son an appropriate lifestyle to grow up in or they will end up homeless and starving...The screenplay for this film by Steve Conrad is very traditional. It is just the usual uplifting story with all its highs and lows. Yes, the characters of Chris Gardner and Chris Jr. are very likable and the type of protagonists an audience loves to root for. But I thought it was cruel how characters such as Chris's girlfriend Linda are portrayed as a villain. She is going through the same situation as Chris and offers to take their son with her to New York but still the writing makes her appear as a villain. The main focus of the film is money and it seems like Chris Gardner will not be satisfied until he lives a luxurious life like those that he works for. On the plus side there are several very funny and enjoyable moments in the film, I will not spoil them for those of you who have not seen it. This is a very predictable film though, but is still enjoyable.Gabriele Muccino's direction was not anything really noteworthy. Again I would have to blame the way Linda is portrayed also on him but compliment him for all the great segments of comedy. In no way did any of the shots make me impressed at any point, like Conrad's screenplay the shot selection is very traditional. Muccino did get very good performances from basically the whole cast of the film, never at one point did I think to myself I can't enjoy this film because of how bad that actor is doing.Speaking of the acting I will start with Will Smith's Oscar nominated performance. I have yet to see the film Ali which he was also nominated for but this is the best that I have ever seen him do. He is extremely likable, as he is in all of his films, but he almost forces the audience to want him to succeed. This film was Jaden Smith's first performance and he made an outstanding debut. Young Smith played the role of an extremely cute kid who just wants a normal life perfectly and supplied much of the comedic relief. Thandie Newton plays the part of the evil girlfriend Linda and plays it very well since she is very unlikable during the film even though she should be very relatable. The rest of the supporting cast does a fine job and keep this uplifting drama going.The score for this film is very good and appropriate. It added another layer to the stress going on in the film or added light heartedness when it was an enjoyable part. Andrea Guerra's score was definitely one of the strongest parts of the film and is another addition to his impressive resume.Overall I give this film a 7/10, it is very traditional and predictable but features some fine performances. This is a good movie and I'm sure that anyone who watches this will enjoy it even though they will think it is corny. This was probably Will Smith's last good movie and hopefully in the future he will be the Will Smith we all know in love instead of trying to get an Oscar so much. Definitely see this if you want to watch and inspirational feel good film, don't see this if you are looking for something original and thought provoking.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The bond between father and son is beautifully depicted, adding a layer of emotional depth that resonates profoundly.Director Gabriele Muccino masterfully captures the rawness of the human spirit, reminding us that even in the face of adversity, grit and perseverance can lead to triumph.

Smith's performance stands out,"The Pursuit of Happiness is an inspiring and motivational movie about the amazing story of Chris Gardner and his journey from rags to riches.Will Smith delivers an amazing performance and has amazing chemistry on screen with his real life son, Jayden Smith. Smith's performance and this chemistry are basically what stand out in what would be without those two things a mediocre melodrama. Which is the movie's flaw. Nothing in the movie stands out. Sure, the story is inspiring but the directing is OK at best and nothing really special happens. A very ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" type of movie, this one just isn't that special.In the end, I will say that I enjoyed The Pursuit of Happiness, mostly because of Will Smith's performance and his on screen chemistry with his son, but that's it, I could watch this movie again sometime in the future, but I don't plan on doing so.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Movie,"This is one of the great movies in recent memory.

There are of course the usual ups and downs including housing, family, etc but the plot and the emotion of this film set it apart from the rest. The movie does a great job of showing hope when most would not even consider the idea. Will Smith displays the emotion of a father that is doing everything he can to provide for his family even though everything continues to go wrong and it would be easy to give up. This is a great moving depicting how you can fight against the odds and win, and in the process win the pursuit of happiness.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Safe and amiable tale that does what it sets out to achieve.,"Well well, after sitting down expecting a sickly sweet tale of hard luck I was surprised to find that I got exactly that, only the sugar here is replaced by a delicate substitute that succeeds with appetising results.Yes there is nothing new here in the formula, the spiral of hard luck gnaws away at the heart strings as Chris Gardner and son hit poverty street and hope there is light at the end of the tunnel. It's a predictable journey, and yes it has the ending that was never really in doubt from the start, but the film is engaging to those who have that little triumph of the will spirit in their make up???, and to me it hits a nerve no matter how many times I have seen it in different guises. Will Smith is very good, very restrained and believable, and I say this only furthers my belief that he is one of the hottest talents around if he is directed by good hands. The rest of the cast flesh out the story with no great gusto or detriment, and the score is poor, but the film works for those seeking a bit of a heart tugger with the punch the air ending.It's a tad overrated here in my opinion, but a very safe sweetly 7/10 for me .Footnote: I don't know who it was who murdered Bridge Over Troubled Water in this, not only is it misplaced in view of the back story to the song, it also detracts from a good sequence in the film...............shoot the scorer",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Smiths save the show...somewhat...,"This is a slight movie with some very good performances, especially by the 2 Smiths. It is somewhat a pity to see the talent of Will Smith poured into his usually very silly action flicks. This movie, while no action flick, is nevertheless one that comes across as a big budget after school special instead of the serious drama it pretends to be. But there is a greater disturbing factor to the Pursuit of Happiness: The idea that happiness is equated with money. I laughed out loud when he sees all the stock brokers walking out of work looking so happy. How stressful is their life in reality? And I suppose some would be happy with their paycheck. Pity that a lot of them get it through conning people and manipulating facts. This is only emphasized further by the very last title screen at the end where again it talks about the heroes net worth. It was frankly an offensive slap in the face to anyone who has had to deal with the complex and trying issues of poverty. Poverty is somewhat made out to be a choice rather than a condition or an oppression, and the truth is it is very complex.And yet there are very moving parts of the human drama, especially through the wonderfully told bonding between the 2 Smith characters. I give it a five for these many moments. An average movie at best with some Oscar worthy performances buried within.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Excellent realist piece of Hollywood,"A touching, if slightly manipulative docudrama based around the financial struggling of one Chris Gardner, this inspirational yarn has just enough integrity to override much self-importance found throughout a somewhat preachy script. While relying on another rags-to-riches scenario to hold interest, what The Pursuit of Happiness does well is balance a grimy realism with Hollywood aspirations of sentimentality so as to wrangle both types of cinema lovers in creating one of the more impressive family films to emerge in a while.Credit producer and star Will Smith for knowing exactly how to play this one. From the sensible employment of Italian filmmaker Gabriele Muccino (who often elevates scene after scene with a greater eye for direction then this American genre is used to seeing), to an instantly appealing soundtrack, right down to his own contribution of his most assured performance to date, Smith is in fine form here. Once again reestablishing his dramatic credit as an actor, the one time rapper and punch line proves he can still carry a film of dramatic weight, and make beneficial choices behind the scenes. The casting of his real son to play his son here, who spends almost as much time on screen as the lead, should have come across as a self indulgent move the likes Hollywood royalty get to wallow in plenty. But just as the script's seemingly cornball leaning somehow plays out with more inherent truth then it should, Smith is able to utilize the precious bond he has with his son to astonishing effect in a way that hardly feels exploitive. Mild cases of overacting do arise, though a certain sincerity based on this real life hardship manages to shine through nearly every clichéd moment.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Will Smith becomes a better actor with each film. Who would have predicted this of the ""Fresh Prince?"" His son also does a great job.One small comment on the casting. I think it is a nice touch that the mom and son in this movie actually have some resemblance. The family has a very real look to it.I have only one negative comment on the whole thing and that is, it could have been 15 mins shorter and lost no content. Hollywood today seems stuck on the principle that longer is better. This is not always the case. I am not exactly sure what I would have cut but then, I am not a professional film editor. I am a film watcher and this film had a slow feeling to it that needed to be adjusted.I strongly recommend seeing this movie, especially if you feel the bird of paradise has taken a dump on your head recently.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Story. Great Acting.,"Inspired by true events, The Pursuit of Happiness follows the story of a struggling salesman (Will Smith), who takes custody of his son after his wife leaves, and tries to work his way up to becoming a stockbroker through internship. Faced with a nearly empty bank account, he must try to care for his son the best he can, and pray that his hard work will pay off, and give him the job that will save his life, all in the pursuit to find happiness. Will Smith has come a long way since The Fresh Prince of Bell-Air. This appears to be his shoot for an Academy Award, and his phenomenal acting is definitely worth an Oscar nomination. The story is very emotionally moving, and truly inspiring, however, at times it is quite depressing and drags a little bit. There is a little humor thrown in here and there, but for the most part, the film is quite serious. The viewer really becomes attached to Smith's character, and the movie makes you root for him to succeed all the way through. Although you could call The Pursuit of Happiness a ""feel-good"" movie, for the most part it is on the depressing side.

The Ultimate Chase,"The Ultimate Chase: The Pursuit of HappinessThe Pursuit of Happiness (2006) revolves around Chris Gardner (Will Smith), who quits his job and invests all his money into ""high tech"" bone density scanners.

After he is evicted from his house, he enters a program to train for a position in a stock broking company, but must go through six months of training without pay with only one intern out of twenty receiving the spot. Chris and his son live in a homeless shelter as he goes through training.Director Gabriele Muccino generated a heartfelt cinematic piece based off a true story. He was able to portray the story of a struggling single father, trying to raise his son in the city. The movie reflects the reality of being a single parent and trying to provide for one's child, while dealing with the stress of competing in a new job market under the added and unforeseeable burden of living in a homeless shelter.I find this movie fascinating and very touching. It is a rags to riches story, but one that required an extreme amount of sacrifice. Chris could have made it through the whole program and at the end lost the position to another contender or allowed his wife to take custody of his son, but he believed he was smart enough and desired it enough to receive the appointment, and in doing so illustrated his love for his son. He was not content to be homeless, he wanted more from life, and he was willing to chase after happiness and the ability to provide for his son.

If you're looking for a film that will touch your heart and teach you about the hardships of life, you should go and see this film.

I didn't go for any reviews nor the ratings regarding the movie, before i watched it. It was recommended by my sister.I was blown away by the performances of WILL SMITH and his junior. Especially that toilet scene, where WILL SMITH gave the best performance of his life time.The pace of the movie was a bit slow, but that didn't prevent me from getting glued to my seat. Everything in the movie was perfect- ACTING, MUSIC, SCREENPLAY, DIRECTION...I was moved a lot by the movie and when the credits started rolling, my eyes were filled with tears and i realized that a movie couldn't get any better than this.For those people who don't shed tears after watching this movie, this is what i gotta tell you-"" YOU ARE NOT FIT TO WATCH A MOVIE """,10.0,Anonymous,Biography

One Man Struggle for a better life,"The Pursuit of Happiness was a beautiful movie with a theme that sold out to the audience showing that one man in pursuit of his happiness regardless of his difficulties in life. There were many lessons to learn from this movie. The word Happiness was spelled incorrectly but there was something special in the word that stood out and so was Chris Gardener. It foretold happiness, joy, and abundance in life. Though Chris complained about the spelling many times, but there was a true meaning behind it. Chris Gardner (Will Smith) was a man of courage who was willing to risk many things in life for a better future. He was not afraid of anything and was willing to face his challenges regardless of the circumstances. His experience in life was a very challenging one. His wife, Linda (Thandie Newton) thought that failure for him was inevitable, but to Chris it was a risk that he was willing to take to make life better for his family. Chris was going through the storm, but he left his fears behind to seek for lasting peace and a better future. He was persistent in every disappointment that he encountered. His wife, Linda hurtful actions and her personal choice did not destroy his hope for his future. It did not sap his energy and rob him of his joy that he would encounter in the future. Being homeless was a price he had to pay so he could fight harder to achieve his goal. The lighting was appropriate when he was hustling on the streets during the day to sell his bone densitometry machines.There were many guilt trips that was place upon him by his landlord for not being able to pay his rent on time, his wife nagging him about not bringing in money and she had to work extended hours for the family to survive, the daycare that did not provide proper scholastic teaching for the children in which he knew, but that was all he could afford. He knew that with much faith one day he would resurrect from that life of poverty and excel in this country. He believed that if he studied hard and work hard he would reap his harvest of plenty. He trusted in his inner being to direct him in making his decisions. He did not allow his wife to keep their son Christopher Gardner (Jaden Smith); she would have to go alone. Where ever Chris was he wanted his son to be there. He was a great example to Christopher and a great father. He loved Christopher and promised that he would not let him down. He protected Christopher in every way he could. He was patient and a very positive father to him. He always had some encouraging words for Christopher. He persevered through his struggles and won. In comparison, to Freedom Writers where one teacher, Ms. Gruwell (Hilary Swank) fought tirelessly to help students from gang trouble community to better themselves by continuing to attend school and avoid the dangers of gang life. Giving them the tool to become college graduates and achieve a career for a better future. There were many great characteristic in Chris that many people can look at him and his achievement to partner their lives on that of Chris to become stronger and more persistent when trying to achieve their goals.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
attitude is the key,"I can honestly say that there are very few better movies in its genre. A pure inspiration. I absolutely loved it. The way this film affects you can't be underestimated. Everybody who believe in good things happen to good people get something for their soul. This is Will Smith's greatest acting by a clear mile. He delivers so well. His powerful emotions and character development are amazing. He nails the role of Chris Gardner, a story of a salesman with ongoing contraries in life to achieve success through determination and attitude. In addition, he has his own son Jaden playing his son in the movie, so it's a natural match.People need those kind of movies. They need something to keep them going. Many people are facing problems like Chris every single day. The movie not only gives inspiration, but it reminds us the most important factors to achieve success which are determination and attitude. The latter, in my opinion, is the key. Once you got it, impossible is nothing. The movie is in my elite list. I highly recommend it to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Happiness Doesn't Elude Goodness,"This film is great because it is so much like real life. If you have never been flat broke, a single parent, trying to work, and still hanging onto the goodness in ones heart, than maybe you can't relate to what this man went thru. I have been there and I know exactly what he went thru and the movie really brought out the human determination while facing hopeless situations. It reminded me of the many times I would tell myself (Don't Give Up!!!)I was impressed with the man who lived this movie and no matter how much Happiness was pursued his goodness never eluded him...Kudos to Will Smith for stepping into character, some of the best acting I have seen!!!

"A beautiful & touching movie about hope, love, survival, fatherhood, and dreams, with a breathtaking performance by Will Smith","Chris (Will Smith): ""Don't ever let somebody tell you you can't do something. Not even me. All right?"" Christopher (Jaden Smith): ""All right"".Chris: ""You got a dream, you gotta protect it. People can't do somethin' themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want somethin', go get it. Period"".I have to confess that I have a big crush on Will Smith, an actor and rapper who I find super sexy, nice, funny, and cool. I've recently bought many of his movies and albums. I am only now discovering, together with my kids, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (Yes, I didn't watch it in the 90s!). So, I bought this movie just because Will is in it. And I was blown away by the movie. The Pursuit of Happiness (yes, with a ""Y"": that's because of a misspelled graffiti on the wall of Christopher's depressing day-care) is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The film is touching, surprising, sad and funny. The Pursuit of Happiness will break your heart and will make you value what you have. But this is not a depressing movie. It is a movie about hope, love, survival, fatherhood, and about never giving up your dreams.The Pursuit of Happiness is based on a true story: the story of Chris Gardner and his struggle for a decent life while keeping his son next to him at all times. The real Chris Gardner was present throughout the shooting and discussed several things with Will and director Gabriele Muccino.Will Smith was nominated for an Oscar for his breathtaking performance of Chris Gardner. That's definitely one of the best performances of Will's career (if not the best), together with his stunning portrayals of Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001) and Dr. Bennet Omalu in Concussion (2015).Chris Gardner first thought that Will was miscast to play him, but his daughter Jacintha told him: ""If Smith can play Muhammad Ali, he can play you!"".Jaden Smith's performance is also amazing. He wasn't cast in the film right away. Director Gabriele Muccino saw some 250 kids and he said that they were all cute and fine. The problem was that Muccino wasn't looking for a cute and fine little boy, but for a little boy who could be real. After a week, Muccino asked Will if his son Jaden could read for him, and, when he did, Muccino was amazed. The love that father and son have for each other in real life can be definitely felt in the movie. Jaden, who portrays a 5 year old Christopher, was 8 years old when the movie was shot and released. The real Christopher (Chris Gardner's son), however, was just a baby at the time of the real events.The best: Will's brilliant performance, the toilet scene, Will's running, Jaden's fresh performance, and the board room scene towards the end of the movie.The worst: nothing. / Antonia Tejeda Barros (Madrid, Spain)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
elates even the irksome!!!,"Just watched this movie a week ago. Hadnt planned to, but my friend insisted that I watch it. So well, having seen the movie, I would say that its a must watch for anyone wanting to achieve something in life, lacking in self-confidence, need an external thrust inorder to get their life in shape, or in short wanting to be the next Gardner.Well, as far as the movie is concerned it simply rocks! Will Smith has more than justified his selection for the portrayal of Mr. Gardner by delivering a stupendous performance. The movie starts with Smith as a nonstarter. He then, adapting to the requirements of the external circumstances, trying to maintain close ties with his wife and child and exhibiting perseverance, crystalizes the fact that nothing is impossible to achieve if the determination is there to achieve it. Gabriele has done a tremendous job as far as directing the movie goes. Its simply awesome guys!!! Some scenes might just tear you apart man!!! In departed you get to hear 'You gotta take it'....but this movie consists of eternal verities.So guys just go and watch the movie...Sure that you ain't gonna get disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The power of the human spirit,"If everything in your life is ""fine,"" you should watch this movie to ensure you stay on track with your efforts, growth, and the pursuit of goals that will eventually lead to happiness. If everything is ""perfect"" for you, it's a good idea to watch this film to remember your own journey ""upward"" or realize that not everything is perfect for everyone, and maybe you could give a talented person, like Chris, the opportunity they need. But if everything is terrible, you're getting by with random jobs, buried in debt, and feel like there's no future or hope left, then it's absolutely essential for you to watch this movie! Life is never easy, that's what life is, but if you try, if you push past doubts and fight through problems for the sake of your loved ones, the right doors will open for you. Gabriele Muccino perfectly proves this with his creation. And I know I was lucky to see The Pursuit of Happyness. After watching a film like this, all I want to say is, ""No matter what happens, I won't give up.""Both Will and Jaden are brilliant, in the heartbreaking scene in the ""cave,"" in the chase for the bus to make it to the shelter, and in the moment of exchanging cash for the last sold densitometer. And the final scene in the brokerage office.Here it is-the unmatched talent of the film's cast, the power of the human spirit, and optimism in its purest form.

Everyone must watch!,"This movie is a gem and classic! Though it did not win any Oscars, not sure why, this movie moves and teaches you more life lessons than thousands of others. The portrayal of Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman by Will Smith is fantastic and probably his best film to date. The portrayal of his son in the movie by Jaden Smith who is in fact Will Smith's own son in real life is cute and endearing.Some of the life lessons from the movie are to appreciate the struggles your parents or countless others even to this day go through to make a better life. It teaches to value things we take for granted and realize how blessed you are. It also teaches you through hard work, grit and determination anything is possible in life. Also teaches you to love and value your family which really is the greatest treasure in life. Aptly titled ""The pursuit of Happyness' it demonstrates that happiness is a fleeting moment, what is promised is the pursuit if one really looks for it but not necessarily the achievement of Happiness.

During the first 3 quarters of the movie you feel a lot of anxiety for the character played by Will Smith because of all the unfortunate events that take place that keep him from being able to become more prosperous, mainly for the sake of his son. It made me think about my own son and of the things I can do to make our lives better thru hard work, perseverance and dedication. There are several uplifting moments where you whole-heartedly are happy for the characters when they're able to overcome the obstacles that have been put in their way.

"Oddly, the message is lost on its star","""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is one of the great movies of the year (perhaps the decade) and a rare product from Hollywood.In theaters Friday, the film presents a male character and father in a positive light. And it shows the virtues of merit--not race-based preferences--in America. It is the story of the high hopes--and achievement of those hopes with hard work--that are only possible in this great country.In a day when men are portrayed as losers and dopes, absentee fathers, and deadbeat sperm-donors who don't care about their kids, Happiness tells us the real story of most American fathers. They love their children and work hard to give them a good life.In this case, it's the real story of Chris Gardner, a down-and-out-on-his-luck bone-scanner salesman who succeeds to become a multi-millionaire, all while raising his young son alone. Gardner's wife, the mother of his two-year-old son (in the movie, he's five), has no faith in him. After bitching and moaning endlessly and trying to kill his dreams, she leaves Gardner to raise his son on virtually no money.Gardner, without a college education, enters an internship for stockbrokers at Dean Witter. But he's paid no money, and must raise his son and succeed in the internship while homeless. The scenes of Gardner living with his son in homeless shelters, subway station bathrooms, and cheap motel rooms are no exaggeration.Most of all, Happiness is the story of the love of a father for his son--in the face of incredible difficulties. Every disaster in the world, every bit of bad luck happens to Gardner. The scanners he sells are stolen or fail to work, and he is arrested for unpaid parking tickets on the night before an important interview, evicted from his apartment, evicted from his cheap motel room.Throughout all of this, it is not just his drive to succeed that motivates him. It is, above all, his love for his son, the custody of whom he refuses to give up. And although Gardner is a Black man, race is never mentioned and never plays a part in the Chris Gardner story.Still, it is important because the Black fathers we see on television are portrayed most often on venues like the Oprah Winfrey show. To Oprah, Black fathers are absentee millionaire NBA players who cheated on their kids mothers and didn't pay child support. She's also portrayed Black fathers largely as extramarital cheaters, gospel singers addicted to porn, spending addicts, married gay men on the ""down low"", and assorted other highly unflattering presentations America is shown daily on her syndicated daytime talk show.The true story of Chris Gardner did not originate on Oprah. It originated on a solid news show that doesn't engage in male-bashing, ABC's ""20/20."" Happiness is the story of hard work. Only one person out of many in the Dean Witter internship gets a permanent job. Gardner was the chosen one.But Gardner did not get a break because of his complexion. He was chosen on merit alone. In the stockbroking business, race-based preferences can't help you sell stocks and make money for the company. Gardner was chosen because -- with his pluck, initiative, and drive -- he sold the most stock and financial packages for Dean Witter. In the movie -- which Gardner says is true to his life (but for the age of his son at the time)--race has nothing to do with it.Sadly, this message is lost on Happiness star, Will Smith. In an interview with Detroit Free Press film critic Terry Lawson, Will Smith says he is upset that Michigan voters voted for Proposal Two, the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, which ends affirmative action in public hiring, contracting, and college admissions. Given his role as Gardner, Smith's psychobabble is jarring: ""As a Black American, I am 100 percent in favor of affirmative action. But Jada (Pinkett Smith, his wife) always talks about the beauty and the pain of the true political process. She believes every paradigm ends in paradox, that the result can be the worst thing and the best thing at the same time.The very thing that sparks one person can break another. For Chris Gardner, defeat only made him work harder and believe in himself more."" But Chris Gardner didn't succeed because he got special treatment for being Black. The company he founded, Gardner Rich & Co., didn't prosper because of race preferences either. He succeeded because of hard work and resulting profits. The movie's script makes the point that equality of result is not guaranteed -- that the Declaration of Independence specifies only the pursuit of happiness as a right, not happiness itself. Gardner succeeded because he was smart, resourceful, hard-working, and dedicated to making a better life for his son.Those should be the only reasons anyone succeeds in America--not the coincidence of birth with a certain skin tone or set of internal plumbing.Smith--of all people--should know this. Hollywood is full of unemployed actor-model/waiters of all races. Those few who make it don't get there because of affirmative action. They made it because they appealed to the audience marketplace on merit and talent alone.Will Smith did not initially succeed because he was ""The Black Prince of Bel Air,"" but because he was the talented ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air.""Debbie Schlussel",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Optimism versus Pessimism,"The beauty of this film is its honesty. This movie is going to play with emotions, you are going to cry and laugh along with the characters. An amazing, realistic father and son scenario is well illustrated. The father (Will Smith) teaches his son about the hardship of life and how to deal with it.
In spite of his, failures, he keeps on, trying again and again, and proves that, there, is no age of, success and it doesn't matter what your background is. We need to learn to live with the realization that we have, we equally need to accept that we have failed in succeeding in the first attempt. For every difficult, we encounter in life there are several solutions. To believe that we are the author of our destiny does not deny and that circumstances may severely restrict us. If we are unhappy with our circumstances, we have the freedom to go and seek out more favorable conditions. We have always at least one other option besides self-pity.
In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story depicted on screen, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story follows the pattern which is common in life This movie shows the constraints that are imposed on us by our environment. It shows that it would be foolhardy to assume that we can overrule these constraints without some sort of consequences.
This movie shows that there is always a two-way interaction between ourselves and the people we relate. A further point to note is that not only can we influence others but we can also influence ourselves. We must have the ability to construct our reality, but that means taking responsibility for the choices we make.
The men of self-fulfillment and contentment lie in our own hands. It takes courage to work towards one's happiness because it means taking the risk of trying new ways and learning more about oneself and one's feelings. It takes determination to preserve on a new way and not giving up at the sight of the first obstacle.
Some Inspiring words from the Movie.
""You got a dream... You got to protect it. People can't do something'
themselves, they want to tell you, you can't do it. If you want
something, go get it.""
Will Smith tells his son, ""Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something -- even me.""",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gut wrenching,"After watching this movie, I sat stunned ,cried and couldn't let go of my 2 yr old son for a long long time. This moving portrayal of a guy sinking into the abyss of poverty will shake everyone, but specially those blessed with little boys. Will Smith illuminated that tenuous line between comfortable middle-class existence and the slip-slide into poverty like few others. People may criticize the lack of focus on race--somewhat justified--but in my opinion it turned out to be the correct decision for preserving the core message of the movie: anyone can descend into poverty at a moment's notice, and only perseverance and a dose of luck can get you out--the latter cannot be underestimated.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a fabulous inspirational story!,My teen son and I were both quite inspired by this story. Will Smith's superb performance should earn him an Oscar nomination. His son Jaden was very good without stealing the show. The screenplay was excellent and all other supporting roles were well-developed and expertly delivered.I will not be able to complain about any of the comparatively minor challenges in my life as long as I can keep this inspirational story in my head and in my heart.

Excellent performances from the Smith's!,"I just came home from watching this movie, and I must say I'm still very touched. I like the fact that this is based on a true story. The fact that you can compare it to the reality of the real world, really gives the movie something special. It's touching, it's real, and yes it do have it's few funny moments.What lead to all that was not only how it was directed, but definitely by the two Smith's - Will Smith and Jaden Smith. This was definitely the best performance from Will Smith I've seen. Together with his real-life son, he really took my breath away, and I have to admit, I did shred some tears, in eventful moments. This movie however also made me very tense. Because it kept running on the clock, meaning paying the bills, taking care of a son, finding a place to stay ... through the whole movie my stomach ache, and no it wasn't because I'd ate something bad - it was because of the tense mood in the movie. That - to me, just shows how excellent the movie really was, and how it really did move me.Will Smith definitely deserves the Oscar, for best acting performance - he really did an OUTSTANDING performance.Too anyone who enjoys movies - go watch this, it really is an outstanding movie, with a real touch.The reason I give it 9/10 is because of the fact, that we did not see that, according to Chris Gardner's own website, he receives a monthly amount of $1000 in pay. (Which in the days that the movie is going on in, was a bit more than today) - It really doesn't catch the completely true story. Otherwise - go watch this!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Major Wake Up Call!,"This is one of my favorite films of the year, Will Smith is nothing less than perfect! The story is about a man (Chris Gardner) who is very much a victim of taxes. He is a family man, with a wife who is fed up with living in such debt, and a five year old son is to young and innocent to know whats going on. Will Smith wins my pick for the best actor award come Oscar season. He gives it all and there isn't a single scene that he could have done better. I rarely see films where i can just sit and watch and get sucked into the film, it was that good! For me as a student, it is a major wake up call! Chris Gardner talks about how he would get an A on a test and wonders how he got where he was, homeless, and doing everything he possibly can to help him and his kid (Jaden Smith Wills REAL son)get through this. The film co-stars Thandie Newton, and she gives a great performance as well. This movie should be seen in schools! Its that important!

Great but slow,This movie was so fantastic and it was so painful to watch at the same time. Because The Pursuit of Happiness is based on a true story I found myself struggling to watch it. I knew that someone actually went through everything I was watching and it wasn't just entertainment. Actually I would call it the opposite of entertainment. The movie was very slow and took a long time to get to a point. Will Smith's character shows so much drive and motivation and I wonder why I can't be more like that day to day. It was really amazing to consider how hard he worked to provide for his family. The acting was great and the story was great. At the end of the movie it all comes together and it makes the rest of the movie worthwhile. I have very mixed feelings about this one so just go see it for yourself and make your own judgment.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sure to become a Classic for the Millennium,"I didn't choose to see this movie. I was going to see a sneak preview of ""Dreamgirls,"" (which I had been eagerly looking forward to for weeks) but was turned away because so many other people were there to see it too. As consolation, the theater management let me into a sneak preview of ""Pursuit of Happiness."" I went in utterly unprepared for the emotional ride I was about to take, not having seen a trailer or any early reviews. Needless to say, this movie totally made me forget my disappointment! Everyone around me was crying shamelessly -- myself included. I left the theater convinced I had just seen this century's equivalent of ""It's a Wonderful Life."" It's that great!Excerpts can't convey the full impact of what happened to this man. You really have to see the movie all the way through to get the cumulative effect of one hit of bad luck after another. When you're already down and desperately struggling to hang on it doesn't take much to push you off the ledge. The movie was utterly convincing in its depiction of what it must be like to spiral down into homelessness -- and the number of paths that can take a person there, over and above the usual stereotypes. (I understand they used actual homeless people as extras and it showed. You can't ""act"" that look).Some have complained that the movie was too long, or too repetitive, with not much going on in the middle. I would contend that this was a deliberate attempt to convey what it's like to be caught in a Sisyphean routine of hoping to get through day after day of not much hope. I thought the setting was used really well to show this -- San Francisco is a gorgeous city, but Chris (and the camera) barely has time to notice, because he is too busy just trying to get from one place to another.I've never been a huge Will Smith fan before now but the gamut of emotions he conveyed in this movie without uttering a word was just brilliant. His kid is adorable -- and an astonishingly fine actor. Thandie Newton as his wife was the one weak note -- she came across as more of a shrew than a woman who was once a loving partner but now just exhausted and worn down.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the only films in recent years to have a true heart pounding in the center of it,"Will Smith has proved himself over the years not only to be an undeniable tour de force at the box office, but also a multi-talented mega-star. After excelling in almost every possible genre (Action, Comedy, Animation, Sci-Fi, Romance, etc.), his 2006 mega-hit propelled him to yet another cinematic height  pure old fashioned dramatic acting.In Pursuit of Happiness, Smith portrays Chris Gardner, a single parent with no formal education, who decides to beat the odds and make it big in the world of stock broking  despite (and perhaps even in light) of all the objective facts being against him. One of the only films in recent years to have a true heart pounding in the center of it, the film plays out as an unfolding prayer for the Capitalistic and liberal manner through which the American society evolves. Through that, it also carries one of the sharpest and truthful messages i've ever seen at the cinema  the notion that each and every one of us holds the potential to make it big, even huge, in life, if we only put our honest talents to the task.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A few things aside, a pretty good movie!","It's getting to be general knowledge that The Pursuit of Happiness is one of Will Smith's best performances, if not his best of all. Walking into the theatre, I was skeptical. I knew he was up for that Golden Globe nomination, but still I was skeptical. I knew he had some skills, but I didn't know he could bring the emotion out like that! Sometimes the dialogue, especially between Will Smith and Thandie Newton, who plays his wife, Linda, was strained and slightly unbelievable, I have to admit. In fact, I hate to admit it because I liked this movie so much..but just thought I'd warn you.The Pursuit of Happiness is a cute little movie centering on Chris Gardner, a salesman in the early 80's selling bone scanners. As his sales slow down significantly, he finds himself in huge financial trouble, struggling to live day by day. Trying to take care of his son, also named Chris (played adorably by Smith's real-life son, Jaden) by himself is tough, especially while being an intern for a potential high-paying job he may or may not get. The movie is one of those tearjerker-yet-heartwarming movies that I tend to hate, yet this one was so well acted by both Smiths, I couldn't give it a bad review! All in all, this was a cute little film that I enjoyed very much. If you want to laugh a little, maybe cry a little, or just see Will Smith stretch from his usual groove, then The Pursuit of Happiness (yes, with a y!) is a must-see!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Rages to riches story a winner,"Honestly, I only saw this movie due to being out on a date, really wanted to go see ""Night at the Museum"", however, am now glad that I saw this excellent movie, upon investigation I have found why it so clearly states that the movie is ""Based"" on a true story, reading up on Chris Gardner I find much of the movie has been designed to make the character much more appealing than possibly Mr Gardner may have been in real life, and thats not a spoiler, the movie has been made well and I would encourage anyone to see it, very glad I did, it was inspiring and I found my eyes moistening up on more than one occasion. Go see this movie if your going on a date. 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Top level stuff.,"This is a spoiler free review, just because this is the type of film you should go into without any knowledge if you can help it. Because you want to get the biggest bang for your buck. 
This film is like a warm hug from your grandma. But best of all, it is based on a true story. 
Note to self: read the book it is based off of.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The American political system has a lot to answer for.,"Contrary to the reviews I have already read, I really did not know what to make of this film based on a true story, although I do believe that Will Smith's performance was superb.The Pursuit of happiness played against a background of modern, free enterprise America, yet there are soup kitchens and clear signs of other deprivation, I believe I caught a glimps of a man lying on the streets, and people were litrally walking past him.In my view, the soup kitchens, the homelessness, the deprivation across the USA, and the apathy that supports it, are the real story here, and as such need addressing through the American media, but are they being addressed ?????????.Modern America is the archetype of how ""not"" to run a country, because people have a ""right"" to a decent reasonably paid job, and affordable housing, yet the underclass shown in this film courtesy of Will Smith's travels are being deprived of their human rights.I can understand the Hollywood moguls wanting to make a film about people who strive against the odds to better their lives, because Hollywood are part of the so-called American dream, yet in the 20's, 30's, and 40's, Hollywood itself treated those who worked in it, like virtual slaves, because they wanted to sell a product for their American audiences, who were, and still are, trying to achieve their own American dream.Whilst I do take my hat off to the real life character played by Will Smith, and what this guy achieved in real life, this man was clearly an exception to the rule.Most people in free market America, as here in England due to the same marked based system, live in fear of losing their jobs, their homes, their very livelyhoods, because these are all the downside of a low tax economy free market culture.I found ""The pursuit of Happiness"" depressing, but I kept with it so I could write this honest review.I am not giving this film 10 stars. I am giving Will Smith's gripping performance 10 stars.And I pour shame on America who have the Statue of Liberty as their hallmark of ""Liberty"".Because frankly there is no liberty, or human rights in America, people can have it all one moment, then lose everything the next.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
BASED on a true story is correct.,"Once I found out the true story of Chris's life the film isn't the same. He assaulted his ex wife. He sold drugs on the side to make ends meet. He & his son only spent 2 nights sleeping in toilets. He didn't even know where his son was living most of the time. He spent a few weeks in jail for unpaid parking tickets. So his son didn't spent all that time living in toilets as made out in the film, yet people watch it & just believe it. If I hadn't found out the truth about Chris I wouldnt've have minded the film but I couldn't watch the film again knowing it was full of lies. Making his son sleep in the toilets with him to make it more hard hitting. Not for me.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

Happiness with a Y,"While a pivotal scene regarding the misspelling of the word ""happiness"" might have been cut (according to IMDb's trivia section), the significance of the misspelling was not completely lost. The fact that the Chinese-run daycare misspelled the word contains meaning enough. Many people come from all over the world to pursue happiness, and of course many of those people, especially those whose languages don't even contain alphabets, spell ""happiness"" incorrectly. I thought it was a nicely placed symbol.I loved the movie, and it is not just because I lived in SF for fifteen years and drove a Yellow cab for two and sang in the choir of Glide Memorial Church where Chris Gardner was and is a member, but because the story was very well performed and presented. I cried every time Will Smith cried. I felt as though I was there.I too was once homeless - when I was in high school - and I know exactly what that feeling of moving forward despite everything feels like.Now, I am a Big Brothers Big Sisters volunteer. This afternoon I brought my Little to the movie. I hope she could fathom the significance of the message - that with drive, perseverance and a keen understanding and exploitation of one's natural attributes can you not only pursue happiness, but actually wholeheartedly embrace it.Anyhootle, despite any missteps in continuity or time/date issues, the movie was a delight.Andrea Kittelson",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Pursuit of Excellence,"I have always been a big fan of Will Smith, and consequently, I have always felt that he doesn't quite get the recognition he deserves. His role as Chris Gardner in The Pursuit of Happiness proves that Will Smith is just another action star or rapper. He has now become what I always knew he would--an actor.The Pursuit of Happiness is based on a true story. It follows the life of Chris Gardner, a man who struggles to raise his young son during economic hardship after his wife has just left them. Gardner does his best to work his way up the job ladder as he pursues a job as a stock broker. Through the ups and downs of this pursuit and the heartwarming father-son relationship between Gardner and his son, the viewer will undoubtedly fall in love with the characters and with the film as a whole.As of this date, Will Smith has been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Hopefully the Academy won't make the same mistake the Golden Globes did and they will actually hand the award to Smith. In fact, I feel that this film has been robbed by critics and actually deserves to be nominated for Best Director (Gabriele Muccino), Best Screenplay (Steven Conrad), Best Supporting Actor (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith), and Best Cinematography (Phedon Papamichael). But since I can't change the Academy, I'll cross my fingers and hope they at least give the Oscar to Mr. Smith.In conclusion, please see this movie. You will not be disappointed because Will Smith will have you on the verge of tears and laughter all at the same time. If you ask me, a 7.4 rating is ridiculous. This movie is truly excellent.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
we treat our homeless cruelly,"If you aren't totally familiar with the state of poverty and homelessness in America, then ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" will not only show you but shock you. It tells the true story of San Francisco scanner salesman Chris Gardner (Will Smith), who set about trying to get a job as an intern in a stock broker firm in the hopes of trying to show his son Christopher a better life.What struck me more than the main story itself was what the misery that Chris and Christopher experience. They get evicted from one place after another and when they get to stay in a shelter, they have to listen to a preachy choir. All this and Reagan remained mired in optimism.Is this a perfect movie? No, far from it. Large portions get kind of treacly, and it often seems like Chris and Christopher are a little too lucky. But overall, I thought that the movie did a good job showing how they know that they have to keep going even in the most desperate and difficult conditions. I recommend it.Also starring Thandie Newton, James Karen (you've probably seen him in something) and Dan Castellaneta (that's right: Homer Simpson's voice artist!).",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the greatest films I've ever seen...period.,"This movie is nothing short of phenomenal. It mercilessly swings your emotions from scene to scene and leaves your heart pulsating more so than any suspense film. Will Smith delivers an amazing performance that guarantees him an Oscar victory sometime in the near future. I would also like to see more of Jaden as I thought he was absolutely adorable. 2006 was a year full of garbage until the last 3 months of the year. This movie came out right in time for the holidays which couldn't possibly have been a better time. It's a great ultimately uplifting film with a strong positive message and provides a great opportunity for you to see it with the whole family. Trust me, you don't want to miss this one!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An amazing character performance by Will Smith...,"Be warned: this movie is not for people suffering from the following incurable conditions: emotional instability/weakness/insecurity; and teenagers suffering from unusually extreme hormonal cycles.SummaryChris Gardner (Will Smith) struggles to keep his and his son's lives together as the world around them begins to crumble. Money AND wife troubles at the same time? who could survive under such treacherous conditions? Based on a true story, Chris tackles constant financial debts and marriage problems whilst desperately holding on to his beloved son Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith). He enlists unlikely (and indeed risky at times) methods/career paths as his fight for stability and comfort continues into deeper, more difficult territory...PositivesAn amazing acting performance by Will Smith - certainly an Oscar candidate. The depth to which Will is able to lend to Chris's character is outstanding, if depressing at times. Christopher - the son, is excellent and acts like he was born for the role.NegativesMore could have been done to lift the spirits in this movie - a lot more! And NOT at the expense of audience satisfaction, time or indeed at the expense of the ultimate purpose of the story - 'adversity through poverty' or 'rags to riches' etc. Indeed, the reality of the story upon which this film is based would have reasonably expected it. In my opinion, 5-10 more minutes of such content (spoiler avoidance) and this movie would have been lifted into 'greatest of the decade' territory. Shame.All in all - excellent...",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Well made, great story","I didn't think Hollywood was capable of showing Capitalism in a positive light. This movie and story is inspiring, motivational, and actually believable. To me, the message was that a man with enough hope, a positive outlook, and determination can accomplish absolutely anything.What I have come to expect of the entertainment industry in America is the message that that everyone needs a helping hand, socialism is good, and nobody is capable of succeeding alone. It's true that we need each other in life, but the message in this movie is that YOU are responsible for yourself. You can succeed if you try hard enough. This is a capitalist's story. There is nothing wrong with making money. Happiness is not an entitlement, but everyone is free to pursue it.The chemistry between Will Smith and his child is completely obvious, and Will Smith really turns in his best performance IMO. The acting and on-screen chemistry is what upgrades this movie from a TV Family movie special into a true world class production.This movie is stressful to watch, but is very rewarding. Personally, I recommend it highly!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Will Smith plays it straight and breaks your heart doing it.,"I saw this film yesterday.I loved it.I have been a Will Smith fan since ""Parents just don't understand"".Jaden was so cute and he did a wonderful job for his first acting gig.The film makes you realize we are all one paycheck from being where he was.Will did so much running I was worn out when it was over.The pace he kept made you stay with him and feel his adrenaline as it rose from scene to scene. I will not be surprised if he receives an academy award nomination for this film.When I saw ""Ali"" I thought he was great in it but I thought they never showed Ali's funny side which Will could have captured with no problem.I remember Ali right from his beginning his sense of humor was as much a part of who he was as his ability in the ring.Will had the good looks and God knows he perfected his body but lacked the humor.This film showed his humanity.It made you think that could you be me.I could lose my job,my home.I could be on the street.Will Smith is pushing 40 and I think his best performances are in front of him.I think he's only scratched the surface of who he can be on film.I'm looking forward to his next film.I say see this film and thank God you have a roof over your head.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The Little Engine That Could, But Sappier","A single dad down on his luck? Check. A mute little boy who's his shining light in the darkness? Check.

Oscar worthy performances,"Will Smith provides us with an Oscar worth performance of a man who goes from trying to find his niche to having no niche to rising above all obstacles when the stakes become his son. He makes the emotional transition of a happy family man worried about a failing investment to the man who lost wife, income and apartment almost overnight and must, despite the odds against him, persevere to provide for his young trusting son in a dignified and honest manner despite the obstacles the fall before him along the way.

perspective on life.,"I'm going through a bit of hard stage in my career at the moment, before Christmas, i felt my work life had never been any where near this hard ever. One of the directors in my company said to me ""get through this and you'll be laughing for the rest of your career, it doesn't get any harder than this""Chances are he's right, but watching this film put my life in perspective, and that i very much doubt things will ever be as hard for me as they were for Chris, and the key to success is not losing your cool and keeping it together for the sake of yourself and your family.I recommend this movie to any one who is struggling with possibly any part of their life, as it shows you just how you need to be to get through it!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good to watch with Family,"I'm a avid movie watcher and I would say this is one of the best movies I've watched this year among a 50-100 movies I have watched this year. The main reason for my appreciations are (i) An excellent acting: Will Smith has not just acted but he became the real Chris gardener, just like a commoner you see on the road. (ii) An inspiring story: I'm a person who likes movies based on true stories more than fictional stories. Movies should have an impact on the society and it has had in the history of human kind. This movie really does that job.There are two or three quotes worth remembering in our life from this movie, like ""If you need something, go get it period"". This conveys a lot of meaning more than the words within the quotes.Overall, it's a must to watch a movie in this holiday season.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Strong performances make for an inspiring film,"The Pursuit of Happiness is the true story of a man named Chris Gardner who was left alone to raise his son under difficult circumstances. Will Smith delivers probably the strongest performance of his entire career in this film. Most of the actors and actresses, including Thandie Newton and Smiths' son Jaden, are strong in the film. Stronger than the performances is the message. The film stresses that we must dream high and achieve. It's the same thought that made the real Chris Gardner a billionaire today. It's an inspirational and emotional film that I highly recommend for the entire family. Will Smith's performance is nothing short of Oscar worthy in this heartwarming film.The Pursuit of Happiness - ***1/2 out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
