Will Keep You Debating On What Is Truly Right,"I had wanted to see this movie for sometime now. I have finally gotten to see it and can tell you it is no disappointment. This movie had a particular touch that gave a genuine and authentic feeling to it. Ben Affleck has a way of writing about life on the streets in Boston that just grabs you. Good Will Hunting was a fine example of that but Gone Baby Gone displayed his directing abilities as well. This movie appeared that it could fall apart any second but yet the story held up and managed to get its message out. Ben Affleck seems to be very creative and knows how to get your attention right when he want you to.I had not expected Casey Affleck to play as well either because there were so many compliments made toward his performance I expected something totally different. Yet he also brought this authenticity in his acting like Ben did in his directing. Youn could just see the look in his eyes that he was totally into it, he was it. He gave a great portrayal of a detective that should have earned him an Oscar nomination. Also a great supporting cast was put in place with Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris and Amy Ryan. All of them gave engaging performances as well. Amy Ryan especially with her performance as the mother of her girl who is the centerpiece of this story. I believe if it was not for her this movie could have very easily fallen into an ordinary movie.What really made up the movie was the message. After all what is a movie without a message. This movie did not try to pretend to be deep or try to impress. It did what it had to do, asking the a very tough question. Is the right thing to do always the right decision to make and do the ends justify the means? I advise you not to miss this movie and definitely watch this with a friend or family member.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Baby Great,"When I went into the theater to see Gone Baby Gone, Casey Affleck was not what I pictured when I read Dennis Lehane's Patrick Kenzie novels. But he won me over and will now forever be Kenzie as far as I'm concerned.Gone Baby Gone is a tough and gritty movie about a child abduction and the lives it destroys. You can see the end coming a little too early in the movie, but it's still fascinating watching Kenzie slog through a lot of awful stuff before you get there. Ben Affleck has proved that he can direct a movie with the best of them. There was nothing slack or boring for the entire running time, and the ending will give you something to argue about over dinner after watching the movie.The best detective movie I've seen in a while.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"WOW, Better than I expected","Anytime a movie can get you to pause and consider a moral dilemma (what would I have done?) while watching it definitely deserves a high mark in my book!! This movie showed the very raw, mean streets of Boston's underbelly and didn't sugar-coat anything. I liked that it was real and not made all pretty for film as in so many other films of late. I have/will recommend this movie to all my friends. Kudos to Casey Affleck, Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris. This was, so far, the best movie I've seen in 2007. I haven't been impressed with Ben Affleck in front of the camera, but maybe he's found his niche - behind the camera? Just go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
When Keeping It Real Goes Right,"I would consider myself to be a movie buff and I live and grew up in Massachusetts. I must tell you that Ben Affleck has done an outstanding job in his directorial debut. In casting his brother Casey you may think that it's just nepotism or giving his brother a break. No. He is the absolute perfect person to play this role. Because they know the area they have made one of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. And it's not just some Boston movie either. I heard a woman as I was leaving saying it's just like The Departed. No it's not, it's much better and the fact is, I loved The Departed. But that was flashier. As great as it was you could tell people were acting. Not here. They seemed exactly like the degenerates and handful of decent folk I see every day of my life. The woman who plays the girl's mother, I don't know who see is, but I've met her about 1000 times.As far as the story goes I'd never spoil it for you but it's complex, not confusing. There is a lot going on and it's so real. I don't know what's happened in this area but people have become so lousy. So lousy that if you're a good person you just don't know what can be done anymore. There seems to be no answer sometimes and this film is set in that world. If you have the brains and heart to try you don't even know what will come of it.Who should see this? Intelligent people. People who want to come out of a movie thinking about what they just saw. People who want to see an incredibly well made film. And anyone who ever liked Ben Affleck even for half a second. He should be very proud of this movie. As far as content there are loads of curse words, some drug use, but no nudity that I can remember, and there is some gun violence, but nothing too bad. Put it high on your movie going list.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"See it before it's gone, baby, gone!","Ben Affleck's impressive directorial debut features some remarkably naturalistic performances, a genuine sense of locale, and an atmosphere of despair and hopelessness that becomes a major antagonist. An honestly downbeat film, it portrays a mode of existence where nothing is black or white, and it is that gray area that the film explores so effectively even if I find the story from Dennis Leheane's novel to be a bit far-fetched and convoluted. More than The Departed, Mystic River, and Peter Yates' The Friends of Eddie Coyle, Gone, Baby, Gone understands the inter-relationship among cops, criminals, and a neighborhood as they search for a missing child. Though the boyish Casey Affleck is arguably miscast as Patrick, a character who was more mature in the novel, his performance cannot be faulted and by the end he has won us over. The last scene is particularly resonant. Though well-known actors such as Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are expectedly good, it is the performances of an unknown supporting cast that gives the film a disturbing authenticity. And Amy Ryan as the child's mother gives a trenchant performance. Director Affleck maintains an admirable tone of objectivity and compassion throughout, and he has made a film that is worthy of your time. Go!Baby!Go!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A masterpiece,"Every once in a while, amid the dross that reviewers have to sit through, comes a movie that hits like a sucker punch to the gut and haunts you long after you've left the theater. Such is the case with Gone Baby Gone.Based on the book by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River), Gone Baby Gone marks the directorial debut of Ben Affleck, who also penned the screenplay in tandem with Aaron Stockard, and easily puts him at the front of the line for Oscar contention.Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan star as a pair of private investigators based in the rough working class Dorchester district of Boston. The two are hired by the family of a missing four-year-old girl to assist the police investigation because of their street connections and ability to get people to talk who otherwise would never open up to a cop. As they navigate through the neighborhood's seamy underbelly of pimps, drug dealers and crack whores they uncover an ever-expanding mystery that takes on the added dimension of provoking the question of just what is right and what is wrong, firmly pitting both story and viewer in a struggle between situational ethics and moral absolutes.Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris round out an impressive cast, but it's the younger Affleck who takes this movie on his back and runs with it, easily surpassing his director brother in terms of acting breadth and range. This is no slight to Ben, however. It's been a long time since I was this impressed with a directorial debut, and even longer since I was given cause to reflect upon the values that we hold dear as individuals and a society, and the moral foundations upon which they are based. Gone Baby Gone manages both, and wraps it up in a hard-hitting detective story that serves as much to satisfy the baser urges of bar fights and gun play, as it does tackling bigger issues.It's also one of those rare movies in which it can easily be said that the less you know about the story going in, the richer the experience. There's no clear twist ending to give away, but rather a layered story that unfolds like a Russian stacking doll with a moral dilemma at its core.One thing I do feel comfortable revealing, however, is that this movie comes about as close as any can to being a bonafide lock come Academy Award time. Congrats Ben, you may well have redeemed yourself from your J-Lo/Gigli reputation at last.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Flawed film with a great deal of promise,"It is now largely forgotten that Ben Affleck's big break was not as an actor in but as a writer of ""Good Will Hunting"". His career has never lived up to the promise of his performance in that film (a quiet and subtle display) and has been overshadowed by the success of his friend and co-Oscar-winner, Matt Damon. With ""Gone Baby Gone"", Affleck moves back behind the camera, directing and writing, whilst his brother Casey, who really impressed in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"", takes the lead.The film is a gritty thriller at first, with a quite masterful opening which is engrossing and effective. The sense of location is evident from the start and both Afflecks demonstrate their talents. Casey is an interesting screen presence, and Ben is an unfussy director with an eye for location and images.The film is served well be the stellar cast. Ed Harris is very good, as is Michelle Monaghan and the Oscar nominated Amy Ryan is fantastic, whilst Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman, which is nice. They do make the film easy to watch, even though the subject matter, focussing on child abduction, is difficult to deal with.However, although the subject matter is treated well throughout most of the film, its fatal flaw is that it lets itself go in the third act. The plot twists and turns three times toward the end to lose nearly all credibility and then loses any that it had left by landing on a truly unbelievable conclusion. Its focus on character is not lost, but it is still a disappointment to see such a tightly played drama unwind at the end.Nevertheless, this film has much promise. Its subject matter should be a consideration for anyone who is thinking of seeing this, but it is an intelligent and interesting film which is worth watching, mainly because of what it might be the precursor of.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I was surprised at this movie being so good,"Being retired I have all the time in the world to do what pleases me. And seeing movies pleases me a lot, so much that I see almost everything, good, regular, bad and really baaaad. Seeing a movie for me is being at the cinema showing it, paying for my ticket, and I hardly ever watch a movie in TV, direct or recorded. This means that in order to keep up with my statement of seeing almost everything I go to see movies a minimum of five and a maximum of seven days per week, and some days I attend several movies (this is not an exaggeration), meaning that I do get to see 250 to 300+ movies every year.Today, 10/20/07 I was trying to decide what to see and Gone Baby Gone was not in my menu, as even though I go so often to the movies I had not seen any trailer for this movie nor heard anything about it. Perusing the newspaper the synopsis attracted me and I decided to see it. As Gone Baby Gone progressed I found myself being really pull into the story, living it together with the characters, through the splendid direction, editing and camera work. As the movie ended I thought to myself: ""This is why you go see so many bad and regular movies, so you will not miss the occasional good one and the rare excellent movie"".""Gone Baby Gone"" is easily the best movie I have seen this year. And that includes most of the art, foreign or indie movies that I also attend religiously. Unless something out of this world comes out in the next six weeks, this is my candidate for the Oscar to the best picture and Ben Affleck should also be nominated for best Director.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Overrated but mildly worthwhile,"A somewhat entertaining morality drama of the Hollywood variety, this baby doesn't really get going until the convoluted first and second acts are played out, culminating in a more emotionally involving conclusion. Speckled with much homegrown Bah-stonian flavor, the newfound directorial talents of big bro Ben Affleck to portray the city he loves with a notion of gritty integrity perhaps overwhelms with some shiftily stereotypical minor characters- both in look and delivery, but the core cast remain strong enough to let the overcooked plot come to a gentle simmer when we finally are able to understand what all the messy details add up to. The result is certainly far shy of the riveting, infinitely ponderous conclusion some have suggested, but still absolutely enough to make for a decent night of serious entertainment for mainstream American audiences.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Into the depths,"It's become a hobby of mine this past year to watch IMDb's top 250, AFI's top 100 and all Oscar winning (and most nominated) films. I've seen over 100 films in just the past year alone, but I am struggling to think of a film that I enjoyed more.The performances are outstanding. All of the characters- including the city itself - are filled with depth and ambiguity. Like a previous post mentioned, Amy Ryan did a phenomenal job as Helene, not only do I know many people like her, I'm related to some. I didn't even recognize her from her wonderful performance in the Wire.The questions that this movie asks as it unfolds do not get answered in by the closing credits, and they still aren't answered as I type. Who was right? Is there a right answer? Morgan Freeman- the greatest actor alive- and Ed Harris give standard upper echelon performances. But I was surprised by Michelle Monaghan and especially Casey Affleck. He didn't flinch, and he didn't compromise his ideals, but in the end compromised nonetheless. I hope he gets a nomination.Ben Affleck lost my favor somewhere around the time he began to cry in Armageddon, and I haven't taken him seriously since. But his achievement here, the pace, the mood, the spot on capturing of the desolate neighborhood, and the overall story leads me to anxiously await his next directorial effort.The best film I've seen in years.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the Year's Best,"""Gone Baby, Gone"" is one of the best films of the year. It is being compared to ""Mystic River"" and ""The Departed"" because it takes place in Boston, but I actually liked it better than either of those films.The opening credits start with the camera showing close ups of people's faces. The close ups are a recurring theme throughout the movie. It's because this is not just a film about a child kidnapping. It is a film about people and that is what lifts this film above so many others.Director Ben Affleck shows confidence and style in his first film. After this, he does not need to perform in any more films. He is a much better writer and director than he is an actor.All the performances in the film are superb. Casey Affleck has to carry the film and he does a great job. He is a stoic, deadpan, detective. But unlike the Noir detectives of the past, he is not a loner. He has a lot of friends and he has his girlfriend played by Michelle Monaghan help with the investigation. He uses his connections to find out things the police cannot.Beyond that, the less you know the better.If you like crime dramas that also work as character studies, you should run out and see ""Gone Baby, Gone.""",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Complex, engaging thriller with strong delivery from cast and crew","When a young girl goes missing from a rough Boston neighbourhood, the relatives of the less-than-sympathetic mother turn to private detective Patrick Kenzie who they hope can help with his local knowledge. Kenzie instantly does two things  one being rubbing the police the wrong way with his involvement, the other being proving his worth by exposing lies the police have been told by key people. However, with the clock ticking, time is running out and the odds dwindling for finding the child alive.As many others have said, Gone Baby Gone understandably took its time to get to the UK given the thematic connection with the real life child disappearance that dominated the headlines for many months, not to mention the likeness that the two white, blonde girls share. Going into it I thought that it would be a very bleak look at child abduction or child abuse and it was quite pleasing to find myself in the middle of a thriller plot  albeit very much about the aforementioned subjects. I'm not sure if this has been marketed at all in the UK (not seen a single poster for it whereas Hulk is everywhere) but if it has I'm not sure how they would have done it because while it is engaging, it is certainly not a cheerful or lovable film. However this is a problem for the marketing people  not the viewer.For the viewer what the very dark tone also produces is a complex and engaging thriller that not only manages to hold the attention with a series of solid and unexpected twists but also forces moral questions onto you that have no easy answers (although do have ""right"" answers). The two aspects of the film complement one another really well, with the thriller moving at a pace that does not detract from how grim it is. It is not perfect of course and some of the plot turns do take the odd jump and for the overall scenario as you understand it at the end, asking too many ""yeah but"" questions will take it to pieces with relative ease. Fortunately though, when it does tend to be weak in these regards, it is delivering questions to the viewer (the ending being a perfect example) and these rather serve to prevent one from picking at the internal logic but rather focusing on the question instead. Working this way makes it engaging and interesting to watch and it was a lot better than I expected.Being"" better than expected"" is also a statement that be applied across the cast and in particular to the director. Affleck does really good work here with his cinematographer to gets loads of well-framed shots along with the realistic ones but he also does very well in regards tone and style of delivery. It may be a ""thriller"" but the development is slow and, when violence comes, the gun fire has an abrasive crack rather than the satisfying thuds more favoured in action films. He draws mostly good performances from his cast as well. Casey Affleck turns in yet another strong performance; some have said he is rather flat but to me his restraint and internal conflict worked best for the film. Freeman has a small role and is essentially the sturdy pair of hands he is now known as. Harris is as good as you expect and it is nice to see Ashton in something again. Oscar nominated Ryan really should have won for a really convincing turn as the mother of the missing child but Monaghan is sadly not as good as she could have been and didn't work for me at key parts. Ironically the main cast member that stood out for me was one that did so in a jarring way, and that was Williams. We are treated to several lingering shots of his character before his name is even known (far less his minor part in the narrative) and I wondered why he was focused on like that. I imagine most people will not notice but it is hard enough to forget he is Omar from The Wire without having unnecessary shots of him.Anyway, before I start going on about The Wire again (watch it folks) I should note that Gone Baby Gone was not only better than I expected but also very good on its own terms. The narrative has weaknesses but these are helped over by the thread of moral questioning and how engaged I was in the overall film. The delivery is surprisingly good from Affleck as director and the cast is good with only a very few exceptions. Hard to market and not the most fun film you'll see but worth seeing regardless.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Gone but Never Forgotten,"In his directorial debut, Ben Affleck has completely morphed himself into an emerging artist and even more challenging director. Gone Baby Gone might be the most innovative and moral challenging film of recent years. This is the story of young Amanda, a little girl who mysteriously disappears from her home and the activity and dangers that befall upon the people involved in her finding.The film stars Affleck's brother Casey as Patrick, in his most challenging and engrossing performance to date. Not since Sean Penn in Mystic River has a role been so subdued yet immensely victorious and depth defying in choice of delivery and spot on emotions. Casey Affleck has paved the way for himself in roles that demonstrate the actor's showcase and give the performer range. It's a bit odd what to make of the younger Affleck in the upcoming awards season. He fairs a better shot for his earlier raved performance in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford for a nomination, but his performance in Gone Baby Gone is far more superior. Especially with upcoming prospects such as Daniel Day-Lewis, Johnny Depp and other big name talents, it'll be a tough road ahead for him.Ed Harris, who's been long ""overdue"" for Oscar recognition is purely haunting in his role as Remy, a hard-nosed cop looking for young Amanda. In one scene in particular, Harris shines and gives his best portrayal since The Hours. Although his character is a bit one-dimensional, Harris elevates the material and turns it into his show and steals frame after frame in a role easily lost in a picture like this.Morgan Freeman, in a role we have not seen him in before, plays Captain Jack Doyle, the head of the missing persons unit with personal experience in the loss of a child. Freeman, although absent for most of the narrative, sugar coats the top acting talent in the picture. Freeman's agenda into more range projects in his older career is reaffirming his Oscar win in 2003 for Million Dollar Baby, but now with the more rewarding films worthy of consideration.Michelle Monaghan who's a bit of an unknown face, plays Angie, Patrick's significant other who's personal fears interfere with her involvement in the case. To be honest, Monaghan gets lost in the shuffle and while the audience empathizes with her throughout the latter of the film, she's placed into a role easily overshadowed by stronger characters. Perhaps being the only strong woman role would have gave us something to awe at, but not with the guns at full blaze at the hands of Amy Ryan.Ryan plays Amanda's mother Helene, definitely not the most likable of characters but tragic in character arc. It's like a full on tennis match going back and forth with Ryan and audience; the viewer is hating her one moment and then needing to hold her the next. Helene is multi-layered and grasps her own importance of parenting and the whole film it becomes a fallen angel lost in the fire. That is the tragedy of the film, a film not only about the loss of a little girl, but the loss of innocence and the torment that betrayal, guilt and corruption can weigh on our souls.Ben Affleck is completely in control of this film, which he has lacked in his performances often. He knows what the mission is of this picture and would gladly take a spot amongst some bigger, older talents among Oscar prospects this year. Along with Co-adapting the film with Aaron Stockard, if Oscar is feeling like inviting Affleck to the Kodak, the screenplay category seems like a better fit, especially with an already win for Good Will Hunting. Other possibilities for consideration is wonderful cinematography by John Toll and a great musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams.Comparisons to Mystic River are all about, being done by the same author how could we expect no less. Mystic River had more of the message of the domino effect of one's actions on others, Gone Baby Gone brings it to a new level. This film is about a society, a society who has lost the importance of innocence and the beauty of life. It focuses on the beauty of children and rest assure, when the film is over, if you're not yearning to be a better parent of embrace a child as a blessing, there is probably emptiness in your chest. This film is marvelous, beautiful and spectacular. A must-see film of the year and a pleasant surprise coming from Ben Affleck.Grade: ****/****",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A well-done mystery thriller with a melancholy tone that never lets up and ultimately leaves the viewer a little more sad than satisfied.,"Ben Affleck's debut as a director was a decent start. Gone Baby Gone is a crime thriller with significant surprises and twists. The excellent cast and performances accentuated the emotional toll of working on a kidnapping case, and that emotional weight saturates every aspect of the film. Unfortunately, that heavy tone makes the movie a little challenging to enjoy. The dismal and somber mood throughout left me just feeling sad at the end. That poignant hopeless nature was clearly the goal and was well executed but keeps it from being a traditionally ""enjoyable"" film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Often, doing the right thing isn't so simple.","""I will hate you for doing this, and I don't want to.""There have been a lot of solid movies set in Boston in recent years, but Gone Baby Gone tops even The Departed and Mystic River, as good as they both were. What starts off as a story about a missing child evolves into one of the most thought provoking and genuinely compelling movies that I've seen.Ben Affleck has real talent as a director, and did an excellent job of maintaining the authenticity of both the story of the Dennis Lehane novel and the neighborhood that it's set in. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, and Amy Ryan were all perfectly cast, and give stellar performances.Gone Baby Gone is just one of those movies that it's hard to find a flaw with.

"Good?.....yeah, but the acting!!!!","Well, am i the only one that was disappointed with this movie?Yeah the storyline was good, a little all to familiar with the world today! And i did enjoy it. BUT it looked like it was made for TV! The acting was not great, and i think this was in some part due to the script. The worst was Mr Affleck. Sorry but this boy just can't act! Every time he spoke he seemed to wear one expression!! Even when he was trying to be menacing or angry it didn't feel genuine. I always read the reviews on here before i watch any movie, (none that contain spoilers!)and i have never wrote a review before myself, but i felt compelled to to comment on this film after so many people talked it up!! For me both Freeman and Harris were good but seemed restricted. Harris more so. Trust me, there will be no awards for this film, which is a shame because there is some bravery in the ending of the film, which shows us all something that we really know anyhow, but is rarely shown in this type of film............and that is that ultimately, people don't change!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Gritty, depressing but oh so good!","My admiration for Ben Affleck has gone way up after realizing this film is his directorial debut. Depressing in that it shows the seedy underbelly of life and the truly horrible flaws of human beings, it sucks you in with the excellent acting of the principle characters. When I first saw his brother Casey on the screen my reaction was probably the same as most viewers - this guy is way too young to play the character written for him and he's out of his depth. I was so wrong on both points. Casey Affleck is great in a very understated way as a man haunted by his morality in what is right and wrong and you see the struggle he goes through as the film develops towards its heartbreaking conclusion. Everyone played their parts well and any film with Morgan Freeman in it is worth a look as he is a fine actor. The only criticism I have about the film is the use of the 'f' word in almost every sentence. I guess a film about the underbelly of life in Boston would not be realistic without the 'f' word but it was 'overkill' to me and shows a lack of originality. However, the script is amazing and the story is well told as it unfolds to its conclusion. I found the ending scene so profound and powerful in its predictability and ordinariness that it's impact was like a punch to the gut. Without giving anything away, the ending scene shows that life goes on, one way or another!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hardest Moral Question In Any Film,"Discussing this film without delving into spoilers is challenging, but it's essential to note how it stands out from others in its genre, particularly towards the end. ""Gone Baby Gone"" starts as a detective story but evolves, introducing intense moral and philosophical questions that keep you on the edge of your seat. The film is replete with mind-blowing revelations and impressive plot twists.Leonard Bernstein once said, ""A work of art does not answer questions, it provokes them; and its essential meaning is in the tension between the contradictory answers."" This film embodies that idea, posing perhaps the most challenging question I've ever encountered in cinema. Usually, I have an inkling of which side I lean towards, but with this film, I find myself completely lost in contemplation.""Gone Baby Gone"" is far more than a simple police drama; it's a profound exploration of morality. Is there a right answer to the puzzle it presents? Is there even a good choice to be made? The film is not only a stunning piece of entertainment from start to finish, but also a thought-provoking journey that lingers long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An admirable cast, impressive acting and the wise way to tell the perfect story because, in so many senses, it is the story of the viewer.

The pinnacle of Affleck's directing career,"Back in 2007, it surprised many that Ben Affleck's directing debut was such a finely tuned crime thriller.It's not like the much-lampooned leading man wasn't adept at other things outside of leading such big-budget event films like Armageddon, Pearl Harbor and The Sum of All Fears, as the talented all-rounder showed his worth as one part of the Oscar winning duo behind the long-standing classic Good Will Hunting but there still wasn't many out there that believed Gone Baby Gone was going to be a film of much note.Showing the detractors why they're wrong, Affleck's nuanced adaptation of Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name that takes place in the filmmakers beloved Boston and stars his brother Casey as private investigator Patrick Kenzie, whose been drawn into the search for young neighbourhood child Amanda McCready, Gone Baby Gone is a unique film with a heartfelt foundation and a film that holds up well these years on from release.Many would argue, and perhaps rightfully so, that Gone Baby Gone is the pinnacle of Affleck the filmmaker, despite the success he found in The Town and Argo (let's just forget Live by Night is a thing) and it's not hard to see why, as the film is the complete package from noteworthy performances, pitch perfecting scripting and a loaded narrative that will have you guessing and questioning yourself right up to the end credits.Due to the finely crafted nature of the film, it's not hard to see why it made Affleck an in-demand force behind the camera and led to more of a public acceptance after a few rough years in front of the camera, while it established his younger brother Casey as a genuine lead after his fine work previously in the likes of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, we're the solid performer was unfairly overshadowed by his A-list co-star Brad Pitt.Casey is brilliant in his role as Kenzie, a local Bostonian that utilises his long-standing connections to help uncover the mystery surrounding Amanda's disappearance, with the at the time lesser known Affleck brother solidly supported by the likes of Michelle Monaghan as his co-worker and partner Angie, Morgan Freeman as retired police chief Jack Doyle, Ed Harris as detective Remy Bressant, while the Oscar nominated Amy Ryan is an irritating joy as drug-addled mother Helene McCready.It's a fine showcase for Ben Affleck's ability to get the best out of his ensembles, an ability his showcased in almost all of his features as director, while his handling of set-pieces and more solemn human moments (a house raid and the films stirring finale examples of this) are works of a director who knows and understands his craft, but also knows and understands the human condition, combining to create an emotionally heavy and often thrilling experience.Final Say -A finely tuned film that asks some intriguing and confronting moral questions, Gone Baby Gone is as powerful of an experience today as it was upon release and an undeniable showcase for Affleck's directing talents.4 ½ uninviting bars out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Nice and well played thriller with a lot of surprises, twists and turns","Good thriller, though some downbeat, adapted from a novel written by Dennis Lehane. Here Ben Affleck gives a top-notch directorial debut. When little Amanda goes missing, despair emerges and hopes are dim. She is from a noisy neighbourhood where residents are not disposed to talk to the cops who are investigating the case : Ed Harris, John Ashton under superior orders to Police chief : Morgan Freeman. While her druggie mummy : Amy Ryan, has incurred the wrath of a drug kingpin. Those are reasons enough for Amanda's devoted uncle :Titus Welliver and aunt : Amy Madigan to contract a young team of private detectives , the soft-spoken, wry Patrick Kenzie : Casey Affleck, and enjoyable Angie Gennaro : Michelle Monaghan. But then things go awry when the investigation deepens with turns as well as twists, where doing the right thing begins to look all wrong and viceversa.A decent thriller steeped in the unkillable grudges , continuous betrayals , compelling ambiguities, dark secrets and tribal loyalties of South Boston. All of them finish into an astonising ending, in a conclusion puzzle-solving development that turns to be convoluted and surprising, at the same time. Main cast and support cast are very well. Casey affleck, director's brother, is terrific. He is the film's backbone playing the obstinate eye private, being helped by his colleague and girlfriend, Michelle Monaghan in an inert role, both of them carry out the deep investigation that ends up into fateful consequences. Ed Harris is fantastic as the cynical, squinty police inspector who investigates the case along with the forgotten secondary of the 80s John Ashton. Of course, the great Morgan Freeman as the heartbroken police chief who knows sorrow all too well. But is Amy Ryan who steals the show as the junkie mother, she creates a role who is at once pathetic and fearsome.It displays an evocative and dark, at times, cinematography by the fine professional cameraman John Toll. As well as thrilling and stirring musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams. The motion picture was competently directed by the famous actor and director Ben Affleck, though it has some flaws and it results to be a little depressing and disagreeable. Ben Affleck is a good actor who has starred a lot of big boxoffice movies as Suicide squad, Smokin' aces, Paycheck, Daredevil, The company men, Armageddon , Pearl Harbor, Good Will Hunting. He has also directed a few and well-deemed films, such as Live by night, The Town, Gone baby gone and his greatest hit : Argo that had seversl Academy Awards. Rating 7/10. Better than average.

The book is always better than the movie...,"The book is always better than the movie. (Except when someone takes a half-baked book-idea and turns it into a great film. This has also often happened.) In this case, Dennis Lehane's book was better, just as his ""Mystic River"" book was better, even though they were both good films.I thought Ed Harris was excellent, as was Morgan Freeman; but they are seasoned veterans and of course would be good in such a production. The two lead characters, both relative unknowns (relative in the Affleck brother's case being a pun unintended)were okay, nothing special; they had a good script which made them credible, but there was no big acting going on here.Sometimes it's just...not a good idea to make a film from a complex, complicated story. There are so many characters and so many unexplained threads, and although the film tried hard to cover gaps in the storyline, it was still too diffused. Of course I enjoyed it, but it's not going to make film history.I recommend this just the same, as a well-crafted film, based on a brilliant storyline.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Where have all the screenwriters gone?,"The idea behind this film is fundamentally a good one - which is not surprising since it is based on a novel. And despite the horribly clichéd, implausible and convoluted screenplay, some of those original ideas remain. Also, to be fair, there are some nice moments in the film and it does not go Spielberg on us.But, there seems to be a trend - maybe they all learn it in screen writing school - to focus on a couple of key scenes that need to be told and to put as many twists in the story as possible to get there, Realistic dialog, believable characters, plausible behavior, pacing, logic, good storytelling - these don't seem to matter as long as we get that Oscar winning scene and those unexpected (actually very predictable) twists.This could have been a good movie with tighter editing and better storytelling to connect the Oscar moments - as it is - it makes about as much sense as a Steven Seagal movie and at least there you've got some cheap thrills...",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Casey is by far more talented this way, and benefits from the guidance. Heck, he even got an almost good performance out of Freeman, who has a role just far enough from his ordinary character to surprise a bit.But the key thing – he is cinematic.

a nifty directorial debut,"Working for the first time on the opposite side of the camera, actor-turned-director Ben Affleck has delivered a solid, if imperfect, crime drama entitled ""Gone Baby Gone,"" based on the novel by Dennis Luhane. Ben's brother, Casey, and Michelle Monaghan play a pair of missing-persons investigators hired to find a little girl who disappeared from her Boston home three days earlier. Her mother is a foul-mouthed coke-fiend who is not very particular about the company she keeps and who seems strangely reluctant to cooperate with the authorities working to get her daughter back. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris co-star as cops whose involvement with the case grows ever more complicated as the drama unfolds.Affleck co-wrote the screenplay - his first since 1997's ""Good Will Hunting"" - with Aaron Stockard, and together they have gone beyond the surface simplicities of the standard whodunit to probe the ethical complexities that are, for good or for ill, an integral part of law enforcement work. As the central character, Patrick is continually confronted with the moral relativism of his actions, be it in negotiating with child abductors without police authority, shooting down an unarmed pedophile who has just murdered a child, or going after a crooked cop who reveals a legal indiscretion to him in a moment of drunken confidence. Yet, when all the murky details of the case are finally revealed, Patrick realizes that, when it comes to doing what's ""right,"" even he has a line over which he will not cross - even if, by refusing to do so, he loses the one thing that matters the most to him in his life. And yet there's still no guarantee that the choice he makes will be the best for all concerned in the end. As an over-arching theme, the film also points out how difficult it is to raise children in a world in which so many adults are themselves deeply troubled and maladjusted.As director, Affleck has extracted fine performances from every member of his large cast, most notably Casey, Freeman, Harris, Amy Madigan and Amy Ryan, impressive enough to have earned an Oscar nomination for her work here.The multi-layered script occasionally defies credibility and pushes too hard to make its points, but ""Gone Baby Gone"" is at least willing to explore the ethical uncertainties of life and to honor that stance by ending on a note of ambivalence and ambiguity. That alone makes it a rarity in commercial American film-making.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nasty Realism in a Vivid Offputting Roar of Moral Dilemmas,"Gone Baby Gone (2007)Nasty Realism in a Vivid Offputting Roar of Moral DilemmasThis is a penetrating experience if not a transcendent one. This cinema-verite dive into rough Boston trashy life, with only limited filmic gloss, as if a kind of documentary, is still clearly fictional and intentional in its scope. These are mostly horrid seeming people on the screen, yet we know them in real life, more or less, and we know they are not so horrid most of the time, that people have their troubles and their strengths. The problem, and the value, of Gone Baby Gone is that we are made to live with them for the entire movie. Even the good guy, the moral light (more correct than his girlfriend) played by Casey Affleck, is rough by necessity. The violence of language, of attitude, and with real bullets, never stops.Or when it does stop, we are left with abusive parents, neglectful parents, child molesters, kidnappers, corrupt cops, drug kingpins, drug dealers, torturers, mindless murderers, and mindful murderers. I'm sure I've only touched on half of it, and yet we believe this kind of world is out there, and are thankful it's got limits, or at least that it doesn't brush against ours. Usually.Affleck's character is a contemporary and very young private detective, Patrick Kenzie, and he sort of proves that the cool, hard talking, slow-paced film noir detective is no longer a reality (if it ever was, even potentially). Our new world reacts with too much immediacy, and murder is impulsive. People are so strung out, or so far into criminalilty, reactions are fast and violent. Kenzie's unflagging, show-no-fear approach, and his kindly but somewhat dull girlfriend sidekick, Angie, are the closest thing we have to decency, and we naturally relate to them. But what proves successful is not wits, not CSI cleverness and science, but personal connections and tough conversations, threats and pressure of one friend (so-called) against another, one cop against another.The plot might at time seem to teeter, but hang in there, because it makes sense, even as it drops over the edge of probability. The twists keep you curious, but mostly it's the determination of Kenzie, driven by some need to succeed, to do the right thing rather than money, that makes you care. Oddly, I did care where he went with it, and worried for him. Affleck is the younger brother of the director, Ben Affleck, and the two of them seemingly have a rapport that centers the film. Morgan Freeman shows, by his sheer presence, what great acting is, and though his role is a cliché as a veteran cop, he pulls it off perfectly. Ed Harris, playing a more war-weary cop, is more complicated cliché, but with enough odd corners to his career, and enough intensity to his acting, we go with him the whole nine yards.One unsavory character, the young druggie mother played by Helen McCready, is at times so perfectly played it's part of the success of the movie. At first I thought she was playing too stupid, and too callous (being the one we are meant to sympathize with) but gradually I see the depth of exactly that kind of person, and by the last scene I'm convinced completely, and all her earlier crying and not-crying makes her the half faux-victim, half selfish addict she really portrays.What finally splits the movie is a moral choice that the viewers might make differently, and so ultimately the film goes somewhere beyond its own seedy example. And the ride there is really interesting and worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Affleck's Vengeance,"Ben Affleck must be kicking himself. I'm sure it passed through his mind when he was making particularly empty vehicles as an actor and turning in self-conscious performances as Daredevils and Dick heroes that he wasn't enriching the history of cinema and had somehow joined the Forces of Evil, conspiring against the wellbeing of humanity by cashing in on a watery culture of cinematic mediocrity. He knows that film at its best can make the world a better place – somehow. It is implicit in the script of Good Will Hunting. Then Hollywood came along and tried to tell him otherwise and he forgot, like those flawed heroes who become mired in just getting by everyday after their fall from grace. Well, consider Gone Baby Gone his vengeance. It is superb. Immensely detailed, textured and nuanced he uses his own brother Casey as his alter ego to confront a world mired in selfishness and deception. The Afflecks will attempt to do what is right, what is good, and yet! It is the ""and yet..!"" that makes this film so special even beyond the great performances of pretty much every actor in the show. Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan play Patrick and Angie, life partners as well as professional partners in their business of private detectives. They are hired by the relatives of a child who has been kidnapped from her drug-using irresponsible mother (Amy Ryan playing Helene McCready in one of those turns that is unfortunately so richly convincing you don't actually think she is acting). Patrick may be street wise but there is a youth and innocence to him that makes the viewer feel protective. Those hand-picked masters of gravitas, Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris play 'the grown ups' as it were. Freeman is the police chief who has suffered a young daughter being murdered in the past and at first appears as a minor character in it all. Harris plays Remy Bressant, the seasoned cop working with colleague Nic Poole (John Ashton) obliged to share their findings with the young pair. The relationship proves to be mutually beneficial as they delve inside the shabby crime kingdom of Boston with its drug lynch pins, hustlers, thugs and users. From a Dennis Lehane novel the script by Affleck (Ben) and Aaron Stockard handsomely builds up the detail and complexity of the story. Affleck knows how to make a scene count and there are stings and zingers throughout this two hour movie that make each word and image essential and watchable. The writers also take a big chance with structure, chucking the (recently) time-honored three act system out the window, as the film is divided into two halves. It is a risk to take nowadays as audiences are so used to the set up, but it pays off because of the density of events and - that rare thing nowadays – real character development. At the heart is Casey Affleck's prickly boyish persona, both strong and brittle, a resolute and doubting crusader, vulnerable and untouchable, a sinner or a saint in the making.While I'm reminded of those early Scorcese films that weave Catholic hope and guilt between urban conflict, Gone Baby Gone manages to produce a new level of sophistication. Scorcese heroes are iconic and distant. Affleck is within arms reach. This is a crime genre film that is reflective without forgetting the viewer, dealing with the lives of ordinary Americans as if they mattered, brimming with compassion, while still managing to be a cinematic ride of craft, invention and mature intelligence.Yep, Affleck must be kicking himself for wasting so much time letting less capable people shape his offerings to film when all the while he should have been at the helm himself. I hope he has learned his lesson. Loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The mean streets of Dorchester,"Gone Baby Gone (2007) is a crime drama co-written and directed by Ben Affleck. It stars Casey Affleck as Patrick Kenzie, a private detective who works in Dorchester. Dorchester is a huge neighborhood in Boston. It contains upscale areas but also some really rough spots. The overall crime rate in Dorchester is 30% higher than the national average, so it's not a very peaceful place.The premise of the movie is that Kenzie grew up in Dorchester and knows everyone in his neighborhood. He's hired to find a kidnapped girl by the girl's aunt. The thought is that he can talk to people who wouldn't talk to the police. As it turns out, the aunt is right and Kenzie learns things by talking to people who will talk to him.The supporting cast is very strong. Michelle Monaghan portrays Angie Gennaro, Kenzie's lover and his detective partner. Morgan Freeman portrays Jack Doyle, the head of the kidnapping squad, and Ed Harris portrays Remy Bressant, one of the detectives assigned to the case. They all do well in their supporting roles.The problem for me is that I think Casey Affleck was the wrong actor for this role. Director Affleck knew that. There's a line where Kenzie tells the police something like, ""I may look young, but I'm 31."" In fact, Affleck really was 31 when the movie was produced. However, he looks more like an Explorer Scout working on his Law and Justice merit badge than he looks like a street-hardened private detective.Truth in reviewing--there were so many very bad guys, pretty bad guys, and somewhat bad guys in the movie that I lost track of which bad guy was on the screen at any given moment. Win some, lose some.However, I have to admit that the basic question raised by the film was interesting and not easy to answer. The question is whether the end justifies the means. Do you do what the law says is right, or do you do what may well be wrong, but could have a better outcome?Although I believe Affleck was the wrong actor for this role at that time, he portrays his doubts about the case very well. (I should say that I thought Affleck was superb in Manchester by the Sea. In 2016 he was the right actor in the right role.)This movie worked well enough on DVD. It has an excellent 7.7 IMDb rating. I may be overly critical, but it just didn't work for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Reprehensible Drivel,"*** SPOILER WARNING ***So in Boston it's apparently legal to commit murder as long as the guy on the receiving end is a piece of low-life scum. A short way into the investigation into a child abduction the police and private investigator track down a double-crossing drug-runner who's been strapped to a chair and beaten to a bloody pulp before being killed. They have a very strong suspicion as to who did it. They know where he is, the detective even meets him face to face to discuss the more important issue of the kidnap, with the police waiting outside. They don't bother to question him about the murder, let alone make an arrest or apparently even open a case of homicide. Later the detective himself shoots in the back of the head an unarmed man posing no current threat. The recipient of the bullet is a known paedophile however and it seems that he has been abusing and recently killed a kidnapped seven year old boy. The detective openly admits to committing murder in conversation with a senior police officer. Everyone knows about it, his girlfriend says she's proud of him for it. Again there is no questioning, no arrest, no mention of any charges being brought as even a possibility. I can only conclude that in Boston it is legal to murder someone as long as they are well known to be a piece of low-life scum.Ah, but these police had reason not to do the things by the book as they are up to no good themselves. That misses the point. The detective believes them to be on-side and yet doesn't raise an eyebrow, nor does anyone else at the fact that a murder in some cases seems to be less of a crime than jaywalking.The story is the most ludicrous that I have ever come across in a supposedly serious film. In an amazing twist the kidnapping turns out to have been an extra-curricular operation by the Boston police themselves conducted at the very highest level - the uncle of the girl, the senior cop, his sidekick and the chief commissioner of police were all in it together and have been leading the private dick up the garden the path from the very beginning. Scriptwriters take note - you can turn any story on its head by this simple device  just have a lot of the supposedly trusted people that the main character was relying on for most of his information turn out to have been telling lies. And why did they do it? To give a better life to the young girl than the one that her biological but wayward, neglectful and impecunious mother was providing. The now retired chief commissioner and his wife, who lost their own daughter to a killing, have become her parents. One slight problem here I feel  how were they to explain the sudden appearance of their lovely new blonde daughter (who would be presumably be highly coveted by thousands of the eager adoptive couples of a more likely age?) and one who looks so uncannily like the very girl whose face has been plastered on posters and broadcast to the nation, whose disappearance the commissioner led the investigation into? Or are they to retire from society completely, keep her away from school, friends, all social intercourse in case she mentions a previous mother she can perfectly well remember? Perhaps one crazy individual or couple could overlook such niceties, but three senior long-serving police officers with presumably massive pensions at risk to go along with an escapade that is so fraught and liable to discovery? Yet this is not even the final absurdity. We are asked to believe not just that this could happen but that when the detective finally confronts the kidnapping top cop they have a moral debate about who's right and who's wrong, making elegant speeches to each other about what's best for the girl now and in the future, and not only this but the detective's girlfriend takes the kidnapper's side, and so strongly that she walks out on him and ends their relationship when he insists on turning the ex-commissioner over to the law and returning the girl to her mother.Praise for the actors in coping valiantly with this drivel and turning in good performances cannot be too high. The first half hour or so is quite gripping, before the first faintly ludicrous interview with the framed gangster suspect. After this it is all downhill  moving ever further from any possible reality and with ever longer tedious speeches between characters supposedly grappling with the moral dilemmas that the contrived storyline has thrown up. Rarely in the history of cinema has such silly and faintly repellent rubbish been taken so seriously and been so highly praised. In choosing the theme of the ultimate crime  the abduction and possible abuse and murder of an innocent defenceless young child  the film-makers perhaps thought that they themselves could get away with murder or at least daylight robbery  the audience so cowed by the enormity of the topic that they take collective leave of their critical faculties and accept any old nonsense at face value. It seems they were right.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The acting falls flat, as does the plot","I don't want to name names, but a few of the lead actors in this film just seem flat to me, with not enough emotion invested in their characters to be believable or even interesting. The plot started out interesting enough but then quickly became a downward spiral with an increasing amount of ridiculousness. There were quite a few moments where I literally felt like it was an insult to my own intelligence, particularly in the second half of the film. The one thing I did appreciate about the film was its ending, which poses an interesting moral dilemma for the main character as well as viewers, if they think about it enough. So all in all, it's worth the watch as long as you're willing to overlook some of the ridiculousness in the story line. It's another one of those films that seems to have a twist at the end just for the sake of having a twist, regardless of how unbelievable that twist is.

The book gave me the impression that Patrick was a dark, hard-drinking private eye, who could handle himself in a fight. I pictured him around 6-1, 190lbs. Denis Leary would have been my choice for the part. Angie in my mind was a voluptuous Italian girl, who would swear back at the tough guys, but had a heart of gold. Casey Afleck, and Michelle Monaghan were OK, but Casey Afleck is about 140 soaking wet. Remember the bar scene, he can't even put down a guy who was shot twice by the bartender. Angie(Monaghan)is pretty but without the curves needed to fill Angie's character. Amy Ryan did a great job.

Best Film of 2007,"Gone Baby Gone (2007)**** (out of 4)Ben Affleck's directorial debut is nothing short of a masterpiece and deals with two private investigators (Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan) and their search for a missing four year old girl. To say anything else about the plot would ruin the film so I'll leave it at that but I really, really loved this movie. I'm not one who thinks current films are all horrible and the future of cinema is dead but I will say that I'm a bit nervous that the character dramas that depend on acting, direction and a great screenplay might be dead. With this film and Sean Penn's Into the Wild my nerves are calmed a bit because we've got at least two young directors with balls. This film asks a lot of hard questions and gives a lot of hard answers and sometimes they'll make you wanna cry while at other times they'll make you want to commit murder. The film deals with a very ugly subject matter and deals with some of the lowest forms of scum yet the heart in this film is untouched by any recent film. This is an ugly picture that will turn a lot of people off but Affleck never pulls any punches and it constantly giving the viewer something to think about. I've always enjoyed Affleck as an actor but this film proves that his given talent is as a screenwriter and director.The film features a terrific cast all of whom should be remembered at Oscar time. Casey Affleck has a lot to handle here and going into the film I wondered how he would do and it turns out he comes off brilliant. His character goes through a lot of changes throughout the movie and the viewer must follow him through all the questions asked of him. At times I was fully behind him but then there were times that I wanted to punch his teeth down his throat. Even with me hating some of his actions, Affleck makes the character all his own and never gives a false move. Monaghan is equally great as his partner and the screenplay allows her to be a full character and not just some sidekick. Her reasons behind wanting to find the child and her fears are different than her partners but this too works wonders within the script. The supporting cast is full of great actors including Ed Harris as a Detective on the case, Morgan Freeman as his Captain and Amy Ryan as the child's mother. Harris gives the performance of his career because, once again, the rich screenplay gives him so much to do that he's able to explore his character and show ever side of emotion. Freeman has a smaller role as the Captain who has his only child murdered and he gives a speech about that, which is perhaps the most haunting thing in the film. The Robert Shaw/Indianapolis speech in Jaws was one of the most haunting speeches I've heard but this here comes pretty damn close. Ryan, playing a crackhead whore, is also marvelous and once again benefits from the screenplay.Taking place on the mean streets of Boston, the film perfectly captures the mood and ugliness of the ""poor"" side of town, which is full of drugs, prostitution and various other things. The dialogue is so rich that you'd think you were watching a documentary with real people and real situations. There's a lot of racist and homophobic talk here with various slurs being thrown around and this here is something missing in our politically correct times. The screenplay simply shows how some people are and this is something I respect. Affleck handles all of this material like a veteran so it's shocking that this is his first stint as director. I certainly look forward to what he has to offer in the future because he's clearly got talent behind the camera and behind the typewriter. This film starts off depressing and doesn't get any lighter throughout the rest of the movie. It's dark, disturbing and at times downright brutal but it has balls, which is something more films need. What I also loved are all the clues that are given in plain sight yet we don't pick up on them because we don't know they're clues. The film has a couple big twists and turns but not once did I feel cheated because, as I just said, the clues are given in a fair manor. I won't reveal the ending but the film offers people two sides and I'm sure people will be split 50/50 on what should happen. It offers a lot of possible discussions, which is another thing more movies need.",,Anonymous,Mystery

What saves the movie is the wonderful story-line, and the supporting cast members (namely Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, and Amy Ryan). Casey's acting was totally forgettable to me in this movie. With all of that said, I did give him a second chance in the Assassination of Jesse James. I had a TOTALLY different reaction to his acting abilities in this movie. I thought he was wonderful, convincing, and well deserving of the Oscar consideration. Honestly...you have to ask yourself one question about Gone Baby Gone. Would Casey have gotten this part if big brother wasn't directing it? Like the judges always say on American Idol...""pick the song that defines you"". That song for Affleck was The Assassination of Jesse James, not Gone Baby Gone. Just keeping it real dog.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Affleck brings a strong air of humanity to directorial debut,"Perhaps Ben Affleck should stay in the director's chair. If I had been asked to guess if Affleck would make a good director, I probably wouldn't bet my money on it, but I certainly wasn't going to hold it against him upon viewing this film. Now having seen the delicacy with which he handles this film, I have to say that he has a pair of highly capable directing hands.""Gone Baby Gone"" is a top notch under-the-radar thriller and another successful film adaptation of a Dennis Lehane (Mystic River) novel. Affleck has essentially helped plant Lehane's solid seed and done nearly all the work required to let it blossom. This is not one of those arrogant, chin-in-the-air missing child investigative mysteries--it is genuine and honest nearly the entire time. Affleck really keeps his impressive cast of characters on the ground and they are all played by talented actors capable of doing just that.The story follows independent detective Patrick Kenzie, played by Affleck's younger brother Casey, who easily surpasses his brother's depth and range of acting talent. Basically, Kenzie and his girlfriend (Monaghan) are brought on to help investigate the case of a missing four- year-old girl and what Patrick finds along the way begins to test his character. Kenzie is a thick-accented hard-nosed Bostonian who gets a lot of flack for looking younger than his age but keeps his worth based on who he knows in Boston. Ironically, the role is true to life for the younger Affleck, whose success has been impeded by his youthful appearance. It's a shame, too. Casey keeps the serious, introspective tone of the film alive and prevents it from getting too ridiculous at the end when the film takes some overused twists and turns as the mystery is revealed.The supporting cast, particularly the always-talented Ed Harris and the missing girl's mother played by Amy Ryan (who we will surely be seeing more of), was also outstanding and helped push across the very human feel of the film, truly its greatest strength. It stays very theme- focused and some excellent dialogue keeps the intensity up. There is some high quality trash talking in the film (thanks to Ben, probably) and that plus some of the scenes in the beginning portray Kenzie in a way that does not make him seem any more powerful because he's the investigator--a trait not common of thrillers.The film really stays close to its themes and makes it very clear, but not in an overstated or cheesy way. That is avoided because Affleck the humanity and realism are established so early in the film. Just looking at the actors gives off a working-class vibe. The small role actors and extras were not chosen because they were easy on the eyes and that's commendable and integral to the vibe of the film. From a technical perspective, Ben focuses the camera on people and the Boston backdrop a bit too and people and places is what real life is at its most essential. He picks the right moments to show characters and grasp their emotions and what they're likely thinking.""Gone"" will likely exceed your expectations, especially for Ben Affleck, but it won't go above and beyond anything you've seen before--it's not one of those genre-transforming films. Affleck just takes the story and brings it to its full potential in a way that is thoughtful and entertaining and that's all we can ask for from a director.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good movie, but with lots of holes in the plot.","This is a very engaging and interesting movie, but I still was left somewhat disappointed after it ended. The actors are good and the camera work is not bad either. What let my overall impression down were huge holes in the story, quite a few things that didn't make any sense at all, and the absurd desire of the creators to add as many turns and twists to the story as they can possibly squeeze in. Seven people dies to save one little secret? Highly unrealistic. I will not go into divulging any of the spoilers, but the second part of the movie was so hollywoodish, in the worst sense of the word, that it was almost on the verge of laughable. Also, several key scenes were shot hastily and without any respect for the viewer, just to carry on with the unrealistic plot. The bottom line: it is an OK movie, but with some huge gaps in the storyline and direction.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Like the film, MYSTIC RIVER, GONE BABY GONE brings your neighbors to the fore front in a manner that is both alluring, and frightening at the same time.The question of ""what is right for the child?"" is shown on the screen and captured in this film with an ending that will cause an audience to question what is really right, or, what is wrong, in child care rearing and the importance of family. Casey Affleck is magnificent and the lovely Michelle Monaghan as his conscience make a wonderful pair on the screen. Of course, Ed Harris is as always, such a strong supporting actor and his role in the film makes the story flow along with the presence of the fabulous Morgan Freeman.

Strong and engaging story  of difficult moral choices,"This is a film about two private detectives investigating a case of missing child. No one is prepared for the avalanche of shocking events that unfolds during the investigation.The first half of ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a thriller about the search for a missing girl, while the second half is an emotional drama about the search for truth and moral dilemmas. The great thing about ""Gone Baby Gone"" is that such transition is gradual, without being contrived as it easily could have been. The plot is very strong and engaging. It questions who is fit to be a parent, who is to decide who is fit, and who is to decide a child's future. It's a heavy subject that people will feel strongly about, but ""Gone Baby Gone"" manages to present the issue in a balanced way.For years Casey Affleck is known to me as Ben's brother. After watching ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"", I am impressed and am convinced that he is a serious and talented actor. As for Ben Affleck, his directorial debut is impressive, and I am already looking forward to more of his work.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Has its flaws, and some big ones, too, but still achieves something near greatness","Ben Affleck's directorial debut, based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, who also wrote Mystic River. Affleck's direction is more than adequate. I'm sure he's aping Clint Eastwood's film version of Mystic River much of the time, and there's one scene that's way too reminiscent of Se7en, but he shows a lot of skill. He's great at capturing his hometown of Boston and the people who live there. The story revolves around the investigation of a missing girl. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are two of the major investigators for the police. The aunt of the missing girl hires Casey Affleck and his girlfriend, played by Michelle Monaghan, to do private investigation on the side, because they can maybe find some secrets that the girl's mother (Amy Ryan) might be hiding. It's a gripping mystery story, and it arrives at one quite satisfying twist. But then there's another twist. The second big twist is completely stupid, and then the previously excellent film starts to fall. This isn't unlike Mystic River, where, when we finally found out why Tim Robbins has been acting so strange all the time, I just had to slap my forehead. Gone Baby Gone is able to pull itself up a bit from its head-slapping plot revelation in its final moments, but I was still left feeling cheated. I also have to complain that Monaghan, as cute as she is, adds very little. Would Affleck's character really put his girlfriend in such dangerous situations all the time? I'm sort of glad we're spared the whole cliché schtick where one of the two lovers fears for their significant other's safety, but bringing the hot chick into a powerful drug dealer's den sounds like a hostage situation waiting to happen. Casey Affleck delivers his second fine performance of the year, though it isn't as good as his Robert Ford, which I think might some day be considered iconic. Ed Harris is a sure thing for an Oscar nomination. The guy is such a master at his craft. It's a credit to Affleck's direction that the film can still be considered so good after some should-be fatal flaws.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Convincing plot and realistic characters,"'Gone Baby Gone' is one of the strongest and most realistic mystery/drama films of the last decade.

This isn't the case with 'Gone Baby Gone', it is very well-written and the characters all feel very realistic.This is a drama film more than anything and there is a lot of emphasis on the dialogue.

Ben's debut as a director is amazing.,"Ben Affleck gets behind the camera and directs his brother amongst others in this tale of kidnapping, moral decisions and society's deep undercurrents. In a scenario eerily similar to that of the real life disappearance of Madeline McCann (the girl in the film Amanda even looks like her) the story is that of a young girl taken from her bed at night and how the ensuing search affects everyone from the community to the police to Patrick (Casey) and his partner in his private investigator business Angie (Monaghan). Along the way we meet Amanda's mother a character that seems to have no redeeming features, her brother who with his wife are instrumental in the hiring of Patrick and Angie much to the protest of cops Remy (Ed Harris) and Nick (Ashton) under the leadership of Capt. Jack Doyle (Freeman) who we discover lost a child in similar circumstances which lead him to set up a special unit to deal with such happenings. The tone and pace of the film can be compared to 'Mystic River' or 'The Woodsman' with the characters being the driving force of the story which continues to build right up to the end. One of the main things the film does is pose ethical and moral questions and you find yourself at once with the characters that have to make these choices, along with the superb direction and acting it's the main way the film continues to grip you throughout. A haunting score and some impressive cinematography flesh out the movie as do some of the smaller characters that inhabit the neighbourhood, but this film really does belong to the Affleck's Ben proving that with his debut he is now a director to watch out for and Casey who after his part in last years 'The Assassination of Jesse James..' is showing he is an actor of range that is developing with each role.

compelling drama with a twist but pretty slow and kinda melodramatic,"This was hard to rate for me because I thought the acting was superb all around, especially by Ed Harris who I love and Casey Affleck. I thought it was a very compelling story, well told and directed, including an ending that kept you guessing and chances are you probably didn't have it 100% from the get-go. That said it just felt a little too grimy, like they were trying to force down your throat just how decrepit parts of Boston can be, and their peculiar denizens. Also there's a ""moral"" decision made by one of the characters at the end that, in my opinion (and my friend who watched it with me) was downright freaking stupid and made no sense, especially for that character. Eh, a minor gripe given the other qualities of the movie. A 7.5 if I could give half points. But will likely not ever watch again.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Not having read the novel, I don't know if this followed Lehane's work.The plot is complex, dealing with law and order and differing approaches to same. It seems to come to an early conclusion, only to go on to further complexities. A friend with whom I saw and discussed the film differed from me in her opinion on whether the proper decision was made in the end.Gone, Baby, Gone is highly recommended for its performances, particularly that of Amy Madigan, and for its overall quality.

I needed more from the senior detectives, less of the horrible first half performances from such as the bar thugs, and others.

Emotional pornography,"Ben Affleck has created a movie in which his scrawny little brother Casey can act out his wet dreams of playing a tough guy. It's pathetic from the syrupy opening sequence where we discover the ""heart"" of the local people of Boston, all the way to the end, where Casey avenges then deaths of all the little innocent children and slain heroes. Watching this movie was wallowing in bad, emotional pornography.The movie is a series of vignettes in which the littlest Affleck gets to show what a bad ass he wants to be. The plot winds on and on as Casey saves the day scene after scene. There is no trajectory to the story, no sense of rhythm, just back-fired catharsis after back-fired catharsis. It's mind-numbing. You will hear ""for the sake of the children"" until you want to stuff cotton in your ears. I can't imagine any self-respecting writer actually putting this schlock on paper.So what does the movie do? Affleck's redundantly long film massages the prostate gland of gun-toting, vigilante-wannabes who think the best way to extract justice is by ""taking care of things themselves"" and ""taking justice into their own hands"" and watching movies about bad asses. The LAST thing America moviegoers need is another film to stroke the egos of puffed-up, self-righteous violence mongers. The movie is basically Team America with a dramatic score.Please do not support this kind of movie-making. It's pathetic. We can do better.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Outstanding thriller with a great understory.,"Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck): He lied to me. Now I can't think of one reason big enough for him to lie about that's small enough not to matter.I didn't see the trailer for this movie, so when that came came out I was surprised. I had a feeling about Detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris), but it was nothing like what happened.It was this line, and many more like it, that stood out in this great first directorial effort and screenplay by Ben Affleck, based on a Dennis Lahane novel.Casey Affleck has gone way beyond the Ocean's movies with his role in this film. He played it with just the right amount of finesse. Nothing over the top. He was supported wonderfully by Michelle Monaghan, who just keeps impressing me with better and better performances.I really got drawn into this film because of two facts: one, I spent nine years working with the types of people in this film. I am no stranger to pedophiles and sex abusers, and completely understood Affleck's response. I have dealt with more than my share of trailer trash, and this film shows that not all of them live in trailers. All this sets up the reason why I am so drawn to the TV show ""House."" Everything is not black and white. There is so much gray that it makes it difficult to know what is right. This movie shows a whole lot of that gray and questions I have answered or seen answered on the job and in courts. If you want to see a good taste of the daily routine of child abuse, then this is what it is all about - neglect by those who are consumed by alcohol and drugs. There are no answers hers, just as there are no answers in real life - just hoping you make the best decision.Ed Harris, Amy Ryan, Morgan Freeman, John Ashton - I know I'll miss some great performance, but I can't list the whole cast.First, Mystic River, now Gone Baby Gone; I can't wait for the next Lehane novel to be brought to the screen - Shutter Island in 2009 - and I sure hope Ben Affleck is a big part of it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Be Affleck crafts one the years best films, or would have been except its source material breaks apart in the final stretch to the end","Ben Affleck marches toward an eventual Best Director Oscar, maybe not this year, but mark my words he will be getting one if he repeats his stellar work on Gone Baby Gone.This is the story of a private detective and his partner who are asked by the family of a missing girl to help the police. The family knows that some people won't talk to cops so they hire Casey Affleck to augment the investigation. It quickly transpires that the loving mother was far from saintly and that there are other problems in the investigation.Brilliantly acted and monstrously wonderful on a technical end this film hopefully will get a boat load of Oscar nominations for all concerned at years end. Casey Affleck, Ed Harris and pretty much everyone else are at the top of the game and reason enough to watch the film. Director Ben Affleck has created a film that is a masterpiece mood and emotion. We are in Boston and these are real people. Affleck has managed to take any notion of this being unreal and a story being performed by actors and removed it from our minds. Thats a huge order when faced with titans like Harris and Morgan Freeman. Its a stellar achievement. I can't say enough, actually all I can say is that he's made something real and tangible, which is the highest praise I know.The problem with the film is the source material. Based on a book by the Author of Mystic River (another movie/story with plot holes you could drive a truck through) the film suffers from a complete break down of logic and reason in the last half. What is going on, really is so potboiler-ish as to be absurd. I kept wondering if I was missing something, and then realized I wasn't. I know that the twist and turns allow for the exploration of moral question and issues, but at the same time they are unbelievable in any real world sense. The problems are such that it keeps a good film from being what it should have been, one of the best of the year.Still the technical virtuosity of Ben Affleck and his cast make this a film that you really should see.

"a good, sturdy directorial debut for Affleck; brother Casey comes into his own playing a tough Shamus","Gone Baby Gone is only the second adaptation of a Dennis Lehane novel, and while it's going to probably be the consensus for most (including myself) that the first, Mystic River, is much better. But it might be a bit hasty to compare a film like Eastwood's to one like Ben Affleck's, as it's also his first time at the director's chair for a feature. On the terms Affleck sets it up though it's a more than credible effort. His film takes the story of an investigation into the disappearance/murder of a little Bostonian girl, and the troubles of a Detective (Casey Affleck) who can't seem to wrap his head around the holes in the story as it unfolds- the little cracks that don't make sense. It's gripping mostly as a procedural, and mostly as a revelatory look at the corruptibility of men holding on to power. And it's also interesting in that the mother of the child, played in one of the best turns from the actors by Amy Ryan, isn't some helpless victim but is a druggie and, very likely, an unfit mother. Though not to spoil much in the film, this adds just the right hint of moral complexity to the end of the film, albeit in some contrivance.In fact, it's little moments, both stylistically and substantively, that slightly hamper Gone Baby Gone. How many times, for example, have we seen the grainy flashback-montages of past events suddenly reconstructed (it might be a change not to see this but to have the audience think these bits out). And the factor of the character Angie is almost irrelevant, which is strange as- from what I've heard of the books- she's supposed to be much more stronger and on-par with Affleck's character, here reduced to either a weepy girlfriend or an underused detective's partner. Plus, the masked-bar robbery and the immediate aftermath is a little far-fetched. Still, these criticisms shouldn't stop anyone interested in the premise or the cast to see the film, in the theater especially. I liked seeing the urban sprawl and the seedier joints (and people, can't forget that), as Affleck goes a step further than Eastwood, and probably even Scorsese, in showcasing the nature of the city the events take place, more akin to noir than anything else.And Affleck's little brother, Casey, does a lot with what should be a typical gumshoe part. He plays tough for about 90% of the film, but rarely this year has there been a performance so compelling with emotions and focus so set dead-on. Going from a part like in Ocean's Thirteen to Gone Baby Gone is not an easy stretch, as the aimless quality of humor turns to the stark quality of a guy who straddles the line of everyman to bad-ass without missing a beat. For whatever slip-ups Affleck encounters as director, his cast (his brother, and particularly Harris, Freeman gets back to shape after repeatedly playing God), and his sense of place and time, make Gone Baby Gone a small slice of sublime dark drama, neo-noir with a twist of attitude and pathos.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Do you know people in the neighborhood who don't talk to the police?,"Gone Baby Gone is directed by Ben Affleck and Affleck co-adapts the screenplay with Aaron Stockard from the novel of the same name written by Dennis Lehane. It stars Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, John Ashton and Amy Ryan. Music is by Harry Gregson Williams and cinematography by John Toll.Private Investigators Patrick Kenzie (Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Monaghan) are hired to find missing child Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien). It appears to be a simple case of a kidnapping, but the deeper the investigators go the darker the truths become.A potent drama, Gone Baby Gone offers up a mystery that is propelled by moral murkiness. Unsurprisingly given it's from a Lehane novel, the twists and deep characterisations dovetail seamlessly with the very real feel of a Boston neighbourhood, the sense of place and community superbly marshalled by Ben Affleck (in what was his debut as a director). The story is so strong it makes us the viewers part of the search for missing Amanda, which in turn forces us to answer the ethical quandaries thrust upon Patrick Kenzie.With tech credits firmly in the plus column and the director un-showy and assured enough to keep the key third act from dragging the picture down, this proves to be very good film making. Pic only has minor faults to be bothered by. Monaghan is a fine actress but she is hard to take here in a street wise role, though with a nicely cast Casey Affleck dominating their scenes she gets away with it. The sharp of mind should pick up on what is driving the mystery forward, whilst the ambiguity at resolution point can go either way for respective viewers appreciation or otherwise. But this is all told a rewarding piece of adult cinema and recommended for sure. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Masterfully Crafted Descent into White Trash Hell,"In some ways, ""Gone Baby Gone"" plays like a horror film. It depicts a seedy world full of drug dealers, murderers, corrupt cops, pedophiles, child killers, and down-on-their-luck Bostonians trapped in an urbanized ""white trash"" hell where the two African-American characters, a Haitian drug lord and a noble police chief (Morgan Freeman), wield the most power from opposite sides of the law. Director Affleck showers his hometown with humanistic shots of everyday people milling about, seemingly minding their own business, while their world decays and rots around them. The socio-political subtexts of ""Gone Baby Gone"" tick quietly like a time-bomb underneath the surface of an otherwise rote crime flick about the race to find a missing four year-old girl. I imagine this deep, dark, and morally questionable under-pinning is what has kept mainstream audiences from connecting with the film while critics have hailed it as a masterpiece.Adapted from a Dennis Lehane novel (author of the similarly themed and depressing ""Mystic River""), ""Gone Baby Gone"" is masterfully crafted from the opening shot to the closing scene. Ben Affleck proves to be a far better talent behind the screen than in front of it, and while the casting of his younger brother in the lead role may seem like nepotism, Casey Affleck gives a richly complex performance as the private eye who uncovers the truth behind the kidnapping of the little girl. The dialog, strung poetically with grim and vulgar Bostonian street-talk, reminded me of ""Good Will Hunting."" With Ben Affleck credited as a co-screenwriter here, this film disproves the popular myth that Matt Damon (or an unnamed third party) was the primary force behind their Oscar-winning screenplay for ""Good Will Hunting.""Like the best of the actors-turned-directors (Robert Redford, or ""Mystic River"" maestro Clint Eastwood), Ben Affleck is able to get his cast to deliver amazingly rich performances oozing with pathos. Ed Harris, who sometimes over-acts in one-note fashion, is a powerhouse as the lead officer on the case and delivers quite possibly the best performance of his career; his character's seething rage and fractured view of justice will leave you literally shaking. Amy Ryan, as the strung-out mother of the girl, delivers the type of pitch-perfect portrayal that the Supporting Actress Oscar was tailor made for. Casey Affleck, following his great turn in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" shows that he is an actor to be reckoned with, raw and emotive, and equal or superior in many ways to contemporaries like Ryan Gosling. Older brother Ben is such an actor's director, he even manages to deliver a heartbreaking scene towards the end where Michelle Monaghan (in the otherwise thankless role of girlfriend and partner to the male lead) displays a range you didn't see coming.For the acting, for the dialog, for the intricately complex and devastating crime drama that unfolds, and yes, for the directing, ""Gone Baby Gone,"" as depressing a piece of subversion as it is, ranks as one of the year's very best.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Gone Baby Gone,"Gone Baby Gone I like Casey Affleck and his acting. Knowing Ben Affleck has directed this movie, made me more interested to see it. Reading good reviews and knowing about the story I ventured out to see it.This is a story of a private detective Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) who gets an assignment to track a missing child. Circumstances lead him to the family of the missing child and then the town police chief Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) and detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris). Here he unravels some disturbing truths about drug abuse in family, kidnapping rackets and an underlying mystery. I will not disclose the mystery to dilute your interest in the movie. However, this leaves Patrick in a professional, ethical emotional and moral dilemma. How he overcomes that at the end of the movie.Casey Affleck has his own style of acting and he has done a good job at it. Same thing is with Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris who have given competent performances. The direction is apt by Ben Affleck. He has done a good job on his directorial debut.The downtown and neighborhood is captured beautifully. Some sequences are also technically of high directional value  especially worth remembering are the ones when the detectives barge into the suspected child kidnappers and silent moments Casey has with his girl friend.Overall a good movie.(Stars 6.5 out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Ben has some how managed get some forgettable performances from Freeman and Harris.Last... But not the least, Casey Affleck. Ben has tried to show his lil bro Casey as a super cool stud with some hard hitting lines. But then... The lines don't fit in and Casey's dialog delivery is very amateur to say the least.

Gravitas without Gigli,"Something about Dorchester, Ma., makes directors such as Gus van Sant (GoodWill Hunting), Clint Eastwood (Mystic River), Martin Scorsese (Departed), and now neophyte Ben Affleck (Gone Baby Gone) go for its working-class realism that celebrates the abrasive friendships of hard-knocks' sharing and the comfort of life-long neighborhoods. In Gone, Affleck's script recalls the lost child motif of Mystic and the betrayals of Departed, with less of the latter's intensely-felt terror and more of the former's existential angst.Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan are hired to find a missing little girl, but as any aficionado of the thriller knows, there's much more to the plot than this. While the first hour plods through the increasingly boring CSI rituals of gathering evidence, the last 45 min. are reflections about the demands a conscience makes on contemporary relativistic challenges that could be settled at either end of the ethical spectrum.If you allow me the almost irrelevant example, the Iraq war could be thought of as the greatest humanitarian effort in the world's history or the greatest foreign relations blunder in American history, depending on how you view things. Affleck's film engages this kind of Platonic give and take between the ideal and the real with a denouement that leans toward the ideal without fully making its case.In other words, I liked the dialogue between police captain Morgan Freeman and private detective Affleck about the fate of the lost child, a sparring that raises the film from mediocre whodunit into a dissertation about the ethical maxim that the ends do not justify the means. Along the way, Dorchester is evoked with more realism than in Mystic River, largely through montages and cutaways of real denizens and a few local actors.But the film's adherence to clichéd cop techniques such as interminable interviews with locals to build a case keeps this from being a groundbreaking effort by the new helmer. But, hey, even Eastwood used these techniques. Yet, Eastwood has gravitas and no Gigli.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Effective Affleck,"Police and private detectives investigate the disappearance of a little girl in Boston. A surprisingly effective directorial debut for Affleck, who creates a grim atmosphere and elicits good performances from his cast, particularly brother Casey as a tough detective and Harris as a grizzled cop. However, Ryan steals the film in a standout performance as the mother of the missing girl, a floozy of a woman. Because of the setting and genre, it invites comparisons to ""Mystic River"" and ""The Departed."" It's not as good as either of those, but is an absorbing film nevertheless.

The real dark of a soul lies beneath the surface.,"This is the first movie that shows the art of direction of an ex-blockbuster actor like Ben Affleck, and, i must say, i'm really impressed. Based on another stunning novel by American author Dennis Lehane, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a cold,sad,moving and unpredictable masterpiece in his genre. Affleck stars his brother Casey in the role of a young private investigator chasing the kidnappers of a little girl, daughter of a drug addict. The movie unfold slowly on the dark side. The cast is perfect and the direction of Ben can show us the multiple faces of Boston, of his people, with the voice of Casey that explain us, like a guide to tourists, how people lives, how people struggle in his neighborhood, without hope, without color, in a twilight-zone existence, and the truth is far from easy... A movie that rise from the others of his genre because has the ability to move different ideas, deep thoughts in the finale. It's not easy to direct a movie like that, it's not easy to use a topic so delicate yet so dark like kidnappings, but here Affleck shows that he can truly amaze us, so that we can breathe the real atmosphere of a plastic reality where the real life, the real problems, the real dark lies beneath our smiling faces.Go see it if you haven't yet.

Casey Affleck is simply stunning in this role, co-written and directed by his brother, and upheld by a fabulous supporting cast.Although this is based on Dennis Lehane's novel, this runs in the beginning like it could have been inspired rather by Caylee Anthony's disappearance, but the story quickly turns around and takes control of itself as its own work. This is really amazing, and is highly underrated, in my opinion.One thing is for sure, I'll not dismiss Casey Affleck's work ever again. That's for sure.

"Tension, morality, and choice","Gone Baby Gone feels like Affleck is making amends with the audience for the one too many mistakes he has claimed to make throughout his decade-long career as an actor. From beginning in heavy-dramas to the occasional comedy in the nineties, to sporadically diverse films like the passable Daredevil and the odious Surviving Christmas, also making tabloid headlines for his relationship with Jennifer Lopez, Affleck's career has been inconsistent and sometimes even depressingly bleak. I have always stood firm on my praise for the man; he plays one of the best straight-men in films and always takes a confident step on to the screen, asserting his determined mindset and impenetrable swagger.Affleck has informed me that as far as power goes, I haven't seen nothing yet. He takes a bold leap in the director's chair with this picture, as he films his younger brother Casey assuming a role of great impact. He plays private investigator Patrick Kenzie and is partners with his girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan).The two have recently been hired to find a young kidnapped eight-year-old named Amanda (Madeline O'Brien), yet find complications arousing at every corner from the girl's drug addicted mother, Helene (Amy Ryan), two other cops working the case (Ed Harris and John Ashton), and the police chief (Morgan Freeman). And do not fall under the impression that this is a straight-forward, linear cop drama, because Gone Baby Gone hesitates not to employ twists and turns in every direction; much like a real private investigation.The film's beautifully authentic photography turns Boston into its own grim character, depicting a working class city with a lion's weight of pressure at rest on its shoulders. Performance-wise, the film is highly significant, with Casey taking a good portion of the credit, proving his name should be just as popular as his brother's. It also goes with saying Morgan Freeman is effective and convincing here, and Michelle Monaghan takes the role of Patrick's girlfriend with a pleasing amount of substance, fortunately evading the depressing cliché of ""the girlfriend role."" The brothers Affleck prove that both are worthy of recognition, and both can provide their viewers with a rousing, unsettling setup sure to bring up debate and dissent. Gone Baby Gone isn't as forceful or as gripping and effective as Clint Eastwood's Mystic River (perhaps the only way for the film to be made is that it must be captured through a cold lens), yet its audacious writing and directing provides the audience with one of Affleck's admirably slickest efforts in film.Starring: Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, Amy Ryan, and John Ashton.

A great directorial debut from Ben Affleck,"'Gone Baby Gone' is a fantastic film. It is the sort of film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, thinking to yourself what the outcome will be. There's plenty of scenarios that went through my head as the film progressed. There is plenty of twists and turns and the flashbacks link the film together well to fully explain what has happened.When I started watching, all I knew was roughly what the plot was. I didn't expect it to be so complex and thrilling with so much more going on that just an investigation. It really will keep you guessing.I haven't read the book so I don't know if some cast members aren't a true representation of their character. But I can say I thought they all done a great job at making this film believable. I thought Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan were superb in the lead roles. Morgan Freeman was as good as ever, he wasn't in it much but by the end you will see he plays a key role in the story. Amy Ryan who played the missing child's mother was also superb as well as all of the supporting cast.It's a tension building story that I can't recommend highly enough. I really enjoyed it. Cleverly made, well acted, good action and great suspense. A great directorial debut from Ben Affleck.

"GONE BABY GONE (Ben Affleck, 2007) ***","This is another Oscar contender I managed to catch in time for the ceremony; I’ve never been taken in by Ben Affleck’s supposed acting talent – but it’s also true that his endeavors in other fields, such as his Oscar-winning writing credit on GOOD WILL HUNTING (1997) and his directorial debut here, have been worthier of consideration! The film garnered a fair bit of controversy due to its plot line about the alleged kidnapping of a toddler mirroring the real-life case of Madeleine McCann, in which her own parents may or may not have been implicated; without spoiling the eventual revelation, this element is present in the film as well – but it has been given a decidedly Hollywoodian thriller slant!Anyway, I have to admit that I was expecting this to be a sentimental melodrama as opposed to a compelling thriller in the MYSTIC RIVER (2003) mould; even if the leads (Casey Affleck, the director’s younger brother, and Michelle Monaghan) are far too young to convince as detectives, the film finds veteran Ed Harris (that most underrated of today’s character actors) in sterling form as a shady cop – abetted by the quiet fortitude of the no-less reliable Morgan Freeman as the Head of a Special Section in the local police force dedicated to missing children (which he personally instigated following the loss of his own daughter!) and, especially, a very good i.e. showy Oscar-nominated showcase for virtual unknown Amy Ryan as the little girl’s ‘bad influence’ mum (foul-mouthed and more prone to sleeping around, coke-snorting and drug-dealing than fostering). Perhaps the film’s greatest coup is that the ending offers no easy answers as to whether a child should be allowed to stay with an irresponsible parent simply for reasons of lineage, given the devastating effect this could have on the former’s grown-up life.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Gone Baby Gone is full of twists and turns that take you on a powerful, uncompromising journey of pain and deceit","Ben Affleck has shed beautiful light on his talent as an actor on screen. But about his talent behind the camera? Making his directorial debut, Affleck crafts a dark and twisted tale about every parent's worst nightmare: the kidnapping of a child. Packed with unexpected twists and powerful emotional resonance to keep the heart pounding to its very last breath, Gone Baby Gone is an uncomfortably profound experience that dares to leave you convinced of the unsettling events that unfold on screen, the opening minutes of exposition, to the shocking twist of moral dilemmas and the blurred lines between right and wrong. By no means is this a comfortable picture to sit through. It is dark, grisly story where the moments are levity are as scarce as water in the desert. After all, the events are inspired by the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane who also wrote 'Mystic River'. Set in Boston, the director's hometown, this film follows Patrick Kenzie (played by Casey Affleck, Ben's younger brother) and Angie Gennaro (played by Michelle Monaghan), two private detectives who are hired by Lionel (played by Titus Welliver) and Bea McCready (played by Amy Madigan) to go under investigation for their missing four-year-old niece Amanda, initially against the will of her drug-addicted mother (played by Amy Ryan). As the two dive deeper and deeper into the investigation, they are confronted with suspicious secrets involving local drug dealers, gang members, and the local law enforcement that leaves them questioning everything they about this case.Thanks to Ben Affleck, this is a mystery/thriller that avoids following the tracks of a straightforward narrative, but instead drives its stories through misdirection and moral ambiguity to leave you questioning every character involved with this case. Although the story takes a while to pick up with its slow exposition during the first half, it powerfully builds up the layers of the characters and sets up for the rigid complexity of the story. Much of this pays off during the final stretch when the lead character Patrick and Angie are forced to confront against the demons that threaten their moral pedestals. And Affleck captures the events with pure grit and emotional magnitude with just enough tension leave viewers shivering in their seats. Setting the action in the middle-class Boston is perhaps no surprise as Affleck knows the town very well, but he also uses this location to great advantage by capturing the dour environment of a place riddled with crime, drugs, and prostitution. Once the events finally reach a conclusion, there is still a sense of uncertainty underlined by moral ambiguity of the characters. At the end, viewers are likely to find themselves divided on whether the character made the right decision or not. It comes to show that no goods come without punishment. As for Casey Affleck, he puts on a great performance. Though nothing I would consider Oscar-worthy, it effectively shows he has the acting chops he rarely gets the demonstrate unlike his older brother. Michelle Monaghan makes good use of her talent as well. Again, nothing that shouts for Oscars. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, unsurprisingly put on blissful performances. Arguably the most profound display in the roster is Amy Ryan who makes a convincing impression of a mother with a low-life persona who nonetheless is anxious of finding her daughter, even though her volatile personality does little to show it. The movie never lets any of its inspiring stars go to waste.Gone Baby Gone is a profoundly riveting mystery/thriller with a patent of powerhouse performances, an uncompromising package of snappy twists and turns, and a surprisingly strong directorial efforts by Ben Affleck. It is not a pretty picture, it is a dark one bound to leave even the most desensitized viewers squirming in their seats. Bloody is also a word not worth leaving out. Above all, it proves Affleck has just as much charismatic talent behind the camera as does in front.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"GONE BABY GONE : Evidence That Affleck Has Potential As A Director, But Not A Perfect Piece...","GONE BABY GONEAs an avid non-fan of Ben Affleck, I disregarded GONE BABY GONE when it first hit theatres because of my skepticism. When the reviews hit, it started to seem like I wasn't giving Affleck a fair chance b/c critics were favorable. But I allowed myself to believe the positive reviews Affleck received for HOLLYWOODLAND and go see the movie with an open mind... let's just say HOLLYWOODLAND was not a good experience for me and I fervently disagree with the critics on that one! So I was wary of GONE BABY GONE from the start. However, as the film managed to keep some presence through awards-season (for both Amy Ryan and Ben Affleck as a debut filmmaker) my curiosity got the better of me. I'm glad it did.Not to say that GONE BABY GONE is a perfect film, it does feel a little like a first-time directorial effort. However, it's a film that shows Affleck might have promise as a director that he does not hold as an actor. GONE BABY GONE is a solid crime drama that tells the story of an abducted young girl through the eyes of a private investigator with no experience on this kind of case.Casey Affleck, in a solid performance, plays Patrick Kenzie, a young man who's lived in Boston his whole life and now works as an independent investigator alongside his girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan). Angie and Patrick are roped in to ""enhance"" the ongoing investigation that is taking place to locate a young girl named Amanda McReady. She is the daughter of a drug-runner (Amy Ryan), and she has disappeared under mysterious circumstances from an unhappy home. With the help of Detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris), Patrick tries to find a way to balance his ethical beliefs with the necessary decisions his line of work present him with. But as Patrick and Angie uncover more of the truth, it becomes apparent this is nothing close to a typical abduction.The film spends the first half of it's running time exploring the story as if it is your standard kidnapping investigation, but in the second half there is a major shift that brings the film into a totally different direction. The film has received comparisons to both MYSTIC RIVER and THE DEPARTED for basic reasons... using the Boston landscape most obviously. But the film does feel like a blend of the two films, that doesn't quite find the perfect balance to make it all work. Half of the film focuses on the human drama of an abduction like this (like MYSTIC RIVER), while the other half explores corruption vs. honor (like THE DEPARTED). These two parts never come together perfectly for GONE BABY GONE, but it still never goes completely off the rails.Casey Affleck carries the film well and offers the movie's most nuanced and fully felt performance for my tastes. He proves that he is able to take his conversational and laid back approach to dialogue and lace it with gravitas just as well as he is able to lace it with humor (as exemplified in the OCEAN'S films). Amy Ryan has received a great deal of critical acclaim and awards attention for her performance as the burnt-out mother of the abducted child, and she does a phenomenal job of fully embodying Helene McReady. However, her screen time is limited and the character doesn't really have a change of heart. She is a one-note mess of a woman, and a frustrating one at that. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman offer typically solid performances, but it's nothing new to see from them. Meanwhile, Monaghan escapes unscathed, but her character has virtually no definition. Though she is always present, she feels remarkably unnecessary and her relationship with Frankie does little to strengthen the films primary themes.Overall, GONE BABY GONE is a solid, though unremarkable film. It vastly exceeded any expectations I would have placed on a Ben Affleck film however, and I won't avoid his film in theatres next time.... B- ...",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
extremely powerful drama,"I was never much of a fan of either Ben or Casey Affleck, and so originally had no desire to see this film. But I kept hearing good things about it, and so tuned in one afternoon when I saw that it was on TV, coming in midway through the film. I watched about five minutes before turning the TV off -- not because I didn't like what I saw, but because I was so impressed that I wanted to order the film and watch it from the beginning. I wasn't disappointed; this is the film that made me a fan of both Afflecks.Casey is terrific as the gumshoe searching for a missing little girl through the gritty, dangerous streets of a very blue-collar Boston neighborhood, sticking his nose into places where he is so obviously not welcome. Ben Affleck's direction is incredibly deft, patient, and subtle. There are a myriad of twists and turns, not just in the plot but in the characters themselves; everyone has a dark side and even most of the so-called bad guys have understandable, even noble motivations.This is a drama but be forewarned: there are several bursts of very graphic violence and the language is very, very rough. There are no easy, pat, Hollywood-type solutions to this film, either, and some viewers may be frustrated by the ending, but that's exactly one of the reasons that I found it so satisfying; it feels messy and real.

The audience never truly learns enough about each characters traits to understand why each decides to do what they do. When it is revealed the role each character has in the events that unfold it is very quick and some of the dramatic impact is lost because of this speed and lack of familiarity with the characters.Furthermore I feel like the side plot with the cocaine addicted family with the pedophile son gets way too much screen time. They are given so much time that you would expect that it should connect to the main plot in a way more than it does. It's only real purpose is to trigger Remy's speech on having to pick a side and willing to stretch the rules to do what's right per se. Ed Harris is also fantastic in the role but as I mentioned earlier I needed more dialogue to appreciate why he made the decisions he did,Lastly I think the moral debate that is raised at the end of the story is a false dichotomy and therefore didn't have me as interested as I'd hoped. There were certainly other options that Casey Afflecks character would have in this scenario. I will leave those up for you to think up as I do not want to spoil the entire film.Nevertheless , the fine performances make the film worth a watch , but I'm perhaps not as high on the story as others.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
good murky crime drama,"It's a lower class Boston neighborhood. There's a little girl missing and her mother is Helene McCready (Amy Ryan). Lionel (Titus Welliver) and Bea McCready (Amy Madigan) hire P.I. couple Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to find her. They normally don't do these types of cases. However the case isn't all that simple. Helene is a drug addict. Police captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) is in charge and doesn't care for the newbies. Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) are the cops running the case. Soon they discover that Helene had ripped off a drug dealer named Cheese.Ben Affleck has a real eye and ear for these characters. This is a good murky crime drama. Better still, Casey Affleck gives a real break out performance. Amy Ryan is just as good as the white trash mother character. I'm only disappointed with Michelle Monaghan. She's a little stiff and couldn't dig deeper than what's on the surface. I wish they let her pull a knife at least. I like that the story isn't a straight line. The story takes a break in the middle and it has some good twists.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fine debut for Affleck,"I noticed Gone Baby Gone had received fairly positive reviews from the critics, so I decided to go and check it out. It's the directorial debut for Ben Affleck and he's crafted a fine movie. The key casting is his brother Casey as Patrick Kenzie who is a private detective. A high profile child abduction case leads to him being hired to investigate on the basis that the fellow locals are more likely to speak to him than the police.I really enjoy films that make you consider your own values and prejudices and this film falls very much into that category. It's a very fine film and it's only the rather contrived conclusion to the film and the somewhat pointless female partner in life and business that spoils a perfect 10. With Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris providing support you are guaranteed a good cast and Casey does well to take the acting honours. Fine film!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Drew me in, spat me out, GREAT movie!","I think that people are so mean and selfish nowadays that the concept of a ""good"" conspiracy just doesn't occur to us. That's why this movie is such a surprise and is so effective.Kudos to the Affleck brothers. Both of them are extremely talented. Harris was exquisite as some kind of godlike knight in the guise of the epitome of a hard bitten cop. I usually hate cops as a matter of principle, but Harris really had me going there. And WHO was that guy playing the ex-alcoholic uncle? He was so authentic he just blew me away. He had a pivotal role in this movie and whoever hired him should be commended for choosing him for the part.BUT : There were parts of the movie where what the actors said was hard to hear, and this is definitely the only reason for me giving it a nine instead of a ten. Affleck should get his pipes operated on, because he shows much promise as an actor, but he sounds like a cat with his throat cut being introduced to the dark side of vise grips. And through all this noise, I never got to hear WHO was that little girl in the bathtub. Where did she come from? If that isn't explained away satisfactorily, the whole movie's just another cheap sham and crumbles away.Excusing this anomaly, putting it down to the defective sound quality and going on with it, I really was drawn in. I watched it at home and the ending had me swearing, gnashing my teeth and furiously pounding the table. That's exactly what a good movie should do.Just before the credits, when Affleck's character does his ""benevolent watcher"" bit, if you had given me a free ticket to smoke some people, nobody would have come out of that house alive but the little girl.""God protect us from other people's good intentions"" should be the tagline for this movie.Definitely one of my ""might buy"" DVDs. If I find an explanation for the girl in the bathtub...",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Small enough not to matter,"Greetings again from the darkness. Ben Affleck loves cameras. Doesn't seem to matter to him if he is front or behind. As a director, he still tries to be the star. The heavy handed camera work throughout the film really detracts from a decent story that could have benefited from a more seasoned filmmaker. Enough already with the swooping shots from the helicopter, and the grainy night shots showing the tough street types. Nice work from a film a student.On the other hand, brother Casey does a very admirable job as the lead in this multi-layered story that really doesn't hold surprises, but is fun to watch unfold. Casey's deadpan delivery, stoic stares, monotone mutterings and baby face features combine to give a unique look to our hero. This plays well against the liveliness of the stunningly talented Michelle Monaghan and the heavy screen presence of Morgan Freeman and the manic frenzy of Ed Harris. Young Casey is the calm in the eye of the storm.Other nice supporting turns are from Amy Ryan, who shows us how not to win mommy of the year; Amy Madigan and Titus Welliver. Additionally, director Ben flashes some of the ugliest humans this side of the Springer show or a Michael Moore documentary. Some would be right at home in the State Fair freak show. That part was more gruesome than the actual violence.Most certainly this is not at the level of ""Mystic River"", ""Good Will Hunting"" or any Scorcese film, but the screenplay is interesting and worthy of film ... and lacking only a pro's touch behind the camera.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bad Baby Bad,"Where do I begin? I read several positive reviews about this film that made it sound interesting and poignant. It was apparently meant to be a film about dilemma that was primarily designed to make the viewer reflex on its message and think about their' own moral decision making. What would you do, type of thing. By the time the moral of the story came – I no longer cared. The film was a huge disappointment. First of all, the story is confusing and disjointed. Ben Affleck directs like he acts – like a teenager with A.D.D. The characters were uninteresting, unmotivated and miscast. Casey Affleck (Patrick Kenzie) as a private eye looks more like Dookie Howser than Mike Hammer. He tries so hard to master the Boston accent that he is difficult to understand - not that he has anything interesting to say. So little time is spent on character development that the viewer doesn't really care about who any of these people are or what happens to them. Michelle Monaghan literally sleep walks through her role as Affleck's girlfriend and partner, muttering a few phrases occasionally so you won't mistake her for a mannequin, but so uninspired that one wonders who she was cozy with to get the role. (I think you can all figure out how Casey Affleck got the lead role). Ed Harris, who is a good actor, does his best with the uninspired dialogue but his efforts are wasted on a part that no one could have saved. Most disappointing of all is Morgan Freemen's role as Jack Doyle. Morgan appears as an aging police official – who looks to be about 80 – who for some reason ""lost"" a 12 year old daughter. OK, that's possible, but improbable. While his name appears prominently in the advertisements for this debacle, Freeman's character shows up in about 5 minutes of the actual film. In conclusion, the acting is second rate, the characters inadequately developed and the story poorly told. Gone Baby Gone should have been titled Bad Baby Bad –it stunk.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Emotionally draining,"I had heard wonderful things about Gone Baby Gone, it was a semi-silent hit of 2007 and the first film that I've seen that was directed by Ben Affleck which was interesting to see a different side of his talents. Gone Baby Gone is one of those films that is so far from entertainment, but you'll be glad to see at least once. I think because the subject is just so disturbing and has always been a big one: ""In the best interest of the child"", what is right and what is wrong? What are your morals? But what about your conscience? The questions just boggle your mind in this deep intense drama. The actors, a surprising great performance on Casey's part, just seemed to care about this film and that was what made it work without putting people too off about Gone Baby Gone.A little girl is missing and the search by the police is just failing. When the little girl's aunt asks two private detectives, Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro, who are also boyfriend/girlfriend, to help them on the case. They learn how the drug addict/seller mother was just extremely neglectful of her child, so much to when she took money from her drug boss, he is the suspect of the case, but when that proves to be false, things get more deep and dark. After another child missing/possible murder case, Patrick does to the criminal what he feels best at the moment and then has to deal with the biggest dilemma at the end.Gone Baby Gone was one of those films that had me shaking after I watched it. I think because I was studying to become a teacher and when I was student teaching, I saw the innocence in children's eyes, why would anyone want to harm them? How could a parent risk their child's life? What lengths would you go to, just to protect a child's innocence? That's the main point of this movie I think, and the crew and cast were absolutely brilliant in maintaining the dignity this story deserved. I would recommend it for a watch, but I think once is enough for me to be honest.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Baby Don't You Cry...Here Come The Afflecks To Save The Day,"45 minutes into his new film, Gone Baby Gone, sitting in a darkened club with a thug across from him, his girlfriend and private detective associate to his right, Casey Affleck delivers one of the most threatening speeches placed on film this year. One wouldn't think so, given the boyishness of Casey, and his struggle to prove himself as a viable and relevant private investigator. The thug pulls a piece out on him, and threatens to kill him for negotiating the release of a little girl who is being held ransom, with which the thug claims he has no knowledge of. Patrick (Casey Affleck) calmly backs off, and engages in a sixty second monologue of the most amazing, threatening words of which I wish I could reproduce and yet am having trouble finding at the moment.The opening shot of Gone Baby Gone thrusts you into a world that is cruel, unkind, and with no easy answers. As matter of fact, there were no answers. Only decisions, and living with the consequences of those decisions. Our protagonist is not a hero, though he is portrayed as one. The subject matter dealt with is not good versus bad, though it would seem as such on the surface. Life for the average joe is a cruel, unkind force to be reckoned with, those who give into addictions and cause others around them to be hurt. Yet when something catastrophic happens, it doesn't change you, or the type of person you are. It only changes the world around you, and your adjustments to that new world.Casey Affleck has given his greatest performance to date. More accessible to his audience, more engaging than his character in The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford, and faced with a moral dilemma of how to distinguish if there really are opposites in a society which paints them as so. Taking comfort in his native Boston accent, Casey Affleck loses himself in his role. This was not the little boy I grew up watching in the Ocean series, the secondary character who shoots off wise cracking lines to his buddies. This was a young, fresh faced man faced with the impossible task of finding a little girl declared missing. He's loving, but cynical. He's tender, but tough, and not afraid to do what is necessary to get the job done.Ben Affleck, of all people, has given me a film I've long desired this entire year. A smart, intelligent, realistic film that thrills and saddens. The script is amazing, the way everything falls into place by the end of its run time. My body was tense throughout the film. The acting of all involved was impeccable, from Morgan Freeman (whose character takes a surprising turn), to Ed Harris (the man is a chameleon), to the tragically underused Michelle Monaghan. He gives them the room needed to give their characters the dimension and emotion they deserve. If he can continue with this much care and detail to his films, he has a bright future behind the camera. Absolutely brilliant his first time out.Much like life, this film leaves you with no answers as to what a good decision is or is not. The moral dilemmas we face everyday are embodied in Patrick Kenzie, and like him, we sit, dazed and confused, at the implausible and unbelievable atrocities that make up our society.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A Deep Dive into Moral Uncertainties,"After the end of ""Gone Baby Gone"" I feel deeply thoughtful and a little unsettled, which I think is exactly what the movie aims to do. At one point I thought the movie was over and it had just begun. As someone who watches a lot of movies, predictability used to bother me, but I didn't experience that in this movie. Casey Affleck, as a private detective, gives a subtle depth to a character who is torn between what is legal and what is right, and gives a great performance. The use of camera and shooting techniques increase the tension and atmosphere of the movie, drawing the audience into the story. Director Ben Affleck takes a careful, character-driven approach to the dark themes, which makes the story all the more compelling. The moral questions raised are weighty and leave you thinking long after the movie is over. The direction is sharp and perfectly balances the bleak mood of the movie with moments of intense action, making it a compelling viewing experience. This movie not only entertains but also challenges you to rethink right and wrong. Highly recommended for those who appreciate thought-provoking and controversial cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good enough to make one forgive Affleck for Phantoms... almost.,"A little girl is reported missing. Her name is Amanda MacReady and she is 4, she appears cute, innocent and photogenic – so her picture is all over the news, as is her mother Helene pleading for help. The local police are all over the case, lead by Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman), who has lost a child of his own.Helene's brother Lionel and wife Bea are not as confident in the police's ability to track down their beloved niece, so at the urging of Bea they contact a local finder of missing people to assist in the search, hoping that local knowledge will help.Enter Patrick (Casey Affleck) & Angela (Michelle Monaghan), a young couple in their early 30s who use their local contacts and smarts to track down people – though not normally children. Angela is especially reluctant to take the case, fearing what a negative outcome might do psychologically with a 4 year old involved.Bea however is quite persuasive and frankly desperate for help, so they decide to have a quick look at Amanda's room and a quick chat with her Mum Helene before declining the job offer and this is where we learn quite a deal more than we had to this point.It turns out that away from the cameras and sympathetic faces that Helene is a very different person indeed – in short she is a pointless waste of inferior DNA: a drunk, drugged, ignorant, neglectful, judgmental slut who at times genuinely expresses a desire to be reunited with her daughter, only on her terms and if she doesn't have to help out in any way.Faced with this knowledge Patrick decides that Amanda deserves all the help she can get.The Boston PD aren't initially helpful – Jack Doyle actively warns the young couple away from the case and expresses real reluctance to provide the assistance and co-operation that they are entitled to as Missing Person Detectives – but once it is obvious that the two are ""in"" a meeting is arranged with the two lead detectives on the case, Remy (Ed Harris) and Nick (Beverley Hills Cop's ""Taggert"" himself John Ashton). During the meeting once again it appears that Patrick is being mentally mocked by the more senior detectives until he gives the detectives a breakthrough that he sourced through discussions with some, let's say, ""colourful locals'. The breakthrough information disputes an earlier account made by Helene, so they all head back to reopen questioning.The ensuing investigation takes the now quasi-quartet deep into the seedy underbelly of the Boston area, along the way they encounter drug users and dealers, thugs and general low-lives – most disturbingly the trail seems to lead to some known paedophiles that reside in the area. While Patrick is more streetwise than his missus Angie and shows a steely resolve and unwavering conviction regardless of what he is faced with, Angie is apparently witnessing the real world for the first time at its lowest ebb, and it would be fair to say that she is gobsmacked and somewhat out of her depth.There are red herrings, dead ends galore and new developments to be dealt with. Just when it seems that they are closing in on the truth something – or someone – new pops up out of the blue to provide further confusion. Because we as the audience are discovering along with the investigators there is genuine interest and at times surprise as the truth gradually unravels.Without detailing all the twists and turns I must point out one scene in particular which takes Patrick and an acquaintance deep into the underground, after a tense Silence of the Lambs style standoff the conclusion of the scene triggers events that escalate proceedings towards the conclusion.Despite my trepidation at seeing the name Ben Affleck on the poster, and the somewhat depressing subject matter, I love Gone Baby, Gone. The dialogue is gritty and realistic, the performances uniformly great, especially Ben's little bro Casey, who as it is mentioned in the film does look incredibly young, but proves both as a character and an actor that impressions can be very deceiving. This young bloke already has a very impressive body of work on the CV, and without the matinée good looks seems destined for a fine career as a character actor or supporting player.On first viewing a couple years back I immediately felt that this was an especially impressive film but I thought the plot took maybe one twist too many. A second exposure to the film uncovered a wrinkle I had earlier missed, with full understanding came an even greater appreciation.I watched The Town recently and was once again impressed by Affleck's script selection and direction, The Town is a fine film – but this film is a mile better than The Town. I truly believe that if Affleck used an alias on the poster this would have received even greater acclaim and might even be seen as the decade's companion piece to Memento or Children of Men – Gone Baby, Gone is THAT good.Final Rating – 9 / 10. A labyrinthine plot, excellent performances and uniform credibility across the board make Gone Baby, Gone one of the top films of the last decade.

More violence than I prefer and kind of depressing.If you know someone who's going to become a police officer or social worker - they should watch this one.There's a lot of Catholicism, too.

A powerful crime thriller,"Ben Affleck's film directorial debut is nothing short of amazing. I have never been so fond of him as an actor, but I do think he has a future in writing and directing films. He along with Aaron Stockard have created a great script and have made a film that is powerful, riveting, and very entertaining.The performances here are great. Morgan Freeman does his usual self of creating a very emphasized character, and the whole other supporting cast was great, including Ed Harris. I thought that they could have picked a better actress for the character of Angie Gennaro, but Michelle Monaghan eventually grew on me. But the film is also this great because of two performances. One of them comes from the award-nominated performance of Amy Ryan. She creates a character that is very true to the life of many people in neighborhoods like this. She gave an outstanding performance, and creates ultimate likability in her character because you feel for her, even though she is also quite unlikeable in her actions. She deserved that Oscar nomination, and one of the best supporting performances of the year. However, as strong as Ryan was, the real star here is Casey Affleck. I am a huge fan of his performance in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, and I thought he gave one of the best male performances of the decade, whether it was supporting or leading. I thought he deserved that Oscar for Supporting Actor(even though I ultimately think he is leading, although it is not a huge issue). But with this he proves he is an actor capable of anything. Whereas his character of Bob in the film Jesse James was very quiet, sort of weak and manipulated, here he proves his character is a strong, mannered leading man in whatever he does. I very much enjoy watching him perform, and he deserved to get an Oscar nomination for Leading Actor, because while his role was not as showy as Ryan's, it was just as strong or even better and he holds the film together. Much better than the nominated actors of the year George Clooney and Johnny Depp.The film was brilliantly shot, and while I did think it had problems with the editing, it was not a big glitch. I thought the twist at the end was very surprising, and I thought the ending scene was so powerful and heart-breaking. The film was very entertaining, and it also raises a lot of questions about neighborhoods like this and what is better for a child that lives in these ways. I thought this was a better crime film than Fincher's, Se7en and Zodiac, and I hope it does not become forgotten over time.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Not bad, but it's no Mystic River.","As I am federally mandated to point out, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is the directorial debut of Ben Affleck, a fact that is impossible to overlook while watching the movie. Sometimes I wish I could watch a movie while completely ignorant of its director, but that's another post. Anyway, Affleck clearly cares about this crime drama, both in content and location, and his loving fingerprints mark the film with a unique raw edge.For a multitude of reasons, ""Gone Baby Gone"" can succinctly be described as a light version of ""Mystic River"", which was likewise based on a Dennis Lehane novel. The subject matter is equally heavy and thick, also exploring family dynamics through a painful crime involving a child. Both movies are set in Boston, and the one thing that ""Gone"" does better, largely due to Affleck's devotion to his hometown, is capture the seedy bizarreness of the local culture. Beyond that, ""Gone"" trails ""River"" in every aspect, not to an extent that makes ""Gone"" a poor film, but merely a decent one that does not remotely reach the great heights Clint Eastwood achieved four years ago.First, the story itself is weaker and more transparent, due in slight part to a bit of foreshadowing. The moral waters here are equally murky, but shallower once fully explored. Secondly, the cast is weaker; that's not so much a swipe at a solid troupe includes the always good Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, but rather reminds how loaded River was with proved, veteran talent (Penn, Robbins, Bacon, Fishbourne, Linney, Harden). The younger faces here, like Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, and (especially) Amy Ryan, acquit themselves well, but they do not possess the gravitas that can make such a film so much better. They are simply in a different league, the NFC versus ""River's"" superior AFC. Similarly, Affleck's movie sports an effective rough look and a less effective uneven flow, as opposed to the smooth and polished texture of Eastwood fluid masterpiece. For a first film though, Affleck's end product is impressive and worth watching for fans of the genre.Bottom Line: Always decent, sometimes quite good, but it's nowhere near ""Mystic River"". 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Dirty Dishwater,"Gone Baby Gone, adapted from a book by Dennis Lehane, the author of Mystic River, marks Ben Affleck's directorial debut. While the move did pose and interesting moral question, I found the movie confusing, unrealistic, and a little boring. The story centers around a little girls kidnapping. Casey Affleck is a private investigator hired by the missing child's aunt to supplement the police investigation.I wasn't terribly impressed with the acting. Ed Harris gives a spirited performance as a cop, and Amy Madigan matches his intensity as a protective aunt, but those were the shining stars among weak performances. Morgan Freeman disappointed me, as he is a phenomenal actor, but he plays a watered-down version of a police chief dedicated to bringing missing children home. I can't decide whether it was Michelle Monaghan's performance or the script that left me cringing every time she spoke. Casey Affleck, Ben Affleck's brother, is an actor that does possess talent, and is easy on the eyes, but like Michelle Monaghan's character, was either just poorly written, or just lukewarm in his delivery. It's possible that the casting for these two characters miss the mark, but I certainly expected more from Casey.Ben Affleck obviously strives to impress us with his directing skills, but in general, his attempt at stylish directing simply made the movie more muddled. With the numerous fades and voice-overs, it gives more of a feeling of confusion than clarity. And matching the stories dark themes with dark lighting made me wonder if I needed to adjust my television's brightness. I was also disappointed in the connection between both Afflecks and the Boston setting. Instead of making a clear connection to the neighborhood, with the exception of thick Bostonian accents, the movie could have been set in any U.S. city. The suspense seemed to come to a crescendo at least three times. The only reason I knew the movie couldn't possibly be over yet was because hardly even half and hour had passed when I thought we were reaching the climax. Ben may be able to pull it off in the future, but at this point his skills are, and come across, amateurish.The basic plot of this movie is what left me the most unsatisfied. The basic premise of the story is preposterous. I can't explain why without giving away too many details, but I would love to hear anyone disagree with me. The best part of the movie is the previously mentioned interesting moral question, which in itself could be a reason to watch this movie. But if you are hungry for movies with interesting moral questions, I would rather recommend Eye for an Eye, starring Sally Field, and again, Ed Harris.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Excellent, and a great directorial debut for Ben Affleck","Ben Affleck has taken a lot of criticism in recent years; kudos to him for staying in the fight. Here he makes his directorial debut in ""Gone Baby Gone,"" and takes a hand in the screenplay with Aaron Stockard. The story's pedigree is excellent, as it's based on a book by the author of ""Mystic River,"" Dennis Lehane.Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan are private investigators in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who are hired by the family of a kidnapped four-year-old girl. Though the police are on the case, it's felt that these two have some good connections and can get people to talk. It turns out to be a much more complicated situation than they realized, and comes down to, finally, a moral dilemma for the detectives.Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are the law here and give excellent performances, as does the low-key Affleck, who plays his role very realistically. Monaghan is very good with him, and their conflict is an interesting one that you'll be giving quite a bit of thought about after you see this film.Having watched a lot of Nancy Grace, I don't have any doubt what I would do, but everyone will come away with a different opinion, I think.

"Just Plain Bad, Regardless of the Reviews","This is just bad film-making.

engrossing and entertaining,"There's an interesting though flawed story in Gone Baby Gone, but what is most notable about the film is actually its fascinating view of the underside of a working class Boston neighborhood. There is a very authentic feel to the characters and situations. You can't call it a love letter to Boston, since it deals with the seedier parts, but there is a genuine affection for this world.In structure this is a detective movie. At times it made me think of Raymond Chandler's novels, not for the style, which is decidedly different, but for the distinct, interesting characters and the rather convoluted and unlikely story.Performances are terrific across the board, particularly from Casey Affleck and Ed Harris.The weakest element in the movie is the character of Patrick's wife Angie. The problem is not the acting (although the actress does come across as a little too stylish for her working class neighborhood), the problem is that the character seems superfluous. She is said to be Patrick's partner in the detective business, yet she acts simply as a tag along. She really doesn't do anything, take any actions, come up with any ideas; she mainly just tells Patrick everything he's thinking of doing is a mistake. If they'd just made her his wife this would have been fine, but it just seems weird to make her his partner since she seems to bring nothing to the partnership.Still, it's beautifully directed and acted and the plot has some interesting ideas, although not much one could actually call a surprise. It is overall an excellent film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lingers in your mind long after watching it...,"""Gone Baby Gone"" follows two Boston area detectives investigating a little girl's kidnapping, which ultimately turns into a crisis both professionally and personally.This film cemented Ben Affleck's career as a director and a storyteller, and very rightfully so.Long after I had finished watching the film, the main thematic question lingered in my mind, which is a merit to how much of an impact the film makes on the viewer - especially with strong imagery used to portray these theme-defining moments.Mainly, the choices that we consciously make - what is right and what is wrong? Or are they just choices that we have to make, then live with the consequences (which is easier said than done) ...Set in a run-down Bostonian environment, the milieu feels very authentic in the way it shows the people living here and their short tempers - which is obviously influenced by Ben Affleck's own Bostonian background. It was refreshing to see him having translated his experiences of the borough onto the film so well.The performances of Casey Affleck, Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are most commendable in this film - allowing the audience to empathize with their characters' actions despite the shades of grey we see in them.The scenes that unfold the plot succeed in conveying the sense of suspense, distrust and ultimately disturbance that would come from investigating a case such as this - and make excellent use of the characters to make these situations tense and unpredictable.Unlike my usual habit of thinking about a film's flaws after watching it, the only flaw I could think of here was the prominence of Michelle Monaghan's character (or lack of it). Being one of the two detectives mentioned in the premise, we never really see her do any detective work. Casey Affleck's character does all of the investigating, leaving her character sidelined, hence severely underused. Her only importance comes at the end where the protagonist has to make a major choice which would affect their relationship.But this flaw comes nowhere close to hampering the experience of watching this appreciable film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Gone Over With Much of Public,"A morally ambiguous tale is told within a quite murky structure. It seems to wander here and there, without the feeling of anything but free form. Rather reminded me a bit of that similar detective yarn of yore, ""The Big Sleep,"" in which Bogart and Bacall danced around a convoluted script--and managed to get away with it.The acting in ""Gone, Baby Gone"" is so confident and dedicated, and the production so convinced of itself, that when one ""doesn't get"" everything, one tends to think it's just their lack of understanding.I suppose if one would make the effort to analyze everything, much of it would make sense. Indeed, the production is designed to make one think all the ends are tied up. Still I've a suspicion that some of it's a conjurer's trick, through crafty writing and editing manipulation. Director Afflect shows us just what he wants us to see at any one time, leaving other ""bits of evidence"" either out or delayed, to create a ""surprise effect"" down the road.Lead actor Affect slurs and mumbles his way through his lines, I suppose giving a ""realistic"" performance. Some of the violence seemed a bit gratuitous and pat; still, I admit the plot needs some action from time to time to liven things up.How long this film will ""last"" remains to be seen. I've a feeling it won't be among the ""great"" detective stories, but only time will tell. On the positive side, Messers. Afflect and cast and crew have made a respectable piece of work, and the much of the public and critics tend to agree. ###",,Anonymous,Mystery
Powerful performances; succeeds in capturing the Boston atmosphere and a powerful morality tale,"Another in this year's continuous selection of morality tales, Gone Baby Gone raises a lot of questions; deep, resonant moral questions of course, but also some external questions that haven't to do with the film content but rather the talent behind the camera, questions also raised back in 1998. Questions like ""how is this guy, who has an unusual tendency to pick bad movie roles and the wrong people to date, so good at film-making?"", and ""why hasn't he done this stuff before?"", and ""why hasn't he done any more of this?"" Indeed Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's debut-and-only screenplay, Good Will Hunting, is one of the greatest examples of debut screen writing and is intriguing not only because it is so good as a stand-alone work, but also intriguing because the two haven't written a screenplay since. That is until now, when Affleck wrote and also chose to direct his second (mainstream) screenplay, and did such a fantastic job that it's incredibly that he didn't use his Hollywood clout to land a directing job before this one.Affleck utilizes his intimate knowledge and personal experience of the streets of Boston and employs this experience to create one of the best portrayals of rural city atmosphere in recent years. Affleck paints the seedy underbelly of Boston with immense skill, clearly making use of the sights, sounds, backgrounds and people he grew up with and even putting many of them in the film. Indeed one of the greatest elements working to the film's advantage is Affleck's spot-on brilliant ability to capture the very spirit and atmosphere of the underbelly of Boston, an ability that should leave many directors envious.Another element working to the film's advantage is the acting. Affleck directs his extremely talented actors to absolutely pitch-perfect performances, and manages to turn his younger brother into a bona-fide leading man. This role, along with his supporting turn in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, are sure to propel his star in Hollywood immensely. Affleck simply commands the film and proves that he is more than capable of carrying not only a complex, intricate mystery plot but also a very heavy moral dilemma and message. Michelle Monaghan is passable but doesn't really have much acting to do, but the rest of the cast deliver stellar performances, in particular Ed Harris as the hard-boiled detective who helps Affleck's Patrick character, and even more so in Broadway veteran Amy Ryan who delivers a frightening, visceral, raw and brilliantly vicious performance as the broken, manic drug-addicted mother whose young daughter's abduction puts the plot's gears in motion. It is a fantastic star-making performance for her as well and this will hopefully be the launching point for a wonderful film career for her as well as for Casey Affleck.As I previously mentioned, Gone Baby Gone serves as one of many morality-themed films released in 2007, which study and sometimes judge the motives that cause people to do the things they do and make the decisions they choose to make. In the film, based on the novel by Dennis Lehane who is no stranger to dark, Boston-set morality tales, the main character Patrick must choose between understanding the motives behind a heinous crime and perhaps even reaching the conclusion that they were good-natured motives, and between making the decision he thinks is right but may not be. Any film which openly raises these questions and actively engages its audience in the moral dilemma, in effect asking the viewers what they think is right, automatically gets some high points in my book, especially if it is done as effectively as in this film.That said, the movie suffers from one major drawback in that in the final act it allows the shocking mystery revelations to take over in place of the heavy moral dilemmas and the brilliantly detailed depiction of the Boston underbelly that characterize the first two thirds of the film and make them so brilliant. These revelations aren't all on the brightest side and the whole conspiracy theory is old and rather daft, but the film skims over these parts rather quickly and hastily returns to its previous high levels of quality, characterized by powerfully brilliant and spot-on performances and wonderful, location-based direction from Ben Affleck. As a debut directorial effort the film is even more impressive, and even without Affleck's name on the poster it still works as an effective, engaging morally themed crime-mystery.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Gone B side,"This seems to be a Clint Eastwood wannabe movie. The Affleck's don't cut it though. OK, the principal character is supposed to be a young looking 31 but for x's sake he's incredibly dim for someone that age. Unfortunately, the story is revealed from his point of view so the viewer is left in the dark and can only pick holes in the story as told until it is eventually revealed that, no, they are not mistaken, the story teller is the dim one. This makes for very unsatisfactory viewing. The dialogue is often incoherent. Affleck's inability to move his lips when speaking doesn't exactly help.

Both Afflecks shine in slow burning mystery,"""Gone Baby Gone"" is a well done mystery. But it's slow to thrill you and doesn't put you on the edge of your seat, though you will be guessing things to the very end. But the filmmakers give you something else to take from this film besides a mystery. A clue to this should be the gentle narration at the beginning of the film from Patrick Kenzie, played by Casey Affleck, talking about how he knows everyone. We see flashes of people in a Massachusetes neighborhood, with Patrick going up and greeting them. It's an excellent setup for Patrick's down to earth tactics in approaching his cases - and for his general principles.""Gone Baby Gone"" is ultimately a morality tale. It's a society tale as well. The main conflict in the story revolves around the disappearance of a little girl named Amanda. Patrick and his girlfriend Michelle are hired to investigate the disappearance of the girl. Their reactions to the case are key to the story. In many ways, the heart of the story is reaction to such atrocities.For those reactions, we are given several views, from the victimized parents, to the neighbors, to the different police officers attached to the case, including the hard, veteran Detective Remy, played with precision by Ed Harris and the police Captian Doyle, a minor but pivotal role for Morgan Freeman. Ben Affleck uses this palette of characters to paint a painful morality tale about children in society.This is a film about children. It's about our sometimes condescending views towards parents and asks the question what would you do when you see that sort of injustice. Working in a field involving children, this film struck a chord. Ben Affleck directs the film as if looking for a right answer to injustices against children without burying the film in manipulative sentiment. It's an insightful affair and a good vehicle for Casey Affleck as actor and good feature directorial debut for big brother Ben.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The most difficult scenes include that weird family of a drug addict couple and their child molester house mate. The scenes in the house are weird and creepy. Casey Affleck (Ben's brother) is fine in his role but another actor could have been better. The plot and mystery behind the kidnapping is so convoluted and unbelievable.

More often than not you'll see them do the ""humane"" thing (or what most people would like to see cinematically) , even if it would go against their morals, in the effort of gaining more praise from the viewing audience.Right at the end, Casey's stare at Morgan Freeman was phenomenal.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Great directional debut, Gone Baby Gone is a neo-noir thriller that should be on your radar","Gone Baby Gone is a neo-noir crime film directed by Ben Affleck, in his feature-length directorial debut. He co-wrote the screenplay with Aaron Stockard, the film is based on the 1998 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane.
The film stars Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan as two private investigators hunting for a young girl abducted from her single mother's apartment in the Boston neighborhood of Dorchester. The supporting cast includes Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris and Amy Ryan.
The characters are written very realistic and flawed and overall amazing in terms of writing.
The acting is incredible, each person doing a splendid job. Casey Affleck and Amy Ryan is the ones who stand out the most though, their performances are award worthy. You could call favoritism for Ben Affleck giving the main role to his brother, but I understand why as he's a very talented actor if you didn't notice it in this film then watch Manchester By Sea.Many of Dennis Lehane's novels have been made into films, and this is one of them. Mystic River and Shutter Island to name two, both of them are critically acclaimed so I went in with high expectations for this film and I wasn't disappointed. Gone Baby Gone is a superb crime-thriller that makes use of the neo-noir in a perfect way, and Ben Affleck's direction is great, making use of visual storytelling on top of the incredible writing. This is also Ben's favorite novel, a fun little fact and tells you a lot in how much passion and hard work he put in to make this into the superb film it is.
The cinematography is one of the highlights, I also liked the music and the editing, the pacing was perfect.If you're interested in mystery-thrillers with neo-noir, then Gone Baby Gone is something for you.

It's well told, honestly characterized, and pretty much as the Boston street cops might see it. But, for me, there's a couple of problems... Anyone familiar with the Kenzie/Gennaro series of books absolutely knows that, 1st - Angie is much more of an action person than was given to Michelle to work with. She seems so, well, ""secondary"" to the plot line. In the books she's much more a central figure and quite a bit more outspoken. The second, and perhaps the biggest problem I had with the movie is in the portrayal of Kenzie himself. Kenzie is supposed to be a big guy. Casey Affleck isn't. Kenzie is MUCH more action oriented. Again, not so for Affleck. His director brother, Ben, seems to be trying to not get him hurt. A nice brotherly touch, perhaps, but certainly no Kenzie.

Huh?Also, ever notice that in his early movie days Marlon Brando took on roles whereby it took some getting used to his speech patterns? Well, I don't know if Casey Affleck will attain Brando status, but something needs to be addressed as his words slide unintelligibly sideways out of his mouth. Yes, I had to use the Rewind on the DVD to get what he said. Then I got tired of that and said the heck with it and I just put my ears into SLURRY mode and made out so-so. Not good. At this point Mr. Affleck is not a Marlon Brando or even a James Dean if anyone remembers him.The production was okay, but the dark night scenes were really too dark to a point I would rather have the camera focus on someone we can see sitting somewhere listening to all the commotion and reacting to those sounds than to try to figure out who is on the screen and what is he doing etc.well you get the idea. That would help eliminate eye-strain.Amy Ryan was up for Best Supporting actress and did not get it. Why was she nominated in the first place? Her performance was okay but we see this character all the time on cop shows on TV. Nothing new or exciting here. The performances of the rest of the cast were good, but when Titus Welliver (Lionel McCready) was on screen I kept getting distracted by his overly bushy mustache. I wanted to pull it off, brush crumbs off it, put a match to it. It was that bushy.I think the only time we will see more of Morgan Freeman is when someone does a documentary about him. His screen appearances are nothing but GOLD but we always only see bits of him in movies. Why?The story was good, lost some continuity in places and had two anti-climatic scenes (when I thought it was over, it was not). However, the movie had one big flaw in it: Casey Affleck is not a Leading Man and that is the reason this is a forgettable movie. Sad to say but he had no chemistry with anyone he was in any scene with. Enough said. But, to be fair he was better in the Assassination of Jesse James film.Almost forgot.

And the climax, THE Decision, I loved it so much. Consistent to the character even though the consequences were there to be seen. A story about following one's own moral compass, from so many characters trying to do just that and how it creates so much conflict. What do you choose when all choices have pros and cons and will have to bear to cross of your choice knowing you've severely changed the course of other's life no matter what?

Moral dilemmas and a great cast,"A very nice tale about moral dilemma. Discusses whether doing the right thing is really doing the best thing. Also shows the weight that the system can have in conforming it's players, and the unpredictable consequences of bending the rules. Cops, private investigators, criminals and victims clash, as a girl's kidnapping investigation unfolds, making the spectator confused about who is actually good and bad.The great nuanced acting of a top class cast and a very indie-style directing by Affleck create just the right amount of doubt and surprise of the plot.

"Emotionally harrowing, mesmerizing crime mystery","""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" goes the timeless saying, and such is a maxim increasingly applied to the film industry through the years. Though originality and strikingly fresh and new ideas are often sought as the storytelling ideal, there remains something to be said for a not all together unfamiliar but resoundingly quality effort within known parameters. It is on this front that Gone Baby Gone proves a rousing success - despite being primarily recognized as another crime mystery by the author of the more renowned Mystic River, the film proves such a staunchly quality package to warrant differentiation, as well as being recognized as the emotionally harrowing, gripping and flat out powerful mini-masterpiece that it is.While the story, adapted from the Dennis Lehane novel, is well tread ground for those experienced in the crime or mystery genres, making some of the more crucial plot twists apparent before the fact, it scarcely detracts from the execution, beautifully elegant in its simplicity. Touching upon themes of class struggles, moral ambiguity, corruption as well as Catholic introspection worthy of Scorsese (Mean Streets is an obvious influence), the sheer authenticity on display makes for a genuinely compelling immersion into the slums of Boston in all of their sleaze and grit. These are real people having real interaction in real environments, transfixing the viewer by the near complete absence of Hollywood showiness or sugar-coating - rather than a finely tuned script, the impression is given of peeking over the shoulder of those interacting in real life, and the picture is more often than not a pretty one.Director Ben Affleck seems to have found his true calling with this remarkable directorial debut, as both his stellar script (co-written by Aaron Stockard) and emotionally charged directorial presence throb with passion and dedication for the film. Keeping the pace reflective and riveting without ever having to rush, Affleck holds the tension on a slow burn throughout while retaining every ounce of emotional intensity - the result being a slow, steadily affecting immersion in the story, making each twist all the more gripping, each raw human interaction all the more draining and eerily moving. Some beautiful cinematography, sublime editing and an affecting, minimalist score which only on occasion falls back on convention complete the stunning overall productCasey Affleck cements his status as a genuinely bankable leading man as rough but vulnerable investigator Patrick Kenzie, as his truly powerful, stoic, brooding presence anchors the film, his understated simmer and brutish emoting retaining the audience's full sympathies through every twist and turn. In contrast, the highly talented Michelle Monaghan disappointingly proves one of the film's weaker aspects as Kenzie's girlfriend and investigative partner, though not through lack of trying. Despite her best efforts, and impressive fuming in emotionally heated scenes, Monaghan is saddled with an insulting lack of character, often given nothing to do but stand around silently, making for a criminally choppy and underdeveloped character and a waste of considerable dramatic potential. However, Ed Harris proves at the top of his considerable game as an abrasive police officer, a dynamic powerhouse of a performance. Similarly, Morgan Freeman provides his usual quiet dignity and class with a subversive twist as a shady police captain haunted by the death of his daughter, and Freeman's wistful eyes offer uneasy entrance into a damaged soul - a truly affecting and resonating performance. Amy Ryan also impresses as the sleazy, drug addicted mother whose daughter was kidnapped, managing a brusque charm amidst her countless foibles.Despite few storyline surprises being in store, the real surprise is how flat out mesmerizing the film is, its constant eerie calm and claustrophobic intensity making for a thoroughly riveting and draining watch, near inevitable to haunt viewers for days afterwards. With sturdy, lyrical directing and rock solid performances aplenty, Gone Baby Gone breathes fresh vigour into the hard worn crime drama, easily worth a watch.-9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Where we learn just when right can be wrong, and wrong can be right.","I missed even knowing of this movie until very recently. My loss for sure because it's a finely crafted mystery that kept me highly alert, watching and listening carefully for clues. And still, I missed it....The story centres upon the disappearance of a toddler, a 4 year old girl from her mother's home. As viewers, we enter this mystery with Casey Affleck as private investigator Pat Kenzie and his female side-kick Michelle Monaghan as Angie Gennaro.The police are already involved in the disappearance but not progressing sufficiently for the mother, Helen McCready (Amy Ryan) and her brother, Lionel (Titus Welliver). Hence, she has asked the two private eyes to get things moving more to her satisfaction.Which they do, even though the police, naturally, are not too happy about their continued presence. The lead detective, Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) is not impressed with the PIs lack of experience; while his boss, Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) just wants Bressant to get a result - like yesterday.Things worsen for the cops when our PI heroes get mixed up with a local drug boss, Cheese (Ed Gathegi), mainly because Helen, the toddlers mother, has stolen $130,000 from Cheese when a drug deal was busted by the cops. Hence, suspicion falls upon Cheese that he has kidnapped the child as hostage to recover his money.From here, best you just savour the quickened pace of the movie as more ugly truths and lies surface to muddy the mix even further.The performances are uniformly - no pun intended - adequate, especially with stalwarts like Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris. Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan are both up to the task also. Ben Afleck does a good directing job.Some might argue, however, that the resolution of the mystery is utterly contrived and even beyond suspension of disbelief in a fictional story. I don't agree with that outlook - as the saying goes, truth is often stranger than fiction. Watch carefully and listen for those clues.Recommended for adults.

The world of the film feels real, and not like a tinsel-town projection of a working class Boston neighborhood.Ben Affleck brings surprising subtlety and depth to his directorial debut, and ends up making one of the most intelligent Hollywood mysteries in recent years.There are flaws; the last 1/3 isn't quite as strong in terms of plot – a few twists hard to swallow.

"""Everyone Wants The Truth... Until They Find It""","Our choices make our realities, either good or bad. The question is; what is really good or bad? Is the world black or white? Can there be grey areas? These are the type of questions you will be asking yourself after watching this magnificent film.Gone Baby Gone is based on Dennis Lehane's Mystic River. It follows two Boston private investigators that are given the case of missing 4-year old Amanda McCready. During the investigation, the private investigators work with Boston detectives in hope of finding Amanda alive and well.To my shocking, this film marks the directorial debut of Ben Affleck. I have to say, he did more than a great job. Ben's brother, Casey Affleck, and Michelle Monaghan star as the private investigators. They both were authentic in their acting. The acting all around was very realistic which I believe is vital to this story.Speaking of realistic, the montages of urban Boston were extremely authentic. The extras used looked like they lived in the streets of Boston their whole life. This really made me feel the story was real and I was watching it unfold right before my eyes.The writing in this film is wonderful. It kept me on edge and had me thinking, there has to be more, something just doesn't seem right. The actors did a great job of portraying the story line. I like how despite Casey being a ""young looking fellow"" and presumably under qualified, according to the detectives, he had the guts to question everything, even when it could cost him his life.Overall this is a great mystery that you deserve to unfold.

A  pure spirit walks among them.,"What kept me glued was the consistency of Patrick's character. As indicated by the opening voice-over, he was seeking to save his soul even as he walked among characters ruined by corruption. Patrick is something of a saint without conventional piety, or at least none shown here, willing to make hard choices and willing to take the consequences. At the end. I am left convinced that the child has acquired a guardian angel who will do whatever he can to make sure no harm comes to her but with no certainly that he will succeed. Affleck is certainly superior to his brother as an actor, but I think that even Ben could have made Patrick convincing. Director Affleck obviously has a lot to learn, but he has made a damn good movie. Many of those above have pointed out things he could have done better, but the actors save him from some of his mistakes, and the end result is worthy of real praise. I agree he has found his proper niche, but he is also beginning to find his feet as an actor and--it seems--as a person.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Go Baby Go-But leave your tender ears at home,"This film elevates the f----word to mantra status for the urban economically disposessed of South Boston. If you can't take it------. I was delighted when I heard that Dennis Lehane's novel was being made into a film. I was utterly impressed with Ben and Casey Affleck's work. This one easily trumps Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"". but is definitely not a movie for everyone. Prudes will be turned off by the language and the lifestyles portrayed. But all things considered, this flick is about as real can get. The earthiness of ""Southie"" is palpable and Amy Ryan's performance makes you want to just reach out and slap Helene McCready across the kisser. Casey Affleck was born for the role of Patrick Kenzie and I hope to see him again in 'Darkness Take My Mind,' or some other vintage Le Hane thriller. Michelle Monoghan makes a delicate but perceptive Angie Gennaro and Ed Harris turns in one of, if not his very best as a burned out veteran detective. Amy Ryan gives an Oscar worthy performance as the 'Slut Supreme', Helene McCready. Morgan Freeman, though thoroughly admirable in the role of police captain, seems out of place in an environment historically not given to racial tolerance, despite the name Doyle.

Gut Wrenching,"I loved this film, and it is clear that Ben Affleck belongs behind the camera not in front of it. I think he aspires to be the Clint Eastwood of his generation, and with this directorial debut I have every reason to believe that he will succeed.This is a very downbeat film though, and perhaps that is what kept me from giving it a 10. It ultimately deals with a moral dilemma, which I cannot discuss without utterly spoiling the film. Suffice it to say that Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan do a terrific job as well as Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman and a host of smaller role players that helped Ben Affleck to create so genuine a film. Possible spoiler occurs here- I loved the final scene in the film as the camera pans away and the viewer is left to think what is going through the head of the Casey Affleck character at that moment just after a doll's name is revealed to be Annabelle instead of Mirabelle.

Michelle Monaghan is rather bland. However, Amy Ryan plays her role with perfection. Casey Affleck is rather hard to believe in his role.

A terrific 'thriller' that raises more questions than it answers,"OK, so Ben Affleck won an Oscar, along with Matt Damon, for writing ""Good Will Hunting"", the controversy at the time being that they had a little help from the likes of William Goldman. He was also sexy, funny and even charming in ""Chasing Amy"" despite playing a misogynist pig. Then it all went wrong. Good looks notwithstanding, bad movies choices and an almost total lack of anything resembling charisma ensured that while Affleck was seldom out of the movie news, albeit for all the wrong reasons, his career was all but over. Until now, but this time Ben has stayed, perhaps wisely, behind the camera, casting instead his almost unnaturally talented younger brother Casey in the lead.""Gone Baby Gone"" is a terrific movie; ostensibly a thriller about the kidnapping of a young girl from a blue-collar Boston neighborhood, (its release in Britain held up until now because of supposed similarities with the Madeline McCann case), this brilliant film asks more questions than it answers, posing a number of moral and ethical dilemmas. This is a movie to ponder over and which you will take away from the cinema with you, (and no, I don't think there are any resemblances between this and the McCann case).Adapted by Affleck and Aaron Stockard from a novel by Dennis Lehane who wrote ""Mystic River"", it shares with it the same blue-collar Boston milieu and which it captures to perfection. Indeed it seems to me a much more accurate representation than was Eastwood's film. Rather than borrowing from his mentors Affleck has learned from them and this is a remarkable assured directorial debut. (We shall over look the one about the lesbian wife and the meat-hook).It is also terrifically well acted. Casey Affleck, so good in ""The Assassination of Jesse James"", is perfectly cast as the young Private Investigator hired by the child's aunt to head up the investigation, knowing, as she does, that many people in the locale will not co-operate with the police. It's a beautifully written part and Affleck plays it superbly. He is matched by Ed Harris as the policeman not beyond bending or breaking a few rules to get what he wants. The film's real revelation, however, is Amy Ryan as the child's drug-addicted mother. Ryan plays her unsympathetically and although her character isn't on the screen very often she remains crucial to the film's development making this as much a movie about the nature of parenting as it is a thriller. Ryan won almost every award going last year, only losing out on the Oscar. She's amazing but then so is the whole movie. You may feel by the end as if you've been kicked in the stomach.

Great debut,"On the surface, Gone Baby Gone, is a crime thriller about a child kidnapped from a cocaine addicted mother and the private investigator recruited to find her. Beyond that though, the plot only continues to get thicker every step of the way through the film.Upon hearing of this movie I was slightly intrigued, mostly because of the Oscar nomination attached to Amy Ryan who I had never heard of. After watching it though, I was very pleasantly surprised. The movie was considerably well made, a great start for Ben Affleck's directorial career. Based on a novel by Dennis Lehan and adapted by Ben Affleck, Gone Baby Gone starts out with a deceivingly simple plot and expands and grows with great intensity. Simply put, the story is wonderfully written.There is an impressive mix of character dynamics in the movie. In other words, certain characters relations to each other greatly facilitate a complex and interesting story. Along with its fine plot, Gone Baby Gone has a phenomenal cast and they help to display these dynamics excellently. On top of Amy Ryan's Oscar nominated role (which is quite deserved I think), Casey Affleck, Ed Harris, and Morgan freeman deliver splendid performances as well. While the performances are what we should expect of actors with the experience of the latter two, Casey Affleck is deservedly building an impressive resume too. In keeping with a good plot, deeper messages in the story very thought provoking. In some senses, it displays the traditional dilemma of ""do the ends justify the means"" but does so in a way that makes it too hard to simply take one side or the other.An outstanding debut for Ben Affleck: the director.

My view,"This was a better movie than I expected given the fact it was Ben Affleck's first directorial effort and he shamelessly cast his own brother in the lead role. And it is Casey Affleck's performance I felt was the weak point of the film, along with some clumsy scripting in spots. IMO Casey was just not believable in that role, which calls for someone with a lot more substance. His attempts at masculine toughness were somewhat embarrassing. The best I can say for Casey is he did not completely destroy the movie, even if he did seem to be in a semi-trance most of the time. Fortunately for him he was working with some really great actors, though they did overshadow him at every turn. But the success of the movie lies in the story itself, which was both gripping and haunting, as any story of children in danger would be. Ben himself seems to have a good feel for story-telling though his visual style is ordinary at best. His feel for dialogue is not much better - but I realize he is not a master writer and not likely to ever be. My advice to Ben is stick to just the directing - if he leave the scripts, camera work and editing to more talented people he will do just fine. Oh, and stop casting family members in lead roles.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good baby good?... No baby no!,"I was really made restless by this movie because of the overwhelming reviews it got from ""trusted"" reviewers here. I searched through highs and lows just to get hold of a copy of this film, and when i finally had it, i didn't find it coming that i will be haunted again by restless nights why i paid so much for such a lousy film.I am not trying to disparage the novel or whatever. No, it is not the story, it is everything about the film that sucks (pardon me for my use of such word but it is the only one that I can think of right now to describe how the film felt for me).I am really quite disappointed and appalled by the ratings this movie got from the reviewers. Let me explain on the following points one by one.First, they said Casey Affleck's acting in this movie has far surpassed his feat in Jesse James. this is absolutely not true. Jesse James (as Robert ford) is still Casey's best and unforgettable performance. other jurors must have agreed with me that was why they chose him as the best supporting actor. there is still no film where he acted better. Casey's performance in gone baby gone is not in any way in the league of great actings; his brother Ben just couldn't bring out the best from him. he just can't.Second, from the reviews, it said that Ben Affleck did an amazing job in his directorial debut. I hope Ben does not read the reviews here because they might get into his head and make him believe he really did a great job. For Christ's sake, I thought i was watching 24 or CSI or Prison Break. Yes, Ben affleck was copying the styles of the TV series, only that his film turned out to be a cheap copycat. If Ben affleck could not afford to go to school to get some directing lessons, or at least the how-to-point-your-camera 101 basics for complete dummies, he should watch great movies to learn how they are made.what was really annoying was that Ben affleck does not know how to use camera perspectives. he was always so focused on the faces of the characters that it seemed they were always shooting in a cramped, tight, tiny rooms where there are no spaces to move about, even a step. there were very few scenes where the camera captured a panorama, most of them ugly ones. 90% of the time you could see Casey's, or other character's faces, or should i say, noses.acting was really bad. Ben affleck made their actings strangely stressed or tensed. not only that, the dialogs were so clichéd and predictable and what they did to make up for such lousy dialogs was to pepper, no, drench them with expletives. i might have a slight idea that Ben wanted this film to make it to the Guinness book of world records as the film with the most number of ""f.u.c.k"" having spoken.this movie is not worth buying the DVD. it surely is a waste just like what Ben affleck made out of the great actors he cast. i just couldn't calculate how agonizing it was to finish the movie because i wanted to get something worth out of the not-so-affordable price of this lousy title.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not perfect, but all around excellent otherwise","Even to this day, I have yet to understand how the trend of Ben Affleck bashing started. Yeah, the man has starred in some pretty awful films, but then, which supremely entertaining and brilliant actor has not? Is there really something so godawful and putrid about Affleck's style that just seems to irk everyone into stereotypically bashing him? It bothers me to no end, but after being one of the few campaigning for awards recognition last year for his dazzling supporting turn in the otherwise forgettable Hollywoodland, and now after seeing his written/directed effort of Gone Baby Gone, I can only hope that these stereotypes will come to an end.Gone Baby Gone revolves around private detective Patrick Kenzie (Ben's little brother Casey Affleck). Kenzie is hired, alongside with his live in partner Angie (Michelle Monaghan), to help police find a missing little girl. Kenzie, known for his knowledge of many of Boston's degenerates, seems to be a natural fit for the job.What follows, at its core, is a tale of morality. While I have never been the biggest fan of preachy films, Affleck manages to side step any reverend-esquire moments, and focuses in on simplistic cause and effect. Thankfully, in all of his years in Hollywood, he has managed to understand the thin line between gracious ponderings and blatant throat shovings. Even at its most convoluted moments, Gone Baby Gone stays very focused, and does not attempt to dwindle into the territory better suited for veteran directors and writers. The film does not play itself off as amateur on any instant, but it does not feel well rounded enough to be considered having been created by an expert.And as much as I wanted to adore each and every frame of this film, it does have its flaws. The opening hour, as you more than likely have read, plays off immaculately, even if it feels like it could have been tightened more than it already is. For someone relatively new to the production side of things, Affleck pulls this off with finesse and grace. He knows just the right moments to play tense, and just the right moments to stay soft and brooding. It is thrilling and just all around excellent. But then, the film kind of trails itself off after it hits its emotional peak in the middle. As it builds towards its inevitable conclusion, it just plays itself a bit too loosely, and packs in a bit too much. Never once did I attempt to calculate its plausibility or question what was happening, I just think that Affleck wanted to cram far too much of Dennis Lehane's original work into the relatively short running time of the film. As said, for as convoluted as it gets, Affleck tries his best to keep it straight-laced, and for the most part, content aside, he does very well for himself.What he also does well (or at least helps to do well), is bring the grittiness of Boston to life. Filled with images of his former neighbourhoods, the film is positively loaded with a sense of authenticity. This is a movie about Boston, from somebody who knows Boston. And with every passing moment, the film just reeks of being accurately depicted. I felt like I was living in that city, and never once did I think anyone had traveled out of there. It is just so accurately represented that the visuals practically become a character of their own. Having all the normal townspeople appear in crowd shots and in passing was a nice touch on his part as well.He also does wonders with the script. Having co-written with Aaron Stockard, Affleck brings a real sense of urgency to the film. The words are hard-hitting, and have a solid impact on each scene. I wanted to try and not compare to the Oscar-winning Mystic River, but as the film went on, it just became impossible. Except while River wallowed in its own pedantic melodrama, Gone succeeds in consistently delivering the same awe-inspiring tone. It is heavily dramatic (and darkly hilarious in more than a few instances), but it knows when to stop pushing itself. It never overstays its welcome, and not once did I feel like it was trying to one-up itself like Clint Eastwood's take on a Lehane novel. I just think they could have better worked out the kinks of the second half of the film.And if Affleck does great behind camera, than his actors do equally great in front. His brother Casey is an absolute marvel leading the film. I never thought of him as a lead actor, but seeing his genuine finesse and bold attitude at work here, I think that Hollywood just may have a new young lead to add to its rank. There is never a dull moment when he is on-screen, and his character's ballsy attitude helps propel him past even the likes of his own brother's best performances. This is a career making turn, and I can only hope that we can see such unbelievable work in the future.The supporting cast is excellent as well. Ed Harris does wonders for the enigmatic detective Bressant. Tapping into the same frightening and thought-provoking demeanour as his character in A History of Violence, Harris lays on the strong acting and never once lets up. Morgan Freeman, much like Monaghan, appear very little in the film, but help really round out strong moments in the film. I just wish Affleck used them more. Amy Ryan is another particular standout as the mother of the missing child, and helps to bring a solid sense of pathos to the characters and to the film itself.Even with its problems in the second half, Gone Baby Gone is a solid and well rounded effort from everybody involved. It deserves all the attention it gets, and I can only hope that means good things for Ben Affleck.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Phenomenal Movie,"This was one of the best movies I have seen in some time. Casey Affleck does a great job and will soon be (if not already) one of the coveted actors in Hollywood. This movie is very genuine with plot twists and keeps you thinking and guessing all the time. Ben Affleck did a fantastic job directing this movie and should have been nominated in my opinion. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman play their supporting roles flawlessly.If you are in the mood to see a movie that will make you think about life, what goes on around you, the gut wrenching decisions that you sometimes have to make, and how lucky you are, in addition to being entertained at the same time, this is it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mystic River meets Who Will Love My Children,"Director Ben Affleck and his brother Casey, having grown up on these mean streets, are obviously prosecuting this movie as a labor of love. Just as in Good Will Hunting and The Departed, you're immersed into this generally poor Irish-Catholic culture, with its combination of anti-intellectualism, artistic charm, and blind ruthlessness. When these people bear a grudge they really bear a grudge. Sam Peckinpah's movie Straw Dogs, though set in Ireland, also comes to mind. What GBG adds to the genre is basically an extremely well-written mystery that doesn't trick you but will probably surprise you, combined with great characterization particularly in the performance of Casey Affleck....For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Casey Affleck was outstanding, and Morgan Freeman, Amy Madigan and Ed Harris were on point.This has to be the best film of 2007 --- not typical glam but a gutsy and provocative storyline that grips and makes you think. Boston locations are perfect and the movie does show that there is heart and soul in even the most difficult life situations.

"A Powerful, Moving film","Personally, i wish i would have seen this movie in theaters. This was by far one of the most disturbing movies made in the 2007 film year. Telling the story of Detectives Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro and there search for a kidnapped child, Although it is much more than that. This tells the story of choice and the fine line between right, and wrong. Amy Ryan does a great job portraying a drug dealing, burn-out mother who could give a damn. This movie is full of twists and turns that will leave the audience questioning the decisions and choices made in this movie. After seeing this movie, you will realize that maybe the line between right and wrong is more of a choice then anything else. I definitely recommend this movie, but just to warn you ahead of time, it will leave you disturbed. Ben Affleck did an amazing job at directing this movie, and his brother Casey Affleck did an amazing job playing Patrick Kenzie. Definitely an amazing movie.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Superb,"Just watched this the other day and was so pleased. This movie is great and delivered on every level. I've admired Casey Affleck's work since Good Will Hunting, but after seeing The Assassination of Jesse James and Gone Baby Gone, I am convinced that he is an amazing actor. The supporting cast is fantastic, Ed Harris is so talented and Morgan Freeman is always good. The actress in the lead as the little girl's mom is so good it's scary. She portrays a drugged out, selfish, terrible mother to a tee. The plot has some great and surprising twists and kept me on the edge of my seat. Some scenes were so raw and quite disturbing but an unfortunately startlingly accurate depiction of some of the sickness in the world today. Ben Affleck should be so proud-amazing job.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""I'm gonna bring her home""","There is a certain grim ambiance that distinguishes Boston as a city. Within the last few years, Clint Eastwood and Martin Scorsese enjoyed high praise for their Boston based dramas. The city has a natural grit that lends itself perfectly to film. While ""The Departed"" utilized the city as merely a backdrop, ""Mystic River"" came to life exploring the tensions of the working class natives amidst the city streets and neighborhoods. Both these movies were released to mass critical and public praise, so it's no surprise that Boston native Ben Affleck would choose to make the city the subject of his directorial debut ""Gone Baby Gone"".Based on a novel by ""Mystic River"" author Dennis Lehane, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a fascinating crime drama. The film concerns the kidnapping of a 4 year old girl, and the investigation that follows by a private detective played by Casey Affleck. Assisting in the matter is a loose cannon detective (Ed Harris) and a no nonsense police chief (Morgan Freeman). With each clue and discovery, it becomes clearer that there is more to this kidnapping that meets the eye. Matters of right and wrong become blurred and, more importantly, choice and consequence.Director Affleck deserves high praise for taking on a challenging subject and his display of excellent film-making skills. He handles the visual and stylistic aspects like a seasoned veteran, and demonstrates excellent storytelling intuitions. In particular, the city of Boston sizzles with life under his sharp eye. I would even go as far as saying that he outdoes Eastwood in terms of capturing the spirit and nature of the streets of Boston. The film opens with a breathtaking montage of city life, and often slows down to observe everyday people about their blue-collar lives. There are also a number of well crafted action sequences that are very effective and intense thanks to their grounded realism. The acting is capable all across the board, in particular, Ed Harris impresses with his intense and evocative performance. Also of interest is the first rate behind-the-scenes crew assisting Affleck. Oscar nominees John Toll and William Goldenberg provide wonderful lighting and cutting, while noteworthy composer Harry Gregson-Williams delivers a haunting score.The film isn't without flaws, most notable being the plot suffers a few predictable twists and some uneven structure. I'm not one to dwell on this sort of thing. More important are the final shot and subsequent issues at hand. Affleck doesn't take the easy way out with his commentary. The film offers the kind of bold moral challenge that will surely divide audiences and make for great debate long after you leave the theatre.3.5/4",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Heartbreakingly beautiful from the very first sound...,"The moment the first note of the theme song came up on the screen, tears started to fill my eyes... I knew that the directorial debut by Ben Affleck, ""Gone Baby Gone, was going to be a Great Film. All you had to do was LISTEN. All you have to do is HEAR.You will be transported from the land of the living to the land of innocence lost and long gone and the longing for what we knew long ago and far away... it's that place we all know and long to return to that doesn't have a name.You don't even have to watch the screen, even though you wouldn't want to miss a frame... This gorgeous, touching, heartbreaking soundtrack by Harry Gregson-Williams follows every fast-paced twist and turn down the rushing river that takes us on this tale of ""right and wrong."" The story is heartbreaking morality play, about the choices that we find that we must make, even when we don't want to take a side, and none of them seem right. The musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams perfectly sets the stage. The actors played their parts to the hilt, so that you could barely say who was ""right"" and who was ""wrong."" I will be thinking about this story for a long, long time.Talking about the soundtrack, you could be a blind person and not have to watch a frame; just sit and listen to the voices and the song: you would know the tale of love, longing and loss, right and wrong and how we sometimes try to do our best. And so often do our worst.I have come to believe that people are all too often ""too terrible for words."" They are selfish, greedy, full of fear and hatred; they are self-centered and cruel... Then along comes those few people who aren't. And those are the ones we call Heroes and Saints.This is one of the best films, acting, directing and soundtrack I've seen in a long, long time. Simply tremendous... it was almost ""three stories in one."" I wish it could have gone on longer as a sequel, as there is so much more to the story to tell.This is a tale that takes us to the land of innocence, so long ago and far away, which still survives in spite of whatever errors or terrible deeds we do. There may still be hope for us all... * * * * *",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A thought-provoking crime drama,"Ben Affleck's directorial debut ""Gone Baby Gone"" opens with the aftermath of a child abduction which results in a local detective couple being hired to augment the official police investigation. The plot moves through countless twists on its way to a conclusion that is unlikely to be predicted by anyone at the outset.The cast is pretty solid with Ben's brother Casey giving a fine performance in the lead role. Ed Harris is always good but Morgan Freeman, who I normally like, seems like he's just phoning it in here. Amy Ryan's convincing portrayal of the child's irresponsible mother was justly rewarded with an Oscar nomination.Affleck's direction is assured for a debut though there were aspects of the presentation that didn't appeal to me. For instance, I felt that Affleck was apt to dwell upon images of the neighborhood more than was necessary. Also, the multiple twists result in a convoluted storyline that moves further and further from plausibility as it progresses. I will say, though, that the film's conclusion does cause you to reflect on the costs of doing the 'right' thing, whatever that may be.In the end, I recommend this film as an entertaining detective story. It's likely to appeal most to the CSI crowd but it has a little more depth than most films of that ilk.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Close to perfect,"The story is powerful, the acting is on key, and the direction is stressful, which actually serves the film. If anything, Casey Affleck could have used a little more muscles and Michelle could have put more drama into her role, but overall the characters fit the plot rather well. Overall the actors were just superb. The end is not what I expected, or what I would have liked, but it is in line with the main character: A lamb among wolves, sweet inside and tough on the outside. A religious crusader: What haunts him are not his evil deeds, but the good ones. He knows people do not change, but he is willing to follow his principles rather than his common sense. Casey portraits this conflicting detective perfectly. There are few movies that make you sad when they end. This is one of them. I just wanted it to go on and on. Hell, I would like to see more movies like this one!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the Year's Best Fims: Oscar Ignored!,"Ben Affleck has written (with Aaron Stockard) a superb screenplay adaptation of Dennis Lahane's novel GONE BABY GONE and has proceeded to direct this tough tale with an ensemble cast of both well-known actors and unknown actors and walk-ons from the streets of the Boston area where they grisly story takes place. The result is a film so well tuned and realistic with a perfect sense of pacing and character development that it becomes a remarkable calling card for Ben Affleck's career as a director. That it is going unnoticed (with the exception of Amy Ryan's nomination for Best Supporting Actress) by the Oscars is a grave oversight ! The time is contemporary Dorchester, Massachusetts and Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his girlfriend/partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), become aware of a missing child Amanda (Madeline O'Brien) in their own neighborhood. The child's aunt Bea (Amy Madigan) and uncle Lionel (Titus Welliver), unable to cope with Amanda's drugged out mother Helene (Amy Ryan), knock on Patrick and Angie's door, pleading with them to help find Amanda: Patrick and Angie are private detectives who just happen to be an integral part of the neighborhood. Reluctant at first to become involved in the now 3-day police hunt for the child, a hunt headed by the respected Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) who his lost his own daughter in similar circumstances and detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) and who as a triad feel they are competent to handle the case without the 'immature experience' of the young couple. But Patrick and Angie do become involved, uncover leads within the neighborhood that lead to the clues behind the missing child incident and in doing so, unravel a lot of corruption within the police force, and also discover differences between themselves that threaten their otherwise close relationship. To say more would remove the incredible tension this story maintains all the way to the fadeout credits.The cast is uniformly excellent, from the smallest roles to the most major ones. It is difficult to single out any performer for praise as this is truly an ensemble piece. The flavor of the film is honest, unflinching, and refuses to ignore the grotesque incidents that must be shown for the movie to maintain its impact. Writer Dennis Lahane ('Mystic River', 'Shutter Island') is a master of detailing the spectrum of responses that ugly matters induce: even the most noble of intentions have their shadowy side. Affleck finds all of this in this excellent film, a film so strong that it easily bears repeated viewings. Highly recommended...but not for the squeamish. Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tough Moral Dilemma in the End,The ending of this film is worth waiting for - the tough dilemma the investigators found themselves in had me thinking about the situation after the film. I see both points clearly and I'm having problems deciding which way I would call it - and no one asked the 4 year old her choice which would have sway over the viewers decision.Not a great film but it's certainly not bad.

This film didn't live up to my expectations in any way.Without wishing to reveal too much about the plot, I also thought it was pretty unrealistic in terms of the attempted 'moral complexity' of Casey Affleck's character.

Best Move in Ben Affleck's Career?,"Quick review: Ben Affleck has already had a pretty busy career, and has won Oscar gold with ""Good Will Hunting""... but this may be his best move yet. Choosing not to cast himself, but instead his brother Casey (who is a decent actor and also doesn't have the distraction factor of Ben) was wise. Much of the plot is hard to believe, but one suspects this is how the book is, and Affleck condensed it into a film that makes sense and still tells a complex story... I'm tempted to read the book, because if the ""book is always better than the movie"" is true... I can't imagine how great this book must be.

This was rlly my biggest complaint how quickly a presumed good character died or turned so quickly. I appreciate how smart this movie is but it also moves through it to fast for me.

This Boston thriller was Ben Affleck's directorial debut,"This was Ben Affleck's directorial debut, a thriller based on a novel by Irish-American writer Dennis Lehane. It is set in white, working class Boston - a classic location for this kind of story - and focuses on a private detective who sets out to help find a child that has been kidnapped. Soon we are up to our hips in muck, with the child's mother revealed as a drug runner and user, and the hero (played by Casey Affleck, Ben's brother) attempting to supplement the efforts of the police.There are some fine performances (e.g. Amy Ryan as the kid's mom, and Ed Harris as always) and gritty Boston atmosphere, but the plot twists and surprises are a little overdone. There is an interesting section in which it appears that the story has unexpectedly ended in the middle of the movie.

Whoa... This is a surprise,"When I read that Ben Affleck directed this film I had a sinking feeling. I like some of the films he plays in but the most of them are DVD material and not worthy of cinema time. Decided to give it a chance anyway though and I can honestly say that was a wise choice.The film tells the tale of a kid being kidnapped and the search for her that starts. As well as a lot of other events that tie a number of people together. The story is told from the eyes of a pair of private investigators that get hired by the aunt of the kidnapped kid. This viewpoint works out very well. The film has a good tension to it for its full length. It's also highly sentimental, pulling all possible tricks to keep the audience on its toes and reaching for handkerchiefs. This isn't entirely bad though and never pulls away the force of the film.The best of the film comes after it ends though. It leaves one thinking for a good long while and if there ever was a film where the tag line really defined it it is this one... Everyone wants the truth, until they find it.

"Ben Affleck, win #1","Gone Baby Gone achieves a tremendously engaging level of suspense, and does it through the depiction of a perplexing story about a young private detective Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck in a superb role) , who - along with his partner and lover Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) - takes on a difficult case and tries to find a kidnapped girl. Ben Affleck, never really considered a leading man in the acting business, proved for the first time (and not for the last) that his directorial skills are top notch. His high aspirations make Gone Baby Gone a fresh and entertaining addition to the crime thriller genre. The film takes place in Boston, mostly in its underground world, and does a great job of portraying the twisted mechanism that governs the crime scene and all its members.Enhanced by great supporting performances from Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman - who play the two shady yet plausible Boston area police officers - the cast astounds with an unusually realistic attention to details in the representations of regular working-class folks, who are trapped in an intrigue that's literally making them go insane after only a short period of time. In all its sensational, captivating glory, the story presented in Gone Baby Gone looks as though it's been taken straight out of a newspaper's front page, delivering many real-life moments of pure drama. Apart from depicting the step-by-step investigation, the film also aspires to be a considerable psychological piece, pondering how the mess surrounding the case rebounds on the personal and professional life of the main character. Patrick, giving all that he can in order to discover the truth, begins to doubt his sanity and becomes infuriated with his inability to cope with what's been happening around him.As usual in this kind of movies the truth is hidden several layers deep, and in order to reveal the whole one has to go through a troubling amount of more or less acceptable evidence. Every new and unexpected fact found by Patrick adds up to the masterfully build suspense. Though unmistakably intense and utterly gripping, Gone Baby Gone offers one twist too many and changes its message for a less entertaining, yet still perfectly valuable one. In the world of corruption and hypocrisy nothing is certain, and Ben Affleck's debut feature is not only a taut and downright realistic thriller, it's also a hard-hitting exemplification of all the values that rule this shabby place.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Under the radar, but exceeds expectations","Ben Affleck's directorial debut has nothing but strengths in my book, strong performances by actors and actresses that for the most part are getting screen time in a film that showcases their abilities to play truly dramatic characters.Casey Affleck truly shines in this movie, you can see the effects on his character of the decisions he makes, one of the few times in Hollywood where I can actually see a character on the big screen change before my eyes throughout the 2 hours that I spent on this movie.This film also made me truly think about and respect the decisions each and every lead character makes, Affleck, Freeman, Harris, and Monaghan (sp?), I understand why each made the decisions they did, and the film truly made me wonder what I would have done had I been in the same situation.Long story short, see this movie, it is by no means a film for those looking for a shoot em up, or a thriller based on nothing but cheap scares, but for those of you who are willing to view something that truly makes us look at ourselves in the mirror, bring our own morals out in the open, and ask, what would I have done, then this movie is a can't miss for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Uncertain verdict,"I'm not certain how to rate this film, especially after reading many of the negative reviews. Some dealt with its authenticity in relation to the book, others with the actors, others with the settings, etc. etc. etc. As for the positive ones they seemed to praise it for the exact same reasons.I haven't read the book so I can't pass judgment but I do know it's usually a bad idea to compare a film with the book it's based on. It's simply impossible to accurately follow a book. Even Peter Jackson had to skip a few scenes in LOTR and he had some six hours to tell that story. A film must be seen as an independent artistic work that tells a story either successfully or not. As for the acting I can't say I was bowled over by anyone's performance. Freeman and Harris were effective if predictable. I've seen their act before. I'm not all that familiar with Casey Affleck or Monaghan but their performances were believable. Overall I found all actors to be good at their portrayals.Personally I like films that make me think. And this did just that. My wife and I talked about it for a long time after we got over the shock of the ending. We debated the characters' motives, whether their actions were justified or not, whether they were reprehensible or not. How we would have reacted if faced with that situation and how far we would go to save a child. So from that angle this film was a success.Bottom line, to me this film succeeds because it raises valid questions about the value of conscience. After all Afleck's and Monaghans's characters are driven by their conscience although they arrive at diametrically opposed decisions that affect the rest of their lives. And here again the film succeeds.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Gone But Not Forgotten,"I don't like the flippant title but this directorial debut from to my eyes, lightweight actor Ben Affleck, packs a solid punch with this dark tale of child-kidnapping at the poorer end of society. Along the way it posits some tough questions about who decides what's best for a young child growing up in a, to put it mildly, dysfunctional household. Sadly every year brings with it some sensational story of the kidnapping and / or abuse of some tragic infant - fresh in the memory, certainly of UK citizens is the apparent kidnapping of baby Madeleine McCann whilst on holiday in Portugal and frankly and tragically too many other child abuse cases to mention so that plots like this will always have topical significance.There are lots of good things to savour in this movie, most prominently the fully idiomatic playing of the cast, especially by the lesser known leads, Affleck's younger brother Casey Affleck and his partner Angie Gennaro, who become embroiled in a sensational child-kidnapping incident amongst the low-life drug-fuelled underclass in Boston. I would argue however against the casting of the biggest name here, obviously Ben's old co-star chum Morgan Freeman, whose presence almost overpowers the movie and unfairly, in my opinion, skewers the viewer's critical faculties by the nature of his movie persona with its reputation for truth and trustworthiness - the final twist, in which his significance comes to the fore, fails to malign enough, his admittedly good intentions.That point itself is much better made with the excellent closing scene, where Affleck gets to witness at first hand the depressing outcome of his moral decision at the crux of the film as he witnesses first-hand the boozed-up, sluttish mother, only too happily abandoning her recently returned long-lost daughter to anyone passing (on this occasion, Affleck) so she can enjoy a night on the town - the fixed shot of Affleck and the child on the cheap sofa, staring mindlessly at the child's only toy, a TV screen, stays long in the memory. On a side-bar, I also found the utilisation of the background music very effective and the better for being so sparingly used.Fault-finding badge in place, however, besides my casting concern over Freeman noted above, I did occasionally find the plot just too opaque, as, for example, we see played and replayed in a different way each time the key hand-over scene in the dark by the lake, while for me the ending was a bit too pat - such a tautly-drawn narrative just didn't need the plot twist grafted on here and I will lastly admit to having a lot of difficulty in listening clearly to the sometimes mumbled, occasionally incoherent dialogue of the characters.However, minor caveats aside, this was a welcome raw, tough and uncompromising movie, well-paced from start to finish and showed me that Ben Affleck's real talent may be more behind than in front of the camera.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You will think about this one for a LONG time.... A++++,"This is a very fine and precise film. Casey Affleck brings a very textured and multi level performance- well lets get away from that fine talk- Affleck's performance is top notch, and hurts your heart. If you are a reader of Lehane's books, you are NOT going to be pleased with Angie Gennaro. Looking at her in the context of the books, the film portrayal is weak, whiny and extremely lacking. So, to enjoy the film, you have to leave what you know from the books at the door. It's a pity, because in Lehane's Mckenzie/Gennaro series, Angie is the strong hard hitting character, and it is a pity the film didn't chose to act on this- however, let's be practical, you only have so many minutes in a film, and this director chose to develop Patrick- very VERY well... I am a Bostonian living away from home. This film broke my heart- the accent was spot on, the background was perfect, everyone in the film was a bit of my life. There are raw and hard choices made here. This is a film that you will think about for a long long time, like Mystic River. Ben Affleck knows where he comes from and obviously worked very hard, and picked a perfect crew to see him through. He can be proud. The cinematography is first rate, and often heartbreakingly beautiful.Truly an asset to the mood of the film. MOOD is key here- there is very subtle play of music, and very subtle play of the neighborhood. It is a RICH texture. No one can re-create a Boston story, Spenser, or Lehane, or what have you without knowing that there is always ONE character in the background, and that is Boston's particular character of neighborhood- it is VERY different from any city in the US, even NYC. Affleck catches it, undoubtedly because he grew up with it. It is in his blood, and makes him who he is. Had he not gotten this, he would have failed Lehane, and never carried the story over in such a way as to win our hearts, and BREAK our hearts in half... These are all our failed yesterdays, all the kids we went to the High with, all the places we left, and wondered about - or didn't leave and are ashamed of.

I thought it was a fluke (like maybe there were ghost writers involved), but watching Gone Baby Gone is proof positive that Affleck belongs behind the camera and not in front of it. The directing is fairly rudimentary (mostly static shots, close ups, med shots, stiff blocking) but the script is fabulous, allowing the film to flow smoothly, quickly, and cohesively. There's a lot going on in this movie, but in Gone Baby Gone you never feel lost in the narrative nor question the motives of the characters (as you do in many other films in this genre). The performances Affleck gets out of his actors, especially his brother, are amazing (this is the best work I've seen from Ed Harris since Truman Show.) Congrats Ben, you keep this up and you may just win another gold statue.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Filmed more like a drama than a detective story, ""Gone Baby Gone"" runs away from the clichés of the genre by betting on believable twists, which push the story forward","Once again, a novel by Dennis Lehane is transported to the screen to analyze ethical discussions about human behavior. Ben Affleck points his camera lens at those marginalized by society, building a believable prism of life in the American suburbs. The script is completely dedicated to the study of a dirty world, far from the pomp of the elites or the comfort of the more favored classes. It's about a community that is moved by the case of little Amanda McCready, four years old, who disappeared from the poor neighborhood where she lived with her mother and relatives. And even with the mobilization of police departments, other authorities and the neighborhood itself, two private detectives are hired by the girl's uncles to help discover clues about her whereabouts.The disappearance of the little girl Amanda is the factor that disturbs the personal and professional life of Patrick Kenzie (Cassey Affleck, in a performance that does not convey the power achieved by his performance in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford, 2007)"", as well as his partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), who find themselves completely disarmed in the face of the inexplicable directions that the investigation is taking. The girl's mother the reunion and the salvation of her offspring. These script additions make the work's dramatic load even more visceral, despite this the scene in which Amy Ryan's character (in a strong interpretation that is not overshadowed by even his more experienced companions) begs for the rescue of his daughter alive is, certainly, the highest emotional peak of the projection. That she is still alive.The first positive point to stand out is the direction of Ben Affleck. Owner of an acting career seen by many as controversial, he proved to be mature and comfortable in the role of director. It doesn't seem like a first-time job, thanks to Affleck, who showed great sensitivity in portraying the human emotions that are exacerbated during the work. Gone Baby Gone has a heavy, dense, sometimes even agonizing atmosphere, but it holds the viewer from beginning to end. What struck me about the film was the faithful portrayal of reality: Ben Affleck captures the true feelings that a person experiences during a series of different traumatic and conflicting events, and the mark that such conflicts leave on human beings. It's interesting how Affleck, who also signs the script with Aaron Stockard, builds the plot by making us distrust everything and everyone. Not to mention the way in which our curiosity is sharpened with each new piece of information. The mother who lied, the money stolen, the lies that are discovered.The film has two important turns, one in the middle and another in the final half hour of the film that build the resolution in an engaging and surprising way. Even if we already expect something different from what appeared. Affleck presents each situation and builds the necessary visual links. The scene at the lake, for example, is as tense and restless as it should be, leaving us as lost as the detectives. The moment Angela jumps into the water, you can feel her despair. In the same way that nothing is explained satisfactorily, because it will only make sense at the end of everything. The production ends up being this dilemma of to what extent a lie is evil or not. To what extent the truth, no matter who it hurts, is the best path for any case. It's ironic that those who wanted to know the truth the most end up being so impacted and suffering from it. And the way the film discusses this ethical issue impacts us and makes us think about our own values. Especially for the final scene. ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a film that leads to a massive moral dilemma, where complex characters walk the line that separates right from wrong. Morals and ethics are values that some see blurred, but cannot easily discard, given the weight they exert on conscience. The plot is treated with light touches of morbid humor, which barely manage to dissipate the heavy mood of melancholy that reigns throughout. Through their choices and decisions, the characters reveal surprising layers, while the protagonist seeks the truth that we are all afraid to find.The script has an extremely cohesive and efficient narrative with sensational dialogues. Each dialogue fulfills the role of being part of the plot. They are all deep, reflective and extremely realistic. Allied to the most effective measured performances, with the participation of the always great Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, the film still carries a dense atmosphere, almost palpable due to its excellent saturated urban photography, in dark tones, slightly opaque. Intensified by its heavy soundtrack. Between secrets and obscurities, we see a deconstruction of images and concepts, which call into question our ethical, moral and common-sense issues. At all times the film flirts with what is right and what is wrong. Judgments of values and choices are constant. The art direction is also infallible in giving such verisimilitude to the residential environments, always giving the impression of tightness, of degradation, whether in the dark and humid streets at night, or during the day, in a gradual saturation and yellowish graphics. The way in which they treat the relationship of money, drugs and crime with the police is also plausible.Ben Affleck's immersion in that universe under facades makes his plot possible for a more consistent study of his characters, more specifically their reactions to danger, fear. More than that, the tape opens doors for the public to also face the figures most repudiated by the social circle, from pedophiles, drug dealers to other criminals that infect the city of Boston. The effective photography bathed in shadows involves these creatures in a particular way, ambushing them in the frame like fatal monsters, apparently responsible for the chaos promoted by the anguishing atmosphere. In the same way that this same darkness starts to dress more and more characters, as a judge who sentences those who omit the truth and bear lies with them. ""Gone Baby Gone"" fails, however, in its final stretch, when it opens up to an excessive and run-down game of revelations, where the director seems to ignore an essential slow pace to the narrative for the digestion of so many - and such - twists.With an assembly and editing full of agile sequences and slightly dry cuts, the film gains a cathartic rhythm. The second act has an unexpected turning point. But it is its climax that contains all the reason for the film and that elevates it to complete grace. Finally holding valuable information in the case of the kidnapping of the girl, Patrick goes towards the precious truth, and from there we understand the name of the film, a truth that frightens. We arrive at it, but from the beginning, as we understand what Patrick understands, along with him, that the truth will not be the best, even if it hides a comforting element. This puts an extensive panorama in the film, of discussions and opposing sides, in which the character and those of us who are watching are in contradiction at all times about the insistent question: what would I do in his place? This gets to be distressing. So real, so fragile is our perception of what is right and wrong in some cases.Still in the last minutes of projection, Affleck gives us a creative and inspired outbreak and sets up a scene of delicate symbology that serves as a punch in the stomach, by elucidating a small dialogue loaded with meaning with another character about the name of a teddy bear. Plush. Patrick offers to babysit Amanda while his mother goes to the meeting. He sits next to the girl, who is watching television with her favorite doll, the one that had been found in the river and later returned to her mother. Patrick asks Amanda about Mirabelle, and she corrects him - in fact, the doll's name is 'Annabelle'. This is the great icing on the cake, the grand finale of the Affleck brothers' endeavor. We can see on Patrick's face the fear and terror that plagued him throughout the film come back like a tsunami, the scene fixating on him in silence next to the girl for a few seconds, as if to convey the shock and dilemma he faces. In the real world when you need to make the ""right"" choice. During the most varied situations and in the face of controversial and disturbing facts, he was always questioning his decisions. In the end, he thought he had taken the path that would allow him to live with his own choices. All this, only to discover that this whole time Amanda's mother didn't even know the right name of her daughter's favorite doll.Treated more like a drama than a detective story, ""Gone Baby Gone"" runs away from the clichés of the genre by betting on believable twists, which push the story forward without sounding forced. The cogs of the script - very well adapted, with fidelity and respect, but without losing objectivity - are only really exposed in the final third, when everything makes a terrifying sense and justifies the internal growth of the protagonists - also present in other novels by Lehane. The suffocating feeling it leaves behind when it's over - unlike many hollow, purely commercial products - gives Affleck's film a tangible quality, one of sadness and outrage. And isn't that what differentiating the just-right movies from those that deserve a place on the best list?",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Never giving up is essential in finding missing children,"This is a gritty whodunit with more than a few unexpected twist and turns. Of course this is a fictionalized story about a 3 1/2 year old missing little girl Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien) who lives with her single drug addicted mother Helene McCready (Amy Ryan).Bea McCready (Amy Madigan) is the grieving Aunt of the missing sweetheart Amanda. Bea and her husband Lionel McCready (Titus Welliver) believe they need the outside assistance of the private detective couple Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his partner in both his business and personal relationship Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to accomplish what the police department could not which is to get the Boston criminal element to talk about what actually happened to the angelic little Amanda McCready.If the above cast was not strong enough already add to the mix A-lister stars such as Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, and Michael Kenneth Williams and you are guaranteed to have the makings of a Boston cityscape crime/drama that is sure to provide a great film and unexpected ending.I give this crime/drama a more than deserving 9 out of 1o IMDb rating.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""You are sheep among wolves. Be wise as serpents, yet innocent as doves.""","""Gone Baby Gone"" is a nice movie, but nothing more unfortunately. Honestly with this first view he disappointed my expectations, which were quite high seen the positive word of mouth. The film is about a couple of private detectives, Angie and Patrick, who are hired to find a missing girl. This case will lead the protagonists to difficult choices, making them think about what is right and wrong. I found the story and the rhythm a bit boring and too lacking in incisive scenes. I must say that the ending is too hasty from my point of view and the whole story behind the kidnapping was not explored in depth during the course of the film and was not intuitive. Again, I think it's all a little confusing. The level of the actors is high, good performances, especially Casey Affleck worked quite well as a protagonist. The characters are beautiful, but not all, most of them are a little confused, like the movie itself. I really liked the tone of the film, with drug trafficking, mafia etc. Ben Affleck's direction was good, nothing incredible, he could handle it better but overall he did a good job. The images and shots I liked, but at times they seemed to me just shot by a mobile phone with a quality a little 'poor and confused, maybe done deliberately. The setting fits perfectly with the tone of the film and the costumes are matched to the colors of the scenes and the emotions and characters. Unfortunately the film left me little, a film that for now easily forget, but I want to see it again to try to understand better and see if the vote I gave him is right, because in my opinion the film deserves to be reviewed..

This is just an insult. Maybe if he had moved to a foreign country(then how to explain the girl?)..(2) Why did Jack Doyle kidnap the girl? Especially on half a pension.. This is never really fully explained.(3) Then there is the out of nowhere histrionics of Angie who decides out of nowhere that the child should not be returned..what the heck..??

But I have to say thank-you Ben Affleck because you have restored my faith in film because I was starting to think that any film that todays Hollywood would have you believe it to be a masterpiece is actually garbage. But not in this case this is a highly touted film and i agree on all fronts and in fact I really think it should have gotten more Oscar hardware.Now the film. Well where to start the casting agency big ups the entire ensemble cast i can not remember seeing any cast more perfectly casted and i talk extras and all it made the film so much more realistic and genuine. And by the way if there are any people doubting Bens bro and his acting abilities well don't I think he should have at least been nominated with Daniel day lewis for best male performance at the Oscars no joke.And the directing well Ben has nailed his first attempt and if this is any indication of what he will bring to the screen from behind the camera then i truly cant wait.This movie raises many questions like what can any man be capable of doing in the right circumstances and asks of you the viewer what is right and what is wrong.

Great!!,I just saw the movie on it's opening night. Ben Affleck definitely revived his career with Gone Baby Gone. The story was attractive from the start and kept me thinking the whole time. Casey Affleck turns in a fantastic performance that allows the audience to connect to him emotionally and mentally as a character. Ed Harris plays his role as good as could be expected. Morgan Freeman shines and new shining star Michelle Monaghan captures the audience with her performance as well.

Exceptional...another gem from 2007,"Wow. I'll admit I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck, but if ""Gone Baby Gone"" is any indication of his directorial prowess, I may have to reassess my opinion. Based on a Dennis Lehane novel (co-adapted by Affleck and Aaron Stockard), ""Baby"" hits with grace and rawness the notes played for heavy-handed melodrama in Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" (another Lehane adaptation). An exceptionally satisfying mystery, well-textured through character instead of action (though there are several harrowing scenes of violence), with a script that consistently plays against our expectations without resorting to cheap cop-outs and last-minute twists. Affleck stages seemingly simple dialog exchanges with the same amount of visceral intensity as, say, a shootout in a derelict building. While some of the Boston accents are so thick subtitles wouldn't have been unreasonable, the actors nail their rich, complex roles: Casey Affleck as a freelance missing-persons finder (don't be deceived by his baby face and short stature; he has definite leading-man potential); Ed Harris as a cop assigned to the case; Michelle Monaghan as Affleck's partner. In this type of literary adaptation (and no, I have not read the novel), the tendency to emphasize certain passages can lead to a heavy-handed execution (""Mystic River,"" again), but Affleck does a good job of keeping things grounded in reality--the performances possess a raw naturalism that seldom conveys a Hollywood polish, save for Morgan Freeman, whose small yet crucial role is essentially a reprise of the ""wise elder"" he's been playing since ""Se7en."" But overall, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is one of the most surprisingly satisfying films of 2007--the type of character-rich meditation that hits hard, and is not easily forgotten.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It would be no surprise to see Ben Affleck up for another Oscar,"It would be no surprise to see Ben Affleck up for another Oscar this year, this time for his directorial debut of Gone Baby Gone. Ben's also back flexing his Academy-award winning writing muscles as he co-writes the story (based on Dennis Lehane's novel) with Aaron Stockard.Brother Casey Affleck is out of his shadow and is wonderfully credible as Patrick Kenzie, a private investigator in working class Boston, hired along with his girlfriend and fellow PI Angie Gennaro (played by Michelle Monaghan) by the family of a missing four-year-old girl to help find her.The luminously beautiful Monaghan (of MI3, Made of Honor, The Bourne Supremacy) turns in an understated performance, and the rest of the cast amply provides support. Morgan Freeman as Capt. Jack Doyle is back playing a character he does best (God). Ed Harris as Det. Remy Bressant is gritty and compelling as an officer you either love or hate. Broadway actress Amy Ryan is scarily accurate in her portrayal of the missing girl's druggie mother Helene McCready.As the story unfolds, lots of twists and fake endings abound, but is nevertheless unraveled well on screen, with enough pockets for personal musing.

A Nutshell Review: Gone Baby Gone,"While Ben Affleck has gotten a number of flak for his acting ability or lack thereof, there is no denying that his directorial debut with Gone Baby Gone deserves the accolades bestowed upon his work, as he directs younger brother Casey in a tale about the seedier side of private investigation, but stripped of noir elements and immersed totally in the wheeling and dealings with plenty of grey.Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan play the couple Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro who owns a private investigations agency dealing with missing people. Theirs is a small outfit, but they're the go-to persons when you need a second opinion aside from the official investigations by the authorities, the ones who can speak to those in the underbelly of society, whose denizens for obvious reasons refuse to speak to cops. They get called upon one day when the relatives of missing child Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien) sought their help to augment police investigations, and as far as statistics go, entering the investigations at this point in time is like entering a fight with one hand tied behind your back, and reluctantly, they decide to first explore their options and study the background, before taking the case on.It's a fantastic interplay between Patrick and Angie starting off with the latter's fears that results may come in the form of finding the body violated, or in some dumpster. You can't deny that try as you might to emotionally distance yourself from the crime, the fact that it involves innocent children will still somehow grow on you. Worse, the single mom Helene McCready (Amy Ryan) is a drug junkie, which of course presented an additional angle with regards to parental responsibility, and more often than not, you'll find yourself disgusted with her white trash antics.While the movie coasts along quite ordinarily in presenting both case facts and narrative development as the investigations wore on, what cemented Gone Baby Gone into greatness, is its final 20 minutes. Adapted for the screen by Ben Affleck and Aaron Stockard based on the Dennis Lehane novel, it's filled with incredible melancholy, and ends on a somewhat emotionally sad note with great personal sacrifice. I can't recall a crime thriller of late that gripped you with the finale, especially when many pretenders tried hard, but failed miserably. There's an excellent debate between doing what's right, and what's necessary by the book, although the yardstick of measure definitely differs from person to person. Sometimes, you're stuck in similar catch-22 situations, that it be damned if you do or don't. Depending on your values and principles, you might be called upon to undergo deep questioning of oneself about turning the blind eye and walking away, but unfairly given the constraint of time working against you.I haven't seen much of casey Affleck's work except for his short appearances sharing the screen with the bigger names in the Ocean's 11 franchise. I thought that Gone Baby Gone allowed him to shine through and convince that he can be a leading man, though not necessary single name marquee yet. Michelle Monaghan however continues with her supporting female roles playing love interests and such, and I guess it might take a while before she's able to break out of the stereotype. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris lend gravitas to Affleck's movie, and show that they can still chew scenes despite their limited screen time.Gone Baby Gone has surpassed expectations, and comes highly recommended from me. You might be surprised at the developments at the halfway mark, and might think there's an error in the runtime, but trust me, that's just where the fun begins and the movie picking up from strength to strength.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's a thriller and suspenseful film for sure but is hurried up.,"It's a thriller and suspenseful film for sure but is hurried up.At times, we need to set aside our beliefs the rules and what we stand for, to save a life. The last scene where Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) baby sits Amanda (the little girl) made me ask a question, ""What is home?"" Is home something that makes us happy or is it something, where we have people whom we know but they just don't bother if we even exist or not. Poor Amanda was home just to be taken out in what forms a good detective case. Like the mother who said that the dolls name was Mirabelle, the little girl says it's Annabelle. Gosh, the mother does not even know here kids favorite toys name.The taking is good, but screenplay is hurried up, I could not understand in the climax where there were too many scenes flashing, now whose perspective was this all shown. So it's hurried up and does not give us space to contemplate quickly and appreciate how the case was solved. Cinematography was good and so was the whole setup that is art direction. Acting was good especially by Ed Harris. But Casey Affleck did disappoint me at places where I expected a lot as he promised in this. Others were good and especially Amy Ryan as Helene, the drug addict mom stood out in her role.All said and done, I recommend a watch for those who like some fast paced movies. It's not all good pace either, it's sluggish and a routine case till we find what happened to that baby, it took one hour for that and the next hour just rolls on so quick that too many things are revealed in too less time.

It's just not right for me and it did not work for me..It's 3/5 for a good movie for sure, yet it falls short at places to be said a must watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Gritty, riveting, and complex mystery","Gone Baby Gone, Ben Affleck's debut as a feature film director, is a finely textured and thoroughly engrossing crime drama. Showcasing brilliant performances, the film succeeds as both a captivating mystery and as a thought provoking examination of morally ambiguous issues not often encountered on a local megaplex screen.The film is based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, author of Mystic River, and similarly focuses on the tough, crime laced neighborhoods of Boston. Instead of Clint Eastwood's stylish, almost operatic tragedy, Gone Baby Gone provides a grittier and even more complex, morally ambiguous view of life on the other side of the tracks. The cinematography by John Toll (especially the sparing and effective use of hand help camera work) and editing by William Goldenberg (most effective in weaving together multiple tracking shots and in capturing the reactions of multiple characters within a scene) visually support a sense of intimate realism. The musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams pulls the viewer into the film without overpowering it.Ben Affleck's triumph in this film is the way in which he allows the actors, or rather, the characters they portray, to comprise the heart of this film. Every performance is unforgettably etched and seems to flow naturally from the background. Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Madigan, and Titus Welliver all deliver extraordinary performances. Amy Ryan delivers an award-worthy performance as a mother who is both repellent and and heartbreakingly pitiable. Casey Affleck follows up his masterful performance in The Assassination of Jesse James ... with another disturbing, but far more understated and complicated performance as the central character. More than any other, his performance draws the viewer into the disquieting moral labyrinth of Gone Baby Gone.Aside from his work on the screenplay of Good Will Hunting (but definitely not his acting in this film) and his wonderfully self-parodying performance in Shakespeare In Love, I have not been an ardent Ben Affleck fan. With this film, he firmly establishes himself as a talented director. For the first time, I can say that I look forward to the next Ben Affleck film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Gone Baby Gone's a Thriller Filled With Dark Secrets.,"Ben Affleck's directional debut is something very assured as his younger brother Casey Affleck stars in this Dennis Lehane-thriller.

I think most of all this movie shows how excruciatingly hard it is to make the right choices in life. With morality nothing is black and white like so many people assume so they don't have to spend any effort figuring it out.

Gone Baby Gone,"Private detectives ""Patrick"" (Casey Affleck) and ""Angie"" (Michelle Monaghan) are drafted in by the mother of a missing girl to try to find out what's happened. This is pretty much virgin territory for the pair, but they are local and so might be able to unearth sources unwilling to discuss with the police efforts being led by ""Doyle"" (Morgan Freeman). Now it's fair to say that the child's mother ""Helene"" (Amy Ryan) is probably not the most attentive of parents, but she is determined to be reunited with her daughter. What now ensues follows this investigation into their Boston suburb - one that takes them into contact with crooks, drug dealers and an whole fraternity of dangerous hoodlums. Their searching does, however, start to bear fruit - and not a kind of fruit that they really want to discover. The plot thickens and twists and evidence of just who did what and, as importantly, why emerges that causes quite a moral dilemma for the pair. There is a strong dynamic here between the very much on-form partnership of Affleck and Monaghan and the former's brother (Ben) directs this film with consistent pace and a plausible degree of menace. Serendipity takes just too much of an hand in the ending for my liking, but it's still a compelling and thought provoking story that ends up by asking us all a question - the answer to which is not necessarily straightforward. Freeman really only features sparingly, but there are solid supporting contributions from Ed Harris and, to a lesser extent, from Titus Welliver that all help deliver a taut and intriguing drama that is well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Gone Dennis Gone,"I have a real doubt as to whether people showering praises on this movie and providing rave reviews have actually read the book 'Gone Baby Gone' by Dennis Lehane.The author is a master storyteller and I bet that if you have so much of a moderate understanding of English and you can read, you will be bowled over by the pace and sheer intensity that the book provides.The movie is at best,lame. None of the confrontations which exist in the book and keep your pulse pounding is portrayed with as much of an iota of realism in the movie. 1.The Filmore Tap episode. 2.The Quarry episode 3.Leon Trett,Roberta Trett,Corwin Earle chilling and horrifying episode. Where is the blood curdling menace, the horror, the claustrophobia? The book has it all, the movie has zilch. And Ed Harris as 'Remy Bressant' and not 'Remy Broussard'.!! Such an ill fitting role for a great actor. Remy is supposed to be a younger man who works out 4 times a week. Not who's born in 1950 and is 58!!! Edi Gathegi ( Cheese Olamon ) and Slaine (Ruprecht 'Bubba' Rogowski )look like they are in for comic capers.They are real violent stuff actually, in the book. Did Ben Affleck for once, read the book!!!! Michelle Monaghan and Amy Ryan look and fit their parts.How much liberties can a Director actually take when putting an extremely compelling work of fiction into a movie? If Dennis Lehane sees this farce of a movie, he would for sure chuckle: ""Gone Dennis Gone"".",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Rise Of An American Icon,"In his early years, Henry Fonda made a trilogy of films that cemented him as one of the greats. His sixth film 'Young Mr. Lincoln' (1939) followed by 'Jesse James' (1940) and 'The Grapes Of Wrath' (1940). Oh, and 'The Ox Bow Incident' (1943). So four! Four classic films that cemented him in the hallowed halls of -- wait. Can't forget 'My Darling Clementine' in 1946. FIVE! Five great and lasting iconic films. But most of us watched these films informed by what was to come later. It got me thinking, what was it like to see icons like Fonda on screen for the first time. Did people watch thinking ""OMG we're watching something pretty amazing here!"" Did they sense that this was the start of a legendary career? Because that's the feeling I had when I watched Casey Affleck in 'Gone Baby Gone'. This performance was not a one off. No, I was being given the opportunity to see an artist at the start of an epic career. Don't believe me? Check out The Assassination Of Jesse James' and 'Manchester By The Sea'. In each of these films, Affleck portrays the reliable grown up hero for the every man in all of us. The non-hacker who can act a thousand words with a glance. The soft spoken laconicy that suggests vulnerability and unassuredness but belys an inner strength and steely bravery. The hallowed, weary expression of a man with the single minded workaday urge to be good. If you do the math, you know that these people come along once or twice in a life time. Moreover, if fate allows (it usually doesn't), they progress through a long and respectable career leaving the world a better place for it. I watch Affleck work and I find it impossible not to include him in this short list of great American male actors. Hanks is iconic, yes, but he earned it film by film. DeCaprio seemed born to it. Eastwood's doing his best work in the latter part of his career and Pacino and DeNiro are wrecklessly squandering their iconic status with silly movie after silly movie. There are other contenders in his generation (Crudup, Gosling, Hardy, etc.) but Affleck seems to pack the gear for the times as they are. The knowing, quiet guy at the back of the room whose every movement is efficently utilitarian. 'GBG' is his 22nd film. It is a sure bet that forty years from now our great grand kids will be watching Affleck the way we watched Fonda. Directed by brother Ben, who cowrote the screenplay, and with a fantastic supporting cast, 'Gone Baby Gone' is a winning combination of great movie making. But Casey Affleck turns it into a classic. It's why Affleck makes my short list of great American actors for our times and perhaps for all times.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great directorial debut from Ben Affleck,"Ben Affleck's directorial debut shows that he can be a good director, probably more than a actor. Well as long as he has the right source material. The story is written by the author Dennis Lehane and this movie is based off of it. Seeing how ""Mystic River"" turn out to be a great movie. It's not a surprise that Affleck wanted to make his debut directorial movie with Lehane's story. This doesn't have that cold feel that ""Mystic River"" has but it doesn't make it any less intriguing as it progresses. In fact this movie gets complicated as it progresses in a good way. So without giving much away Patrick Kenzie(Casey Affleck) is a private investigator that gets hired to find a kidnapped girl of a cocaine addicted mother. And he is partnered up with his girlfriend Angie Gennaro(Michelle Monaghan), Monaghan always plays the girlfriend or wife character well. And Capt. Jack Doyle(Morgan Freeman) is also head in the investigation. Throw in Ed Harris as Remy Bressant and you got yourself a great detective thriller style movie. This has some great dialogue and phrases that sticks with you. Anyways less you know about this movie the better. Overall this is a intriguing mystery movie that is enjoyable and sticks with you for a while. If you enjoyed ""Mystic River"" there is a high chance your gonna like this one as well.8.6/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Murky tale with moral ambiguity,"An interesting movie about what happened to a little girl that disappeared, involving characters like the mother of the missing girl, her relatives, the police and private investigators out to find her. The mother of the girl could be characterised as being ""poor white trash"" and there are many nasty possibilities as to her fate.Casey Affleck plays Patrick Kenzie, one of the private investigators recruited to find the girl. He disconcertingly looks like the love child of Ben Affleck (his famous brother) and David Byrne, of the band Talking Heads, perhaps. HIs partner in the movie is the lovely Michelle Monaghan, who plays Angie Gennaro, his lover & fellow private investigator.Kenzie's qualities are illustrated in some formulaic scenes which establish his ""tough guy"" credentials, as Hollywood leading men are supposed to have.This movie strives to be profound, I think, but it does leave unexamined some Hollywood clichés as to what is right & wrong. In any case, it does serve up some interesting dilemmas to engage the viewer.That is best illustrated by the character of Kenzie. He's meant to be some sort of model of justice and integrity, but really, some of his actions made me squirm and question his morality. The act that most troubled me (and I won't reveal it here) was, I think, a populist appeal to the mob. Plenty of contradictions in Kenzie for people who like their characters complex.This might be a movie best viewed on DVD so that you can go over scenes to nut out what is going on...a device which is used on TV cop shows would have been useful...a guy just summing up what happened, along with a flashback of it. There was some of that in the movie, but it wasn't entirely easy to follow (with regard to the crucial event at the quarry).Gennarro is lovely to look at but isn't very well fleshed out. She does have a crucial dilemma of her own to deal with but I was unconvinced by it, as she was otherwise Affleck's handbag for most of the movie.Dark at times in the subjects it explores...not for the squeamish.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Exceptional Crime Drama,"I went into Gone Baby Gone with a misconception about what it was going to be about, or rather a different interpretation of the synopsis. I was extremely pleased with the plot, but more so the realism of the story. The plot is so deep, yet understandable, and links us to a moral debate we all struggle with. I considered Casey Affleck a B-Rate actor before this film, but now I can see him becoming a prolific actor. His performance was convincing and incredible. Ed Harris was great as usual, and Amy Ryan was also terrific. The only thing keeping this movie from a 10 is what I consider a lack of character development. Affleck was such an interesting character, I would've loved to see them develop him a little more. There is some subpar acting also, by Michelle Monaghan and surprisingly, Morgan Freeman (who I feel was miscast). Ben Affleck directs well, with elements of Spike Lee and David Cronenberg clearly visible in his style. I'm looking forward to future pictures by him. I would recommend Gone Baby Gone to anyone, but I don't want to release any of the plot details, because I want people to have the same experience I did. This was definitely snubbed at Oscar time, especially the Afflecks and the adapted screenplay.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
so so,"I was very skeptical with this one, as Ben Afflecks work in ""The Town"" just didn't convince me at all. For this one, it was slightly better i think. Well, as some of the reviewers already wrote, Casey Affleck is just not very believable in his role and you can hardly understand what he's saying. It was slightly better than in ""The Killer Inside me"", there his performance and credibility are just horrible and i was asking my self ""really, are they serious""? . It seems Ben Affleck kinda pushed his brother into this role my all means or is it just a coincidence, i don't think so. Ed Harris is very good, but doesn't really fit in very well. Same for Morgan Freeman.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Flawed But Impressive,"Gone Baby Gone has its flaws and i had to decide between giving this a 7 or 8, but i think the strong performances ( Casey Affleck and Amy Ryan are awesome! ) just edged it towards a higher rating.I will start with the positive things because so does the movie: The first hour is great. It has a solid story ( child gone missing ), which is nothing spectacular or innovative, but if done right it can definitely serve as a good foundation. And in my opinion it is done right in this film: There are well written and well acted characters who all have their own problems, ideals and a certain ambiguity. They are not perfectly fleshed out , but i think they don't have to be when so many characters are introduced in a short amount of time. No time and no scene is wasted in the first hour, everything is placed right where it should be and the well written dialogue supports the slowly building tension. Yes, there are a lot of questions and expository dialogue, but you cant get around them all the time in an investigative story. Here there is room left to find out little details about our characters. I also like how the streets and neighborhoods are photographed because they serve as a constant reminder of where these people come from and what they and we as the audience have to deal with. Most of the things we find out as the movie progresses can be traced back to them and the neighborhoods are used well as an overarching boundary for the story and characters. Ben Affleck delivers a directorial debut with a strong sense of tension, using a lot of close-ups in single- or double-character shots and the often vulgar ""on the edge of violence"" dialogue does the rest to suck you into the first hour of the movie. There is nothing fancy going on, but its as close,raw and real as it needs to be for the sake of the narrative.That is where the movie starts to go overboard. Even though the entire cast is firing on all cylinders throughout the whole film, the story and the movie itself cant keep up the high level after the first ""conclusion"" because it feels like a deep cut in the narrative structure. Gone Baby Gone tries to touch so many morally ambiguous topics and ask so many questions about human nature that could have probably served as material for three separate movies. As the opening monologue by Afflecks character implies, this is a movie about decisions and if you can decide yourself or if ultimately the things that surround you, over which you have no influence,make the decision for you(predetermined). But i don't know how many important decisions the characters can make before it becomes unrealistic.It doesn't get bad by any means and the film picks up the slack again at the end, but i cant get around the impression that it is more like :"" OK which difficult moral question can we tackle next"" instead of being good storytelling. That said, this movie has given me some food for thought and i can imagine the (great) final conclusion causing some debate among viewers. I definitely thought about it more than once. Strong acting, good directing and writing with just the right amount of suspense should be enough to recommend Gone Baby Gone. Thanks for reading",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Bad, Baby, Bad","Yes, there is a lot of Boston grit in Ben Affleck's new film. Every lowlife one can imagine is jammed into a Dorchester neighborhood, speaking with an obligatory ""Pahk the Cah in Hahvad Yahd"" accent. The young couple protagonists, however, are pure as the driven snow. And they speak clearly, too.The young couple, private investigators who seem not to have prospered much from their chosen craft, embark on a tortured journey through wildly improbable events that make this film unbelievable on any level.Add to all of this the inept, stone-faced acting of Casey Affleck, who exhibits a complete lack of chemistry (or even life), especially in what should be intimate scenes with his lover/partner Michelle Monaghan, and you have a recipe for terminal ennui.The only rewards here are strong performances from Ed Harris and Amy Ryan. Morgan Freeman is underutilized in what amounts to a bit part.The film succeeds in painting working-class Boston as a hellhole, but does nothing else.

The Perfect Film,"I don't often comment on movies, but this movie hit me so hard that I feel I have to let others know how amazing it is. I went into this movie expecting your basic thriller kidnapping film, with maybe a twist at some point. What I got was so much more than that.This film leaves you questioning morality and what constitutes the ""right decision."" A line from the film is ""shame is God's way of saying you did something bad"" or something along those lines. I feel that this film encompasses that quote. It questions the difference between the law and what is best for a person. I really feel that this film made me reexamine my morals and how I would react if I were placed in the position that the antagonist in the film is.The acting was absolutely superb. Casey Affleck really surprised me with his performance, even though I have recently seen Assassination of Jesse James and know that he has real talent. He showed amazing complexity with his character and there was a depth there that I have never seen from him before.Overall, I would whole-heartedly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys a deep, thought-provoking experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Gone In A Second,"I love Ben Afflecks work, both as an actor and a director he has consistently blown me away with his work, while he went on to say great things with his directorial ability I can't say he had a great start in what I found to be an extremely misguided crime thriller.Another trope of Ben Affleck I find recently is that even when he isn't in a good movie he tends to be the highlight of it and this is the case here to, his work behind the camera is truly excellent here, he's not afraid to go slow and a lot of his shots are done all in wide angles without cuts and it's extremely effective, this film doesn't have a whole lot of action but when it comes he handles it very well, nothing about the violence feels like a movie, but realistic and often shocking. In all his films he uses the location as a character and it's no different here and adds this dark feeling that stays consistent throughout the film.The performances here are all stellar, Casey Affleck gives a very subtle performance here, you can read a lot of his face without him saying anything and carries a lot of this film for me. Ed Harris is also fantastic in this movie, a very wounded and tired performance then he plays extremely well. Amy Ryan absolutely floored me in this movie, she was so despicable I couldn't believe and absolutely earned her Oscar nomination for her work here.The ending was handled perfectly in this film, it asks the audience to think for itself and doesn't give any easy answers, it leaves them feeling unfulfilled and makes you look back in the entire film as a whole. It was a bold note to end on and I really admired them for not giving a stereotypical happy ending.But I find this film to be very mediocre for a few reasons for one, the pacing. This film drags for large portions and honestly bored me quite a bit. A lot of that has to do with a lot of meaningless sequences, the film takes a turn about half way through and nothing ever comes of it other than to extend the run time. Before the ending nothing that happened really stayed with me and makes this film rather dull for me.I have no issue with slow movies but I have to be invested in the characters for that to be a benefit and I don't care for most of these characters, many of them are one note and just have a tendency to repeat the same dialogue over and over again. I don't care about them so I don't particularly care for the situation. I particularly didn't care for Michelle Monaghan's character, I didn't feel like she had much chemistry with Affleck so I didn't really buy their romance.The twist in this movie is also very mishandled, not only was it really cliché but a lot of the characters involved with this twist feel forced in and don't feel very within character for them, it adds something to the ending but on its own it does nothing to me except for making me feel underwhelmed.The Town is one of my favourite movies, Argo is one of my favourite Best Picture winners and I even enjoyed Live By Night for what it was but I really couldn't get behind this film. I like the direction, performances and ending but the film as a whole is bogged down by weak characters, an unearned twist and slow pacing. I'll still watch anything Ben Affleck directs but I can't say he hit the ground running in his career as a director.5.5/10: C (Mediocre)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Notably, Casey Affleck's performance is magnificent.

"Amazing local characters, some miscasting, a decent job of capturing Lehane","As a fan of these Dennis Lehane novels, I was intrigued to see this film. As the Afflecks are actual Bostonians, it looked like the basic needs of the deep local Boston culture could be captured by these brothers who know the town and its nuances.Unfortunately, Michelle Monaghan as Gennaro was simply awful casting. The character in the books is very Italian sexy through Patrick's eyes, which is a wonderful part of the Boston ethnicity of the whole book series. Nothing against Michelle Monaghan, but she was just wrong for the role. Casey Affleck on the other hand, wasn't bad, as he clearly understands the local flavor. Ed Harris was simply amazing too.The folks who made this film though, did some amazing casting of local Boston actors to really capture the poor underclass of what the neighborhoods are like.Lehanes books are sometimes frenetic, and the filmmakers tried to capture that here, but all in all, it was so so. Its hard to capture the richness of the characters developed in a book within the limited time given to a feature film, as we have seen zillions of times over.There are so many cartoonish characters in the Lehane books, and there could have been a tad more done to introduce some of the bizarre characters that inhabit the books (Bubba for one).All in all, a fair first shot at a complex book.

"Great novel, horrible adaption for the screen.","Gone baby gone was probably one of the greatest novels I've ever read and Im a big fan of Dennis Lehane. This however didn't help the movie at all. And it doesn't feel like Dennis has had any say in how the 'feel' of the movie should be.First of all, the cast: Patrick Kenzie was played by Casey Affleck. A rather young looking mediocre actor. I can imagine him playing in a teen-flick as some pretty boy but a roughneck private detective just doesn't fit. He murmurs when he talks and I had trouble finding his acting/emotions trustworthy. He is also dressed in ridiculously childish clothes throughout the movie. (in the novel he's pretty rough, dressed in shirts/jackets and he also has a beard). I mean seriously, is that too much to ask? Angie Gennaro, played by Michelle Monaghan, was just horrible throughout the whole movie. Although she looks pretty much like Dennis portraits her in the novel, they had stripped her of her cocky attitude and made her seem more like a boring housewife. (The novel displays her as tougher and more aggressive than Kenzie). Michelle's acting was OK I guess, but way too 'weak'.Cheese 'jean Baptiste' in the book was a huge, fat, redheaded, pale Caucasian who thought and acted as if he was black. In the movie he was replaced by a African-American and to my surprise he acted even worse than Casey. They had also scrambled his role in the novel and it got very confusing.As for the rest of the cast they played their roles really nice. Remy Bressant, played by Ed Harris, did a wonderful job and Ed was a good choice for the role.Second, the script & movie.While Ben Affleck tried his best to convert a genius novel of roughly 500 pages into a two hour movie he missed a lot of scenes which in the novel are critical. These scenes were also incredibly badly portrayed. The book is scary and very dark most of the time. The movie however, was a complete joke in that aspect. Almost all the scenes were shot in daylight and gave very little to the spooky theme that the novel had.All in all the movie got confusing and a very emotion novel was turned into a flat emotionless and mediocre drama.Im writing this since I feel that this was not a fair conversion from novel to movie. so basically: Great novel, horrible movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One of the few movies were I tried and failed to point out any flaws.Ben manages to get all the praises with this fine piece, everything is just as good as it could be. Casey's delivered his top performance i think. And of course magnificent acts by the rest of the cast Freeman, Monaghan, Amy Ryan and especially I would say Harris.Simply said, this movie will catch your eyes from the first minute to the last, will emotionally moves you and leave thinking about the events and the decisions that has to be made way after. It touches many aspects of life and will make you debate about what's should be done, the right thing or the right thing ,, you'll get it when you do the right thing and watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

At times a loose cannon, at others, a compassionate catholic, contemplating right and wrong. Ed Harris as always provides some of the best peak action moments as Morgan Freeman maintains his dark, quiet role behind the shadows.The movie really manifests the nature of Boston. The people, the accents, the old bars, the drugs, you actually feel as if you're strolling down the blocks, investigating every lead that comes to your mind. The actors were very authentic and everything seemed so natural, as if you were actually watching what's happening as a bystander.This is far more than just a story about a kidnapping, it is a struggle between the forces of darkness and light, a fight between right and wrong, and the ending will haunt for a while after you finish watching it, thinking about what you would have done to handle the situation.Must not be missed, as said, one of the best movies I've seen to date with an absolutely intense, mysterious and thrilling plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire time.Easiest 10 I've ever given to a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An impressive directing debut for Affleck.,"After taking something of a break from the Hollywood scene, actor Ben Affleck managed to successfully reinvent himself as a filmmaker, and ""Gone Baby Gone"" proved to be just the start of good things, with ""The Town"" and ""Argo"" having also gotten their fair share of critical acclaim. He certainly knows his milieu here, having hailed from Boston himself, and does an excellent job at collecting a variety of totally authentic local characters. He also adapts (with Aaron Stockard) the novel by Dennis Lehane, which tells the tale of a childs' abduction. Bens' younger brother Casey stars as Patrick Kenzie, a private investigator who specializes in missing persons cases, along with romantic & professional partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan). The two of them are hired by the girls' aunt and uncle to supplement the work that the police are already doing. They find themselves getting personally involved as they pursue the leads, both in and out of the company of detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton). Even when it seems as if the case has come to a conclusion, Patrick realizes that too many people have not been playing straight with him, leading to a rich amount of twists and turns. Excellent location shooting, gorgeous cinematography (by John Toll), and an emotionally heavy story are all assets as Affleck takes us on this odyssey. Giving this story resonance is the way it poses a big ethical dilemma: what, really, is the best thing to do for others? Should underhanded methods be permissible if a motive is pure? Viewers will appreciate being intellectually stimulated while they are entertained by the multi layered, complex script. The acting is superb from all of the players: Amy Madigan is sincere and sympathetic as the little girls' aunt, Titus Welliver solid as her uncle, Harris compelling as the lead detective on the case, and Morgan Freeman a tower of strength as usual as the police chief. Casey A. proves himself capable of carrying a picture, but the performer who stands out the most is Amy Ryan as Helene, the girls' trashy mother; she's no less than completely convincing. All in all, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is an effective achievement: deliberately paced, atmospheric, and satisfying, with a wrap-up that doesn't necessarily provide all the answers but raises interesting questions. It comes highly recommended. Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Before Gone Girl, there was Gone Baby Gone","After some time ago watching Ben Affleck in Gone Girl (2014), I also found out that Ben also wrote and directed almost the same themed movie, Gone Baby Gone (2007). This is Ben Affleck's first feature movie as a director. The movie tells the story of a mother who lost her child, the police who were assigned also found no result. Finally, a local private detective (Casey Affleck) is hired to help for searching her nephew. The premise of this movie is almost similar to Gone Girl, isn't it? Both of those tell about a lost person, the difference is in Gone Girl the one who lost is a woman, while in Gone Baby Gone is a kid. We all hope Ben Affleck doesn't lose the momentum in directing this movie, his very first debut.At first, I thought this was a usual crime movie like any other. But no, I was wrong. This movie is pretty thought-provoking. The good thing and bad thing boundaries are not clear and that makes us wonder whether the characters do the right things or not. Casey Affleck was very brilliant under the direction of his brother Ben Affleck. Ben Affleck made a remarkable behind the scene debut with this movie after having been a triumph with Good Will Hunting (1997) as a writer. As an actor, he did not really succeed in the early 2000s. Only Armageddon (1998) and Pearl Harbor (2001) steal my attention. But after those movies, he only appears in mediocre movies such as Daredevil (2003). We all know, after this movie he really did a good job as a director and his movie finally won an Oscar in 2013. All of his movies are also have darker tones and stylish, and I really like it!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good crime thriller delivering solid story with minor flaws overall,"When 4-year-old Amanda goes missing from a low-to-mid class neighborhood of Boston, Amanda's aunt Beatrice hires private detectives Patrick and Angie, who see themselves on a web of lies and deceit. Gone Baby Gone explores the violent world of drug addiction, trafficking, and the toll these acts take on a family.According to IMDb, Gone Baby Gone is the first full-featured length movie that Ben Affleck directed, and I have to say he's done an okay job overall. Not perfect, but a solid start for his first big project. Of course, he had a good starting point: the source material comes from a homonymous novel by Dennis Lehane, one of the screenwriters of this movie.A disclaimer at this point: I haven't read the book. Yet.Gone Baby Gone follows private detectives and couple Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro, detectives specialized on finding people mostly for billing firms. Their motivation for accepting Beatrice's request is a bit shady, but their ultimate drive is to find Amanda safe and sound.Patrick is a great character overall, a mix of a weak exterior with a brave attitude. Everyone dismisses him for looking young and naïve, but he is one strong lead, he takes no BS from anyone, and he is willing to die for this case.His development in the story is good enough, I'd say. He does not go under serious transformation, but his moral dilemma is strong enough to overcome his flat arc. I believe Patrick proves that you don't need characters that change from A to B on every story; you need someone that delivers a solid likeability leading to buy-in from the audience. We believe Patrick's motives, and his likeability is enough that we care for him 'till his last act.Angie, on the other hand, has a minor role in this story. She is Patrick's love interest, but she is aside in this story. When she shows strong motivations towards solving this case, I felt that the story failed showing a bit more of Angie's development. Not a big miss, but it's there.The movie starts off with a monologue, which some die-hard movie-addicts might see as a cardinal sin. Being to the point: it is a sin mainly because it's just exposition. Patrick is the main character, but he is not really struggling with his emotions throughout the movie - at least through most of the movie. So, when we hear him talking to us, it feels like that, like he is just telling us information.Monologue is clearly a director's choice, and I feel like most of these movie's flaws are Direction flaws. Considering Gone Baby Gone is Ben Affleck's debut as a Director, I think it's forgivable, but these flaws exist. For example, another flaw is that the editing is a bit off, for some reason. Gone Baby Gone is from the late 2000s, but I felt like I was in a 1997's movie, 10 years prior to this movie's release.Now, take this not for granted, the story is good, with twists that keeps the momentum. I felt not cheated once, and the overall story progression is satisfactory, the plot intrinsically planned out to deliver the climax and outcome, both unexpected and full of moral conflict.And, to wrap up a good story, an ending that pays off. Good arc overall.On technical levels, Gone Baby Gone is simplistic, but that's good enough for what it is. The R rating is a good choice, considering the themes at hand.Speaking of themes, you should see themes like the sense of duty, right and wrong, toll that drugs take on family, family overall, and also what justice really means. Strong themes, but no strong preachiness to what they mean, just hints for you to figure them all out on your own.Gone Baby Gone is a good crime thriller with solid performance by the actors involved. The story is good and involving, and the ending adds closure to what we see. When the movie ended, I was debating with my wife the ending's implications - a good and fun discussion about what we've just watched. Hopefully, you will have room for that level of discussion too, meaning you've watched something that tickles your brain.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Awesome movie. Ben Affleck should really stick to directing now...,"Previously, I had never really disliked Ben Affleck but I didn't think too highly of him either, as an actor. Then just recently I noticed his brilliant writing and decent performance in Good Will Hunting, and I grew to respect him a littleuntil a few hours ago when that respect drastically shot up to a much, much higher level than before.Gone Baby Gone is definitely a triumphant win for Ben Affleck, considering it was his very first directorial venture (not counting the short film he had made years ago as a student). It is a maturely handled, realistic film which continuously shifts between telling a simple story and portraying some truly devastating moral dilemmas. What I like even more about this film is the way it presents the situations (which are again, very human and plausible); it takes to trouble to show both sides of the coin, and leaves the audience to make their own judgment without brainwashing/preaching them in any sort of way. This is especially significant in regards to the climax, when Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) has to make an important decision. The latter is not made out to be ""the only way out"", and nor are the consequences shown to be miraculously fitting to what Kenzie might have had in mind. Just like any real-life decision, the whole situation is portrayed with a hint of neutrality and uncertainty - because after all, we know absolutely nothing about what's going to happen in the future. We can only make our choices and hope we are right.Looks like I went on a bit of a tangent there so, er, sorry. Anyway, back to the movie. I have to admit that initially, I had been a little disappointed because I wasn't finding the movie asthrilling, as I may have been expecting. But then I realised  the fault had not been the filmmaker's, but my own. Or rather, my upbringing of having seen so many mainstream 'thrillers' that I came to expect nothing but hollow, low-on-substance entertainment every time I heard the words ""detective movie"" or ""mystery thriller"". This movie, may not have the traditional ""in-your-face"" moments but it has something even more special  a heart. Not many filmmakers are able to achieve something like thisAffleck has all the right to feel proud of his work. Oh and of course, my comments would be incomplete if I don't mention the excellent performances by  well, the whole cast. Casey Affleck definitely stood out from the rest but even with their rather short screen times, people like Michelle Monaghan, Ed Harris and Amy Ryan certainly made their presence felt.All in all this is an immensely well made, impactful movie. I'll be very much looking forward to Ben Affleck's next film as a director.My Final Rating: 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Scenario 8/10, Director 8.5/10, Acting 9/10","A complicated story about a missing girl, the world of drugs, the police and a private eye. I thoroughly enjoyed the film. It gave me the same feeling that Mystic River gave me. So I was hardly surprised when I discovered the story was by the same author.Most of the acting was great. Morgan Freeman was obviously ""just"" himself: a great performer. John Ashton and especially Ed Harris were great. There is a monologue in the film by Harris that can be compared to some of the best monologues by the great Al Pacino.But the acting surprise for me was Casey Affleck. I was very impressed with his performance as the private eye, the main character. Very convincing and never outplayed by Freeman or Harris.I compared Gone Baby Gone to Mystic River. That also implies that I compared the directors of both films: Ben Affleck and Clint Eastwood. Ben Affleck did a impressive job. Eastwood is one of the greatest directors. But Affleck showed in his first film he is not far behind. I am already looking forward to other film directed by Ben Affleck.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It Blew Me Away,"Wow. Ben Affleck has really outdone himself in this directorial debut. His skills as a screenwriter and as a director make him a true Hollywood talent. To make a movie on such touchy subjects as drugs, kidnapping, child endangerment, and pedophilia as his debut was needless to say, a huge risk for him. He came out of it with what ended up to be an extremely beautiful and touching film.Casey Affleck deserves every award coming to him. His skills as an actor are only getting better. (He's personally my preferred Affleck brother to watch on the screen...) He was fantastic as Patrick Kenzie the private investigator investigating the kidnapping of little Amanda McCready. He showed amazing heart and passion. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, along with the ever-amazing Michelle Monaghan headed a huge supporting cast that helped further portray the issues and controversy behind the law when children are involved.Based on a book written by Dennis Lehane (of Mystic River fame), this film will bring out a lot of emotions, from anger at every person who didn't pay attention to these disappearing kids, to sadness and empathy for Patrick as he uncovers what happens to these unfortunate children and why.Watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The story deals with cracking a child kidnapping case.Patrick (Casey) is a private detective who has been hired by a missing child named Amanda's maternal uncle and aunt, to help them find out Amanda who has been kidnapped from her house. What lies ahead is a rough road which when traveled eventually led to the mysterious unfolding of all the characters who are directly and indirectly responsible for the kidnap.

The worst film I've ever seen.,"Quite why Ben decided to stick his kid brother in front of camera and direct him to perform the most wooden and emotionally void imitation of himself that is possibly imaginable, is a mystery to me. Whether Ben - who I actually rate very highly as an actor - could have rescued such a drab and soulless attempt at story-telling is questionable, but at least he would have made it worth watching.Poor old Morgan Freeman is so hopelessly miscast and underwhelmed by the whole sorry affair that you can almost see the tears in his eyes. Michelle Monaghan is nothing more than a mildly fruity stooge to the wooden and tasteless Affleck. She barely utters a single half-decent line, and is usually seen behind Affleck - presumably prompting and poking him in the back.Struggling to stay awake - nay, alive - through scene after scene of the lamest and most dilute screenplay I can ever remember, I entirely lost the rather serious nature of the plot unfolding.

After a long wait for and hyped reviews of the delayed directing debut from Ben Affleck Gone Baby Gone was simply an anticlimax.,"After a long wait for and hyped reviews of the delayed directing debut from Ben Affleck Gone Baby Gone was simply an anticlimax. The movie drips with moral high ground and wooden speeches of main characters, some of whom although cast from the top layer of Hollywood, still do not manage to make us believe the candy sweet, naïve dialogues.Casey Affleck playing the main lead is cast well if not through his family connections. He plays the young and street-wise detective on a search for a little missing girl. We are supposed to believe (unsuccessfully) that the case is solved in the middle of the movie, just to see it unravel in the next hour. A poor attempt at bad guy-good guy dilemma, Ben Affleck's movie stinks of American mass-denominator, though-shall-not-sin preaching.The motive of child welfare seems to time well with Ben's own new baby theme, perhaps this was the reason why the story was so black and white. Great potential of this movie could have been exploited so much better in the hands of say, Clint Eastwood, but Affleck, like his protagonist, still has a lot to learn.Visually the film is nothing special either. Sweeping shots of horizons, close-up speeches to lame music, sit more comfortably in 1998 than 2008. In some shots, the actors actually move away from the group as the camera moves onto their face and the music swells, and they proceed to give the God-bless-America-ish speech.I do believe Affleck, the actor and director, rubbed enough shoulders in Hollywood to know better. Lets hope his next movie will prove that.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Superb Debut for Affleck,"There is a certain thing to Affleck's movies - they don't feel flashy. Gone baby gone seems like a straight drama kind of thriller. I watched it in two sittings. After watching the first half I thought it is a no brain-er, but just another police/detective drama. Then the second half unpeeled the layers. But it is not just the story or the mystery, but the Boston setting, the believable cast and above all the moral ambiguity that is shown in the movie that makes it a little haunting as well. A choice that the main character has to make - even you would be left wondering what would you do. Even after the movie ends - it leaves you wondering for a while.Do not miss this movie - you wont regret watching it. It does have a lot of cuss words and lots of them - may be that's how the neighbor's setting is and some blood but no nudity.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Provides Thrills,"What Gone Baby Gone is is an intermittently competent urban detective thriller with some good performances and a startlingly authentic look at a side of Boston rarely if ever seen on screen. Affleck reportedly took the same approach that David Simon used with HBO series The Wire in casting extras and some peripheral characters, picking out locals who wouldn't have to fake their Southie accents, trashy clothes, poses and beaten down faces. Indeed, a couple of Wire regulars appear in Gone Baby Gone (Omar as a cop), and that show's idea that the real cops -- the best cops -- spend part of every day walking their Baltimore beat, building relationships, is also part of what makes local boy Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) an effective private detective in the tightly knit enclaves of Boston.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Gone Baby Gone-Good but bad directed,"The movie turned out pretty good, not great but pretty good.As many of you already know Ben Affleck directed it, this is the first time i see a movie directed by him. Was i impressed? Not Really. He managed to write a good screenplay, but he didn't do so well on putting it on screen. Most of the views were pretty simple, and now and then they were a few helicopter-sky views. I didn't know why because it didn't fit in the movie at all, it was like ""Hey look we have a decent budget which means we can put a camera on a chopper"". Takes more than that to impress me.Anyway, the story however is based on a missing girl, actually i believe it circles around the whole area of kids being kidnapped. The story was pretty weak but since it was so simple it kept you alert. And with a little matching string music, it actually sucessed.Anyway i wouldn't say that this is a GREAT movie, it's good but not great.

The plot is transparently obvious, so most of the time I found myself just waiting to see what sort of complications would be thrown at us in what seemed a half-hearted attempt to create suspense.

I couldn't decide which was worse--the acting (except for Amy Ryan), the completely unbelievable story, or the even more unbelievable casting. Casey Affleck as a private detective who tracks missing persons? Give me a break!

Simple, it's a great story and screenplay, some great actors doing a great job, great direction and a it poses a question, that's hinted at throughout the film, that's so difficult you'd never want to be put in the position of having to answer it.The twists and turns to the plot are really secondary to this question but even though you may work out what's happened it'll still have you thinking would you have done the same thing. It's not a spoiler but anyone who takes the time to watch the film will see a closing scene that leaves you wondering if after everything that's happened is this what the main character wanted.I can't speak too highly of the film as a whole but I'd like to pay a special tribute to Ben Affleck. He'd already won an Oscar for co-writing Good Will Hunting with Matt Damon so this film should not surprise anyone that the script is so good. Considering its quality it's rather surprising that it wasn't received as well as it should have been. Maybe that's because it appeals to a more discerning audience, who knows?

A Brilliant Piece of Screen Writing,"11 November 2007. In perhaps the best script of the year, Ben Affleck has reprised his writing talent since demonstrating his talent with his collaboration with Matt Damon in GOOD WILL HUNTING (1997). This amazingly psychological mystery thriller is blunt, hard-edged, raw, and authentic in its depiction of small, inner city-neighborhood life. There are twists and turns here that all eventually lead to a logical but emotionally unsettling resolution that has no right or wrong answers to it. The photography and direction are spot on. Unlike Sean Penn's more cinematically, densely, and overly technically complex INTO THE WILD (2007), Ben Affleck has kept it forward, direct and tell the story along with the hidden blank spaces that will inevitably filled in later that even the protagonist, played by Casey Affleck isn't fully aware of. Except for one brief scene with a crazed woman coming up that starts behind a close door, this movie was technical perfect and perhaps the stereotypical drunken police scene reduced the power of the dialogues, inner turmoil. One of the richest, deeply involving, and compelling movie in years. Nine out of Ten Stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Definitely a must see,"Ben Affleck's directorial debut came out strong, as Gone Baby Gone reproduced the same sort of gut wrenching drama seen in Mystic River. Both movies were adapted from books by Dennis Lehane.The movie plays like a morality tale seen through the eyes of Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck), who plays a private detective in a run down Boston neighborhood. When Kenzie is asked to look into a case of a missing local girl, he and his partner/girlfriend Angie (played by Michelle Mongahan) soon discover the grim realities and horrors associated with child kidnappings. Morgan Freeman plays a police detective who heads the Boston department responsible for discovering missing persons, and Ed Harris is one of the cops assigned to the case.Although it seems that Patrick and Angela are confronted with moral quandaries just about every five minutes, the movie is not overly preachy, and does not endorse any particular ideology or belief system. Indeed it's very easy to sympathize with many of the arguments made in the movie, including the final one made by Morgan Freeman, which is somewhat of a twist although not quite as much as other reviews have made it out to be. The movie ran for just under two hours, though it sure felt longer due to some of the suspense. There are about three extremely climactic scenes in the movie, which make for some great film making but also for a good bit of downtime to recover and prepare for the next one.Casey Affleck, who's probably better known for his comedic performances, did a great job as the main character. Although if you only know him from elsewhere, it may be hard to adjust. Morgan Freeman was, as usual, great. And Ed Harris and John Ashton (famous for his role as Detective Taggart in Beverly Hills Cop) were wonderful as a good cop/bad cop team.Overall, the movie was great. But before we crown Ben Affleck as a new Spielberg, it'd be best to see him do a few more movies first. Remember he was also great in Good Will Hunting, and then went on to box office hell with Pearl Harbor, Gigli, Jersey Girl, Paycheck, the list goes on and on.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ben Affleck's Masterpiece,"What a truly great mystery. Gone Baby Gone has all the elements any good mystery story should have - misdirection, crazy twists and turns, and bloodshed (just to add to the excitement). The all-star cast especially elevates Gone Baby Gone to heights that exceed most mysteries and thrillers produced in this day and age.The person who earned this film an Oscar nomination: Amy Ryan. Rightfully so. Appearing in supporting roles in both The Office and The Wire, Amy Ryan goes well out of her comfort zone to play a druggie coked out of her mind, conflicted emotionally over her missing child (at points she can care less, at others it is heartbreaking how she takes it). It is difficult not to marvel at Ryan's performance; she is completely believable as being psychologically disturbed which is rare from an actress who is sane in her other roles (well, at least in The Wire). It is very difficult to pull off being a convincing drug addict, and Ryan is arguably the best part of this film.The plot is on and off at points; in the first half of the film it is easy to notice that something seems ""off,"" but it is hard to put a finger on it, making the audience question the events as a good mystery should. The outcome of a mystery should be a surprise, but you don't want to keep the audience completely in the dark if you want the outcome to seem plausible. However, the logic of the situations in the first half of Gone Baby Gone does not add up in ways that are too obvious.What makes up for this? Practically everything else about the film. The story eventually gets to a point where the morality of certain situations and choices is questioned by both the characters and the audience, and with good reason too. Movies are meant to be about the human condition, and when you have a film like Gone Baby Gone pose difficult questions of what is ethical, or what the greater good is in certain situations, you have an outstanding movie (and it helps when the twist of any mystery is very unexpected).Gone Baby Gone is an overlooked work by Ben Affleck. It is his best film, but it did not get the recognition it deserved when it was released.4.0/4.0",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Adaptation??? Call it, bad re-invention...","This was a disappointment... What a terrible movie... Did someone in that crew actually read the book??

Gets under your skin and stays there,"Boston resides in the marrow of the Afflecks. Ben Affleck directs his younger brother Casey to an arduously plaintive performance as an amateur Boston gumshoe in his adaptation of novelist Dennis Lehane's ""Gone Baby Gone"", a film that is so quietly accumulative in power when its collapses in morality become tangled in its web of inescapable rot, and where those who seem to have good in them always get hurt.When 4 year-old Amanda McCready is abducted from her working-class Dorchester home, her aunt and uncle (Amy Madigan and Titus Welliver) ""augment"" the limp search conducted by the police when she hires local detectives Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to sift though the neighbourhood and extract information from its distrusting merchants and volatile proles. The elder Affleck adroitly portrays Boston's inherent tribalism and rotting facades with the duo's tortured investigations through the diseased surfaces that recede from the pale daylight into shadows and grime, and eventually through the city's underground of venality so terrible a thing to imagine that it gets under your skin and stays there.Closer to an affecting study of unravelling communal drama than a riveting crime piece, this urban notturno draws on its mileage when the investigation into the little girl's disappearance reveals dark secrets and a trail that leads in circles, discovering more than what they sought to know about themselves. Characters like the girl's mother, a social parasite named Helene (played fiercely by a noteworthy Amy Ryan), balances and evocates the film's residual outrage and pity for its ravaged denizens. Further populated by magnificent performances from Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman as jaded cops, it lends Affleck's directorial debut a confident swagger that allows focus on the material, so unafraid of disturbing its audience, to keep patience in its mauling eruptions of nihilism.There's both a deepness of procedurals and an authenticity of time and place in the script's constant turning of the screw, the narrative wheels churn as damaged children and ineffectual adults begin to take the stage. It just gets darker and more intense in the film's inspection of gnarled human nature, and the reasons that coerce it is at the centre of its slow-burning style, giving it an effectively sustained dramatic tension as its moral convictions become no less irreducible.Ben Affleck's ambitious and unremittingly desolate purview of his turbulent city is never intellectualised, but instead remains meticulously modulated to the emotional resonance of Kenzie as he journeys from one stinging moral decision to another, evincing the confluence of conundrums that's entrenched into the very fibres of the people we are and aspire to be. ""Gone Baby Gone"" presents to us how warped and strident individual instinctive moralities can be and what the right thing truly entails in a world that remains unresponsive to the inner cries of the film's palpitating bleakness.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Doing right?,"I will like to say only one thing.. that is doing the right thing is hard because there is no right or wrong. Only suffering from which you can't escape but must endure.Doing right distorts moral compass of a man, it makes him bomb countries to save people only to ironically kill hundreds of thousands of them, etc..What the main character did was right in a sense that if we were to do right by Remsy standards we would be kidnapping children all the time, invading countries all the time.. the point to make is .. we have to endure what is wrong and try to fix it without helping ourselves feeling good-that is selfish..Sacrifice yourself, a guardian to good we must be, but not the ruler and judge..love people..",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A wonderful crime-drama,"When I saw ""Hollwoodland"" last year I could not help but be impressed with Ben Affleck's terrific portrayal of George Reeves, Hollywood's original Superman. Not to say it was his first good performance, but as of late he hasn't brought much to the screen in terms of quality work (Daredevil anyone?). With his directorial debut, ""Gone Baby Gone"", I think Mr. Affleck has found his stride in a way that he has never before found on screen. The film is based on Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name. He also penned ""Mystic River"" which Clint Eastwood turned into an Oscar-winning masterpiece, so the comparisons are inevitable, but I think Affleck's film stands strongly on its own.""Gone Baby Gone"" tells the gritty story of private investigators Patrick Kenzie, played by Casey Affleck, and his partner/girlfriend Angie Gennero, played by Michelle Monaghan, as they attempt to track down a missing four-year-old girl in south Boston. Telling you more than this is impossible because the twists and turns in this film come at such a fast and furious pace that anymore info could ruin the viewing experience.Casey Affleck's performance is terrific. When first I heard that Ben Affleck was using his brother, who is probably best known for his role as Virgil Malloy in Ocean's 11 and both its sequels, I was a little skeptical, yet I could not have been more wrong. He seems to blend into the neighborhood like he belongs, which of course he is supposed to. Patrick seems aloof, sometimes funny, but that quickly changes as events spiral out of control. Later in the film when he makes some decisions that will surprise you, I think the audience understands why, even if they don't agree with him. This is a real breakout role, the younger Affleck's first real commercial lead and I think we will see more of him sooner rather than later. I for one am looking forward to future projects from him.That said ""Gone Baby Gone"" has some of the best supporting performances you could ask for. Ed Harris' performance as the police detective heading the investigation is fierce. He is a terrific counterpoint to Casey Affleck's quiet, more subtle role. Morgan Freeman, who plays the police captain overseeing the investigation, is good, but he has such little screen time that he takes a back seat to everyone else. Michelle Monaghan has done a terrific job as the uncomfortable partner/girlfriend who thinks they are in over their head before they even begin. Last but certainly not least is the setting of south Boston itself. Ben Affleck's use of real locations and local extras really shows the downtrodden lifestyle of Southie. Everyone and everyplace fit perfectly.It took guts for Ben Affleck to take on such a heavy piece on his first attempt. The subject of child abduction and the moral quandaries the character's face is daunting to say the least. The overall ""what would you be willing to do to save a child"" theme is not light fare, but I think Ben Affleck has brought it together wonderfully. ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a real stand out in the crime-drama genre and may even see some recognition come awards season.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Okay,"I hesitated between a score of 5/10 and 6/10 and eventually settled on 5.The performances are good, and so is the direction. The real problem lies with the scenario.The final act of the story asks a very interesting moral question. However, that question is badly asked: the story is so outrageous, nonsensical even, that it hinders the impact that it could have on the viewer. A more realistic script might have made it a really memorable movie, but it just felt like a very long TV episode from a standard crime drama.Until that final act, the story was good enough. It's failing at the part that could have made it great that eventually makes it just average.I can't say that I wouldn't recommend this movie, but don't expect a masterpiece.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great surprise and another proof that actors can direct,"Ben Affleck's first directing try and definitely good one. ""Gone Baby Gone"" is not a masterpiece, 'only' a good movie and one of the biggest surprises of 2007. Why? Story is the most important part of every movie. This one has the story and it talks about disappearance of 4 year old Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien). Amanda's mother Helene (Amy Ryan) is drug addict so girl's aunt Beatrice McCready (Amy Madigan) hires two private detectives: Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), who all also lovers. Chief of police Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) wants to find the girl, as he is tormented with the disappearance and death of his own daughter, so he assigns detectives Bressant (Ed Harris) and Poole (John Ashton) to help Patrick and Angie.Story is simply great, because you don't know what is going to happen till the end and the suspense is also on top. What is also good is that Affleck managed to present us great shoots of Boston and his interiors are also remarkable (especially house of Trett family). If you have a good script you can attract good actors too. Ben had luck so he could hire his brother Casey for the main role and on that way he managed to escape his own appearance in this movie (which is great because he could stay focused only on directing). Ben also knows abilities of Casey and two of them works just fine. This script also attracted great stars like Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris (my personal favorite in this movie). But Amy Ryan (Oscar nomination) in the role of Helene provides us what this film needs. Great role of mother who is torn between drugs and her missing baby. Only one thing that bothered me in this casting: Michelle Monaghan. Her character is in this story only because of that scene when Patrick has to choose what he will do at the end. Monaghan wasn't given a role so she could show her acting abilities and that is the only weak link of this great scenario.My favorite scenes are conversation between Patrick and Bressant, when Bressant is drinking (Harris is great!!!) and of course the last scenes in the McCready house and the whole issue that is put in front of Patrick (cause he controls Amanda's future). At the end I've got one plea. Please watch this movie, cause it's good, strong and innovative.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

life is complicated,"...in contrast to the impression you get from much infotainment. ""Gone Baby Gone"" reflects this complexity. I was mildly hopeful about this film given the intrigue of ""Mystic River"". ""Gone Baby Gone"" looks deep into all of our souls and asks whether we will choose life or death. The reviews seems to capture the essence of the film very well and I haven't got much to add, but I would also like to recognize Ben Affleck's direction which I think became more assured as the film went on. I think at times he overstated the local flavor of the film at the beginning, as though there aren't a lot of other places in the country that can't boast similarly....and there was a part early in the movie in which I thought the climax had come too early. But the mystery just deepens and Ben Affleck grows more confident and at ease with some very delicate moral areas. As noted, Casey Affleck is...well yes, perhaps there is the whiff of nepotism, but in addition, he's really really really good. He is misread as a pretty boy throughout the movie when he actually has a quite clear moral vision. The challenges he and his detective partner and lover Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan playing her character as loving but reserved and professional, perhaps to retain some distance from the horrors of the world) face are endlessly astonishing; I like films such as this, like Mystic River and LA Confidential in which it seems the double-crosses never end, but I didn't see the depth of the horror here coming. The acting is, as also stated by many other posters, excellent. I found the flawed mother Helene McCready played very capably by Amy Ryan. Ryan captures the dangerous flaws of a very troubled woman for whom there may or may not be a lot of hope. Ultimately however, it is questionable whether her sins are more serious than some other characters'. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are typically able and Amy Madigan is perhaps the most conventional character in the film.Dennis Lehane's novel provides the source material for a wonderfully gritty movie, as it did for Mystic River and apparently another upcoming film, ""Shutter Island"" which Scorsese has signed on to bring to the screen, and in which Leonardo DiCaprio is starring. But Ben Affleck's cool, assured direction is most crucial to translating this complex and soulful novel to the screen. This is a modern film in which the value of a human being is recognized.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You won't regret watching this,"The first thing I have to say is the cast rocked. Harris and Freeman were top picks. Casey Affleck manages his part well. Yes, he's not a leading man, but his character didn't need a Russell Crowe type actor to play him. The storyline is good, even if the characters come off a tad cartoonish. The same could have been said for ""Mystic River"" if the acting hadn't been so spot on. This film's plot is the reverse of ""Mystic River"". In Mystic River, the victims become the purpetrators. In ""Gone Baby Gone"", the purpetrators are ultimately, the victims. These two films share a common theme. There are no good guys. There are no clear cut distinctions between good and evil. Right and wrong become viewpoints rather than right and wrong. And isn't this the ""truth"" of life I mean the real truth? The kind of truth they don't teach in schools or churches. Ben Affleck hits paydirt. Maybe his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame will be made after all.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A surprisingly engrossing directorial debut for Affleck...,"Shaun Munro's Film Reviews (www.shaunmunro.co.uk):English readers may recognise Gone Baby Gone only through the controversy surrounding its release in the United Kingdom, whereby, due to the recent disappearance of four year old Madeleine McCann, the film's release has been delayed until April of next year. Life's ability to imitate art aside, Gone Baby Gone, based on Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name, is a gritty, competently acted, and surprisingly well-directed effort from Ben Affleck. Not only does the film present an intriguing, winding plot, but it also asks the viewer several questions, and the moral dilemma of the film's climax is a painful, disturbing one which will keep audiences arguing for years to come.Affleck serves well to throw the viewer headlong into the kidnapping story from the outset, introducing us to private investigator Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck), who is hired by the aunt of the missing young girl. Kenzie's girlfriend, Angie (Michelle Monaghan), is also his investigative partner, and works as a means of opposition to his steely determination to discover the whereabouts of young Amanda. Angie claims that she doesn't wish to find the remains of a child, whether they be dead or alive, if the results may be overly harrowing (such as the child having been heavily abused)  such a view is an interesting one that less daring films would ostensibly choose to omit. However, it must be said that Monaghan's character is the film's weak link, and appears to largely be superfluous  she does little to drive the narrative, and other than one particularly daring moment, she seems to work as a device for Kenzie to bounce dialogue off of, a sidekick of sorts.Above most all else, Gone Baby Gone is a film comprised of magnificent acting talent, and truer in no great instances than those of Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris. Freeman portrays Captain Jack Doyle, an officer with a chip on his shoulder, and his involvement in the plot's resolution is greater than most would expect at the outset. Freeman assumes one of the more intriguing characters in the film, although no-one is as thoroughly interesting as the super-charged Detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris). With his facial hair, Harris' look is a departure from the ordinary, yet it provides Harris with the ""badass"" look that the part so very much requires. Much like Doyle, he is wary of the baby-faced Affleck, yet in contrast, he is far more acerbic, and far less calm.The novel aspect of the film lies within the fact that Kenzie, as not only a PI, but as someone who grew up in the underbelly of Boston, is privy to information, and to contacts that the police are not  he is able to penetrate the hidey-holes of Boston, something which ""stuffed shirts"" cannot. In many investigative dramas, such attributes would appear clichéd or tired, yet due to Kenzie not being a cop, this concept remains fresh and not insulting to the viewer.The manner in which the facts of the case unravel occurs surprisingly quickly  various discoveries and interrogations lead to a very promising prospect less than half-way through the film, yet the tension and mystery are nevertheless relentless in their intensity. As Kenzie and the police are faced with more and more convincing leads, and as each one is debunked, it only seeks to both fluster and intrigue the characters, as well as the viewer even more.By the half-way mark, things are looking very bleak indeed for young Amanda, and it is impressive that the film burns so quickly, given the tendency for procedural criminal investigation pictures to keep the viewer in the dark until the film's final moments. Affleck's various monologues bridge the gap between the segmented narrative, which dilutes the passage of time more than you may expect, and more unexpected (yet very welcome) narrative intrusions allay any restlessness the audience may otherwise feel, in keeping them fed with information, whilst still managing to maintain a level of genuine intrigue.Whilst Gone Baby Gone's main attraction is the painful moral crux that plagues Kenzie in the film's latter moments, it is not just a film of morality, but of religion, and conflicting ideologies in general. In one show-stealing scene between Harris and Affleck, these beliefs clash  Bressant's ideals may not be orthodox, yet he is driven, clear in his ideas, and he garners results. Kenzie, however, is ambivalent in regard to the lengths people should go to in order to protect children, and this ill will is worsened by his Christian upbringing. It makes for fascinating wordplay, particularly in regard to Harris' Oscar-worthy ""You've gotta take a side"" speech.The picture's end serves up genuine surprises, and whilst it essentially becomes cat and mouse fare, it is very engaging, masterfully constructed cat and mouse fare. The ""big twist"" isn't initially convincing, although the explanation and accompanying moral dilemma are utterly compelling. With everyone, including his girlfriend, against him, and warning him of the potential dangers of his actions, Kenzie must make a decision. He stands to lose a lot, and to damage many people (including himself) with what is the ""right"" choice (at least legally). The turn is one of genuine surprise, and by the film's end, it elicits a disturbing, yet incredibly vital social commentary on how we raise our children.Ben Affleck has turned many heads with his directorial debut  it is doubtful that many expected his first venture behind the camera to succeed to this high a degree, yet with such an impressive level of acting talent on board (no moreso than the brilliant Ed Harris), it would have been difficult for Affleck to fail. Gone Baby Gone is little in way of inventive film-making, but it is an impressive effort from all involved, and it raises a number of valid moral and ethical questions.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ben Affleck's rough and arresting directorial debut,"In the poor South Boston neighborhood of Dorchester (writer Dennis Lehane's birthplace) the TV news and an avid public are all over a story: a little girl has been kidnapped. Family members want Patrick Kenzie (Ben Affleck) and his girlfriend and partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), young missing persons detectives, to investigate. Police Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) objects. Police detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) aren't friendly. But Patrick and Angie are tough and they persist. It's they who unravel what turns out to be one of Lehane's typically tangled webs.Gone Baby Gone doesn't completely work as a movie, but it's still a very interesting directorial debut for Ben Affleck--who took a wise risk in trusting his younger brother Casey for the central role. Casey's no novice, but never a star till this year. He's arresting as the shifty, insecure Ford in Andrew Dominik's arty Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, and he embodies innocent idealism equally effectively here. Ben also took a risk in deciding to go for grit, with many actual denizens of the low life world it depicts used as minor actors.Dennis Lehane's story set in the white ghettos of Boston, which forms the movie's basis, isn't as deep and dark and mystical a tale as his Mystic River, filmed four years ago by Clint Eastwood to great acclaim. But the issues this film raises are simpler, plainer, and ultimately more troubling: they go to the roots of the uneasy equation of morality and class. And despite use of some solid pros, including Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, this one doesn't have the distractions of Eastwood's star-studded cast.Casey Affleck is small. He's nice looking, but not as commanding or handsome as Ben. He has a rusty, reedy voice that doesn't carry; it just stands in the air. He also has a quality of freshness and surprise, as if the camera's caught him off guard but he refuses to flinch. His Patrick Kenzie will stand up to the toughest, most evil people in Dorchester: he has balls of brass without seeming to know it, or to know any other way. It's this strength from the early scenes, where he's tentative, yet unyielding, that gives conviction to his later choices.The film is anchored by Morgan Freeman in the important secondary role of the police captain, a man who's lost a child to kidnapping himself and now heads a Crimes Against Children unit. The other main role is Ed Harris' as the feisty, mysterious detective from Louisiana; Harris shows his stuff here; he's hard and slick without cliché. Some commentators have objected to Ben's use of bloated bar bums and other authentic white ghetto locals; they've said these salty characters are too distracting and pull the story down into an inferno of lowlife immorality.But that's the point. From the first, when Bea McCready (Amy Madigan) and her husband, Lionel (Titus Welliver) appear to seek Patrick and Angie's help three days after the highly publicized abduction of their little niece Amanda, things feel fishy. This is a world so hopeless and off center it crawls with sleaze. It soon emerges that Amanda's single mom Helene (Amy Ryan), Lionel's sister, is a real mess, more into turning tricks to buy drugs than minding her little girl. She's a drug runner herself, and the abductors are probably people she's embroiled with.The incredible, troubling question that will arise is whether Amanda's mother is at fault herself; if she cared; and obviously, if she was a fit mother. But can she be faulted for the lowness of her own life? Taking us into convoluted lives and twisted emotions warped by deprivation, addiction, and traumatic loss, the story at times seems like a slum version of something from James Ellroy's ultra-lurid (but highly cinematic) ""L.A. Quartet,"" with similarly twisted machinations and motives in a Lehane permutation. Nobody is what they seem to be, except for Patrick and Angie. The unraveling revelations may strain credulity, but they keep you paying attention.The movie is very strong on atmosphere and situation, not quite so good at sustaining the forward momentum of the action. Most of what happens seems to come through flashback or review. The investigation tale ends, and then it picks up again later. I'm not sure the movie ever recovers its energy, and yet still t it gets much more interesting, despite the fact that it flounders a bit somewhere midway in the denouement. But then the moral dilemma comes hard in the face of the young investigators--and us--an issue so clearly posed and firmly dwelt upon that we carry it out beyond the credits.8 1/2-9",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

When offbeat is awful.,"Ben Affleck matches his wooden acting talent as a first time director with this shabby attempt to match in mystery and atmosphere Mystic River. Sloppily edited, filled with cliché performances and tortured plot twists it rings false from beginning to end.A child has been kidnapped in a rough clannish section of Boston called Dorcester. It's clear that the folks in this hardscrabble part of town have little faith or trust in the cops so the family hire a pair of local private eyes to get some answers. The two then form an uneasy partnership with a couple of veteran detectives as they pursue a rogues gallery of low lives to get some answers. It makes for some very haphazard storytelling on the part of director Affleck.Keeping things deliberately confusing this patchwork quilt of a mystery is poorly stitched together as scenes bump into each other rather than transition smoothly. GBG jolts the audience in more than one scene but in Affleck's incapable hands the action wanders and the actors remain unconvincing. He seems content to allow his music score to telegraph the emotions of actors who offer little more than solemn stares.Offbeat casting can sometimes revive tired genre types and instill something fresh into the recipe but Casey Affleck looks like a runaway from a boy scout troop confining his performance to cold expression and side glances. PI partner and girlfriend played by Michelle Monaghan does little more than stand around waiting to jump in a quarry. The chemistry between the two is non-existent. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris simply punch a clock with Freeman under and Harris over acting. As the abducted child's mother Amy Ryan is excellent but it is the only bright spot to be found in this oafish production that flounders from start to finish.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A Superb, Morally Compex Film","Gone Baby Gone is the best film I've seen so far this year. I can't think of another movie that is so mournful, or another mood piece which so perfectly and beautifully sustains its mood throughout.Ben Affleck memorably has compassion and empathy for his characters, while not shrinking away from the appalling aspects of their personalities and the grimness of dead-end lives And what a joy to see a thoughtful movie with moral ambiguities, one that is asks hard questions and presents no easy answers. The ethical struggles through which the characters are going are so deeply expressed as to be completely palpable, and this is accomplished without an ounce of sentimentality.Affleck's non-judgmental stance towards most of the characters adds to the depth and richness of the picture. The film's ambiance is also superb  the production design, costumes, extras all convey such a strong sense of a very particular place.And what acting! If we didn't know Amy Ryan was an acclaimed stage actress, we'd assumed she was someone Affleck came upon at a bar in Dorchester. She's uncannily good. And a shout out to Amy Madigan, who is just as impressive (and in some ways even more terrifying than Ryan). As for Casey  wow! After The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Bob Ford, another superb and unforgettably self-effacing performance. One of the most exciting things film-wise this year has been his emergence as a major, major acting talent. I love what Mahnola Dargis wrote in the NY Times: ""I'm not sure exactly when Casey Affleck became such a good actor."" A truly haunting achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent adaptation--Hooray for Ben!,"When I saw the first preview of this movie, I got goosebumps all over. I'd read the book by Dennis Lehane, and ""Gone Baby Gone"" is THE one & only story I've ever read which stuck in my gut and my soul without ever letting go. I was a little worried the ending might have been altered in the movie, but I've been rooting for Ben Affleck ever since the public began its mean assault on him, so I figured he wouldn't let me down...and he did not.The plot was condensed, and some characters changed a little, as they would have to be. The language was updated (perhaps a bit foully) from the clever and ironic original, but the meat of the story came through bright and loud and clear. The direction and acting were brilliant, and so, so real. Casey Afflect was perfect, Ed Harris will surely receive an Oscar, and Amy Ryan was so effective, I didn't even notice she was acting, I was too busy loathing her. Keep your eyes on her future, people!This is a gritty, hard, thought-provoking story.It's a story I'm so very glad has risen from the obscurity (these days) of print, to the toppity-top of the silver screen. Yay and bravo all around! Oh, and by the way, the ending WAS changed just a little bit from the novel. Screenwriters Ben Affleck and Aaron Stockard made the best decision ever to make the very last scene a study in subtle hopefulness rather than the heartbreaking conclusion to the novel. Both endings are good, but I think the movie's ending will draw more of an audience, and, perhaps, effect more change in the long run. I hope so, anyway.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Must see movie,After seeing this movie I could not wait to talk to my son who recommended that I see it. It has been years since I felt this way about a movie.There were 2 big moral decisions that had to be made by Casey Affleck's character in the movie. I agreed with one and disagreed with the other.This movie has many surprises and twists and turns. The acting was great and the message of the movie even greater.Child abduction and child abuse are such important topics. This movie addressed them well and left me with much to ponder.Ben Affleck did a fantastic job. This movie is a must see.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"What defines a family, a man, a neighborhood?","Deeply thought provoking, incredibly well-acted, and magnificently directed. This is a riveting movie that is gritty and intelligent and asks some pretty damn tough questions. Hats off to everyone involved...I have newfound respect for Ben Affleck. Let's not forget Dennis Lehane -- no movie without the book. I urge you all to see this movie and ask yourself what you would have done. This movie led to hours of discussion in our house, not only on the moral issues involved, but also on the many little touches that made the movie effective -- particularly the use of ""real people"" to portray the citizens of Dorchester.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good Baby Good,"Ben Affleck has a lot riding on this movie, but he couldn't have backed a better horse for his directorial debut- combine his smart, sharp approach to film with the Boston flavored sewer poetry of author Dennis Lehane, and you have a match made in heaven. Affleck colors this missing persons thriller with a local flair, the kind of down and dirty authenticity that 'The Departed' reached for but missed. He also proves his skill with directing actors-uniformly excellent actors like Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris give some of their best performances here, and up and comers Casey Affleck and Amy Ryan give some of the strongest, bravest performances in modern movie history. Still, Ben-Ben's first try behind the camera is flawed-the second act sags into a series of script beats and serious speechifying, and he makes the mistake of having Casey provide a few condescending, awkwardly placed voice-overs that had me scratching my head. But for a first try, Mr. Affleck has done better than many-he has crafted what is, for the most part, a powerful thriller with a wrenching ending that will have you talking. Is it perfect? No. But it's absolutely worth your time.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No good deed goes unpunished,"At the end................what a moral dilemma! The end of this smart film will not be revealed here but it is the kind that has you thinking and talking for days after. Ben Affleck's directorial debut shows he has the right stuff for stories set in his childhood area of South Boston, as he hits all the right notes to me except for two in this gritty, grim and non-smiling story about child abduction, a situation that is getting to be as common as roadside trash in our rapidly declining society.The poor white working class characters of South Boston were shown in all their lack of glory, as downtrodden a folk as you will see anywhere in the country, city or rural. Poverty, obesity and other physical repulsiveness(and not just the people),decay, trash, and trashiness were everywhere and in nearly everyone there, and set the scene well for the very harsh tale to follow. Ben's brother Casey was very good in his starring role as a private detective hired to help solve the kidnapping. He is short on emotional range, but that usually fatal defect in an actor actually became a positive in this very serious role, as after much violence and deception, he finally solves the confusing riddle of convolution created by the terrific Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman in their pivotal cop roles involving the kidnapping of the 4 year old daughter of a drug addict single mom, played by the accomplished stage actress, Amy Ryan.Amy Ryan was mostly very effective overall in her druggie/mom from hell role, but her poised body language learned for the stage was not realistic compared to the slumped over, beaten down body language of the addicts I have seen. But, she did convey well the repulsiveness of the poor white underclass, using gross denial, insult, disrespect, and abject irresponsibility and foul language to the hilt, and was especially upsetting when we saw a ""mother"" like her repulsive self ""raising"" an innocent daughter who would surely pay, along with society, in many hard ways over the years for the sins of her horribly flawed mother. If she was lucky enough to live through it, that is.Another nagging problem was that Casey's Dudly DoRight character was very conflicted at the end about the dilemma discussed below, but not at all about taking the law into his own hands earlier and making a decision that is only the state's right to make. Extreme moral right and criminal wrong in the same person?.....just like many of the rest of us probably, but disturbing here in that his lawless deed was so in contrast with the rigidly self-righteous stance he took at the end.Michelle Monaghan was gorgeous and terrific as Affleck's smart and aware girlfriend and business associate and, to me, had the correct opinion of what should have happened in the end. It all boiled down to this......yes, what happens to one child, good or bad, will not change the world much I understand well, but the growing collective evil in the world has to be questioned and examined by all of us when it is seen to grow by the choices we all voluntarily make in our lives that we think are right at the time. So, is traditional moral right always the best solution for any problem? Or, compared to strict traditional moral right, is what is best for one child at a time the practical best answer overall for that child and for society even if it contrasts with traditional moral right?That is the very tough issue all responsible viewers will give much thought to upon seeing this film. See it...and think hard about the problem. It's a crucial issue in our decaying society, and Ben Affleck showed it here in as convincing yet entertaining a way as anyone could show it in film. But, don't expect a feel-good Hollywood ending as there was nothing of the kind, and I applaud Affleck for making that choice here. One of the best films of the year so far.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I Hung out at the Bar they exited in Dorchester!,"When Patrick and Angie back out of the bar they had trouble in,they show the Front of the bar we hung in. It is called Cataloni's. If you look they show an alley that runs between the bar and the building next door. There are a set of stairs that lead up to the Strand theater. Also you can see St.Kevins church and school. My wife's whole family went there and I got married there. This is the second time I have seen this location used in a TV/Movie. I saw it years ago during a ""Spencer for hire"" episode. Of course when Robert Urich crosses the street he does not cross Hancock street where the bar is but he ends up on Washington street in Roxbury.I always get a kick out of stuff like this. You could tell someone from the Boston area made this film. They got most of the little things right like the accents,locations and such. In the Book Patrick and Angie's office was in the Tower of the old St.Margeret's church. This must not have been possible to shoot or I am sure they would have left this in. Just a great,great film. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Disappointing, Contrived","Like ""Mystic River,"" Bostonians (and fans of that epic city) have lauded ""Gone Baby Gone"" as yet another ""masterpiece."" The truth is that Ben Affleck brings the same lackluster feel to his directing as he does to most of the films he chooses to star in. Sure, the script is snappy, with dialogue that hits the viewer like a slap to the face, but the plot is overly contrived and the twists are elementary at best.While Casey reinforces the fact that he is a fine actor destined for great things, he is terribly miscast (probably, let's see, because he's the director's brother). Maybe its his slight frame or boyish looks, but Casey plays a tough guy about as well as a high-school cheerleader. Even Morgan Freeman seems out of place as a Georgian uprooted and serving in the Boston PD. As portrayed in the film, he doesn't seem to fit in either world.The direction from Ben Affleck, too, seemed very amateur. Ben fancies himself an auteur, but the film instead comes off as amateurish. The quick cuts and blackout voiceovers only reinforce this point. Let's face it Ben: you're not Paul Greengrass.""Gone Baby Gone"" carries a certain amount of emotional gravitas, which is why parents probably relate to and enjoy the film. But let's not pass off mediocre film-making as great cinema.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The wrong baby left .. right.,"People are in awe of Ben Affleck these days with his astronomical rise to another level of stardom and his charming ways of capturing those momentous images on camera. Frankly speaking I don't get the hoopla around 'Argo', I didn't see much into it and my dubiousness is not because of the pro American sentiments obvious in the movie. I will talk more about it when I write about that movie, another day. I enjoyed watching The Town because of it's spunkiness. But the movie that triumphs over these newly featured ones is his directorial debut 'Gone Baby Gone'.I do like to make confession that I have made an attempt to see this before but I couldn't, I found it slow pace and Casey Affleck that to be replica of James Franco in that Oscar ceremony. But what a imbecile I was to ignore such work of pure awe. The movie starts with a beautiful voice over by Casey Affleck then moves over to the main story. It's has Boston city named all over it, in it's wide shots, in it's short glimpses and in it's people. As the detectives makes conversation with characters played by Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, there is a Tarantino- ish feel to it albeit not with the devilish music background. Casey Affleck character is developed with the morals and chauvinism of a do- gooder. He rarely shows fear in his eyes and his persona is very enigmatic.I found a lot scenes in this movie that were worth remembering but I won't mention those because I might have to sound spoiler alert. There are moments of disgust not because there is blood or violence(hardly) but the kind of people shown and how they live their life. As the secrets box keeps opening, there are things that come to fore, characters get more intense, they develop backstory and this whole whirlpool of characters and their stories boils down to questionable climax. I know some people might be left unsatisfied with the ending, but what could he do. He made a decision that nobody agreed on, he made it by himself he lost everything and there is no chance he could go back on it. It's against him. By the way you get a ominous feeling at the start when Angie asks Patrick if their is a good life and if this case can change anything worse about it.Performance wise everybody is top notch, Casey Affleck holds that grip and control over his character that I have seen rarely. Michelle Monaghan is little subdued and I thought like the makers wanted her to have more but it didn't permit. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris with their ferocious performance are like fuel to this movie. Every now then the sparks fly when they staple those dialogues. Titus Welliver, Amy Ryan and others were superb throughout their acts. A pat on the back of Ben Affleck, rightfully his best movie for me. Back ground music keeps up with the pace of the story.A must watch for those who like the movies with mind inducing thoughts and questioning morals. A must watch for everyone.Mindbugged.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent; treats tough subject matter in a non-disturbing manner,"First off, I read the book by Dennis Lehane. I wondered how well the movie would stand up to the book (like Peter Jackson so famously has done with Lord of the Rings), and I was very pleasantly surprised. There were a few minor changes made by Affleck but they worked very well for the screen.What I was most struck by in the movie was how REAL the people were. The acting was completely transparent. I also appreciated how the movie dealt with a very disturbing subject matter, child abduction. I was expecting to sit through disturbing parts of the movie where children were involved, but the movie mostly implied what could happen without going there, thankfully.It was a fantastic movie, with a complex plot but not one that was confusing. Acting was superb by all. Cinematography showed me what I wanted to see at any given moment. Direction, pacing, editing all great.I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pleasantly Surprised,"When I read the back about a kidnapped girl I wasn't too excited to see the movie. They bore me with their excessive action scenes, extreme story lines and predictability. But my father wanted to see it so I didn't argue. The first thing that turned me off was the swearing, I know in those neighborhoods with violence, drugs, etc... well in most neighborhoods now a days is a lot of swearing which I don't like. The one thing that kept me watching was the believability of the characters. All of them are written and acted as people you would see in real life. Never over the top, raw, with beliefs that make sense if you were them. With views even how wrong it may be you can understand their thinking. The actions, the horrible and sad things you see happen in real life. The story was very captivating, you are watching everyone thinking is it him, is it her; they all had bad pasts. Where it ends is when it really begins and then you are left thinking did he do the right thing. This movie made you think at every moment, made you feel and understand every character. Made you question right from wrong. It didn't have a lot of action. A lot of fighting. It had no nudity. It was a really good movie worth watching if you like movies that make you think from beginning and even after the movie finished.A woman who uses drugs and neglects the care of her child comes home to find her missing. Not completely telling the truth about her where a bouts at the time she left her daughter alone. A private investigator and his associate (girlfriend) hired by the missing child's aunt is called in to help find her. While trying to co operate with the police he tries to piece together clues from people who are hostile but little does he know the perpetrators have been beside him the whole time trying to cover what they thought they did was just.

Fantastic Film When Dubbed for Cable,"There are two versions of this movie. The theatrical release DVD version suffers from the actors' lack of budget and perhaps experience projecting on camera the South Boston speech rhythms that powerfully underlay the film. In the broadcast dubbed edition everything comes together with extremely powerful effect. Try as hard as you can to find someone who has recorded this movie from broadcast, you'll be very, very richly rewarded. Ben Affleck has shown himself to be a rather unappreciated fine character actor in such films as Hollywood Land -- and here to be a problematic first-time director, handling complexity with some grace during camera work on this feature and then with consummate, almost poetic brilliance in dubbing the dialog.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A fundamental moral question,"Based on the novels by Dennis Lehane, this is a drama about the kidnapping of a young, innocent girl, aged three, in the rough town of Dorchester, Boston. Her mother is a drug mule and addict who clearly does not pay much attention to her daughter, often leaving her unaccompanied for many hours, which makes you wonder why Social Services have not stepped in before. The cops are involved in finding the girl by default, but the girl's uncle and aunt, obviously wealthy, also get involved. They hire two private investigators (played by Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan) that live in the area and know many of the locals, making them well suited for the case.A real gripping film which takes many twists and turns throughout, almost leaving you confused half way through, but then people start to talk and villains are exposed. In the end you are left with a very clear picture, in addition to a critical moral question that keeps you asking yourself what is the right thing to do  what would I do?

Remarkable.,"This pleasant mystery film, Ben Affleck's debut as director, revolves around a couple of young private detectives who, hired to investigate an apparent kidnapping by the aunt of the child missing. In addition to the natural difficulties of the case, they will have to prevent the antipathy of the police forces, who are not willing to collaborate, although they have to do so.The film is excellent and really worth it, both for the story and the good performance of the cast. There is no doubt that Affleck deserves congratulations on his work. The story was very well written, it has tension and suspense in the right measure and tries to be realistic and escape a little from the more conventional ways and options. Although the mystery is well covered and the film has several twists and turns, the plot reveals clues about the truth, and if the audience is attentive they will have what they need for their own investigation. The construction of the characters, and their evolution throughout the film, is another element that I feel obliged to highlight: throughout the film, the audience is confronted with repellent characters that gradually undergo an authentic catharsis. And we were torn between feelings of repulse, commiseration, aversion and sympathy for those characters.The cast has several notable names. Casey Affleck takes on one of the main roles and supports the older brother's project by working hard and giving us an excellent interpretation. It was truly impressive to see how the actor was able to embody the character's psychological and mental shifts. Beside him is an excellent Michelle Monaghan. The script gives her a lot of material to work with and allows the actress to carry out a coherent and elegant development of the character, leaving the gender clichés and being much more than a beautiful hero's girlfriend. Ed Harris also deserves a note of praise. Used to playing tough characters, he showed versatility in giving a soul and a dose of sensitivity to the frowning policeman who had to play. Amy Ryan has, perhaps, one of the most complicated works in the film, since her character is the most controversial here, but she knew how to extricate herself and shine. Morgan Freeman is in a much more discreet role, but he plays it with all his spirit and gives us some great moments.Technically, the film has excellent production values and looks more expensive than it may have been. Affleck put a lot of effort into making his film authentic, and it paid off. Of course, this effort forced him to use a very crude language, but I accepted that quite well. Cinematography is good and the filming work is exquisite, with remarkable limpidity and color. The use of light and shade is also very good. The choice of filming locations (mostly Boston suburban neighborhoods) is consistent with the story and exudes authenticity, as well as all sets and costumes. The soundtrack is not exceptional, but the film makes up for it with good sound and visual effects.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sways from drugs; human biology and; the human 'soul'.,"The movie put me on a broad chain of thoughts. In that way it is broad, but it does it through a focused and intriguing storyline about an investigator's search for a missing child. The story makes turns at just the right places, and for each turn it made me reevaluate. It is a beautifully conducted movie, though 'beautiful' don't suit the atmosphere of the movie. ""Gone Baby Gone"" portrays clashes between a modern society with its sways from drugs; human biology and; the human 'soul'.On a more general note it is a strong crime-drama-thriller with an impressive line of actors.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Gone Baby Gone,"One of the problems with the film industry is the oft unavoidable delay between inception and release. Whether it be an overlong production, or some outside influence or controversy, the gods of fate will all too often cause a film dealing with or alluding to a current event, to be released after said event has ceased to be current. Such is the case with actor Ben Affleck's directorial debut Gone Baby Gone, whose plot bears striking similarities to the case of four-year-old Madeleine McCann, who was abducted just last year.This parallel, still fresh in the media memory, is bound to bring just as much publicity as the director, who until 2006s Hollywoodland, had made a career on decidedly lowbrow roles. So it would makes sense that, following one of his few serious roles in the aforementioned film, Affleck would turn his attention to helming a just as serious piece.And serious it is. Gone Baby Gone, with its urban setting and seedy themes, could easily be described as noir. But absent are the expressionist shadows, fast-talking private eyes, and veiled allusions to unsavoury criminal activity. Instead we have the rundown neighbourhood of Dorchester, Boston. As private investigators Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angela Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) scour the community for clues as to the whereabouts of kidnapped four-year-old Amanda McCready, the neighbourhood almost becomes a character in its own right. As shots of neighbours gathered on doorsteps and children playing in the streets contrast with darkly-lit discussions of drugs and child abuse, we really get a sense for the living dichotomy of the neighbourhoods we so often see on the evening news.Neither does the film shy away from the question that always threatened, but never surfaced during the already mentioned McCann case: how little chance is there of finding this little girl alive? As Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) tells the two investigators, if the child isn't found within twenty-four hours, only ten percent are ever recovered.The film's performances perfectly capture this sense of hope, despair, and desperation. As can be expected from his recent Oscar nomination, the younger Affleck makes the role his own. The shy and awkward youngster who half-smiled his way through a myriad of uncomfortable silences in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is still there, but Casey moulds this persona into something tougher, but still hopeful and, in some ways, naïve. Freeman is obviously as professional as ever as the police captain in charge of the search. And Ed Harris delivers another reliably solid performance as a jaded police detective partnered with the private detectives.But then there's Michelle Monaghan, something of a weak link. This is not a slight against her talent or ability; on the contrary, she is a fine actress, as is most readily observable in the unbelievably entertaining Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. No, the problem comes in the validity of the character. Gennaro has little to do throughout the vast majority of the film. When she is used, she acts as more of a conscience for Kenzie than as a physical element in the narrative. She questions her partners actions, or reassures him when he himself questions them.Having said this, Gone Baby Gone does sometimes benefit from the presence of a walking, talking moral compass. As the film progresses, our own moral stance is challenged. Without giving the plot away, we join Kenzie in re-evaluating our preconceptions about who is right and wrong when it comes to the protection of children. Please don't take this as meaning that the film sides with child abductors; that would be absurd. But when the parents are distant and neglectful, who is to say what is best for the child? This tricky moral quagmire is accompanied by an equally tricky narrative one. While the first half is a simple search narrative, Gone Baby Gone's second half snakes around so many twists that it is difficult for us, not only to keep track of the plot, but too keep track of who is right and wrong. Characters who seemed good turn bad; characters who seemed bad turn good; and some who seemed good but turned bad, turn good again.The confusion finds its way into the older Affleck's assured camera work. For the most part, the cinematography adheres to that loose, semi-documentary style that has been favoured in recent years. But occasionally, when the action threatens become as confusing as the plot, we are treated to an almost nauseatingly shaky camera: the characters are unsure of what is going on, and so are we.When it comes to tally up the box office receipts, it is a shame that a large portion of the money Gone Baby Gone will make will be due to its parallels with recent media events. Because this is a surprisingly well-crafted and assured debut from the always polarising Ben Affleck, and it deserves to be watched and judged under its own merits, of which there are many. As a thriller you could not hope for anything more. And as an exploration of the moral pitfalls of investigating child abuse, well, thoughts will be provoked.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Pointless Exercise in Human Nastiness,"This crabby pill of a movie takes place in the dreg districts of Boston and stars Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan as a boyfriend/girlfriend detective team who are hired to search for a missing child. What follows is a twisty plot with a stupid and implausible finale. The movie is surly, everyone involved is in a bad mood, and the whole thing left me gloomy and angry.What am I supposed to take away from a movie like this? The film thinks it's asking weighty moral questions, like what does it mean to do the right thing, what's the difference between what is right and what is legal, etc.? But any point gets lost in the ugly, horrid world the movie lives in. Director Ben Affleck has been getting loads of praise for painting such an accurate portrait of working-class Boston, and maybe he did, but then why in God's name does anyone want to live there? The film makes Boston look like the worst place on Earth, filled with degenerates and thugs. One scene set in a drug house -- by far the most demoralizing scene in the film -- is straight out of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" inbred hillbillies and all. After a while, your only defense in this film is to laugh at the preposterous human ugliness Affleck unrelentingly heaps on you.Maybe good performances could have saved the movie -- or more accurately, good characters, because the performances are decent. But I don't know what any actors could have done with this material.I'm sick and tired of Hollywood churning out movie after movie that has no reason for existing other than to make people feel bad. What happened to movies that communicate ideas and engage in dialogue? Now film makers seem to think that what moviegoers want more than anything is to simply wallow in human baseness and meanness. It's movies like ""Gone Baby Gone"" that are responsible for the insidious belief that the world is a much more nasty and violent place to live in than it really is.I'm glad this one bombed.Grade: D",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great movie with a crazy twist,This movie was very good. It had a crazy twist in the end. It is about a little girl who gets kidnapped and the police do not know where to find her.

No good dead goes unpunished,"The overall plot was perhaps too fanciful for me to suspend disbelief entirely. But the film's symbolism was deep, wide and dead on! This may be the best film I've seen to date about America's current ""predicament"" (Iraq, Wall Street, Bush administration, poverty, class warfare, et al.)My wife and I had a HUGE argument regarding the basic moral dilemma over young Amanda McCready. Like Patrick Kenzie, the film's protagonist, I was compelled to defend ""the rules"" over the alternative, whereby ""the end justifies the means"".In short, my argument was thus: each time any of us willingly chooses to place our thumb on the scale of justice - i.e. bends or breaks the basic code (rule of law) that establishes the larger framework, however flawed, for our society in our complex world with many competing motives, then we are ALL damned.Thus, Bush invades Iraq, because Saddam Hussein is evil. Banks lend to borrowers that can't afford to repay, because it's legal and the fees are lucrative. Right wing radicals bomb abortion clinics, because abortion is murder.In other words, just WHERE does ""playing God"" end? With this riveting film, Affleck contends that no matter where it begins -- it always ends badly.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bad bad bad,"This is a bad movie. The characters are so unreal. The main character keeps messing about with everybody and the truth is that it seems to be hated for everyone as soon as he opens his mouth, which isn't the ideal situation if you are looking for information. He tries to be the macho type and fails embarrassingly. The theme is good but although it is true the mother type seems real, the rest of them are jokes .It may be real for people who never had or will have contact with this part of the society but they are fake. And the police, my God. That would never ever happen. They would never ever ever let this kid do what he does in the movie. And the end. I just felt such a regret I keep watching until the end. In all, the worst with difference is Casey Affleck performance. I just wanted to punch him in the FACE. And all those twists. After the second one you just start feeling annoy.

A Venerating Directorial Debut About How Some People Should Not Be Parents,"The first thing any viewer will notice about Gone Baby Gone is that it does for Boston what Deliverance did for the Cahulawassee River. The streets are filled with some of the most sickeningly ugly, obese, wiry, and disfigured people you've ever seen. And, as one indescribably feels every here and there during the film, it seems unnecessary or uneven. Nevertheless, it is really Ben Affleck's undercurrent of shock that he forces us to face about Dennis Lehane's reflection of the relentless nastiness of human beings. This film is a vengeful testament to superficiality and wrongness of all claims against Ben Affleck on the basis that he is a boyishly attractive movie star and other gross underestimations of ""pretty boys"" in Hollywood like Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. Ben Affleck, yes, handsome Hollywood hunk, directs a film that, instead of flaunting style, grits with a hard-edged rusty- kitchen-sink realism.His younger brother Casey Affleck, an endearing character actor, gets his break as the lead here, in a down-to-earth, street-smarts role as a private detective who is used to handling vicious, shady people in grimy, scuzzy areas of Southie, but even having grown up around it can't prepare him for what he will have to witness and decide. Coarsely sexy Michelle Monaghan, who was hilariously callous in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, plays his detective wife, a motherly sort whose compassion she knows may blend dangerously with her work. The most powerful performance in the film, however, is delivered by the barrel of volatile explosives that is Ed Harris, who I don't ordinarily find as appealing as I did here, enlivening his capability of being intimidating and silently warning you of an ominous, lurking, terrifying side of him. He delivers a beautifully down-home monologue at one point about the innocence and rudimentary forgiveness of children. He chokes up, but shoves the tears back with anger. (His partner is played by John Ashton, who it's good to see again. Where's he been since the Beverly Hills Cop films?)The film's uncompromising brooding with its dark, extremely depressing subject of child abduction pays off with certain poignant moments, possibly showing wisdom in both Lehane's writing and Affleck's rendering of its effects, as the movie shows us the importance of the effacement, recognition, and understanding of even the most painful experiences because they are what make the great ones great, as are reflected in the most disturbing images of the film and the most relieving ones. The story's culmination to its ultimate dilemma is such an uncompromising example of facing the world, in which black and white is a myth and grey is virtually always the reality. And no matter what the resolution comes to be, it may not boil down to black and white even still.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What would you do?,"This is a film about moral dilemmas, about which side you take and about what you decide to do with the things you know because of how you think they'll affect you in the future; and it's directed by Ben Affleck. I don't point this out as a major thing, but the truth is I never quite liked Affleck neither quite disliked himHis ""Gone Baby Gone"" made me choose one side: I like the man.Based on a novel by Denis Lehane (the man who wrote ""Mystic River""), Affleck and Aaron Stockard tell the story of Patrick (Casey Affleck), a private detective who has never left his neighborhood and sometimes takes care of finding those people the rest don't feel they have to find anymore. With his camera, courtesy of John Toll's photography (one with beautifully constructed images and sequences, if I may say), Affleck makes sure that we feel the familiarity that the main character shares with the neighborhood. Peacefully he lets us see the streets, the people who walk them and a sense of security provided by Harry Gregson- Williams' score.But of course, every place that appears really safe never is, and soon Patrick and his girlfriend Angie (an unexpected portrayal by Michelle Monaghan) find themselves in the middle of the solving of the abduction of a little girl that's all over the news. She's Amanda, the daughter of Helene (a solid Amy Ryan, though not amazing as everyone said), a drug addict and clearly unstable woman who took her daughter to the bar where she consumed as she was consuming.The character of Helene is the first and the main moral aspect that Affleck provides in his movie. Throughout the film Patrick will encounter individuals he knows-after all, he's lived in the town his whole life, and he says it- and meet others he doesn't, of whom most also have deep moral concerns. Two key players are Remy Bressant and Jack Doyle, policemen played brilliantly by Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, respectively.Affleck's narrative as a first time director is absolutely impressive, as he puts the Patrick character in the middle of the tale as the individual who not only knows more about what's going on, but apparently wants to know more than the rest. Morality takes over his actions, as he looks like Jack Nicholson's role in ""The Pledge""; a man with a promise to keep, no matter what.What's great about Patrick is that he slowly starts realizing he cares more about what he's investigating than the rest, and this makes him suspect. The thing is that, masterfully after an hour of film, Affleck makes us believe the case is close and provides Patrick with one of those speeches that usually appear when films end. So maybe personally Patrick's not so consumed with his investigation, but he inevitably becomes consumed afterwards, because of some revealing conversations that activate his thoughts again, and because he realizes the person he cares about the most is driving more away from him as time goes by.Without question, there are two keys to the success of ""Gone Baby Gone"", more a personal drama than the resolution of an apparent crime (as ""Mystic River"" was). The first one is Casey Affleck's starring performance. I wonder what it would be like to be directed by your brother. I suppose it would be fun, because here Casey delivers a perfect portrayal in what represents his first major role in twenty years of acting.The second key (though we already knew about this, because of what Affleck did alongside Matt Damon with ""Good Will Hunting) is the script: so plausible, unpretentious and connected to reality, it shows its magic with emphasis in two conversations; one that Patrick has with the Harris character and another one he has with the Freeman character.And it's like Matsan (who wished the film had ended at the conversation with Freeman) said: in a very good movie that doesn't take sides and leaves the decision to the viewerWhat would you do?",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great script from a brilliant novel,"Dennis Lehane's book, with these Kenzie-Gennaro detective couple, is enjoyable. ""Gone baby gone"" is certainly one of the nicest thriller novel ever written. The script by Affleck and Stockard is also great. They rightfully chose to cut the angles and went to the core of this story. They did well. For his first movie as a director, Ben Affleck is doing a very good effort, especially with his cast. There are a bunch of great actors in this, Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, Amy Ryan and Amy Madigan, and they are all good. The only thing that bothers me is Casey Affleck. He's done a good performance, but the only problem is he doesn't look like the part is described in Lehane's novel. So it's hard to believe is as tough than he has to. But the couple is completing with Michelle Monaghan is OK. They fit well together and you have to believe in them to like this movie. It's a brutal movie, with a lot of violence and coarse language. But hey, the story is going on in the poorest and tough neighbourhood in Boston. You have to be good in vocal English, because the slang used is sometimes hard to hear.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Morgan Freeman has chosen such better roles that he must have had negative signs in his bank account and really need the money.

Things get complicated when a child molester is found and the police uncover the previous kidnapping of Amanda is not what it seemed. Morgan Freeman turns up as a retired police captain who is a good man trying to make a difference. Tough choices must be made, and they lead to one of the best endings I've ever seen.

Horrifying child abduction drama,"Sometimes reality impinges on fantasy. While this film was being made, Maddy McCann was abducted. By a strange quirk of fate, the four year old girl abducted in this film looks like an identical twin of Maddy McCann. Can you get more disturbing than that? Sensitive souls should not try to watch this film, as they will not be able to take it. This is really, really heavy stuff. Most of the characters in this film are either drug takers or drug dealers. We have here the famous American Underclass. If you are into cocaine, this will all be familiar to you perhaps. Just about everyone in the movie is disgusting and revolting in some way, sometimes to such an extent you think the impossible has been achieved: the film might be described as vomit-as-celluloid. The various murders and mutilations are not necessarily shown in the fullest grisly detail, so hurrah for a tiny bit of restraint. This film was written by Ben Affleck and stars his brother Casey Affleck, who is really extremely good, and the only moral character in the story. He has however a bizarre girlfriend payed by Michelle Monaghan, who looks just like Michael Jackson except that her eyes are so wide apart they look like ears. She spends most of the film hanging back, looking disapproving, dropping out, and throwing a wet blanket on everything. Lots of negative energy there, and a major script and directorial weakness, and frankly a bad actress. With the exception of old pro Morgan Freeman, everybody in this film mumbles so badly that nearly half of the dialogue is incomprehensible. Even old pro Ed Harris delivers a long drunken speech which he forgets to articulate, so we only get half of that too. I don't know what's wrong with the sound technicians these days. I think they have had their brains removed and implanted headphones in their place. Once a director stood by the camera during shooting and would have noticed everybody was mumbling, but ever since they started sitting in chairs and gazing into TV monitors and call that directing, they don't notice anything but how the shot is framed. Big deal! The story of this film is fantastically clever and complex, and ends up being more shocking even than the two child abductions. The story also deals with genuinely profound moral dilemmas in an honest way. It was earnest in intent. But the reason why the film is terrible is that it is a vision of unremitting hell and we have enough of that already, thank you very much, Affleck brothers. Why not make something pleasant to watch sometime? Wouldn't that make a change?",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fine directorial debut from Ben Affleck,"I saw this movie on opening night, and i was telling my fiancé all day how great this movie was going to be and how excited I was for us seeing it. The movie has the kind of plot that I love and a cast any director would die for. So let me start off by saying the movie was very good, and the acting was top notch, especially from Ed Harris ( when is he not good ) and a surprise performance from Casey Affleck in the leading role. A lot of people think Ben Affleck is not a good actor, and i would disagree with that, but for those of you who think he is bad actor, he has definitely been taking notes on how to make a movie, because he does a wonderful job. There are some very intense scenes, the scene on the cliff, and the scene where they have to bust into the house, but when the movie ended i felt like i really wanted to love this movie, but it was not quite there. And i feel the reason it was not there is because these cops were searching for a little girl who was not even loved by her mother, and the scene where the mother breaks down crying to Casey Affleck felt forced and felt like it had no emotion in it. And the ending, man, the whole time i was saying there is no way that could be the ending, and it was. The ending was just not believable, and for those of you who have not seen the movie will know what I'm talking about. I am looking forward to more of Mr. Afflecks movies, and this one was very good, but could have been a masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It didn't make me cry until the second time through.,"My favorite film of the past year. Awesome story. Even though I loved ""No Country.."" and thought "" There..Blood"" (which will win the Oscar) was good. The short opening voice-over tells so much of the story...as we find out. Several of the quiet moments are the throat grabbers in this film. I know a social worker who despairs over the plight of urban youth today. I agree, but in his heart he is sure that if the 'government' would just take over and give out needs and love (?).. things would be OK, fixed and solved. NAH.(he'd say 'be better' because it's vague).This movie is so authentic. For me only God has ""solutions"". In this world it's more about opportunities and choices.

A more than successful silver screen adaptation of a popular Dennis Lehane novel.,"This movie is based on the fourth installment in the Kenzie&Gennaro book series, written by the prominent American crime fiction writer, Dennis Lehane. It is directed by Ben Affleck who, in his first attempt behind the camera, delivers an excellent crime film, tight-plotted and with great characters. The performances by the main actors, especially those by Ed Harris and Casey Affleck, are top-notch while the tempo of the story's unraveling is such that it never wears the viewer down. Morgan Freeman plays a secondary, though crucial, character and he nails the role as well.The story revolves around a child disappearance and the plot begins when the uncle and aunt of the missing girl, little Amanda, ask from Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro, two private investigators with a lot of connections to Boston's underbelly, to help them with the investigation. The tough city neighborhoods seem to be the most appropriate setting for a crime story to take place and Boston is a character in itself, as it is true for many of Dennis Lehane's novels. There is a lot of mystery, little doses of suspense and some great twists that make the film one of the best films of the genre for the 2000-2010 period. The finale is thorough and satisfying, giving all the answers to the -many- questions raised by the complex and elaborate plot. In my opinion, ""Gone Baby Gone'' along with ""Mystic River"" (2003) is the best big-screen adaptations of D. Lehane's crime novels and two of the modern classics of this kind of films.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Unconvincing but watchable...,"Gone Baby Gone is a strange mishmash; it begins brilliantly, the acting is mostly superb, the detail convincing, dialogue great. Dennis Lehane wrote the novel it was based on and perhaps the sprks in the script originated there. But the denouement - or the entire last third of the film - didn't hack it. Maybe it worked more convincingly in the novel but it ran out of steam and seemed too contrived. This film is - dare I say it - entertaining and almost great in parts; but the whole doesn't make it. Ben Affleck's brother is a slightly better actor than his brother; but he is similarly 'dull' and he does not carry the movie as his character is required to do. His tough act in the bar didn't convince me. The film leaned heavily on better actors; Ed Harris, Amy Ryan, Morgan Freeman, Michelle Monaghan, Titus Welliver, and everybody else are outstanding enough to carry the less than watertight story. A cameo by Edi Gathegi almost steals the show for me; and Michael Kenneth Williams, who I seem to remember in The Wire?, is brilliant.

"Compelling, tightly plotted Baby feels authentic","Like its cousin Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone is based on a Dennis Lehane novel about an abduction. And like Mystic River, the novel - and the subsequent film - takes no predictable route to reach its conclusion and offers no easy answers to complicated problems. It doesn't just tug at your heartstrings, it snaps them in twain, reattaches them, and yanks them out again.The three-year-old daughter of Helene MacCready (Amy Ryan) has gone missing, and the child's aunt and uncle approach private detectives Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to help the police with the case. The detectives agree, albeit reluctantly, because a case of this scope and magnitude (including a lot of media attention) is a little beyond their purview.During his time on the case, Patrick makes discoveries he wish he hadn't made, and facing opposition from people he knows in the neighborhood, the police, and even his lover, Angie, he makes quick decisions with the best of intentions. Some of these decisions work out well, and others change his life for the worse, forever.The first thing that strikes you about this movie is how authentic everything feels, from the actors to the sets. The movie is set in a crime-ridden section of Boston, with plenty of working-class (and a lot of low-class) denizens with their almost stereotypically comic accents and coarse language. But although Affleck is a local boy, most of the cast isn't; this is, I believe, what they call acting. And, like Clint Eastwood's Mystic River, director Ben Affleck seems to have fully captured the desolate, desperate, and bitter lives of dishonest, disreputable people who often turn to crime and other shenanigans to get by in life. Affleck's Dorchester is unyielding, where hard people live.Another asset is the film's narrative thread. Although the story is told linearly, it's not easy to guess ahead of time what's coming. And it's not a product of the film's moving quickly, as some films do (a fast-paced film means less time for the moviegoer to spot holes in the plot), as there are realistic lulls around every scene's corner. At one point in the movie, with the benefit of watching it at home, I had to pause it quickly to assess the situation at hand, and I tried to predict where the movie was going. I was wrong. It's tightly plotted, but it's not unjustly or implausibly plotted, not in the least.Casey Affleck, who looks very much Ben's younger brother but apparently got all of the acting genes in the family, is superb as the conflicted but driven Patrick. His youthfulness notwithstanding (he's only 32), Affleck has the poise and guile of someone much older, a fact that's even noticed by other characters in the film. Faced with incredibly difficult decisions, Patrick has an unwavering sense of what is truly right, but he's never a single-minded, ignorant zealot who knows what he knows. At times during the case, Patrick's faith is shaken, and by the end of the movie he's not completely sure he's made the right decision. In other words, what you get at the end is not a neat, happy ending at all, a fact that shouldn't surprise those who have seen Mystic River.As the anguished (but loose) mother, Amy Ryan notched a Best Supporting Actress nomination, but my opinion is that it's not a nomination that's entirely deserved. Ryan is good, especially for a fairly inexperienced actress, but she's not so commanding or compelling as to warrant that sort of accolade. Faring about the same was the usually steady Morgan Freeman, who's okay here but whose role (and use as a plot device) is a bit underwritten.In fact, it's plain that this movie fails only where Mystic River succeeded so strongly; the former did not lapse into clichés, and Gone Baby Gone does. Although the movie generally presents plenty of plausible twists, some of the characters are rather predictable. The final resolution of the plot, in fact, seems almost too obvious in hindsight. Because of this, Gone Baby Gone just misses being a great movie, and instead it has to settle for being a pretty good film with an exhilarating performances from Casey Affleck and Ed Harris.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Affleck Junior plays a young-ish private eye, and together with his girlfriend seem to be the only ones with a firm moral compass in the picture. They're searching for a missing little girl, who's mother is a serious addict to every vice known to man. She plays up her 'grief' for the cameras, but the reality is she really isn't that bothered about the disappearance at all... heck, the little lady even seemed to get in the way of her daily fix.What starts off as a minor investigation liaising with the police quick escalates into a tense game of chess, as our detective finds himself in the midst of conspiracies, cover-ups, threats and outright murder. Friends are few and far between, and even the ones you THOUGHT you could trust have to be scrutinised to the Nth degree. This kind of knotty storyline has been done on many an occasion, but very rarely with the style and finesse which is exhibited here. The city BREATHES, the air HUMS with anticipation and when the people TALK, you listen.Finally, we have the ending, which is destined to be one of those classic Water Cooler moments. As in... what would YOU do? There are no easy answers to that... people would get hurt either way, and would you break a heartfelt promise if you thought it was in... someone's best interest. All difficult questions, inspired by a film which puts these complex matters on the agenda and delivers the respect demanded of them in spades. Brilliant. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This movie sent me back in time.,"When you read a comment like that, you might think that the movie brought on feelings of nostalgia for me or took me back to a place and time of some significant meaning. If you did think that, then you're dead wrong because what I really meant is that this movie is so ridiculously bad and mind-numbingly stupid that I had to dumb myself down to the level of a 13-year-old on crack to actually enjoy it. You see, it was 11:30 at night on a Sunday and I had contemplated going back to Blockbuster and bitch-slapping the cashier for not warning me about the rotten garbage I was about to expose my eyes to, but I was too tired so I decided to make fun of every line in the movie instead. And if you judge it by that scale, it ranks up there with every Jean Claude Van Damme movie ever made.I love Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, but they gotta do something good now to redeem themselves.Maybe if Casey ""Same expression on his face at all times"" Affleck could speak like a human and not a midget with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, the movie would have been a bit better. I mean, you can't understand one damn word he says in the whole movie. Annunciate, you're an actor! And what exactly was the point of even having Michelle Monaghan's character in the movie? They could of cut her out completely and the movie would have been a valuable 18 or so minutes shorter. Believe me, no one would notice.One thing the movie didn't have a shortage of was one liners and stupendously ridiculous comments at every turn. If I closed my eyes and tilted my head just so, I could hear Stallone moaning ""Yo Adrian"" followed by Schwarzenneger stating ""I'll be back!"" But then I remembered, those were actually entertaining movies so I knew it was just my imagination playing tricks on me.Bottom line: I would rather have a root canal with a jackhammer while a diseased rat gnaws on my rectum than have to sit through this piece again. Good riddance.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What a moral dilemma,"This was an unexpectedly great movie and I didn't know what was going to happen, but when it reached its conclusion I was left wondering about the moral dilemma that Patrick (Casey Affleck) faced. I felt that I agreed with him and he did the right thing, yet it was an impossible decision to make. If a child is missing, the detectives who agree to take on the case feel honour-bound to continue to search until they find the child. It seems like a simple matter, but this film reveals how complicated it can be. Along the way, we meet a collection of low-life characters who make the viewer feel depressed about the society we live in (or at least in that city) and wonder how any child can grow up safe. It could have the effect of disillusionment with the story, but the attitude of the two young private detectives is a beacon of hope: they know the difference between right and wrong. Even though their responses to the final dilemma are different, they illuminate the central minefield faced by anyone who gets involved in child welfare. Since this is one of the most emotive issues faced by our society, it's a compelling narrative.The performances were excellent and I wondered at several points how the collection of ill-assorted characters was made so realistic. The dialogue was hard to follow in some places because the realism of the delivery was such that I would have needed subtitles, but that didn't detract from the overall experience. The violence was convincing, but not overwhelming. Definitely worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Who knew Ben had it in him?,"Director Ben Affleck presents a gripping film about the aftermath of a child abduction.Wait a minute. Director Ben Affleck? Yes indeed. The often maligned actor and gossip column fixture serves up a serious-minded, thought-provoking near-masterpiece in his feature directorial debut. Sometimes brilliance comes where you least expect it. Now whatever you do Ben please don't waste your newfound credibility by starring in another Gigli.Gone Baby Gone unfolds in Boston, which is of course the perfect setting for an Affleck-helmed film. Ben certainly knows the city and more importantly knows its people. And this knowledge is so important as the movie unfolds. Everything seems so believable. Everyone fits perfectly into the Bostonian tableau. What at first may seem a rather simple story will eventually reveal itself to be quite complex. And a group of fine actors, all wonderfully cast, brings that story to wonderfully vibrant life.In the key role Affleck chose to cast his younger brother Casey. Does that send up a red flag? It shouldn't, the younger Affleck does a tremendous job. He plays Patrick Kenzie, a private investigator who works with his partner (and lover) Angie Gennaro, who is played by Michelle Monaghan. Patrick and Angie's work usually involves tracking down deadbeats. But when a young girl in their neighborhood goes missing they are asked by the girl's aunt to investigate. And from here the story takes myriad twists and turns. Only bit by bit is the full picture revealed to the audience and in the end you may find that the story simply takes your breath away.Casey Affleck is at the heart of the film but it is the wonderful supporting cast which really takes the film to another level. Monaghan is fine in her role, although you may feel you don't get to know her character as well as perhaps you should. Amy Ryan is a true standout as Helene, the mother of the missing girl. Helene seems much more interested in drugs than her daughter and Ryan is spot-on in portraying this character who at times is sympathetic and at other times reprehensible. Ed Harris is reliably brilliant as Remy Bressant, the lead police investigator into the abduction. Remy is a man of obvious passion and strong conviction. It is an interesting dynamic to say the least to see him working with the young Patrick and Angie of whom he has obvious doubts about their ability to be of any help. Morgan Freeman, John Ashton, Amy Madigan...just a few more familiar faces turning in excellent work. And there are so many lesser-known performers, including some ordinary Bostonians from the neighborhood, who fit in perfectly. All the pieces fall into place and the end result is something special to see.Gone Baby Gone is not a perfect film but any criticisms amount to just minor quibbles. A couple of characters, most notably Monaghan's Angie, could be fleshed out a little better. The story's turns may make it seem a little hard to follow at times but that's OK because it will encourage you to want to go back and watch the film again to see the clues and unravel the secrets. And this is a film well worth seeing a few times. It's a film which raises some serious moral questions and dares you to decide what you would do in such situations. You'll be thinking about this one for quite a while afterwards. Director Ben Affleck? Believe it. It's hard to see how anyone could have done this story any better.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Casey is an under-rated actor, juggling toughness with anxiety, the rights with wrongs.

The Greatness the Afflecks have reached.,"I've been thinking a lot about this movie everyday since the day I saw it seven days ago. The fact is this movie really makes you think. Its like, what did I just see? It actually disturbed me a little bit. This is a completely thought provoking film. Its about bad parents, a city's willingness to find the truth, and a missing girl. Secrets are uncovered throughout the film, dark, unthinkable secrets. It completely takes you by surprise. Ben Affleck has suddenly become a powerful filmmaker, showing us our world's dark side in all it's horror and disgrace, and beyond that, our weaknesses. Perhaps more perfectly than any other film I've seen, this film shows us in a completely shocking way, how far some people are willing to go. The tag line to this film sums it up perfectly: Everyone wants to find the truth... Until they find it. The picture starts with Casey Affleck's character talking about the city of Boston as we see different shots of the city, its really beautiful, and right then, I knew this was going to be no ordinary movie. From the beginning, the director makes you feel what the characters are feeling, this dark atmosphere. The ending of the film at first was not what I wanted, but when I think about it, the film would not have been as good without it. If you have yet to see this film, prepare to ponder it for a long while after witnessing. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Well-structured plot line, finely-directed with studied performances","I first heard of this film more given its release date than for the film itself given the (continuing) Madelaine McCann saga. Then with the DVD in front of me, I wasn't sure if it was worth spending an afternoon to watch. Firstly, it's Hollywood so I assume all the characters will be cardboard cut-outs with a plot line simple enough to be understood in Arkansas drive-ins. Wait a minute- Ben Affleck is the director?!?! Come on! No wait, it gets better- it stars his BROTHER! And Morgan Freeman as yet another cop. Not only does this seem like further evidence of extremely lazy casting, but he looks almost a dead ringer for Nelson Mandela who turned 90 this week. And he's supposed to be retiring EARLY in the film! So perhaps all this led me to be pleasantly surprised. The characters don't seem much more developed from standard British cop shows on the telly, but they aren't tarted up either. The plot is complicated without being too complex which allows the view to be involved without being taxes. I do have an issue with some of the twists that seem too contrived, particularly at the end, but in the end the message leaves one actually thinking about one's own personal position- this is after all what made Million Dollar Baby so controversial and successful. The direction is tight, and performances understated. Since the Pearl Harbour debacle Mr. Affleck has really taken his craft seriously and sought to earn respect for his professional development. I certainly recommend this film, writing as a cynic. www.lairdkeir.spaces.live.com",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is what Mystic River should have been.,"I read somewhere that the same author who wrote Mystic River, wrote the book Gone baby, Gone of which this movie is based. I didn't understand all the praise and attention Mystic River received, a mediocre film at best. Gone Baby, Gone on the other hand is a masterful film deserving far more praise then I have heard it got and wouldn't mind to hear about it getting an Oscar nod.The film opens with narration by the lead character. It is solemn yet tense, solemn in its tone, tense in it aimlessness. These words can faithfully describe the movie solemn and tense. Set in Boston, it is a typical detective story that is anything but typical. Other movies set in Boston can't even begin to have the feel and overall street cred that this film exudes (Yeah, I'm talking to you The Departed). Its got the gritty locations and local lingo down perfect (including curse-words, racial remarks and the like). The setting has been overused lately in Hollywood, but somehow seems to feel remarkably fresh.Casey Affleck is great in the movie, I personally have enjoyed him in every role I've seen him in. He just has great delivery. When he's funny; I'm laughing, when he's sad; I'm letting loose that solitary tear, when he's fired up; I'm ready to crack some skulls. Few actors have that knack and it only helps further entrench the viewer in the story that is unfolding upon them. Coupled with his girlfriend ( I don't know who she is) but she is a solid actress in her own right. Supporting roles by greats, Morgan Freedman, Ed Harris only add more kudos.I gotta say the story was great, I literally thought it ended two times before it actually did. That is surely a sign of a fantastic detective story. Twists and turns at every moment. Besides being very interesting in its plot twists it poses several morality questions, that you the viewer are left asking in your head at the end of the movie. I won't spoil them, but they are sublimely delivered through an expertly crafted script.I would liken this film to shawshank Redemption, high praise indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Excellent movie! Chilling resemblance to Madeleine McCann!,"We saw this excellent and gripping movie today, and for those of us here in the UK, all the more chilling because some of the photographs of the kidnapped little girl, Mandy, bore an uncanny physical resemblance to the high profile photographs released over the past year of four-year-old Maddy, Madeleine McCann, the little British girl who went missing in May 2007 in Praia da Luz, Portugal, and who disappearance remains unsolved. Since coming home, I have discovered, on IMDb Trivia, that the release date here in the UK was delayed for six months (scheduled for 28 December 2007), because of similarity to the case.We missed the release of the movie when it came out here in June 2008, but caught it today in our local Cineworld's Monday Classic.Excellently cast, directed, and shot, this movie is not just a story about child abduction, but is about the characters caught up in the convoluted maelstrom. All the performances in the film are superb, with in depth character studies, and the direction maintaining a tone of objectivity and compassion throughout.Our reaction was, and that of many in the audience, that 'Gone, baby, gone' left one asking oneself, and debating with family and friends, some very tough questions, about the very relevant-to-our-times issues raised in the movie, long after leaving the theatre.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
In Eastwoods hands this was probably a straight 10..,"This movie has it almost all, so I don't go into that. Affleck is an extremely gifted director. My title looks like an offense to him. Sorry. I just mean that the story misses a key-component. While watching this movie, Clint Eastwood came to mind. If he would have read the script, he probably would have said that something is missing in the very structure of the script, which would damage the ending.The main character is a hunted detective. He has a temper problem, he grew up in violence. He has loose hands and an arrogant side to his person. Why? Well, there we go: we never learn. Does it really matter that we don't learn? Well, not in the beginning, or, in a movie that completely focuses on the crime. And yes, in the beginning the story seems to be about abduction of a kid. But when the story evolves i'm starting to interest myself for the detective. Why? Well, wihle the story evolves and unfolds twister after twister our detective keeps on struggling with his character. His girlfriend is notably restrained. Her silence is like a scream for answers. So script-wise that smells like a psychological subplot, doesn't it? Being a Eastwood-lover - especially his last great movies - i'm waiting for a sub-story to come to surface which give the movie a kick into the psychological drama that is in fact going on here. But our hunted detective just continues to be his hunted self..... When is this gap of information damaging the story? When the main-character makes a hard-to-swallow decision - were no other then his back-ground story could explain, why he does that. It is then that I realize i watch a half finished script.Were the story of an abducted child could have changed into the real story - the resolution of a tormented main-character - i'm left with a very unsatisfied and unexplainable ending.Nevertheless: an 8. Because it is on all other levels a really great film!!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Ben Affleck a genius?  Get out of town!,"Ben Affleck's film career has been, as they say, ""chequered"", meaning that his resume consists of a lot of total dogs and a small handful of nice appearances here and there. Up until very lately, I had always been inclined to agree with the British film critic David Thomson, who wrote in 2004 that Affleck was ""lucky to have got away with it so far"".Because Affleck really isn't a very good actor, or at any rate not a consistently good one. When Kevin Smith attempts to hang an entire movie on an Affleck performance (Chasing Amy, Dogma) Affleck looks wooden, but when Smith brings the actor in for a quick, mischievous cameo, he seems to be galvanised - he is effective as a thuggish boyfriend in Mallrats, and his smirking few minutes as both Holden and as himself in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back are good fun.Elsewhere, though, anyone who can see the point of Pearl Harbor or Gigli needs to gain some serious perspective. Then, in 2006, he delivered an unexpectedly lovely performance as the fading actor George Reeves in Hollywoodland - overweight, sagging, stoical and with a touching sense of faded glamour. When we in our house heard that he'd a.) directed a movie and b.) it was supposed to be pretty good, we were interested - mildly.I started watching Gone Baby Gone with a sense of let's-just-give-this-ten-minutes, and it says much for Affleck's sense of pace that the movie is, to be begin with, both thoroughly unenjoyable and totally gripping. It's a subject which has a lot to say to any parent: the four-year-old daughter of a working-class Boston woman (Amy Ryan) has gone missing, and two private investigators (Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan) are asked by the woman's sister-in-law to help with the police investigation. The initial twist is that Helene, the mother, is a deeply unsympathetic character; she's a bored, slobbish, neglectful mother who drinks beer in the middle of the day and seems almost uninterested in what has happened to her daughter.Before the film is over, you will have changed your mind several times about Helene, and indeed about pretty much every other character. The film starts like a detective thriller, but it isn't one really. It's a highly intelligent and subversive film about family and morality and the cost of doing the right thing.Full marks to an excellent cast. To begin with I found Casey Affleck's voice sort of irritating, but his performance is actually very subtle; the film plays very well on his capacity for blue-eyed innocence. Amy Ryan is truly remarkable as Helene. Everybody else is just spot on; there's a scene in a bar, featuring mostly non-professional actors, that makes you marvel at how unbelievably unfriendly the modern American drinking hole can be.My admiration for Gone Baby Gone grew as it went on and I'm glad I watched it to the end. The final image, a simple shot of two people sitting on a sofa watching television, is one of the saddest and grimmest moments I've seen as a film-goer recently. The film sticks in the mind. Affleck should make more films as a director, because on the strength of this movie he already deserves a more illustrious place in cinema history than his acting has so far managed to earn him.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stunning performance and an incredible movie.,"After watching this movie I could not contain my thoughts and decided to write a review even if its 8 years since the movie first came out.

This movie does not waste any time in reaching the main plot and the urge to get to the bottom of it will keep you on the edge of the seat.The overall cast has acted quite well but its Casey Affleck you need to look out for as the way he portrays his character leaves a powerful impact. Director Ben Affleck has also made a good directorial debut with this movie as the perfect camera angles mixed with good background score creates an environment which kind of leaves you uneasy at your seat as the story unravels.I would not be spilling any beans for the movie as the plot itself is complex but you will be hooked from the very start.

It seems as just a normal kidnapping. Ed Harris in a commanding performance helps them find her and Morgan Freeman is the sheriff. Cules are found, people are blamed.

Because of this voice thing the movie just didn't seem to catch me, and seemed simple, superficial and predictable.

From the very beginning of the film I knew that I wasn't going to like it. Poor acting from both the main characters makes this one to miss. If you want a film that's watchable get a copy of Mystic River. I can only guess that having Ben Affleck as the director was the only reason this film was ever made. I found it hard to understand the slurred speech from most of the main actors, the only reason Casey Affleck was in the film was because of his brother, looking at Casey's past acting roles, well bit parts really no reason for this talentless wonder to make a major stage debut. At one point Patrick hides behind a wooden door to stop someone shooting at him, obviously wood in the USA stops bullets does it? The Angie character was so cardboard cut out I actually wished it has been an inanimate object.

More Hollywood Effluvium.,This film is actually interesting. In a convoluted sort of way. There is good solid ensemble acting by all involved and a notable performance given by Casey Affleck who plays a youngish private detective trying to break a missing child case that is mired a mile deep in local effluvium. Another younger guy who deals cocaine is depicted in the picture at one point as being some kind of a noble person who 'fights the good fight' which I think is pretty damned unlikely. The depiction of unreal rotten morally empty people as representational of the people that inhabit the poorer areas of the good city of Boston-is tedious. One thing that I have never seen in 500 Hollywood movies is a depiction of anyone who grew up in North America after moving from England as a kid causing them to lose their British accent growing up in a place not England. Accepting that even exists in todays world is considered by many to be on a par with accepting Satan into their lives-when denying such things exist is basically what it is to be Satan. Given that thorny general state of affairs I would't call this movie ground breaking or noteworthy. Policeman takes kid who has doper mother-detective steals kid back and returns to doper mother which will ruin kids life-end of story-nobody wins. The movie doesn't enlighten. Things stink generally at the start of the film and they stink generally at the end of it also. Frustrating movie. So frustrating it is interesting.In a convoluted sort of way.,5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Well, there are times, in life, that you choose the right thing to do, even if it is difficult, and you can discover, later, that you haven't considered all the pros and cons.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
He's a Better Director than an Actor,"I hate Ben Affleck like poison, hated every role he's done - and I've seen Dogma and Chasing Amy. So it was with more than a little trepidation that I slapped this DVD into my drive wondering if I've wasted my money. But I have to give credit where it's due, he's more than passed muster with this film.Dennis Lehane's source material has good characters as usual, although the story might be predictable to more seasoned film lovers. Everyone puts in a good performance with perhaps Casey Affleck being the weakest. That would be because his role was the most complicated, at turns considered and shooting from the hip. Still, in a movie of this caliber it's like saying that the second flautist was the weakest player in the Boston Philharmonic. Unless you're looking to criticize, you won't really notice.The movie is pure Hollywood, it doesn't break any new ground nor are there any moments in the film that the film geeks will rant and rave about. But it's Affleck's first film - there's plenty of time later for him to improve if he wants to be Kubrick. If you enjoy a good movie, sit back and watch this one. I heartily encourage Affleck to continue pursuing directing and maybe give the acting a miss for as long as possible.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another great entry in the Crime genre,"This movie is what you call a can't miss movie it has all the makings of a great film and let me be say that it is a great crime film at that, probably one of the best since Street Kings and Narc. It's execution and style almost borders on Noir and it does so with oh so much style and grace. Ben Affleck proves that he's as good an actor and screenplay writer(Good Will Hunting) as he is a director. Ben Affleck surpasses his previous screenplay which he won the Oscar for( which was just as good here) and creates an intricately woven and malicious Crime Mystery.When I first heard about this movie I had absolutely no interest in crime films I was more into Sci-Fi then crime. But now after almost three years and finally deciding to see this film I'm glad I did. This crime drama is powerful in it's execution and sinister in it's play on words and scenarios. It moves along like a wicked little machine taking you here and there and everywhere in it's story all the while keeping you totally in tune with the plot and the going on's of the film. It's so wrapped up in it's story that when you start watching it your slowly but surely drawn in and to tell you the truth this movie won't let you out until it's over and done with. This movie has a very well rounded cast of actors that all display there talents above there normal status quot, Casey Affleck is one who stood out in this film his strong performance drove this film and made it something more than just your run of the mill crime film, his performance stole the show him and Ed Harris blew away anything they've done in the past and have made a strong stand here and came out on top. Michelle Monaghan was beautiful as always but she got sandwiched by Cast Affleck and Ed Harris' strong performances and is almost a throw away in the film(which her character was anyways.) Morgan Freeman who's small but pivotal role was not a scene stealer but he did exceptionally well for the time he was on screen.All in all this film is something you can't miss, it's a study in the devious corrupt nature of man and the true meaning of justice for children. It's a film that you can see over and over again and it will still have the same affect as the first time you watched it. It's a devious ride of sin, lies , love and making the right choices even if they affect those around you. Gone Baby Gone is a movie that is going down in the crime section as one of the best of all time, and it rightfully deserves it this films delivers non-stop mystery and deceit that is hypnotizing and engrossing, All in all this is a can't miss thought provoking Crime drama that must be seen to be believed. Gone Baby Gone delivers.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the most well made and satisfying thrillers I've seen in ages,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningPatrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his girlfriend Michelle (Angie Gennaro) run a private detective agency in a run down Boston area. But they're about to get their big break when the family of a missing little girl hire them to find her. But they encounter some negative vibes off police captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) with his own tragic history with his own child who views them as amateurs and the two heavy handed cops assigned to the case, Detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) who they are lead to form an uneasy relationship with. Although the family appear distraught, the little girl's home life is revealed to be no bed of roses, with her coke addicted mother Helene (Amy Ryan) and shady relatives. Eventually it appears to have been solved, only for events to take a sinister turn and for things to turn out in a way no one could have expected.This arrived pretty much out of nowhere for me, and is probably one I wouldn't have bothered with if I hadn't become aware of the plot line and the rave reviews it had received. It turns out it was actually held back due to it's parallels with the Madeleine McCann case and indeed, as a film it does eerily resemble the case, both in the little girl's resemblance to Madeleine and the theme of the home life of her family turning out to be rather undesirable and some scabby family members trying to milk cash out of it. I often tend to disagree with critics who give a lot of films the five star treatment, but they were spot on here as Ben Affleck has proved a better director than actor and has crafted a fittingly bleak, edgy, gritty and exciting thriller full of unexpected twists and turns that keep you hooked right to the end.With his younger brother in the lead role, we are presented a raw, unflinching film that isn't afraid to show the grimy reality of undesirables living in run down, poor, drug addled areas and the depravity in the trail of child abduction cases. Just when it looks like it's wrapping up and the film's over, but you're sitting there thinking that's ended rather quickly, the film pulls the trick a couple more times until the film gets it's real ending that pays off in a way you couldn't have expected it to.With such a credited cast list, it's no surprise that some great performances help keep the film afloat, especially the reliably great Freeman and Harris, an actor I could always take or leave before but who here really gives his role as a tough, unflinching cop a vitality and edge that makes him stand out.Listen to the reviews this time (especially mine!) as this is one of the most well made and satisfying thrillers you'll have seen in a long time. *****",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Justice,How could someone made that bad choice like Patrick..... What was he thinking about??? Justice should be something right! Not something about the law! Casey's act surprised me. So attractive.,9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Four plots in a blender with a dead carp,"As the movie started I got excited by the camera shots and choice of music. By the end I struggled not to turn it off. I just kept moaning out loud, when will this END, and when it did I was more mad than relieved since I wasted two hours that I could have spent vacuuming. What a torture of a plot. I think Ben Affleck re-wrote the screen play until he could get in all the movies he ever wanted to direct about Boston. Man....twist and turns that made no sense and all with a heavy Boston accent. Ben...have kids and leave the movie business to your wife! On the good side, I like the acting by Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan. Morgan Freeman played Morgan Freeman playing Morgan Freeman, his usual...I still like him. Ed Harris - Fabulous.Its the story, the plot, the execution.......oooh - just torture....that is all I can say. I gave it a two because I dislike the word awful.If you like a good story....pass this one up....it is just not worth your time..emteebrain",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stellar.,"I can't recommend this movie enough. Ben's done a very fine job crafting an intelligent and engaging film in both the visuals and as co-writer.Sincerely one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time (and I see scores of movies). Everyone brings their best. It was great to see Morgan Freeman in this type of role, something a bit different than usual. Ed Harris is always watchable. Casey nailed the role, Michelle was great too.I feel bad for not being able to support this film when it did its theatre run, but I bought the DVD hoping to make up for it. I feel even worse that it had a bit of a bumpy launch due to tragic situations beyond their control. Bad luck, sad situation.In the end though, it's just a fantastic film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This monumentally dark film is very fine,"In Boston, a wee four year old girl, Amanda, has gone missing. Her troubled and careless mother, Helene (Amy Ryan) left the child alone in her second floor apartment for at least an hour and, thus, the girl vanished. Now, the whole city and the neighborhood of Dorchester, is looking for Amanda. In three days, nothing emerges. Very frustrated, Amanda's aunt Bea (Amy Madigan) and her husband Lionel (Titus Welliver), this latter being Helene's brother, ask private detectives and significant others Patrick (Casey Affleck) and Angela (Michelle Moynahan) to join the search. Reluctantly, they do. Police officer Remy (Ed Harris) and his superior, Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) bristle at the addition of the private eyes. Yet, Patrick and Angie immediately turn up clues that Helene lied and is not telling the whole story of her shady, coke-snorting life. Then, too, another child goes missing and notorious kid molesters are back in Boston, somewhere. Will Amanda be found? Alive and well? This monumentally dark film is very fine. The story, based on the superb book by Dennis Lehane, is a repugnant, heart-wrenching, all-too-real tale of woe. As such, director Ben Affleck has kept and darkened the tone, with shots of the downtrodden, ugly persons and venues of Dorchester. There are very few light moments while the cast recreates splendid roles with great skill. MOST IMPORTANTLY, the moral ambiguity and mighty issues that are at the core of the movie will have viewers discussing it till the cows come home and back out again. No, its not a happy film but dedicated movie fans won't want to bypass it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
You have to hit rock-bottom before you can recover,"Ben Affleck, here directing (!), has bottomed out for a five year stretch on the other side of the camera since starring in 2003's notorious Gigli. There followed a half dozen films you'll not care to remember, wiping out all that good will he generated with Good Will Hunting. It's been easy to forget that Affleck has talent (even an Oscar) ... he just cannot choose projects.Now, as director, he's making back some ground. He's returned to surer background too  his hometown of Boston and a fractious suburban milieu. This is the setting for a morality plagued mystery-thriller, based on the novel by Dennis Lehane (of Mystic River), but Affleck shows surprising control of sentimentality and builds suspense well. Perhaps not so surprisingly, he works well with his cast - of mostly excellent character actors - to illicit drama that is convincing and persuasive.That said, if Affleck sits with you on the couch at home, best not let him choose a DVD ... or even hold the TV remote.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Lots of Grey, Open Questions","Ben Affleck did a fantastic job directing this. There were a few sequences where Ben is trying to figure it out, but stylistically he keeps it even, dark, on the grit and focused. Excellent job.Casey Affleck's performance wasn't really award-worthy, but he did surprise me. He was solid. Ed Harris was great, per usual, as was Morgan and the rest. Really, the performances, there weren't any standouts, aside from maybe the missing girls mother, who was terrific in her character.The story is one that will leave a lot of questions open in your heart. There are so many gray-areas on the question of morality, after one watches a fine movie like this, where a child is involved it gets treacherous finding your true feelings. Feelings become splintered.This was a terrific film, I recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Choppy, clumsy pacing and mediocre acting Doom this movie","I disagree with almost everyone who has written or rated this movie on IMDb. I thought the movie started very poorly and failed to engage my attention for the first 10 to 15 minutes. In fact I was really trying to get into the film, but the movie repelled my efforts. In fact the entire movie smashes at the audience, both with its acting and action, but also with its unpleasant theme that deserves better movie treatment.Casey Affleck is a sweet looking guy, but he is totally unbelievable as a detective in hard core Boston. The opening moments that introduce us to him and his female partner are choppy and all over the place. They both come across as flat and one dimensional. They don't talk to each other, but rather by and around each other. The female detective comes across, at best, as a drugged out, vague person. She literally has no personality. This continues the entire film.The film brings in the reliable Ed Harris to snarl and yell as the macho cop. This is easy as pie for Harris. Morgan Freeman's initial acting in the film is also flat and uninvolving. I also question the credibility of this film in having a black as the highest ranking officer in the film. Certainly there are black captains and higher in Boston, but his blackness, rightly or wrongly in our society, brings in factors that detract from the movie. Doyle should have been a rough, tough Irish man--actually Harris should have been Doyle and Freeman should have not been in this movie. Talk about politically correct. We have a pedophilia film with a mournful, soulful Boston police captain who is almost eager to allow private detectives work with the force. That is also beyond credibility. Perhaps Affleck and his girlfriend could have gotten involved, but it would have taken a lot more convincing story telling to make it happen in a believable fashion--in this film things just happen. We have a series of clichéd set pieces (bar scene, scene with bad ass drug king, scene with uncaring mother. There is NO continuity and little believability in all the scenes. I understand many viewers liking this film because there are so few adult films on really serious subjects and this film seems powerful and compelling. However, it never comes together and for reasons listed above this never rises above an average film that concerns a firecracker topic (child sex and abuse).The only interesting moments, and above average acting by Affleck, come at the end when he is deciding whether to do the right thing or take an action that is wrong but more emotionally satisfying. In these final moments, we see what might have happened in this film to make it a good one. I blame the director, Hollywood darling Ben Affleck, (who also co wrote the adaption of Lehane's probably good novel) for the problems in the film. He fails to get good performances from his cast and takes a serious story and degenerates it into a soap opera--a poor one at that.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
