A Great Movie,"When my English teacher told the class that we would be watching ""Shakespeare in Love"" everyone groaned, me included. We all thought it would be another boring movie, but I along with many others was pleasantly surprised. Even though the movie didn't portray the actual life of William Shakespeare, it is a very interesting interpretation of what his life might have been like. Normally I am not a big fan of Gwenyth Paltrow, but she fulfilled the role of Viola De Lesseps very well. This movie, unlike many others I have been forced to watch in school, has not been a waste of time and has informed us more about the concepts and details that could not be seen just by reading the play. Overall I think I have gained a better understanding of Romeo and Juliet by watching ""Shakespeare in Love"".",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Touching and very subtle Comedy,"In the times when Women were not allowed to act on the stage. A time when a young William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) was troubled with Writers block. Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) wanted nothing more than to perform on stage.The Lovely Viola, is set to marry Lord Wessex, but her desire to become an actress, leads her to dress as a man and she successfully auditions for a part in Shakespeare's Romeo and Ethel the pirate's daughter. Inspired by a forbidden love for Viola, Shakespeare's writers block is lifted and his play blossoms into Romeo and Juliet.This is a heart warming tale of forbidden love between an unlikely couple, and is delivered in a charming way, with subtle comedy undertones throughout.A Beautiful Film 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Shakespeare would be proud,"I went to see this movie not knowing what to expect. On the one hand, I was excited, because you see, I am an English major and here was this movie based on the life of William Shakespeare. In the realm of Shakespeare rip-offs (i.e., ""Romeo & Juliet,"" ""Macbeth,"" etc..)""Shakespeare in Love"" clearly stood out. This is the first film I've seen based on the author, rather than his work. And it was a refreshing change from watching the pompous over-fed Hollywood egoes trying to pass themselves off as true actors. At the same time, however, the casting had me a bit nervous. I had not seen Joseph Fiennes work, but I had high hopes since his brother is, in my opinion, a brilliant actor. I liked Gwyneth Paltrow in ""Emma"" and ""Sliding Doors,"" but I was wary to see how she would pull this one off. And as for Ben Affleck.. well, I was truly afraid he would flop. I saw him in ""Armageddon"" and immediately racked him up on the list of other such forgettable actors as .. well never mind. The point is, I was afraid he would make a laughing-stock of this movie. As for the other actors,I did not recognize any one else except Judi Dench, and I figured hers was a bit role, nothing that could affect this movie much. I was wrong on almost all counts. Gwyneth Paltrow was so radiant in this movie, she fairly set the screen ablaze. I never knew she had such range. I had not expected such fire in her, I always thought she was a rather calm actress, incapable of such passions. Joseph Fiennes amazed me far more than his brother in that he knows how to balance wit and passion, joy and sorrow gracefully, even more so than Ralph. Together, these two actors did more than carry off the film; they raised it up to levels higher than any other actors I've seen in a very long time.  Judi Dench may have had a bit role, but she managed to make a lot out of it. She played Queen Elizabeth with more majesty and grace than any other Queen-playing actress I've seen. (I've yet to see Cate Blansett in the movie ""Elizabeth."")But the true darkhorse of this movie is Ben Affleck. My God, he has a sense of humor! I never imagined. ""Armageddon"" didn't give him much space to roam in, but in this film he was all over the place. Had he not been flanked by such worthy thespians, he just might have stolen the show. The actors could not have done such marvelous work had it not been, of course, for the writing. The play flows smoothly, with nary a glitch in sight. This is note-worthy, for it is well over 100 minutes. It is written in a style that is at once clever and grave, passionate and dry. Love is one of the most abused notions on the screen today. It is rare to see a movie portray Love with as much originality and truth as this film has accomplished. Perhaps the highest compliment I can pay this movie I already did on Christmas night, when I went to go see this film. As the movie ended and the actors' names scrolled up on the screen, tears trickled down my cheeks. I must say it is not often a movie makes me cry. And don't underestimate me just because I am a girl and because I may be more sensitive because you see, my boyfriend left the theater with suspiciously bright eyes as well..",,Anonymous,History
I wouldn't have given it Best Picture.,"""Shakespeare in Love"" was an interesting movie, but in a year when we had ""Beloved"" and ""The Truman Show"" (""Saving Private Ryan"" was also good, but there were more things that it could have shown), did this one really deserve Best Picture? Well, I guess that there were worse movies. Still, a portrayal of history's greatest playwright getting some unusual inspiration for his masterpiece didn't really seem to deserve Oscar's highest honor. No matter; I did like the original name that they suggested for ""Romeo and Juliet"".It's still weird to think that this came out around the same time as ""Elizabeth"", and also portrayed Queen Elizabeth - not to mention that both movies starred Joseph Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"What ever happened to ""And they lived happily ever after""?","Shakespeare in Love, the best picture winner of 1998, I know this film receives a lot of bashing due to that win. I believe that also Saving Private Ryan was nominated, which it was also an incredible film. To be honest, I couldn't pick between the two, because both were wonderful films and completely different genres. But anyways, back onto Shakespeare in Love. Everything about this film was perfect and I think that's why it received so many Oscar nods and wins, I mean, the costumes, the acting, the sets, the story was absolutely terrific and wonderful to watch. John Madden knew what he was doing and shot this film so beautifully. The cast also seemed to really enjoy doing this film and worked so well together. Gwyneth Paltrow won best actress for this film and she did a terrific job portraying Viola, she was so elegant and touching. The love story between her and William Shakespeare is truly a memorable one.Viola is a first class lady who is about to be married to Lord Wessex, a man who she does not love. Her heart belongs to poetry, mainly the poetry of William Shakespeare. William has lost all hope though when his heart is broken by his girlfriend and he is writing a comedy called Romeo and Ethyl, the pirate's daughter. Since the plays are only played by an all male cast, Viola dresses up as a man and auditions for his new play. She receives the part of Romeo; later that night at a big party her father is throwing, she meets Shakespeare and it is love at first sight. When William finds out the truth that she is the boy who loves his poetry, he doesn't care, they have a passionate affair and continue on with the play as if she were a boy. But the plot thickens and Viola knows that she must go back to her life of an unwanted love and marriage.Shakespeare in Love is without a doubt a fine film and should have a higher rating in my book. I don't understand why so many people hate this film, I thought it was extremely clever and witty. It had a beautiful love story, it was funny, it was sad; there's nothing wrong with this film, but hey, everyone's a critic, right? I highly recommend Shakespeare in Love, just trust me, if you enjoy Shakespeare and his poetry, I'm sure you'll love this film. Just give it a chance, who cares about the Oscars? They make mistakes at times, but Shakespeare in Love is a great movie and I enjoyed watching it.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
"cute movie, but not Oscar material","I thought this was a very sweet & cute movie with an original plot and good acting.  With that being said, I have NO idea what they were smoking when they voted this movie Best Picture.   It just was not that deep or great and the romance wasn't THAT electric.   It's a good bit of fluff that you'd take a date to or rent for a sleepover with all your galfriends.  But not Oscar material.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The impossible - a successful Shakespeare play in movie form!!,"I was in awe for a good five minutes after watching this film.  Tackling Shakespeare in a movie is a risky business, but John Madden has really outdone himself this time.  The beautifully seamless connection between Will's plays and his life experiences is unparalleled.  The best thing was, the entire movie experience felt like attending one of the RSC's best plays. Now THAT's an accomplishment.  The cast was magnificent.  I was very impressed with the acting chops of Gwynneth, Joe Fiennes, and Ben Affleck. Gwynneth and Joe had more onscreen chemistry than I can remember in a very long time.  I felt my own heart breaking as they bid adieu for the last time, and many times in between.  And Ben proved he has excellent comic timing.  I never would have imagined he could do Shakespeare.  And Dame Judi Dench!  It's amazing that so small a role can have such a powerful impact on the tenor of the movie.  She was a perfect choice for Elizabeth.  She needs but to speak, and she commands the rapt attention of her entire audience, both the actors in the movie and the audience beyond the screen.I haven't felt so giddy with excitement after watching a movie since the Shawshank Redemption.  Fabulous!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Not worth the hype,This movie was overrated. All the fuss wasn't worth it. The movie for some reason was loved by critics while audiences seem to find it rather slow.

Brilliant! Absolute perfection!,"Shakespeare in Love was a fantastic film in all departments. You cannot go wrong with the splendid locations and the wondrous costumes. The screenplay was superlative, very witty and moving, and one of the few screenplays out there that completely blew me away. The direction from John Madden was spot on, and I believe it is the same John Madden who directed some of the greatest Inspector Morse episodes, and Inspector Morse in my opinion is the best British detective drama out there. And what a talented cast, with Joseph Fiennes utterly charming and handsome as William Shakespeare, and Gwyneth Paltrow in possibly her best performance was by every means captivating as Lady Viola. Geoffrey Rush, who actually looks like the Barbossa character he created in the Pirates of the Caribbean films, was hilarious, and Colin Firth makes Lord Wessex intentionally insufferable. Simon Callow, Martin Clunes and Ben Affleck are solid in their roles, not to mention the wonderful performance of Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth I. Her end monologue was beautifully written and Dench's interpretation was flawless. I am 17, and I do hope I am not the only person who doesn't think this movie is overrated- I thought it was a brilliant film, that wholly deserved the accolades it received. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,History
what do people see in this movie?,"Why people like this movie so much, I have no idea. Granted, there was good acting and a few likable characters. However, to me, the story lacked depth. I didn't see much passion or energy between the two lovers.  Yes, I could tell that they were in love, but it didn't say anything more than that.  I wasn't nearly as affected by the fate of their relationship as I was in, for instance, Life is Beautiful.  I understand that Shakespeare in Love isn't supposed to be a deep movie, but if it really is a comedy, how come I didn't laugh? The Shakespeare references in the dialogue were too gimiky and way over-used.  Other attempts at humor were equally ineffective, predictable, and dry.  What else is there to this movie?",6.0,Anonymous,History
9 years later & can still watch over and over,"This is one of the few movies that I have given a 10 of 10, maybe the only one. There is tremendous skill at work in every aspect of the film. And the passion... yes, the passion.The script is simply amazing. The fabulous humour - written and visual - exists throughout. The depth of meaning and presentation of the various references means three things for me. First, that the writing was done for the pleasure of the writers as well as the audience. Second, the writers know what they're writing about (certainly I recognize Tom Stoppard's talent). Thirdly, my impression is that the screenwriters wrote the cleverness not to be seen to be clever but because it was such fun. Every multi-level reference that I could catch or, more to the point, those I didn't, left me feeling not that I was clever or daft myself (correspondingly) but that there was a richness to the material that could be appreciated at a variety of levels.The devices used in the script, many more than I know but can nonetheless appreciate, such as intermixing a dialogue sequence between real-life and stage is used very effectively to show that there are parallel fictional stories being told. There is no suggestion from the writers that we are watching a true-to-life story. We know at the outset that it is a fiction loosely based at a certain point in the lives of real people. Perhaps in similar way that Shakespeare's works themselves are historical fiction in some cases (though I know little of Shakespeare).There are particular moments of script brilliance where I found myself suspended in time and unable to breathe as if a river was suddenly dammed and subsequently released with tremendous emotion. For example, the stuttering start of the prologue to the play - absolutely fantastic. Foreshadowing is also used effectively if unsubtly at times as are the Shakespearean notions of mistaken identity and gender-bending.Even such contrivances as Lord Wessex getting a paper flyer in the face just after his marriage to Viola are pulled off easily and believably.The acting is brilliant, cohesive and consistent - a magical combination of script, direction, casting and, oh yes, the actors abilities. The characters all gel into a single, 2 hour dance. How does a movie achieve this level of inspired acting and vivid characterization? I don't know, it's a mystery.The direction of John Madden needs singling out for particular praise. I don't know what to say except that it is the director who must, in the end, not only bring the varied abilities of all those assembled into a single gem but to inspire and allow each facet to shine brilliantly. This he certainly does.The music sets wonderful moods and captures (inspires) a real sense of situation.Visual sets and costumes are fabulous.The editing provides a piece that flows so smoothly.One of the main reasons I see movies is to feel an emotional response and this movie certainly provides that. It all works beautifully - I think one can tell when a company is firing on all cylinders - and I will return to this movie from time to time as no other I have seen.",10.0,Anonymous,History
I don't understand...,"This movie was a surprise (to me) Oscar contender, many people I know gave it good reviews, and the concept seemed ingenious and entertaining.I finally saw it recently (July 1999) and I do not understand it's popularity.  It is an interesting concept for a movie, but the execution was flat and uninteresting to me.  I forced myself to watch through to the end, which was, thankfully, not typical Hollywood, but was still not enough to have made it an interesting viewing experience.Take the hype with a grain of salt.

The most overrated film of the year.,"It's hard not to enjoy Shakespeare in Love.  It's witty, clever and beautifully shot.  The performances - except for Gwyneth Paltrow, who should definitely stick to the present tense - are solid (though not Oscar-worthy, as one has to applaud Judi Dench for admitting.)But that's just about all there is to this pleasant piece of fluff.  It lacks any real substance, and for all the nods to Shakespeare and the smoldering stares, is basically your average, contrived love story. It has none of the depth that made The Truman Show and Elizabeth so outstanding.An enjoyable, cute, picture?  Certainly.  The best of the year? Definitely not.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent,"Those who are looking for a historically accurate portrayal of Shakespeare's life had better look elsewhere - but then this was never intended to be a serious look at the life of the man.  Those who attack it for its' fanciful relation to history have missed the point entirely.  It is a romantic comedy obsessed with nothing more than making references in storyline and plot to the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, and those references are made so seamlessly it could almost be assumed that what we see on the screen actually happened to the man.In fact the overall story we are presented with is not new.  Anyone who had read or seen `Romeo and Juliet' will have a pretty shrewd idea of the path the narrative takes - the twist is that in the film, Shakespeare writes the play `Romeo and Juliet' in parallel to, and based on, his `real life' relationship with Lady Viola.The opening sees Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) desperately trying to write the masterpiece `Romeo and Ethel, the Pirates Daughter', a comedy he hopes will rival anything by Christopher Marlow (Rupert Everett).  Words fail him until his muse appears in the shape of Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), a noblewoman whose love for the work of Shakespeare's leads her to dress as a boy (since at the time women were not allowed on stage) and attend an audition in disguise (mistaken identity and women dressing as men are devices Shakespeare often used in his comedies).  She is given the role of Romeo and begins a forbidden relationship with Shakespeare, the only one who knows her real identity, in spite of the fact that she is betrothed to the villainous Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) at Queen Elizabeth's (Judi Dench) command.Fiennes portrays Shakespeare wonderfully and not as the infallible master of rhetoric.  He takes the Bard from the pedestal and brings him down to a human level that we can all sympathise with.  His relationship with Paltrow is handled sensitively, although many of the scenes that are exclusively their own did have enough a little too much `Chick-Flick' for my liking. Paltrow's R.P. accent is technically very good, and though I normally like my English to be played by the English, I was as happily surprised by her performance as I was by Ben Affleck's brief, but memorable portrayal of the self-important Ned Alleyn.  Much of the credit, though, must go to Michelle Guish for the wonderful supporting cast including:  Judi Dench, Simon Callow, Imelda Staunton, Jim Carter, Martin Clunes and Geoffrey Rush, to name but a few.John Madden directs hypnotically and constantly keeps the camera on the move but most credit for the film must go to Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard for their cunning and often self-parodying script.  The only comment I would make is regarding the sheer number of theatre references.  Those who have worked in the theatre will be aware of many, if not all, of the in-jokes that the film is littered with.  Those who have not may be left with the feeling that they have been excluded from much of the content.",,Anonymous,History
Charming and cute,"Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is a struggling playwright. He's sold his next play to both Philip Henslow (Geoffrey Rush) and Richard Burbidge. It's called 'Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'. Only he can't get started. Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) comes from a wealthy family and wants poetry in her life. Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) is interested but he doesn't have the poetry. She pretends to be a man to audition for Will's play. However Will sees through her disguise and they begin a love affair.I love all the Shakespearian phrases that are thrown at Will from everybody. It has a cute charm to it. It's probably the best original Shakespearian play not written by him. I also love William Shakespeare as a struggling artist. It's not a high minded academic thing although a good knowledge of some of the famous lines help to appreciate this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Rollicking, Crative, and Fun","Whether there is an iota of truth in this film (it's very doubtful there is), it is a wonderful creation. It sets the bards longing in the Elizabethan period, where life was short, theatre was king, and competition for attention was everywhere. Christopher Marlowe was no Shakespeare, and he met a tragic death, so let's see what happens when you throw the two together. Take all the lessons about the period and the Globe, have those young boys playing female parts. Have Shakespeare riding a roller coaster of depression. Take Gwyneth Paltrow's character, absolutely stunning. Throw them into the hopper and let it happen. Many more articulate people can comment with a great deal more scholarship than I have. But this movie is one of a kind and very refreshing and very, very satisfying. It has humor, tragedy, and a nice edge to keep it from being a fantasy.",9.0,Anonymous,History
1998 Was a Strange Year,"A young Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes), out of ideas and short of cash, meets his ideal woman (Gwyneth Paltrow, not Anne Hathaway) and is inspired to write one of his most famous plays.In smaller roles (but still appreciated), are the great actors Ben Affleck and Rupert Everett. Affleck may not have appreciated a very naked Gwenyth Paltrow pressed up against Shakespeare, as they were dating at the time. But, that is how Hollywood works.1998 must have been a strange year. Although I watched many movies that year, I had not yet caught the ""Oscar bug"" and was more interested in the fantastic film genres. In many ways, I still am, but my views have broadened significantly. Anyway... this film walked away with seven awards, including ""Best Picture"". Reflecting years later (2015), was it the best film of that year? Although the category was smaller then (five films rather than today's eight or nine), one jumps out as the better film: ""Saving Private Ryan"".

A Terrific Film,"I saw a preview of this movie and it was terrific.  Most period movies are long, boring, usually low-concept and often as emotionally heavy as the costumes in which the actors trudge around (Elizabeth, Wings of the Dove, The Piano, Restoration, etc...)Well this movie was different.  Don't be afraid of the word Shakespeare in the title!  This movie is not a junior-high history lesson.  It's light, funny, romantic, and a totally irreverent look at Elizabethan England.The screenplay is brilliant.  The best writing in a movie I've seen this year.  The idea is that Shakespeare is not some grave, great poet, but a young guy trying to make his way in the theatre.  He's written good plays, but nothing truly transcendent.  The conceit is that an ill-fated romance--the one great true love of this life--with a beautiful, smart woman is what inspires him to write his first immortal play: Romeo and Juliet.In this era of world-exploding actioners and cookie-cutter Adam Sandler movies, it's rare to see such a specific, ingenious, and inspired story for a film.The best part about this movie is its sense of humor.  It plays with history, takes a great man abut whom we know alomost nothing, and creates a fantasy about his life that is totally outrageous, funny and real.Also, the movie is really romantic.  The costumes are lush, the leads look great and have real chemistry together.  I used to think that Gwyneth was overrated, but here she's radiant.  And Joe Fiennes has an intensity and a vulnerabiliy, as well as a sense of humor, that I for one find sorely lacking in his older brother Ralph.Needless to say, this is the best date movie of the year.  Women take note: I am a red-blooded straight American male, and I loved it.  Take your boyfriends to see this movie.

He simply did not deserve the nomination over directors like Sam Raimi, Todd Solondz, and Bill Condon.3)The predictability.  We know how this movie is going to end, because we know how Romeo and Juliet ends.  It puts such a strain on such a long (not too long) movie.I am not saying that there is no  merit in this movie.

Ridiculous.Maybe even worse than the Best Picture travesty, was the Best Actress Oscar for Gwyneth Paltrow. I didn't think that the criteria for Best Actress was smiling demurely and showing off your breasts a lot. Sadly enough, that's what it appears to have become. Cate Blanchett deserved the Oscar so much more, as least to anyone to half a brain. However, you don't see her chest in the movie, so no Oscar. Disgusting.Tom Stoppard must have had a serious off day when he wrote this. I can't believe this is the same guy who wrote ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"".

An excellent film in all aspects.,"I had high hopes for this film from the first time I saw the trailer. I am happy to say that the film lives up to the previews. Although it is an art house flick of sorts, it manages to be profound and accessible at the same time. So many art house films manage to be merely pretentious, as if aimed at those that want to believe that they are having an intellectual experience rather than those who are really open to one. This film shows that you can make a film of substance that is at the same time very entertaining.One thing that stood out was the way they showed enough of the performance of Romeo and Juliet so that you could understand what the play is about, without making it a film of the play per se. There are many parallels between the fictional play and the events of the film, and this goes to underscore the relevance of great literature to the human condition. The actual performance of the play was acted so well that there were times when a character in the play was in a fight and I said to myself ""they're really fighting, that guy really got stabbed!"" So often a play within a movie is acted in a very staged manner, so this was a welcome surprise. And for anyone who is a fan of Shakespeare, it is easy to find little tidbits to reflect upon - such as the fact that Shakespeare himself was fond of the ""play within a play"" theme that we see in this film.The performances are excellent throughout, including minor characters. In the midst of tragedy there is genuine comic relief, just as in Shakespeare. The historical details that surround the conjectural main plot are accurate down to the names of the actual people with whom Shakespeare crossed paths. In the end ""Shakespeare in Love"" causes us to feel as well as think, to think as well as to be entertained.",,Anonymous,History

Geoffrey Rush, Ralph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Ben Affleck are superb. The supporting cast is equally excellent. Not to be missed is the performance by Judie Dench as Queen Elizabeth l. Her time on film is short, but her impact on the film is enormous. Bits and pieces of Shakespeare's work are evident throughout, and the tie ins to Christopher Marlowe are inspired! Costumes, makeup, scenery, lighting, and sound - all the technical and design elements are incredibly well researched and well executed. This film gives us a wonderful look at life in the Elizabethan period, not just the life of those involved in the theatre.

Shakespeare's life turned into a bedroom farce...good but not great...,"I never could understand all the fuss and fury over this period comedy of manners that has GWYNETH PALTROW parading herself as a boy because women were not allowed to partake in theater centuries ago when William Shakespeare (Joseph FIENNES) was writing his passionate plays.First of all, anyone who couldn't tell that Paltrow was--well, Paltrow in boy's clothing--should have had his eyes examined. So much for believability. Then we have the miscast Joseph FIENNES looking like a Gypsy with an earring and a Mafia-like manner who wandered out of a tough neighborhood in Brooklyn to play the famous Bard. He's not a bad actor at all, just dreadfully miscast. To believe him as the writer of these passion plays is hard to swallow.Then we have BEN AFFLECK who appears and disappears from the plot for long periods of time--so long that we forget he's even in the movie. And COLIN FIRTH, wasted in a colorless role. And for some strange reason, JUDI DENCH appears for eight minutes as Queen Elizabeth I and gets an Oscar for Best Supporting Role.Not at all helpful for me to review the film is the fact that I put off seeing it shortly after watching GWYNETH PALTROW's tearful, hysterical Oscar acceptance speech. I was so turned off by her out of control moments that I swore not to watch the film. Well, I relented finally, but was severely disappointed by the viewing experience.Sure, it's an enjoyable costumed romp with lots of period flavor in settings and costumes and some nice color cinematography.

Lots of mirroring of the actual play ""Romeo and Juliet"" and sneaky little references that will pique the interest of many Shakespeare fans.Unfortunately this movie is most remembered nowadays as the film that beat ""Saving Private Ryan"" at the Oscars. I definitely think there are worse snubs in Academy history. For the most part, this movie is inoffensive fun and just a well-made, well-acted love letter to theater and acting and literature. Beyond the layer of pastiche it offers very little but it's a nice little two hours spent if this is the type of movie that you enjoy watching, I suppose.",7.0,Anonymous,History
'Shakespeare (rolling) in His Grave' a better title for this movie.,"We all know the Oscars are simply about Hollywood patting themselves on the back, and nowhere is this more evident with the 13 nominations received by Shakespeare in Love.' Very little originality, horrible casting for a lead part and a well-planned ruse to pass this studio pic as an art film are simply some of the factors against this movie.The story (if we can call it that) is no more than a simple collection of lines from the Bard's plays, blended together into a weak two-hour script. Adding pieces of Shakespeare's life into the mix, they pretend to explain the origin of famous lines and stories surrounding him, such as Shakespeare's relationship with Thomas Kent, who in truth was a man (it was widely accepted that William Shakespeare was bisexual). While the movie has no basis in reality, even as a work of fiction it fails miserably.Gwyneth Paltrow gives an unimpressing and incredibly boring performance, looking like a Cate Blanchet wannabe, pretending to sound like Emma Thompson or Kate Winslet in her role as Viola, and like Kenneth Branagh when impersonating Thomas Kent. It's understandable, considering Thompson and Branagh have defined modern Shakespearean cinema, but her performance ends up being a weak attempt at emulating the masters of the genre. Every time she appears on-screen, she simply destroys the atmosphere of Elizabethan England (an atmosphere that is thin to begin with); she is simply out of place. So was Ben Affleck, but at least he didn't talk that much.There are a few shinning stars in the pic, though. Joseph Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush give amazing performances given the weak script they had to work with, dashing the movie with a dose of comedy and great acting that carries the story at times, but not for 2 hours.Shakespeare in Love' is okay as a mass-market date movie, a pic for those that have no idea what Shakespeare's plays are all about, a pic for the Teeny-Bopper crowd, but not as an Oscar Nominated Film. On the contrary, it is a perfect example why Hollywood should stick to doing Hollywood and leave the realm of art films for those with the correct vision to bring them to life. If it's Elizabethan cinema you are after, go see Elizabeth' (you'll get great performances by Joseph Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush, too!). If it's a date movie you're after, see She's All That;' at least it doesn't pretend to be what it is not.",1.0,Anonymous,History
An Abundance of Riches,"A romantic comedy does not get much better than Shakespeare in Love. Here is a movie that captures the feel of England 400 years ago. It is romantic yet light. It is funny but is complex enough to provide enjoyment for fans of literature.The sets of England 400 years ago, the costumes and the character's makeup including their bad dental work were just right. You could almost smell those streets. The hero, Shakespeare, is excellently played by Joseph Fiennes. He is sympathetic but never pathetic. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, she shows her range from boyishness to radiance. This is the first film I have seen her in where I believed she could become a great actress. There is also a great supporting cast, especially Judi Dench, who all have good melodramatic and comic instincts.The film never plods. The screenplay is rich with romance, emotion and action.  The plot weaves several stories and themes. You can enjoy it as a simple love story with some action and basic suspense about producing a play or you can get much deeper into movie's complex tapestry of ideas and in jokes. But most importantly the film's mood is always light and is never overblown (unlike another recent movie about unfulfilled love, Great Expectations).Deserving of its Oscar, this is simply a great film.",,Anonymous,History
Everyone will be in love with this stunningly beautiful  film,"William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is having a major writer's block. He contends he writes best when he has a ""muse"", that is, he is in love. No matter that he already has a wife some distance away, he courts many a lovely lass. Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a beautiful young noblewoman whose father has some money but no title. She loves going to the theater productions at the court of Queen Elizabeth I (Judy Dench). With her parents away and Shakespeare set to start work on a new play, Viola disguises herself as a man and auditions for the play. She, um, he gets the part. Will crashes a posh party soon after and spies the real Viola. He's smitten, through and through. But, Viola's parents have already arranged for her to marry a nobleman (Colin Firth) who has a title but needs the money Viola's dowry can provide. Horrors! Nevertheless, Will succeeds in winning Viola's heart and they begin a relationship. As a consequence, Will is inspired to write the lovely but tragic Romeo and Juliet as his new play. But, will there be a tragic ending for Viola and Will, too? This film is more ""lovely than a summer's day"". It is stunningly beautiful and everything is utter perfection. The terrific cast of Fiennes, Paltrow, Dench, Ben Affleck, Geoffrey Rush, Firth, Tom Wilkinson, Rupert Everett, and all of the other actors, are wonderful beyond words. Paltrow and Dench walked off with the Oscars but everyone is truly excellent. Add on the sumptuous costumes, the gorgeous sets and scenery, the excellent script, the vibrant direction, and the fantastic musical score and you have a film with absolutely no flaws whatsoever. So, then, what are you waiting for? This is a film to buy and cherish forever and ever.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Whimsical what if . . .,"Shakespeare in Love is pure fiction that just happens to use historic people as characters.  Don't come to this film hoping it will answer your questions about the real Will's private life but it is an imaginative conceit as to how the Bard concocted his plots.It is also very modern.  This is a poor depiction of Elizabethean life. Syntax, make-up, social situations etc. make this less a costume drama than a modern movie set in the late 1600s. But that's okay.  Accepting that, Stoppard's allusions to Shakespearean trivia and the evolution of Romeo and Ethel and the Pirate King to the masterpiece we now know was delightful. The scenes between Fiennes and Paltrow tended to slow the march to opening night, er, afternoon, a bit, but the electricity surrounding the premiere made the wait worth it.I'm surprised no-one has cited Tom Wilkinson's superb performance as the moneyman, Fennyman.  He does an excellent job of developing his character from a money-grubbing Shylock to a lover of theater.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching his transformation and sensing, through him, that something special was evolving out of the comedy Shakespeare had originally been commissioned to do (according to the movie, that is).",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Without a doubt, the best film of 1998!","""Shakespeare in Love"" is truly genius!  The symbolism of the language and events, the beauty of the costumes, sets, and scenery (not to mention Gwyneth Paltrow) is absolutely amazing.  ""Shakespeare in Love,"" for lack of better words, is a fulfilling -- even profound -- experience.  The language is advanced, but it flows wonderfully.  If you were to shut your eyes and only listen to the words of the actors, you could ""see"" just as vividly as if you were to have your eyes glued to the screen (and trust me -- your eyes ARE glued to the screen).The love scenes are very tasteful, and even though there is partial nudity, the scenes retain their artistic value.  I feel very strongly that this film will win the Oscar for Best Picture.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" WAS a good film, based on real events (which are easily duplicated), and its emotions came from WITHIN the viewer, whether thinking of personal memories or memories of someone they know.  It took imagination and talent to make the fictional events in ""Shakespeare in Love"" (though BASED on truth) into something so moving and so real.I respect a movie a lot more when it MAKES me belive, rather than ALLOWING me to believe.  I hope that makes sense, but I really can't think of another way to say it.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" was, in a way, an informative documentary about the horrors of war.  ""Shakespeare in Love,"" on the other hand, drew me in and MADE me belive in it.  My heart aches for a love like that.  We should all be so lucky.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A beautiful fictional romance on Shakespeare moving around the making of legendary play 'Romeo And Juliet'.,"Shakespeare In Love (1998) :
Brief Review -A beautiful fictional romance on Shakespeare moving around the making of legendary play 'Romeo And Juliet'. Shakespeare In Love is based on a fictional love affair involving playwright William Shakespeare and Viola de Lesseps while Shakespeare was writing Romeo and Juliet which went on to make a history. There shouldn't be any arguments over historical inaccuracies cause the film is purely based on fictional work and not true events. The world's greatest ever playwright, William Shakespeare, is young, out of ideas and short of cash, but meets his ideal woman and is inspired to write one of his most famous plays. They share a temporary but very serious relationship during the making of the legendary play and it's all easily predictable so you needn't think much about it. As a love story it makes quite a passionate and steamy romance but not on a level you think it should have been. Nevertheless, it has more interesting thing to show us and that is a tour to behind the scenes of Romeo And Juliet. Yeah, seriously, i didn't like their romace much but this Romeo And Juliet's construction had me hooked. I didn't care to see Shakespeare behaving like an unintelligent man who has lost his thing but gets it right at work after enjoying intimacy with his lover, but i cared very about the backstory of how Romeo And Juliet was formed. Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow make a hot chemistry while Benn Affleck and Judi Dench are very impressive in side roles. The screenplay is fine, not much boring moments, dialogues are too good, cinematography is okay and set designing is brilliant. John Madden delivers a beautiful lovestory with slight touch of tragedy at the end but falls fairly short to make a Classic Movie. And the Oscars against Cult Films like 'Life Is Beautiful', 'Saving Private Ryan, and 'Amrican History X', you must be kidding me.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A shrewd and charming romantic comedy.,"A shrewd and charming romantic comedy about the well-known playright William Shakespeare (Joesph Fiennes), who's fighting a severe case of writer's block and the cure comes in the form of Lady Viola de Lessops (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Set in London during the infamous Plague, the indomintable reign of Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench), and only men (not women) portrayed women in staged plays.  The Bard's latest play, a comedy that was originally titled as ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's daughter"" then changed to ""Romeo and Juilet"", a romantic tragedy.  Top-notch writing and directing and first-rate performances definitely make this film an instant classic hands down.  There are plenty of funny moments throughout the movie and one notable example would be when Shakespeare and his actors get into a hilarious, all-out brawl with another theater owner and his men.  Paltrow and Dench both won Oscars for their memorable performances and I'm happy that the film won ""Best Picture"" instead of ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"".  Why Fiennes didn't get an Best Actor nomination baffles me even to this day. Rupert Everett appears here as Christopher Marlowe and is unbilled.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Clever, sappy","In this ""historical"" movie, Shakespeare is imagined as a young playwright in England falling in love with nobility, which prompts him to write Romeo and Juliet.One of my favorite things about the movie were the references to Shakespeare's other plays and his time period. For example, when Shakespeare sits down in the psychiatrist's chairs, he's thinking about ""words, words, words"" (a reference to Hamlet). Also, Shakespeare talks to a young boy who loves blood and finds his name to be John Webster (writer of ""The Duchess of Malfi"" and other plays).However, though the few references were quite clever, I didn't really feel there were enough of them. Though many of the jokes would be lost on a lot of the audience, fans of Shakespeare would really appreciate them.Also, I think the movie shifted from being a clever period comedy with biting satire into a sappy love story and then leaves me with a mixed feeling at the end (in some ways, following the progression of Shakespeare's own plays.) Still, the sap does get a bit overwhelming at times. Rating: 7.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Impressive spin on Shakespeare, with a contemporary feel","Tom Stoppard, who penned Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, knows a thing or two about the modern deconstruction and reconstruction of Shakespeare's work -- and it shows in the bright and vivid Shakespeare in Love, which Stoppard co-wrote with Marc Norman.  Applying many of the same conventions favored by Shakespeare in his own work (including primarily the confusion over mistaken identity and gender) the screenwriters begin with the ""what if"" premise and run with it, speculating with wicked delight on the Bard's rivalry with Christopher Marlowe, his use of overheard phrases finding their way into his plays, and best of all, the possible sources of his inspiration.  Will's muse is Violet, played wonderfully by Gwyneth Paltrow, who shows off in this film her finest acting to date and credibly pulls off the tricky task of being both an object of poetic inspiration and a genuine, down-to-earth human being.",,Anonymous,History
Delightfully droll,"Best Picture Oscar winner is a highly enjoyable frolic, roguish and mischievous, with an exceptional cast.

Clever piece is pure invention, but so what? Amusing and fast-paced, it is a film in love with the theater, a valentine to actors and the creative process.

Director John Madden allows the whole thing to flow.Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow is quite a revelation and totally convincing as Will's inspiration.

It's not like it was in the old days...,"Shakespeare in love is a wonderful film, full of everything - humour, romance, history, moments that make you want to cry, or moments that just make you think - and there are some wonderful little touches. Bits that you wouldn't notice the first time round. Will Shakespeare is played wonderfully by Joseph Fiennes, so well I wonder why I haven't stumbled on him before. Gwynneth Paltrow makes a wonderful ""Juliet""-type character - innocent and sweet and young and well, drop-dead gorgeous. Judi Dench is very overpaid for her minute or so that she plays as the queen, and play it well she does. I absoloutley adore Ben Affleck's performance as the big-headed Ned Alleyn - he has some wonderful lines: Will: Thank you sir, thou art a gentleman. Ned: And you sir, are a s**t-house. I can only assume that the casting director is a fan of the fast show because three of 'em are there, one as the prologue, and two as taxi-boat drivers, and very good they are indeed. Stuff I loved: Will's little ritual of spinning round before he sat down to write; Will's wonderful ink-stained knuckles; the taxi-boat driver bit ""I'm a bit of a playwright meself""; the wonderful joke about John Webster; when that guy says ""well that'll have 'em rolling in the aisles"" and many many more besides. All in all, an excellent film - certainly one of my top ten (probably only 'cause I'm an actor and I love Shakespeare. Oh, and sex scenes).

How can anybody like this film?,"It seems strange to me that Shakespeare in Love has been given so much space by the critics. I found it to be a dull and uninspired movie. The casting was awful (two unpleasant and barely talented leads in one film). Gwyneth Paltrow looking more like a duck than ever, giving her whole range of head movements. As for the plot, well, where can I start. Shakespeare has run out of ideas. He falls in love with a noble-woman (cue much mistaken identity, mistaken gender, in the style of Romeo and Juliet). Through the relationship with Viola (the tepid Paltrow) Shakespeare is inspired to write, yes, you guessed it, Romeo and Juliet. The problem with Shakespeare in Love is that you can see things coming a mile off, jokes, plot, references to historical figures. The only truly funny moments that I found were those in which members of The Fast Show (hilarious British comedy) were on screen. If you feel the need to go and see this film - take a moment and consider seeing one of Shakespeare's own plays which provide all the things that Shakespeare in Love fails to.

Wonderful!,"In the movie Shakespeare in Love, a  young and promising William Shakespeare is finding it difficult to write a new play.  He feels he has lost his gift for stringing together eloquent sentences and yearns for some sort of inspiration to rid him of his horrible writer's block.  William then meets the lovely and royal Viola, who is craving to be an actress.  She becomes his muse, as well as the lead `actor' in his new play Romeo and Juliet, as they weave a tangled love affair.  This burning passion they feel can only end with separation when Viola is forced to marry Lord Wessex and move to America.  This film is a wonderful combination of romance, comedy, and drama that attempts a new perspective of the classic Romeo and Juliet story.  It employs clever dialogue, beautiful scenes, and wonderful characterization to entertain the viewer. The film's Renaissance dialogue is true to its time period.  With such an excellent script, William comes across as the master of speech that he really is.  Some parts of the movie are purely funny as almost to parody the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet. Other parts intertwine the actual lines from the play, such as the multiple bedroom scenes between Will and Viola, to provide a unique and obvious parallel between it and the movie.  When Will quotes `Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?' to Viola, this provides not only a sentimental scene but actual words from Shakespeare to add to the historical content of this film.   This film has an interesting twist on the tragic tale because Will becomes not just a writer pouring out the lines for pay, but a man pouring out his heart in true love.  At the end of the movie, Romeo and Juliet is presented as though you were actually sitting on the dirt floor of the playhouse.  You see the play through the eyes of a person in England during the late 1500's, except by this time the lead is not longer Romeo and Juliet but literarily and symbolically Will and Viola. The setting of this film is very well done, and the playhouses, taverns, and elegant houses convey the feeling of Renaissance England.  The costumes, including Queen Elizabeth's glamorous dresses and Viola's body-shaping corset,  are seemingly accurate.  (I would have hated wearing those clothes!)  The scenes between Will and Viola are rarely anything but love scenes, and they, like their counterpart scenes in Romeo and Juliet, mostly happen at night.  This adds to the mystery and forbidden feeling of the movie.  The characterization of this film was splendidly carried out.  I could not help but fall in love with the beautiful emotion that gushed from Will and Viola ( Will is extremely good looking by the way).  When the couple was separated in the end, I felt like a terrible wrong had been committed.  The character of Queen Elizabeth, with her snide comments and all-knowing attitude, was a comical representation of a serious position that kept me completely entertained.  Christopher Marlowe also provides a wonderful character that conveys `real person' qualities of competition between two famous playwrights. I found this film to be completely engaging from start to finish, but I would not recommend it to everyone.  I believe it could truly be given the title of `chick flick' by some viewers despite its fight scenes and comedic devices.  The viewer will gain a knowledge of the Renaissance period and its characteristics while also getting the feeling of knowing the great William Shakespeare, however inaccurate the description of Will may be.  I feel that now I appreciate the play Romeo and Juliet with a new sense of understanding that can only come from looking at an old tale in a new light.",,Anonymous,History

A Larger-than-life Movie!,"Passion. Art. Love. Beauty. All in one movie that will leave you utterly speechless. Shakespeare In Love has by far exceeded my expectations and deservedly topped my all-time-favorite-movies list.I don't know from where to start.. but I certainly know with whom to start; the one and only Joseph Fiennes. Were Shakespeare alive, he would be jumping out of happiness for being depicted with such vigor, heartiness and originality! Fiennes not only has playfully depicted the 17th century dramatist but also added a lot from his own passion-radiating personality - so masterfully and sincerely that you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen as long as he is on. As for the ever-radiant Gwyneth Paltrow, she is literally the sunshine of the movie. Her delicacy and sweetness take over the script and setting and even other actors, and manage to put you in a fairytale-like atmosphere. Geoffrey Rush was more than brilliant, as usual, as the money-seeker Philip Henslowe and hugely added to the comic effect. Roughly, the same can be said about Ben Affleck who was surprisingly good as the self-centered yet kind-hearted actor Ned Alleyn. Queen Elizabeth was originally portrayed by the ever-talented academy-award-winner Judi Dench. She manages to mix comedy with grandeur in her representation of the famous Queen.Although it derives most of the characters from real life, the story is fictional, or at least not proved true. However, it poses a new perspective for regarding history. History, like art, is in the eye of the teller and the listener/viewer. Thus imagination plays the greatest role in relating the events of the story. This will leave you wondering what if this was true?! What if Shakespeare's timeless love sonnets and plays are nothing but the reflection of a larger-than-life romance?The script is beautifully written and the score is heavenly composed.

When I sat down to watch it, I found only Hollywood's interpretation of a love story, dressed with Hollywood make-up, and Hollywood music, all of which blowing this story far out of proportion.Now don't get me wrong, Hollywood has produced many fine films, but Shakespeare in Love is simply too much of a motion-picture story, and not a real, story. It isn't a story that anyone can identify with on a personal level and that is what makes it hard to feel for the characters. It just so happens that I also saw the film ""October Sky"" yesterday, and although these two films can not be easily contrasted, October Sky tells a truly interesting story, without all the Hollywood dress-up.

I think many of you are missing the point,"Saving Private Ryan? Pants. Thin Red Line? Pants. Shakespeare In Love cannot and should not be compared to these movies for one simple reason - it isn't one of these movies. And why war films should be singled out for distinction when they are themselves rehashed or strangely and continually perceived as being 'powerful' or 'artistic' or 'sensitive' is beyond me. I'm not saying that they are necessarily bad films in themselves, but I think it's time you tried to broaden your horizons a bit. Shakespeare In Love seems certainly to have been received on two levels. Historical relevance and accuracy is not the aim of the film - no more than it was with Braveheart. The latter seems consistently raved-over, and not without some cause - I rank it as one of my favourite films, even though it is essentially a pure flight of fantasy (I love one reviewer's comment - ""I look forward to the sequel"". Come off it!). SIL contains a continual stream not just of 'in-jokes' but of humour at its cleverest and driest. It is an engaging and almost plausible theory of how the great bard came to write one of the great plays, and how others may have followed. The very fact that it is almost a convincing film singles it out as an achievement in inventive, entertaining script writing. The fact that it has been so well received on this side of the pond precludes the theory of its Englishness appealing to the Academians; it is simply an engaging love story whose humour suits the background knowledge and style of humour found here. Sorry guys - but if I wanted a decent war movie, I'd take Where Eagles Dare; if I wanted a trip into the surreal I'd settle for Jacob's Ladder; if I wanted a poignant, historically accurate, and powerful war movie I'd take Schindler's List. And if I wanted a clever, witty and original twist on two old themes, I'd take Shakespeare In Love. It deserved to win recognition, and failure to observe this precludes criticism of all but the most basic films to be found on the silver screen.",,Anonymous,History
Great costumes,"but, was it slow and boring.  Okay this isn't intended to be an action flic, or a laughing in the isles comedy, but come on.  My new rule: do not rent anything that wins more than 2 awards, the more nominations the better.The first HOUR of this movie was a slow day in hell, the second half was much better.  I found the dialogue hard to hear at times and with those accents, it was hard to decode what was actual going on.

"Overrated? Heck, it's terribly Underrated!","I can't believe somebody could rent this movie and find it to be a bad film. I didn't see it until a day or two after it won Best Picture, but when I did, I smiled and affirmed that they had picked the best film of the year. A year, I will remind you, that in July it already seemed that Saving Private Ryan would certainly and very unfairly win itself the Best Picture award plus 10 more. The fact that so many people felt that Shakespeare in Love robbed SPR of its Oscars proves further just how sad this country is. People are extremely easily won over by cheap sentiment and commercials which tell us that SPR was ""deep."" SIL's Oscars were blamed on the Academy's forgetfulness.Truth be told, that is exactly why SIL won and SPR lost. A film came along that impressed them late in the game, and that clinched the award. Plus, it was pushed up by Miramax's soft money campaign. Heck, if SIL didn't exist, Miramax would have tried its hardest to get Life is Beautiful that Best Picture Oscar. It would have even had a chance, a foreign film. No, if indeed SPR had come around in, say, October, it would have certainly won the Best Picture Oscar. Why? Well, look back to the 1998 awards show, where Titanic took everything and its mother. Very few people would affirm that Titanic was a worthwhile Best Picture. I don't know about you, but I was pretty embarassed to be an American after I aw Titanic (of course, afterwards, it swept the entire world, so I guess it's just our species). Titanic was sappy and obvious with its meanings and emotions, as was SPR. It would have won if not for their forgetfulness. Luckily, SIL conquered it.Okay, the reason I like this film so much: it is extraordinarily well written and it has everything. Let's start with the everything notion right away: action, romance, comedy and drama. All of those are here in full force. It was perfect in all those aspects. Now, for the great writing, which many people are apparently missing:to adapt a play as great as Romeo and Juliette and make it even more compelling than the original is a feat that almost no one can achieve. More compelling? Did I actually say that?!?!?!?! SACRILEGE! No, I truly believe that the play garners more meaning as we see it develop throughout SIL. We see Shakespeare's inspirations to write the play, we see him lovingly rehearse lines from the play with the woman whom he loves. Plus, in a developement so ingenious that it makes me clap, Viola, his love interest, is Romeo and Shakespeare is Juliette. It is just beautiful, and I have to give this movie a 10/10. It's terribly underrated, because I believe the idiots at the Academy, as well as a huge amount of cynical self-described film buffs have regretted its initial success. Some people will never know how good movies can get.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Stealing the show,"""Shakespeare in Love"" is, in many ways, the quintessential Oscar Best Picture.  This is not necessarily a good thing.

Gwyneth Paltrow and the rest of the cast are fine, but it is not the best picture of the year, and it is a classic example of how people easily confuse good costumes with good filmmaking.Again, ""Shakespeare in Love"" is not a bad film, but neither is it outstanding.

The most overrated movie of 1998,"Shakespeare in Love is not a bad movie, but it is not a great one either. In fact, in most areas, this movie is amazingly mediocre to pretty good.  It is not particularly funny, not particularly well acted (with the exception of Judi Dench's incredibly small role, the rest of the performances are just adequately acted at best), not moving, not profound, and based on an adulterous affair between an engaged woman and a man who has left his wife and kids (something that is never romantic in real life, but somehow portrayed as such in the movies).  The one area that the film does excel is in its look.  This movie is beautiful to look at and brilliantly designed.The real flaw in this movie lies in its central relationship between the young Will Shakespeare and his mistress Viola.  There is nothing to there relationship.  It's shallow.  Great movies cause you to make realizations about love that you always somehow knew or never quite figured out.  There are no realizations to be made in this movie.  Why are these characters even in love?  It's really hard to tell.  I think it's because they are both so beautiful and really know how to tell each other that.  That's fine.  Not every movie has to be profound or meaningful, but the great one's are. Shakespeare in Love is not great.The most surprising thing for me was the lack of real humor in this movie. Tom Stoppard is truly one of the greatest living playwrights with a gift for comedy and a personal favorite of mine.  This script (which he co-wrote), however, is amusing at times, clever often, but rarely funny.  I guess I expect too much.  If you see this movie, enjoy it for what it is - beautiful eyecandy with a clever but fluffy storyline.  If you don't see it, don't worry.  (7 stars)",7.0,Anonymous,History
"By far the best ""Shakespeare-movie"" ever","I have never really seen a play written by Shakespeare, but I have seen some movies based on them. I must say that this one is the best I've ever seen, by far. I really had a very good time watching this movie. Its historical background, combined with a romance and some great and far from dumb humor really gave this movie a refreshing touch that I haven't seen to often lately.Will Shakespeare is about to write a new play, called ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter"" (that title on it's own is already good for some laughs, isn't it?). He suffers from writers block and is looking for a new muse. He founds his muse in the daughter of a rich merchant, who's about to marry Lord Wessex. His relationship with her inspires him to write the play, renames it and one of his most famous plays is born: ""Romeo & Juliette""The acting is really great and the sets are beautiful and I guess also historically accurate. All in all this is one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. It's definitely worth the rewards that it got. I give it an 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History

(And if she and Dame Judi can get Oscar nominations, then why not one for Joseph Fiennes?)With, at points, every other line being a quote from one Shakespeare play or another, why couldn't the material have been better?Overall, the hype made this a very disappointing film, which is a shame as it wasn't all that bad.",6.0,Anonymous,History

The idea of Shakespeare in a writing slump might have been good, but the forced insertion of the romance element is just concocted to extract some easy sighs from the viewer. How many of them were due to the movie, and how many to the thought of the $8 gone forever, I cannot say. The romance is as deja vu as it gets, the jokes are trite.

One of the best of 1998 and deserving of that Oscar!,"Every so often a movie comes along that is literate, intelligent, and has magic and charm to spare. Movies like these affirm our belief that film is a terrific art form. Shakespeare In Love is one such movie.The movie chronicles Shakespeare's writer's block while trying to write a play entitled Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter. In desperate need of a muse, Shakespeare finds one in the beautiful noblewoman Viola de Lesseps who has a desire to be an actor at a time when women are forbidden from performing. Shakespeare and Viola fall in love thus inspiring Romeo and Juliet.As Shakespeare, Joseph Fiennes steps out of his brother Ralph's shadow and proves what a dashing and charismatic leading man he can be. Fiennes has a Peter O'Toole quality about him and should become a big star. While his portrayal may be nothing like Shakespeare, he makes us believe in romance Shakespeare's woes.Gwyneth Paltrow is stunning as Viola de Lesseps. She throws herself into the part and handles an English accent very well as she did in Sliding Doors and Emma. Viola is the heart and soul of the movie, she is the reason for Romeo and Juliet's existence and Paltrow truly makes us believe in romance.The supporting cast is all terrific. Geoffrey Rush is amusing as the theater owner Henslowe. Ben Affleck is truly surprising a hammy actor, with good material, Affleck is quite a capable actor. Judi Dench and Queen Elizabeth and Rupert Everett as Christopher Marlowe round out the cast with fine performances.The story is quite entertaining. Screenwriters invest the script with a healthy portion of Romeo and Juliet's dialogue and Shakespeare's sonnets that only make the movie more amusing. The story of Romeo and Juliet is familiar to us all, and the movie parallels the story in surprising and charming ways.The most ingenious aspect of the movie is how elements of Shakespeare's plays have become so ingrained in our movies, television, and theater, even though they were cliches in Shakespeare's time.  This movie actually manages to breathe life into all the old cliches thanks to a wonderful exuberance and a fantastic cast.An intelligent movie that actually rewards the audience for knowing something about Shakespeare, Shakespeare In Love is a treat from start to finish.

Close to perfection!,"Marc Norman is credited as a co-author of this screenplay, but it feels like Tom Stoppard's worki.e. it's rich, astonishingly rich, with at least four different interacting levels all going on at the same time.#1: Most ostensibly, it's a romanticized biography of the early turning point in Shakespeare's careerthe writing of his first indisputably great play (Romeo and Juliet), the passing of the theatrical torch from Christopher Marlowe to him, and his joining of the Chamberlain's Men, which cost him 50 pounds (an enormous figure in those days). Lots of known facts are changed, much is invented, but the overall sense is pretty reasonableand about as accurate as the typical film biography.#2: It's a delightful fiction about a romance between Will Shakespeare and the wealthy Viola de Lessups, who is engaged to be married to the haughty but impoverished Lord Wessexa romance that inspires him to write Romeo and Juliet, largely because it plays out as a kind of mirror of that very play. Or a pre-mirror, since it isn't written yet. The ball, the balcony, the duel, the suitor, the nurse, the three appearances of the Prince of Verona (i.e. Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth)...it's all there. One of the joys for the audience who knows the play is recognizing all the anticipations embedded in the filmplus a few from other plays (like Banquo's ghost) for good measure.#3: The film delivers in the most persuasive possible way a strong critical reading of the play Romeo and Juliet. It has been observed by many critics that this play begins as a traditional comedy, with all the stock figures and stereotypes, but halfway through (exactly halfway!) with the deaths of Mercutio and Tybalt, it turns into a tragedy, and then systematically reinterprets all the comedic scenes and characters of the first half in this newly tragic light. Stoppard's story of the writing of the play begins with Will, ecstatic with love, finally getting started on the comedy he's been promising his producer...but as the love affair with Viola darkens, his ability to sustain the comic mood disappears. At exactly the halfway point of the film, he wakes next to Viola and announces that ""I found something in my sleep. It's not a comedy I'm writing any more, it's a tragedy!""#4: Finally, this is a tribute to the joys of the theatreto acting, to writing, to producing, to simply hanging around getting enchanted by it all. A central character here is Mr. Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson), who begins as a heartless money-man who looks to the theatre as a possibly lucrative investment, and ends up transformed; to his own surprise, perhaps, he now cares more about something other than about profit. Many of the most delightful parts of the film are part of this fun: the verbal anachronisms (playing the Palace, the show must...go on), and especially the sexual role-reversals (at rehearsals, Juliet is played by a boy dressed as a girl, and Romeo by a girl dressed as a boy). Several central scenes involve quick cuts back and forth between rehearsals and Will and Viola making love...using the same lines, even though Will most of the time says Juliet's and Viola Romeo's.Are there any flaws? Perhaps Paltrow's readings as Romeo are not as compelling as they could have been...and she never really persuades us that she's British, though as Viola she is radiant and passionate. Ben Affleck is also an odd choice for Ned, and he performs ""a plague on both your houses"" rather badly...though he does project great authority and confidence. Joseph Fiennes, who single-handedly energizes the film and is brilliant in a long demanding role, is the real star...and he, Geoffrey Rush, and Colin Firth are all magnificent. What a disgrace that Fiennes wasn't even nominated for a Best Actor Oscar!",10.0,Anonymous,History

One of the best I've seen in quite a while.,"A whimsical, hilarious, tragic story about a forbidden love between a then-common playwright and a beautiful woman with her wealth forcing her to wed another man. It's one of the most sharply written films I've ever seen, that completely draws you in from the first moment where we see Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson) order his men to chop off Philip Henslowe's (Geoffrey Rush) nose and ear to the very end as Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) walk up the beach.The film centers around the young Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) who is desperately trying to sell his work in order to keep on living. As him and theater owner Henslowe are auditioning for the lead in his new play, he meets a young boy whom he thinks is perfect for the part. The boy runs away after realizing that it's Shakespeare, and Will follows him to his home where he meets Viola (who he later finds out was disguised as the young boy due to her love of theater). And thus begins this beautiful romance between two lovers who are torn apart by status and society.This story has it's share of hilarious moments mixed with absolutely tragic ones, but never manages to drag or stop being one of the most compelling pictures I've ever seen. I also really love all of the subtle references to rumors regarding Shakespeare and the allusions to his other plays that occur throughout the film. The performances are all glorious and the technical aspects (the costume design, set decoration and score in particular) are easily among the best of the decade.

Not bad but too swashbuckling near the end to be credible,"Well-crafted film with plenty of scenic verisimilitude and historical references, such as to stagecraft and theatrical customs of the time. Well-written script, and easy-to-take morsels of Shakespeare for the uninitiated.  Judy Dench, who got the best lines (and an Oscar) didn't look the least bit like Queen Elizabeth, however.  And Joseph Fiennes was miscast: long narrow face and too much the Hollywood or Pinewood male screen idol of the 20th century.  And it's quite incredible that Shakespeare, an actor and writer, would take on an experienced soldier in mortal combat, and even less credible that he would fight him off.

Passionate Love Story Within Dreamlike Inspiration,"Have you ever thought of a well known story in terms of some novelties? So to say, can the content of a movie still leave a contemporary viewer breathless? Indeed, in our age of consumption and shallow effects, it seems that true commitment to the essence of what art is supposed to be is faded. We rarely encounter any freshness in such themes like love and romance, the themes well known in cinema but frequently considered as 'prefabricated,' and, consequently, distorted, deprived of their essential vitality. A very justifiable question arises: are there still films that can really move us? If there are some, is ""Shakespeare in Love"" one of them?At first, it seems that the content of this movie is rather common and predictable. It shows, in a fictitious manner, the inspiration that Shakespeare might have had during writing one of his timeless love dramas. The suggestion goes on logically as the movie calls our attention to the creative experience of love that touches the mind and heart of the playwright to write one of the most beautiful love stories, ""Romeo and Juliet"". That is the crucial link between this movie and the great masterpiece since Shakespeare is showed as the one who goes through similar love that Romeo did go through. But is this movie only a romance, a love story that raises a hero and a heroine to the very heights of blissful feelings?The movie by John Madden is, foremost, a tribute to the artistic inspiration that brings back the very essence of a story on screen. It is filled with profound experience of images, scenery, music and performances. Therefore, firstly, it is a lovely movie with all its merits as a manifestation of art, and, secondly, an innovative representation of love, similarly to Shakespeare's drama that occurs to win the people, both Queen Elizabeth and her faithful subjects, as new and touching.Romeo and Juliet...their dramatic, short but blissful lives are now Will (Joseph Fiennes) and Viola's (Gwyneth Paltrow) short, blissful experiences. The two give sublime performances. They are (...and it is significant to mention that here) romantically subtle and erotically sensual. Their love appears to combine the two depictions of love, or more specifically, the two aspects of love focused on: the one of Shakespeare's works and the one of modern cinema. Therefore, what we get here is a harmony between sweet youthful feeling and strong erotic desire. One cannot go without the other in order not to limit the whole merely to 'characters in bliss' or 'characters in lust.' That would, of course, condense the whole picture to mere sentimentalism or sheer eroticism. The both aspects must complement each other in order to be genuine and satisfy the ambitious movie buffs. Moreover, reference is the building block of inspiration: Juliet's balcony appears to be Viola's balcony, the proud Capulets appears to be upright Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), death appears to be a conventional separation. Yet all the differences are united by the very feeling of love beautifully depicted by Ms Paltrow and Mr Fiennes.Except for the main characters, we have a wide range of different people, different personalities: the proud, the rich, the noble, the poor, the curious, the wretched; finally, the gentle and creative. Witty scenes with curious and over-caring Nurse (Imelda Staunton) who sits at the door the whole night outside the room where Will and Viola are making love are hilarious. The character of proud and rich Lord Wessex is memorably portrayed by Colin Firth who stresses one of the key poisons of human pride: selfishness. The character of John Webster (Joe Roberts) is interesting, too: it calls our attention to the young boy, partly lost in the world's glamor, who finds his entire interest and enthusiasm in brutality... Can a person totally deprived of feelings ever understand what love is? The supporting cast are also very good and in no way shadowed. They rather add their own parts into the complex realities and diverse paths of life in which a true feeling is born. Shakespeare had to have audience, contemporary people who are memorably showed here.Yes, ""Shakespeare in Love"" may be considered one of the movies that still move us. I don't hesitate to claim that this film is as powerful as ""Romeo and Juliet"" must have been for its first audience since what may be more inspiring, more touching, more creative than honest feeling that illumines the lives of a young couple? What matters is not its fiction, its play but its powerful enthusiasm inspired by honest Love that will never age, nor fade, nor die.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Really considering all the elements this time around I felt the story/screenplay was just slightly above average and not as witty or comical as first thought. I now think the real reason this film was so well awarded was in large part because of the cast. They all do a fine job not just of bringing their characters to life, but in elevating the script to a degree that a lesser cast could not have.

Perfect Romantic Comedy,"This is the perfect example of an exceptionally well-crafted film in every respect. The direction is light and sweepingly romantic. The various visual departments-costumes, art direction, cinematography-are gorgeous and distinctive. The light soft glow of the cinematography is especially pleasing. The score is dynamic and enriches the emotions of the story. It is a shockingly well rounded film.There are two things that are truly exceptional. First, the script is an endlessly clever piece of writing. The more you look at it the more you see in it. I always pick up on a new facet and/or joke when I re-watch the film. This time I noticed that as the Comedy of Romeo and Ethel transmutes into the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet Shakespeare in Love has transmutes from a farce into a dramedy. The script is a loving homage to the Bard and many of his common plot devices are deployed with wit and vigor. Play with a play, mistaken identity, crossdressing, a twist a fate etc. all get referenced and used to in delightful ways. The script is just perfect and has more layers to it than people give it credit for.Likewise, the acting is uniformly excellent. Affleck is the perfect ham. Fiennes is sexy, sensuous and a great Shakespeare. Rush gives a great turn as a early fast talking producer. But the real standout is Paltrow. She is utterly believable as the muse that inspires Romeo and Juliet while being funny, authentic. There is an otherworldly quality to her that fits the story; the film would have collapsed on itself without this magical turn.This is the exemplar of what Best Pictures should be.

Cate Blanchett was more deserving of the Oscar too, her role was a harder one to pull off. Paltrow did not do or say anything spectacular in this one, not anything Oscar-worthy mind you. All she did was have sex with Shakespeare. But the costumes are incredible and Judi Dench is wonderful in her 8 minutes on-screen. Geoffrey Rush is also funny as well.

too bad the highest score I can give is 10,"So many others (both here and in external reviews) have extolled the virtues of this film that there's not much I can add.  Romeo and Juliet was always something I found pleasant, but so much work to really understand (the language, the puns, the lack of stage directions...).  This movie brought Shakespeare to life in ways I never thought possible.  I had tears in my eyes when I realized how much the movie would parallel the play.  But because it's not the same as the play, familiarity with Romeo and Juliet doesn't ""ruin the movie"" for you, it makes it even better.  The writers did a wonderful job of playing off the audience's familiarity with the play to throw in some surprises.  Even if you can predict everything that happens at the end, the movie is done so well that you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"An overrated, but charming, bit of fluff","An overrated, but charming, bit of fluff; as is true in many minor movies, the atmospherics are better than the main plot.  One gets a real feel for what it was probably like in Elizabethan England to be an impecunious player.  The jokes are amusing, but much too arch; the story is the sort of thing that one expects from Harvard or Oxbridge undergraduates.  The minor characters are far better etched than the stars.

"Undeserving of ""Best Picture"" award","How this movie beat out the likes of ""Life is Beautiful"" to win the Best Picture academy award is baffling.  It has its moments, but this thing is FAR too long.  45 minutes of this movie is continuous recitation of the characters' lines in the play.  ""Titanic"" was the most overrated movie of all time, but this is pretty close.  Gwyneth Paltrow was superb and may actually deserve her Best Actress award.  Rupert Everett (Christopher Marlowe) was fantastic as well and probably would have performed the role of Will much better than Fiennes' minimal attempt.  The scenery gets a good grade too, but there's nothing else in this movie that deserves a decent comment.  It may have deserved a Best Picture nomination because the year gave us such a poor collection of decent shows, but it definitely did not deserve to beat out ""Life is Beautiful"".

Wonderful,"When I give reviews on films or when I tell family or friends about films, I like to go into detail of why I liked each character, the writing, the actors' performance, etc...With ""Shakespeare in Love"", I can't do that here.  Why?  Because I would ramble and go on typing forever.  This is, to put it simply, an outstanding film.  Sure, there are aspects of the historical time that didn't jive, but this film was meant to entertain, not to give us a history lesson.I have read the many works of Shakespeare, and in particular I have read and re-read and re-read Romeo and Juliet.  Still, in the closing minutes of ""Shakespeare in Love"" I still found myself starting to shed a tear.

A weak comedy,"This is definitely not a film for all tastes.  ""Shakespeare in Love"" is a one joke comedy clearly aimed at self satisfied intellectuals of a literary bent.  In my opinion, it is neither terribly romantic nor terribly funny suffering as it does from sitcom style performances from its two leads; Joseph Finnes (looking very much like a Japanese animation character) and Gwyneth Paltrow (one of the most uninteresting actresses in Hollywood).The one joke (a sophmoric conceit from Tom Stoppard) is to apply all the modern theater's cliche's (greedy theater producers, conceited actors, etc.) to Shakespeare's time.  The ""romance"" (Shakespeare finds his ""muse"" and the love of his life as he struggles to complete ""Romeo and Juliet"") is on a par with most paperback romance novels and consists mostly of Finnes and Paltrow gazing idiotically at one another.  The most satisfying moments are from the short excerpts from ""Romeo and Juliet"" but  Finnes and Paltrow play them so badly (and they are so poorly directed) that any real emotion is lost. One would be foolish to expect any accuracy in the recreation of Shakespeare's life and times (the authors of this triviality are far too self interested for that) but it is distressing to see Shakespeare reduced to a sitcom character in a second rate television show.  Pseudointellectual and neither charming nor funny, ""Shakespeare in Love"" was a total waste of my time.",1.0,Anonymous,History
One of the very best movies,"There are several ingredients to a great movie: plot, character, dialogue, certainly. Settings and photography, not far behind. Performances which relate, directly, to the script, and enhance it, which generally means actors of some sensitivity who are either browbeaten into submission by a director or who actually respect the script enough to want to perform it, rather than use it as a vehicle to enhance their own egos.SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE satisfies every condition. Indeed, it trumps them, by accepting and meeting the challenge of creating an almost totally fictional story in and around the life and work of the greatest and, hence, most intimidating dramatist of the English language. To create a great costume drama is worthy enough, in itself. To do so while honoring Shakespeare in his own terms, indeed, in, perhaps, rekindling the recently waning fire at his altar, is to reach heights rarely achieved in three quarters of a century of talking motion pictures.This is a film which shines in virtually every aspect. It's wonderfully cast. Not a performance rings but true. Gwenyth Paltrow, the most notable of the few Americans in the mostly English cast, gives a fine, nuanced performance as the mythical mistress of a mythical version of Shakespeare, notable both for itself, and because so many American attempts to do period English roles seem to fall flat. Joseph Fiennes, in the title role, is barely less entertaining. And, the strength of the script is such that his limitations, notably, a markedly theatrical take on his role, are appropriate in context, where they might seem odd in a more conventional role. His expressions, alone, are priceless, especially his tortured and/or challenged poet look, an impassioned combination of outrage, astonishment, and constipation.The casting, large roles and small, is excellent, and if it does run a trifle to stereotype, it's entirely in keeping with the context, as the drama of the age ran to stereotype, as well. Classics, after all, deal with eternal truths and there are only so many ways for people to act. One of the reasons Shakespeare holds up over four hundred years is because so many of his characters are recognizable, even in radically different times and places.The film's greatest strength, though, is it's script. Is there another scenarist alive who was better suited to this, specific sort of effort than Tom Stoppard, whose early prominence was in no small measure based on his ROSENCRANCE AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD, a play set behind and among the scenes of HAMLET? In an age when strong, classically based writing has fallen so far out of style as to be a rare curiosity, it's splendid to see work which is not merely ""informed"" by the works of Shakespeare, but which revel in them, and the history of that age, and which play with the canon like a singer descanting on a great melody.Make no mistake, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is, above all, a writer's script. It looks like a work about the theater - itself, a hallowed tradition in movies - but it's really a script about writing and writers and the process of creation, in all it's dirty, shameless, improvised glory. There's more practical description of real writing in this script than in many a graduate program. For that reason, as much as to pick up the delicious satires on various bits and pieces of Shakespeare's best known lines, this is a movie which bears rewatching. Stoppard has both the language and, even, the rhythms perfectly. When's the last time you listened to dialogue which sang, as good Elizebethan drama, which was written as poetry, or quasi-poetry, sang?This movie, incidentally, works beautifully as the first of a double feature with the Trevor Nunn/Imogen Stubbs/Ben Kingsley version of TWELFTH NIGHT, a work whose creation figures in the conclusion of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.",,Anonymous,History
Good -- but a disappointment,"First of all - the movie is good. It is not so good, however, that it deserved an Oscar. A case of lobbyism, I presume. The plot is quite fascinating and I am impressed by the writer. But it seems like there is still something missing in the movie. It is rather tiresome sometimes, and there are no really hilarious scenes. And why did Will and Viola 'get their kits off' so soon? That was a disappointment.As for the acting, Ben Affleck was great in his small part which came as a bit of a surprise for me. Joseph Fiennes has charisma, but I believe Affleck would have been better cast as Shakespeare. Judi Dench is of course great, not to mention Geoffrey Rush and Colin Firth. The real disappointment was Gwyneth Paltrow. It is a shame that she was in the movie at all, she basically destroyed it for me.I *did* like it though and give it: 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Deserving of every award received.,"As a Shakespeare-o-phile I was blown away by the wit, imagination, humour, the literate script and the outstanding acting, costume and directing that sparkles throughout this film masterpiece. I can easily see why audiences unfamiliar with Shakespeares biography, his works and the everyday reality of Elizabethean life and the theatre would not be especially impressed. After all, while they did watch all the film, they really missed about half the movie. It would be like reading Giulliver's Travels as just a voyage adventure without noticing the fact that it's true genius and meaning lies on other levels entirely. There are many, many instances in the film where dialogue or events would seem to be straight forward but in fact allude to other known facts or persons; and therein lies the real humour and appreciation from what is in effect a continuing series of, ""double entendres"". What especially impressed me was the way in which the love story between Will and Viola is played out using many of the actual lines from Romeo and Juliet and with John Madden, the director, seamlessly transitioning the scenes from the bedroom to the stage and back again. I've never seen that device used in a film before with such effect! Deserving of every award it received and made it's main competition at the Oscar's that year, Saving Private Ryan, look like what it really was: a powerfully effective 15 minutes at the front end followed by an unimaginative and franky unbelievable John Wayne type flag waver from there on to the finish line.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A fictional story about the making of Romeo And Juliet.,"A story about young playwright Will Shakespeare, who after years of works creates a masterpiece: Romeo And Juliet. A love story that makes his name remembered. The idea is brilliant, but the result is something entirely different. The movie focuses all too much on Romeo And Juliet, maybe because a couple of years back the new version of the play was released and gained huge respect among people everywhere. This was the most critical mistake the movie crew made. The brilliant idea for a movie was spoiled by excessive Romeo And Juliet- scenes, because now anyone who has seen Romeo And Juliet has really nothing to see in Shakespeare In Love. The sentence ""Additional dialogue by William Shakespeare"" in the movie credits should have been replaced with ""Dialogue mainly by William Shakespeare"". The main theme in the movie is the making of Shakespeare's Romeo And Juliet, and the secondary theme is a regular predictable love story between Shakespeare's and actress Viola De Lesseps. This movie has nothing special to offer, and is not even all that amusing (as a comedy is expected to be). The fact that this totally common movie, with a plot exactly like all comedy flavored love stories through history won the Oscar for the best movie, is beyond my understanding. Gwyneth Palthrow's performance is not bad at all, but hardly worth an Oscar, either. The only bright spot in the movie is Shakespeare's brilliant dialogue, and that proves the lack of imagination by the writers.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Without a doubt, the best film of 1998!","""Shakespeare in Love"" is truly genius! The symbolism of the language and events, the beauty of the costumes, sets, and scenery (not to mention Gwyneth Paltrow) is absolutely amazing. ""Shakespeare in Love,"" for lack of better words, is a fulfilling -- even profound -- experience. The language is advanced, but it flows wonderfully. If you were to shut your eyes and only listen to the words of the actors, you could ""see"" just as vividly as if you were to have your eyes glued to the screen (and trust me -- your eyes ARE glued to the screen).The love scenes are very tasteful, and even though there is partial nudity, the scenes retain their artistic value. I feel very strongly that this film will win the Oscar for Best Picture. ""Saving Private Ryan"" WAS a good film, based on real events (which are easily duplicated), and its emotions came from WITHIN the viewer, whether thinking of personal memories or memories of someone they know. It took imagination and talent to make the fictional events in ""Shakespeare in Love"" (though BASED on truth) into something so moving and so real.I respect a movie a lot more when it MAKES me belive, rather than ALLOWING me to believe. I hope that makes sense, but I really can't think of another way to say it. ""Saving Private Ryan"" was, in a way, an informative documentary about the horrors of war. ""Shakespeare in Love,"" on the other hand, drew me in and MADE me believe in it. My heart aches for a love like that. We should all be so lucky.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Run, William, Run !","An entertaining, ultimately shallow, yet well-meaning film, whose numerous verbal anachronisms can be forgiven for its sheer sense of fun. Joseph Fiennes makes for a goofy, doe-eyed Bard, and Paltrow (as his Muse) seems to fit the Elizabethan period well, although aside from her fashionable looks, Gwyneth's acting has little to recommend itself for.Most of all, the screenplay deals with the world of Theatre, the whole writing/production/staging process, here presented in a freespirited manner that at times rings true, but again, is all too superficial. Obvious visual inconsistencies irritate the eye (notably the mysterious accommodation of Paltrow's sumptuous hair under her tiny boyish disguise-wig ),but not enough to ruin the whole show. Perhaps the movie's biggest saving grace is that it rarely slows down, aside from the obligatory love scenes. Of course, the sex here is overdone and glossed over almost unbearably, but not as bad as in most mainstream genre pieces. If anything, it demonstrates that Miramax is truly no longer an ""indie"" studio: it has fully accepted all of Hollywood's conventions and restraints.Also, SIL is notable for the second portrayal of Elizabeth I in '98: (this time around she's in her waning years ), probably in her best known context: exuding royal patronage on Shakespeare; a brief, yet definitive performance by Dench, fresh from playing Victoria in '97.",6.0,Anonymous,History

I would love to see all the players from this movie do Romeo and Juliet the way they did in this movie.  I have never before seen anyone speak the lines from any Shakespeare play in a way which conveys the feeling of them, as opposed to the meaning of them.

Why bother comparing it to any other film?  It's great on its own right.,"Lots of people don't like John Madden's ""Shakespeare in Love,"" I think, mostly because it beat out Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" for the Best Picture Oscar.  But I'm not going to talk about that.  Why?  I'm not going to change anybody's mind, that much is obvious.Well, if you want my opinion, ""Shakespeare in Love"" is a superb motion picture.  It is, from every standpoint, a flawless piece of craftmanship. For starters, there is the acting, which is simply top-notch.  This is clearly Gwyneth Paltrow's breakthrough performance, in which she truly delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.  Her character is rich, vibrant, and wondrously alive.  As is Joseph Fiennes' take on Shakespeare.  Even though the Academy didn't see fit to honor him with even a nomination, that is not to say that his performance is bad by any means.  I predict that Fiennes will become a leading man in his own right, thanks to this film, because it is now completely obvious that he is an actor of great depth and enthusiasm, which is something Hollywood greatly needs today.  And who could forget Judi Dench?  The lady is, I think, simply brilliant.  Give her seven minutes of screen time and she turns out a virtual instruction manual on screen acting. Her take on Queen Elizabeth is witty, smart, daring, outrageous, and yet, deceptively simple, that is, all the things the Virgin Queen was herself. And, of course, there is also Ben Affleck and Geoffrey Rush, among others, whose work here sparkles with originality and vitality.But lets get to the real core of what makes ""Shakespeare in Love"" a great film.  There is John Madden's effortless direction, and, above all, the amazing script by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard.  Seriously, I can imagine people being left in the intellectual dust when they come face to face with this film, because it is what so many films aren't.  It manages to be blazingly intelligent, romantic, exciting, funny, serious, light, profound, historical, and farcical all at the same time, among other things.  The dialogue crackles with energy and originality, and the writers are clearly playing a sort of mental tennis match with the audience.  In the end, both sides win, and it is a glorious victory.**** out of ****.",,Anonymous,History

Tom Wilkinson and Geofrey Rush's characters come off as complete idiots, who could have been stripped from the movie without it changing.

The magic of the bard lives on,"I confess to perhaps giving the film a rating which it didn't quite deserve, but that's because I have a weakness for literature in general and Shakespeare in particular, and the wonderful sonnets, couplets and other verses that this film is full off probably meant that this film gets an 8 when it would have gotten a 6 or a 7.This movie was the surprise hit of 1998, even going as far to win an Oscar nomination for the director John Madden. The movie depicts a young Shakespeare lacking inspiration and suffering from writers block, who's told that love will restore his gift. He then meets Viola De Lesseps, a lady of much higher social standings, who has a love for poetry and a disdain for the so-called nobility. The two are instantly attracted to each other and a love affair blossoms. Shakespeare meanwhile, get's inspiration and begins writing Romeo and Juliet. However, the conservative society of Britain in the 15th century is such that much like the play, Romeo and Juliet have little hope of being together.The best part about the movie are the performances. Joseph Fiennes shows that the gift of acting is not just bestowed upon his more illustrious brother Ralph, he too has a significant share . His passion and energy seem to transmit to the entire screen. Gwyneth Paltrow was nominated for an Oscar for breathing life into Viola De Lesseps. She beautifully portrays the lovestruck lady's passions and emotions. The chemistry between the two leads is intense. The other cast members do an admirable job of supporting them, particularly Geoffery Rush whose screen presence, as usual, adds to the allure of the movie, even if he has little to do.

It doesn't get any better,"Whenever I'm feeling a bit down (my recent 50th birthday comes to mind) I make a pot of tea and pop this film into the DVD.  From start to finish, this movie is a delight.  It has humor, pathos, good jokes, a love story or two, competent acting, and a bit with a dog. There is a sense that you are actually witnessing the creation of modern playwriting (which is what Romeo and Juliet was) and intruding on the very private lives of those who made it happen.  Fiennes is marvelous as Will Shakespeare, giving the myth some substance; he wasn't always revered and honored as he is today.  Paltrow is perfect as Viola. (I simply cannot even imagine Julia Roberts in this part. I'm truly glad the financing fell through when it did.)  But it is the supporting cast that tweaks this film into the piece of art that it is. Imelda Staunton has long been one of my favorites and she shines as the Nurse who allows Viola to discover who she really is.  Geoffrey Rush steals every scene he appears in (and I often use his line ""It's a mystery"" when explaining the world to my film students). Tom Wilkinson's transformation from crass businessman to a lover of the theater is not only touching, but so well acted that you almost don't notice how great that transformation is. And Ben Afleck out ""Callowing"" Simon Callow is both fun to watch and compare.Editing, direction, art direction, music, actors, and top-notch writing all come together to form a film that is much greater than the sum of its parts.

In fact, one of the producers of the film has gone on record as saying how boring he found Shakespeare's plays as a student.  Perhaps that's why, in his own film, he turned the greatest playwright in history into a sit-com character.

Exeunt Educated,"You can't help wondering how Shakespeare managed it.  In 26 years he produced 37 plays, three epic poems, and all those sonnets, on top of which he was an actor and prosperous businessman.  I would be hard put to type everything he wrote in those years using a quill pen and pot of ink.  The haste sometimes shows.  His plots are often weak and derivative and suffer excessively from what Ebert calls the idiot plot syndrome, in which characters do the stupidest things just to keep the story hopping.  When King Lear asks his daughters how much they love him, Cordelia's one-sentence answer is misunderstood and sets the whole tragedy in motion, though the problem could be solved with a few additional words.  Whole chunks of dialogue in Julius Caeser are shamelessly ripped off from Plutarch.  But the poetry is a different matter, resonant, finely constructed, and sometimes ethereal.  Well, this movie is, in short, the story of how WS came to write Romeo and Juliet, chiefly it seems by integrating bits of his personal life into the mosaic of the play.  He overhears someone on the street yelling, ""A plague on both your houses,"" and so on.  And the movie is filled with amusing anachronistic expressions.  Actors say ""break a leg"" to one another, and they say things like ""boobies"" and ""dip your wick"" and ""we'll be put in the clink.""  It's not jarring because none of this fairy tale is supposed to be realistic.Basically there are two ways a movie about a period classic can go.  (1) There is the elegant way.  Everyone wears immaculate clothes and speaks a sort of perfumed English; vide Olivier.  (2)  There is the dirty way, the route this movie takes, in which characters may be sweaty and vulgar, get into slapstick brawls in the mud, use barely interpretable dialects, and bump into things.  The actors here do a nice job along their naturalistic way.  The dialogue is written in such a way as to suggest the author just finished reading the bard's collected works in one sitting.  WS is clean cut and handsome, though he has inky fingernails.  Paltrow, as Viola, uses an irreproachable English accent and impresses with her lanky body and her sharply boned, slightly asymmetrical face, although she too must brush her teeth and spit.  One also looks forward to the appearance of even the most minor supporting players.  And Judy Dench as QE I is a standout, coiffed like an escapee from Coppola's Dracula.If there is a problem it's that it helps to understand the film if you are a fan of Shakespeare.  I don't mean that you necessarily like the film more, just that you understand it better.  Then you know why Marlowe is such a pain as far as WS is concerned, and why Burbage makes such a stir when he enters the theater for the first time, and why the rival theatrical troupes enact so realistically the Donnybrook between the Capulet and the Montague boys.  I could tell there were a lot of allusions that were getting past me. No matter.  There is verisimilitude enough that you finish viewing the film a more educated person than before.What a place Elizabethan London must have been if you could somehow set aside the plague, the smallpox, the outhouses, the poverty and starvation and odor and other such quibbles.  Along these streets, at the same time, strode people like Queen Elizabeth, Condell, Burbage, Thomas Kyd, Marlowe, Sir Francis Drake, Frobisher -- every English-speaking person who was anybody at the time, it seems.  This film, a mixture of fact and plausible fantasy, is pretty enjoyable.",,Anonymous,History
"Nice movie, poor story","Well of course I know that John Madden never intended to give us any accurate true episode of Shakespeare's life. But it reveals lack of imagination to base the plot of ""Romeo and Juliet"" on a totally invented love that would (could?) have happened between the playwright and a lady promised as a bride to a lord. But if you just forget this detail the movie is agreeable to watch, being a half-comedy and a half-tragedy. The best moments of the movie are the parts where the real play is performed since ""Romeo and Juliet"" keeps being the best and most beautiful love story ever written not matched at all by the love story narrated in the movie. One word of praise to Gwyneth Paltrow, her shining beauty and her splendid performance. Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth acts also her part very well. But Joseph Fiennes is almost totally displaced as Shakespeare. Just only a goody-goody movie after all.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"whether or not you like Shakespeare, this is just simply fantastic","This has been a film i have wanted to see on and off for some time, and today i finally got a chance to watch it! Though I had waited some time to see this film, my expectations of it weren't extremely high; i expected it to be a light hearted romantic comedy, however i was very, very impressed. The performances were excellent, both Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Afflecks English accents were flawless, as were everyone's performances, and they really brought Romeo and Juliet to life. i thought it was cleverly directed, and well thought through, resulting in maximum laughs and also maximum tears. Though this is essentially a romantic comedy, it is genuinely touching, and has some truly tear jerking moments. I was expecting to enjoy watching this film once, and then not miss it if i never saw it again, however i will definitely be keeping hold of this one, as i know I will want to see it many more times. I myself am not a particular fan of Shakespeare, or anything set before the nineteenth century really, but this blew me away, and i am proud to have seen it. whether or not you like Shakespeare, this film is just plain brilliant, and will leave with a big sad smile on your face, and maybe even a couple of wet eyes. genius.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Way too over-rated.,"When this movie came out, I didn't think much of it.  I thought it was just some romantic comedy trying to do its best at the box-office.  But then it got those thirteen nominations at the Oscars and I started to believe it was pretty good and when I saw Paltrow got a nomination for best actress, I knew she would win.  However, I was surprised it beat Saving private Ryan for best picture.  Recently, I purchased the movie on DVD and was very disappointed by it.  I can't say that, besides Judi Dench who won her Oscar for best supporting actress, it deserved its Oscars for best picture and best actress.  It really didn't and Paltrow wasn't that stunning.The movie takes place in 1593.  There were two theatres at that time who were in big competition.  One of these was run by a man named Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush in a superb role).  Now at that period in time, women were not allowed to play in plays.  However, Viola De Lessips (Paltrow), the daughter of a rich man, is in love with plays, especially Shakespeare's (Joseph Fiennes) plays.  She is so desperate to act in a play that she finally uses an alias, puts on a mustache, a wig and auditions for the part of Romeo in Shakespeare's new play, Romeo and Ethel which eventually turns out to be Romeo and Juliet.  But Viola has been engaged by her father to another rich man called Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) whom she doesn't love at all.  Naturally, she is in love with Shakespeare and the problems begin.Joseph Fiennes was over-looked at the Oscars.  I think that instead of giving Paltrow nomination and the Oscar, they should have given the nomination to Fiennes and the best actress Oscar to Cate Blanchett for her role in ""Elizabeth"".  One of the reasons Paltrow won is probably because she is naked quite often in the movie.  Of course this is a good movie, but it was definitely not the best picture of the year.  Proof is, it isn't the best 1998 movie on our top 250 films list.  Judi Dench's and Geoffrey Rush's performances are, however, exceptional.  So, once again, this is not a terrible movie but it is not the best movie of 1998 either.",7.0,Anonymous,History

One of those Best Picture winners that just doesn't hold up.,"Well, it's been almost 20 years since this film won Best Picture, and I happened to catch it on TV. I was about 11 when this film came out, so I'd never seen it.Now, having seen it, I have to say it's cute but that's about it. I don't see the huge appeal of it, aside from the costumes and Judi Dench being in the film for about 10 minutes. It's not a film that I'll remember, and certainly (IMO) not worthy of a Best Picture Oscar, especially over films made at the same time like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" which is a film that I will always remember seeing because it made such an impression. This, sadly, did not make much of an impression and I can see why people say it didn't deserve the big prize.I also don't get the Best Actress Oscar for Gwyneth Paltrow. Personally, I've always found her too pretentious to be appealing on screen, but I'll admit she is talented. As for Best Actress... nah. There are about 100 other actresses who could have played the role just as well, so I can't watch this and say, ""Oh wow, this is such a great part for her. What a performance!"" Neither her nor the film are memorable, and I'd imagine she was given the award more so for being popular at the time, and not based on the strength of her actual performance.I've seen ""Elizabeth"" which was released the same year, and I think the very talented Cate Blanchett deserved the Oscar so much more than Paltrow. Then again, Blanchett has won two Oscars since this film and Paltrow's career declined not long after her win, so obviously we don't need to really debate who the better actor is.I'd say watch this film, and then decide for yourself what should have won the Oscar. Then watch ""Saving Private Ryan"" and see which you remember.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Not a Shakespeare Fan but I Loved This!,"Young playwright William Shakespeare struggles with his latest work ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter"". A great fan of Shakespeare's plays is young, wealthy Viola who is about to be married to the cold-hearted Lord Wessex, but constantly dreams of becoming an actress. Women were not allowed to act on stage at that time (female roles were played by men, too), but dressed up as a boy, Viola successfully auditions for the part of Romeo. Soon she and William are caught in a forbidden romance that provides rich inspiration for his play.This film is very fictional. Perhaps you might already know that (I just wanted to point that out). You know I hated the play ""Romeo and Juliet"" but I thought I'd give this movie a chance, since, it's not a play. Instead, I was wrong. This movie is largely based on Romeo and Juliet, which I've already seen two different versions of it already.Well, I didn't mind seeing a new version of that play. In fact, I actually liked it for the first time because William's events that happened in his life actually inspired his plays! In my opinion, that's just awesome! The costume designs in this film is great, as you can expect from any Shakespeare adaption, and the production design is also great.If you've read or seen the play Romeo and Juliet, you might have a very fun time in this movie like I did because you know what happens before anyone else does! I liked the acting by Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow, which both have great chemistry (not to mention this is Paltrow's first film in which I saw her breasts, not to be perverish or anything).I wasn't a Shakespeare fan, but now, I truly like his work after seeing this fictional film.

"""Strangely enough, it all turns out well. How? I don't know. It's a mystery.""","This much-maligned best picture winner really turned out to be quite good. I mean, there's no doubt there were many films in 1998 that were more worthy to win the award than this, but this by no means should have made people prejudiced against this film.Anyway, what really strikes me about this film is how it brilliantly and wittily retold Romeo and Juliet within the story of the film, blending the play with an original fictional story that Shakespeare, as it's obvious, is its protagonist. The more the plot unravelled, the more impressed by the genius of the script I became. Moreover, there's a sustained self-awareness here which actually comes from being self-referential: the farcical approach to produce laughter; how the plot's structure feels, in a good way, ""staged""; and so on.However, I can't say that this film worked for me as a ""romance"" film at all. Oddly, the film feels soulless in this aspect in particular. I believe I felt emotional every time lines from the play were narrated more than any time there was a ""romantic"" scene. Also, as much as I really loved the humour in this film as I mentioned above, I think it made the tone slightly uneven when we look at the whole picture. I think this could've been easily avoided by setting an ominous atmosphere early on like the play itself. If anyone doubts this could work in a film as it works in a play, I would say Cameron's Titanic is a sufficient proof this could work, and also pretty well.(8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Very Interesting Story and Some Stellar Acting,","Shakespeare in Love is a great movie with a well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.I had this recorded for quite some time but I was reluctant to watch it,although I was aware it was a Best Picture winner,I thought you would have to be seriously interested in William Shakespeare to enjoy this movie,and that it would require some knowledge of the way they spoke back then,but it really didn't,the story is easy to follow,we get to learn enough about Shakespeare before we get to the main plot,without giving us too much knowledge,and the way the characters speak is easy for a general audience to understand while still being as fashioned old as it can possibly be.The chemistry between Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes was absolutely incredible and without a doubt the movies highlight,the lines they deliver to each other is very passionate and intense,something many actors would get shy and awkward about,but the two of them deliver these lines in pure confidence without any hesitation,and Paltrow definitely deserved the Academy Award for her performance.An interesting tale and some very inspired performances,I would recommend Shakespeare in Love to anyone looking for a good drama or romance.William Shakespeare is struggling with writers block before a woman disguised as an actor becomes his muse.Best Performance: Gwyneth Paltrow",8.0,Anonymous,History

Does not hold up to the test of time.,"I did not want to like this film when I first watched it.  I was a little bitter from the Oscars, feeling that both Private Ryan and Thin Red Line had to be better.  I was surprised to find that although I did indeed like the two previous films better, Shakespeare in Love was a terrific film. It was witty, stylish and had an excellent script.  I could understand how it could have won Best Picture.  Today, I can no longer say that.  Upon repeated viewings, it simply does not remain a great film.The witty reparte is no longer as witty the 2nd, 3rd and 4th viewings. In fact, Geoffrey Rush becomes rather annoying and absolutely unbelievable. Private Ryan and Thin Red Line are excellent each time I watch them because there is true art going on.  Shakespeare is simply an entertaining story that gets old fast.  Saving Private Ryan was clearly robbed of the Best Picture.  Oh well, it will simply join Citizen Kane, Psycho, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Shawshank Redemption and numerous other films that have clearly outlasted the films which beat them out.  Shakespeare in Love is a good film, don't get me wrong(7/10).  Fiennes is terrific and Paltrow is passable.  It simply is not the film Private Ryan is.  I think that was clear in 1998, but it is undeniable in 2001.  If you would like to see real Shakespearian drama, check Branagh's full-length version of Hamlet.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Not even really a Shakespeare adaptation, but that's what's so good about it!","There was quite a bit of understandable controversy over the Best Picture Oscar for 1998, because Shakespeare in Love and Saving Private Ryan were both tremendously good films, and the audience was very divided between the two. There is a definite popular influence on the workings of the Academy Awards (no matter how good a film is, it will never win a Best Picture Oscar unless it is hugely popular like Private Ryan and Shakespeare in Love. This is exactly why Memento never won a Best Picture Oscar), but in this case, I think that the quality of the historical element was one of the things that caused the Academy to sway more toward Shakespeare in Love than Saving Private Ryan. Obviously, both had enormous historical value, but I think that there are some notable differences between the two.First of all, Saving Private Ryan is, for the most part, a presentation of true events that occurred during World War II. It is a spectacular portrayal of true events in American history, and should definitely be recognized for that. The fact that Saving Private Ryan did not win the Oscar does not mean that it is not widely, and correctly, considered to be one of the greatest war films ever made. In my opinion, the Oscar was given to Shakespeare in Love because of the enormous effort that was put into the film's story. Private Ryan had a great fictional story as well, but it is much more complicated to come up with such an elaborate story of something that may have happened in Shakespeare's life, and to tie that story in with what little we know about that life, than it is to create a fictional and touching story that takes place during war times.Shakespeare in Love takes the unfortunately small amount of information that we have about Shakespeare's life and brings it to the screen in an amazingly realistic way. We know that this is all fiction, but the fact that it fits so well with the content of his plays and the society that he lived in makes it magical, because Shakespeare is literally brought to life for everyone to see. We get something brought to the screen that people have wondered about for centuries, so of COURSE it should win the Best Picture Oscar!Granted, from the few portraits that survive, William Shakespeare was probably not nearly as attractive as Joseph Fiennes, but hey, Hollywood had to have its influence somewhere, right? Fiennes delivers a brilliant performance in this staggeringly well-made drama, which provides one of the best period settings ever created on film. When you watch Shakespeare in Love, you're THERE. And we not only get what would be on its own a fabulously developed and interesting story, but also some potential facts that interact with what we know about Shakespeare, such as possible inspirations for some of the characters in his plays, the most important of which is obviously Viola (although Shakespeare's infatuation with her does not exactly match her character in Twelfth Night), as well as some of the content of his plays, like Romeo and Juliet. There is also a brilliant subplot that makes Shakespeare himself the main cause of the rather mysterious death of Christopher Marlowe.One of the main problems with movies these days is that people think that just because you get two great names together (like Spielberg and Hanks), then you have what should automatically be the Best Picture winner for that year. This is a hilariously erroneous way of examining the movies, especially when many of the people who think that way have not seen most of the other contenders for the Best Picture Oscar. Shakespeare in Love may not escape from that prejudice entirely, although I doubt there were many small films that matched it in quality. This is a spectacular drama, it has a remarkable score, brilliant direction, wonderful performances from everyone involved (Judi Dench's earth-quaking performance as Queen Elizabeth should be especially noted), and an ingeniously written script, which explored every element of Shakespeare himself, even going so far as to give him a rather short temper (`God's TEETH am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!'). True, we can't assume that such a great man as Shakespeare didn't have a temper (there are already enough rumors about him, such as the one that when he was writing his plays, he `never blotted a word.'), but quick to anger is not the kind of thing that is generally associated with him.It is rather unfortunate that Shakespeare in Love and Saving Private Ryan came up against each other in the Academy Awards for 1998, because they are both worth a Best Picture Oscar, but since only one can be given out, I think that Shakespeare in Love has the edge on Private Ryan. Just barely, but it does. Shakespeare in Love is a nearly flawless film, and just such minor things like casting a late 1990s teen heartthrob like Matt Damon as Private Ryan (just in case you thought the movie took place anytime other than the summer of 1998) by itself knocked it at least a notch or two below Shakespeare in Love. The direction was spectacular, and Spielberg was rightfully given the Best Director Oscar, but when every element of the two movies are taken into account and compared, Private Ryan just has to stand aside in the Best Picture category. I stand by the Academy's decision, and I hope that, from what I have said about Shakespeare in Love, those rather misled people who think that Best Director and Best Picture automatically go together will begin to understand why that is not at all true.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A seamless integration of witty comedy & romantic drama,"""Shakespeare in Love"" is a truly witty comedy, which integrates seamlessly the romantic & creative travails of young Will S. with the ongoing plot that ""Romeo & Juliet"" started out life as ""Romeo & Ethel the Pirate's Daughter - a Comedie"".  What a refreshingly original premise.Both Gwynneth Paltrow & Jo Fiennes (ie Ralph's brother, whom I now understand is more properly to be pron. as ""Rafe"") work well together, and the romance is engaging without being cloying - accepting the fact that Elizabethan prose was somewhat purple in comparison with today's patois (a noticeable absence of expletives!  Which I'm sure _isn't_ realistic).  The rest of the cast is excellent, even when they are only there for an instant - the great stage Shakespearean actor, Anthony Sher, for e.g.  Geoffrey Rush is hilarious as a bumbling & dangerously debt laden theatre owner; while Dame Judi Dench make a sharp-witted & perspicacious Elizabeth I (scary makeup!); the only person who looks anachronistic is Ben Affleck, his Pommie (English) accent is acceptable, BUT, his square-jawed visage just looks way too modern & _Yank_ for him to be extant in the late 1500s - his teeth are too perfect!  But then, maybe that's me imposing my constructed view from seeing Ben in other flicks.Tom Stoppard's script is light & brilliantly interwoven to the rich material that Shakespeare offers.  I'm sure you'll recall some of Tom's lines after the event, despite the towering offerings from the Bard.Last, the costumes & sets are splendidly periodical - the last right down to the throwing out of the window of the night's ordure: you had to keep your eyes about you in Elizabethan Englande to avoid the joys of such hazards.9/10",6.0,Anonymous,History

This movie is my favorite film of all time.,"The first time I went to see 'Shakespeare in Love,' I went because the commercials on television were hilarious.  So, I went to see it opening day (Christmas), but that isn't extremely special because I see movies on holidays as a rule.  When I left the theatre, I was in love with the film, and the more I thought about the more I loved it.  Later that day, I went to see 'The Prince of Egypt' and 'Stepmom.'  Really bad and decent, respectively.  I thought of them in comparison to 'Shakespeare in Love,' and they got worse and worse and 'Shakespeare in Love' got better and better.And why shouldn't it?  Gwyneth Paltrow turns out an amazing performance especially since she is using an accent, speaking in verse, and playing four parts (Viola, Thomas, Romeo, and Juliet).  She is also phenomenal in the way she can switch from being horridly funny to evoking tears.  Joseph Fiennes no less of an actor than she.  He brings such life to someone seen as a god to many and he is so believable as this writing giant. Geoffery Rush is absolutely hilarious as Mr. Henslowe. I must say that he will make you roll in the aisles.  Then of course there is Judi Dench, who has a meek 8 and a half minutes of screentime but is so awesome that she won Best Supporting Actress.  And last, there is Ben Affleck, who also has a small role as Ned Alleyn (the prima donna of the group), but will make you laugh so hard that you will beg for mercy.  I'm really not kidding, he has the best lines.Now, if performances aren't enough to make you see it, there are the costumes.  Or the music.  The music has to be one of the best scores I've ever heard.  Or there's the fights (yes, there are fights in a Shakespearean film), which are hilarious, tense, and full of suspense.So, if I've been able to laugh at every joke all fourteen (yes, you read it correctly, 14) times that I've seen 'Shakespeare in Love,' I think you'll enjoy it at least once.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Syrupy Sweet,"To be 1998's Film of the Year as judged by the Academy, the movie had to have been good?  Yes, this was an above average film.  The costumery was magnificent.  Gwyneth Paltrow gave a convincing performance as Viola. Judi Dench also put on an excellent performance as the Queen.  The Queen was cruel, perceptive, but highly likeable in the end.My first criticism of the movie was the idea of weaving Viola and Shakespeare's star-crossed romance with the well-known tragedy of Romeo & Juliet.  Perhaps it could have worked with a better script, but in the end the concept did not come off well because there was a clear distinction between the play and their real-life situation.  The storyline felt forced-- and false.  The plot would have been more interesting as simply a romance between Shakespeare, an aspiring playwright, and Viola, an aristocrat.My second criticism of the movie was Ben Affleck's appearance.  Whereas Gywneth and Fiennes became immersed in their characters, Ben Affleck was not able to cross the line.  This was Ben Affleck as Ben Affleck.  His character also had no noteworthy actions in the play that I could discern.  In summary, his appearance was an irritant.An interesting film.  I rank it a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History

The problem of the couple is that Shakespeare is married and that she is to be married to Lord Wessex who owns plantations in America. Eventually, Shakespeare finds out that Thomas Kent is Lady Violet. When the play is almost finished, the ""rat-boy"" sees that Thomas Kent is a woman and tells it the Guard. As women weren't allowed on the stage the theater is closed. Lady Violet has to marry Lord Wessex and on her wedding-day ""Romeo and Juliet"" is performed at concurrent's theater. She flees her husband to watch the play and has to play the Juliet. After the play Lord Wessex tells the audience that she is a women and wants to have everybody arrested but then Queen Elisabeth appears and as she is pleased by the play nobody is arrested at all. Now Lady Violet leaves for America but Shakespeare is still inspired by her. The movie got 7 Oscars and I think the actors' performance has earned that. Joseph Fiennes embodies a young and passionate Shakespeare and Gwyneth Paltrow expresses Lady Violet's love for poetry very vivid and believable. Madden has succeeded to combine biographical facts about Shakespeare with a mainstream-suitable love story and one of the Bard's most famous plays. Even people who are not very interested in Shakespeare or his plays could like this film. It is a Hollywood-adaption of Shakespeare's life. Not very near to the facts but quite amusing.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The script is the star,"This is a fine film that I greatly enjoyed.  I don't think that it deserved to win the Best Picture Oscar, but the Best Screenplay was no contest. Very satisfying in almost every respect, the film's true star is the brilliant screenplay that interweaves Shakespeare's texts with the new story being told.I admit that I am a bit of a purist when it comes to Shakespeare - when I see one of his plays, I want to see it as he wrote it.  I am not generally in favor of cutting or moving scenes, or otherwise adapting the Shakespeare text.  That is not relevant here, however, because this is NOT a Shakespeare play.  It is a modern day fictional tale using Shakespeare as a protagonist. The genius is in the way that Shakespeare's own poetry is worked so perfectly into the script.  The film is good in any case, but if you have an appreciation for Shakespeare it really shines.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The most overrated movie of all times,"This movie is extremely mediocre. As a comedy, it's a complete failure because there's not one joke worth laughing, with it's humor being so incredibly lame and old. As a costume piece, it's very forgettable because the performances are so exaggerated you never really care about any of the characters.And the worst thing about the movie is probably Gwyneth Paltrow, who people think can act well because she can talk in a posh English accent. I've never seen someone so cold and heartless in a romantic film.Like most people have notices the 7 Oscars were ridiculous, it may be an ok movie for a sunday afternoon if you absolutely have nothing better to do, but the film is best avoided, a terrible bore. Mind you, I like period pieces and most of the time I don't even mind if it's a romantic drama or comedy. But this pile of crap is just not worth to be mentioned.People probably liked the title, and their mindless adoration of Shakespeare, who most people don't even read, turned it into an out-of-the-blue Oscar rain. There were tons of better films made in 1998, such as Elizabeth, The Truman Show, American History X, The Big Lebowski, and A Simple Plan!I gave it 1 out of 10 just to try to balance up things.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Review on `Shakespeare in Love' - 1998,"Summer 1953: William Shakespeare, well-known playwright, fails the words. In order to earn some money, Shakespeare promises the two competing theatre-owners of London his new script named `Romeo and Ethel, the pirate's daughter'.  But, as I already mentioned it, he suffers from the so-called writer's block. This complicated situation makes him visit a psychiatrist. Unfortunately, the psychiatrist's treatment turns out to be a waste of time and money.As his rival Marlowe gives him some tips for his new script, William feels humiliated. The playwright's inspiration returns, when Lady Viola, beautiful daughter of a prosperous gentleman, takes part in a casting for `Romeo and Ethel, the pirate's daughter'. Dressed like a man, because women were not allowed to act on stage by order of Queen Elizabeth I, Lady Viola impresses Shakespeare so much, that he decides to follow her, as she escapes the theatre and flees from him. Later on, he invites himself to her father's dance in order to find the one, whose voice has turned his head. In the course of time, they come closer to each other and fall in love. Being in love, William dedicates several sonnets to her and gets back his gift to write.The humorous love story of Shakespeare and Viola changes into a tragedy, just as his script of `Romeo and Ethel, the pirate's daughter', renamed `Romeo and Julia', does. Viola's Father marries her to Lord Wessex, a nobleman who plans to buy land in Virginia to cultivate tobacco. Shakespeare, on the other hand, is married to Anne Hathaway.As a result, the constellation turns the former love story into a tragedy, between William and Viola as well as between Romeo and Julia. Lady Viola has to leave with Lord Wessex.The dialogues are easy to understand; still they contain the poetic language of the past. Joseph Fiennes, playing Shakespeare, does not personify a wise man, philosophizing all day in some backroom, not having any social contacts but a genius, whose life is most chaotic, exciting and driven by his passions. Gwyneth Paltrow, playing Lady Viola, does not correspond with prejudices people have towards the aristocracy. She is not stuck-up and spoilt. Lady Viola's most important desire for her future is to become an actress, a wish that was neither common nor allowed during the 16th century, especially as a member of the British upper class. She lets herself being carried away into adventures without having the feeling of leaving the throne.Considering the throne, Queen Elizabeth I was its holder during Shakespeare's lifetime. Her strong influence on the theatre and in this respect the orders she enacted like the one which forbid women acting, are fantastically realized in `Shakespeare in Love'. Judi Dench expresses the Queen's power in an impressive way, especially by her mimic and movement. Slow but vigorous and sovereign, the Queen behaves and wherever she enters the room, people sag at their knees. For her brilliant acting, Judi Dench achieved the Oscar in the category `Best actress in a supporting role'.The scenery of the film appears very authentic. Reading books about life in Britain during the 16th century, the directors and producers reproduced a quarter of London quite detailed. The streets are covered with dirt and citizens throw excrements out of their windows. The interior decorations are generally kept rather simple, wooden and robust. Torches light up the dark alleys of old London. `Shakespeare in Love' indicates the comeback of Shakespeare in our society. The opinion about his works as being outdated and incomprehensible has gone. The film, awarded with seven Oscars, has made a story of the 16th century become one of the present. Millions of people have seen the film and made it one of the most successful movies of the year 1998. The idea of making a movie about one of the most important playwrights in history is unprecedented and has revived a yellowed legend. Shakespeare is comprehensible again, for people who read his works just as for those who don't. The love story of the protagonists of `Shakespeare in Love', bound up with the love story of `Romeo and Julia' and its creation, arouse the viewer's interest even more. I most liked the last part of the film, the change between Viola and William, loving each other in a physical way on the one hand, and verbal on stage as Romeo and Julia on the other hand. The energy of love, the beauty of the poetic words are only disturbed by the ending, which is not what people would call a `happy' one. In spite of the romance and final tragedy, the acting is neither kitschy nor very exaggerated.",,Anonymous,History
Average,"I liked the in-jokes, Geoffrey Rush and Judi Dench. But I wonder how Joseph Fiennes got near there. He's good at posing, but I don't call it acting. He masters two face expressions and the same number of gestures (one for love scenes and another for 'get-off-my-way' elbowing through the crowd in 'dramatic' moments). I agree with all who say the story's superficial, anomalous and mellow - it is. And after Gwyneth Paltrow, who will be the next Oscar winner? Pamela Anderson? All in all, the film's quite funny, yet average.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Revolutionary,"You remember what Shrek did for animated film? That's what this does for modern period pieces. You go in not knowing what to expect. Expecting some boring rendition of Shakespeare's life. It's so far from that. And boy will you fall in love with Joseph Fiennes. If you didn't know the ""other"" Fiennes - you will now.Without spoiling it - you will see a story within a story centered around one of the most famous Shakespearean works. It is genius. Also the first time I saw Gwyneth playing a brit and she does it amazingly well.And not to be forgotten - the music is enchanting and does what a soundtrack should do - transports you, engages you deeper into the story.Costumes - superb.Geoffrey Rush - superb.Even Ben Affleck playing this type of role - he's awesome. Actually, a stand-out in the film and doesn't have the biggest role. Just so well done. See it. I don't even have anything bad to say about it so I had to give it a 10. Oh and don't forget Julie Dench. Brilliant as usual, even more brilliant than usual.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Much ado about nothing,"Stoppard's script is clever, but that's all. It enjoys its relative wit and dexterity, at the expense of character and empathy: Viola is really rather a dull girl, while the bard comes across like a lost cast member from Four Weddings and a Funeral, the bright-but-scatty Englishman required for American audiences. The one-liners are clangers, the wit is contrived and the pace is at times leaden.The arrival of Rupert Everett on the scene seems to promise an injection of class into the film, but he is killed off, leaving the lightweight Fiennes to pout and ponder through the rest of the romantic comedy/sitcom plot.The froth surrounding the film swept Paltrow to the Oscar, a travesty considering Cate Blanchett's monumental effort as the queen in 'Elizabeth'.The final two minutes of the film were utterly stunning. I felt that Stoppard and his band of doting accolytes had been fired, or else possessed by a creative spirit straight from Will himself. Viola's stately walk up the beach of the strange new world was pure magic, turning the fluff the previous 100 minutes into ""sound and fury, signifying nothing."" A pity that this spirit could not infuse the rest of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Doubts at first, but....","When I heard that Shakespeare in Love recieved the Oscar for Best Picture, I couldn't believe it.  How can something be better than Saving Private Ryan? But seeing that I never saw Shakespeare until just recently, I took it upon myself to find out if Skakespeare was truly better than Ryan.  By the end of the film, I was well assured that the Oscar went to the better film.  I loved Shakespeare. I laughed, I cried, and I found myself giving a little applause at the end.  Who ever did the casting did a superb job.  Not only could these people act in a film, but they could also do Shakespeare (which mind you is not very easy).  Not only was the film excellent but the performances of Romeo and Juliet that appeared throughout the film were the best that I have seen and probably will see.  Sadly, I could only give this film a 10 because the voting scale won't go high enough.  In my opinion the film deserves an 11.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Joy To Watch,"This film won 7 Oscars (including ""Best Picture"") and was nominated for 6 more.With an original script by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, this is a historical imagining of the time in William Shakespeare's (Joseph Fiennes) life when he wrote ""Romeo and Juliet"". His character interacts with others who actually lived during that time period and some fictional characters as well, like Viola (Gwyenth Paltrow), a woman of higher station who comes into Will's life just before her betrothal to a nobleman merchant.The Elizabethan period is recreated gloriously in speech, costume and sets. And the casting is near perfection, including Geoffrey Rush, Judi Dench, Colin Firth and Tom Wilkinson.As the action parallels the story of the hapless literary lovers, Will and Viola create a beautiful story themselves, though they must meet in secret. But this film contains another love story: it reveals a love of theater that transports the viewer to the inner realms of stagecraft and performance. A metaphor for this journey lies in the character arc of Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson), the cold-blooded financier of Will's nascent play, who unexpectedly finds personal meaning---and more---in the creative process.As much as any film I have ever seen, this film convinced me that its actors loved the story they were fashioning. And their sense of joy moved me while I watched.",10.0,Anonymous,History
what a carry on?,"First time I saw this I really didn't like it and was surprised it won so many awards. Seeing it again I enjoyed it a lot more but still have some reservations. I've never seen a film that was so pleased with itself. It tries so hard to please everybody and that makes it really hard to like. The second half is more satisfying than the first which is more like ""Carry On Shakespeare"". Some of the performances are very enjoyable notably Judy Dench, Tom Wilkinson and Geoffrey Rush. The pace of the film seems too hurried but at least you've no time to be bored which is obviously what they were afraid of.

comedy romp through Shakespeare's world,"This daft comedy, written by Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman, focuses on the young Will Shakespeare as he tries to write a new play to please Queen Elizabeth.  He is stuck with a title - Romeo and Ethel - but can't get this play off the ground. Still, all it takes is a real-life woman to give him inspiration.Shakespeare is played by Joseph Fiennes, a weak actor who is probably the most lacklustre performance in this movie.  The lady of his dreams, Viola, is played by Gwyneth Paltrow - very well - while other big names cluttering the cast include Ben Affleck, Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Judi Dench (who won her Oscar for an appearance totalling less than 10 minutes), Antony Sher, Jim Carter, Simon Callow, Martin Clunes and Tom Wilkinson, with Rupert Everett playing Kit Marlowe briefly and memorably.Not a marvellous film, but an entertaining one.  Viola of course eventually inspires the great play 'Twelfth Night' and, it is surmised, kick-starts the greatest creative period in Shakespeare's writing career.  All rot of course, although the story weaved around in this movie is intriguing and in places very funny.  Geoffrey Rush and Antony Sher in particular romp away with the comedy performances.  It's an ok film if you're in the mood.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Colin Firth made for a rather effective baddie, however- you'd end up rooting for him as opposed to the Styrofoam Two mentioned above. The other relief in this appalling piece of trash was an acerbic touch from Judi Dench as Elizabeth I.Revisionist takes on the classics & the lives of those who created them are fine, but this was so unsatisfying.

Shakespeare's demise only matches our own!,"Mmmm........ this movie has an exceptional but short and dramatic performance from Judi Dench. Certainly the script was more worked out than Saving Private Ryan. However this movie falls way short of the inventiveness of La vita E Bella (Life is Beautiful) in every department apart from best female actress which should have gone to Cate in Elizabeth. Though the script of this movie was witty in parts, they are not in the same league of humour that is provided by Roberto in Life is Beautiful. The little boy should have won best supporting actor! Imagine trying to do a plot out of the holocaust which is also a comedy,  far more complex that dry humour. In fact, Shakespeare in Love will probably give the wrong view of the great writer to a much younger generation (as there is no one view of Shakespeare). In addition, this movie shows that propaganda through marketing can win a film company an oscar. The company should have advertised La Vita E Bella, instead of this almost average movie. Name any other movie that can make you laugh and cry at the same time, this movie can't do either - Roberto can do it with ease. The romance (it should be called LUST) elements in Shakespeare in Love were rubbish and modernised to 1990's ideologies with sodomistic sex scenes without purpose, drama and lacking romance (something that Titanic suffered from as well). If you want to know about romance and the human spirit watch Life is Beautiful and understand that romance is about giving it in the good times and the bad and the willingness to stick with one partner.

"Can you say. ""More Funny Than a Spoof by Kelsey Grammar's Own Fraiser""?","There were numerous good movies that were released in 1998; ""What About Bob?"", ""Saving Private Raymond"", ""Ice Age 1"" and ""Bill & Ted's Bogus Trip"" to name a few. However, what made ""Shakespeare in Love"" stand out from the rest of them? When I saw Shakespeare in Love, I nearly busted a nut: it was a breath of fresh air from the usual love stories that we usually see. It stood apart from the others; a pity, alas, because every generation seems to become more distanced from the real poetry. Today, it all seems to have become show & tell, there-you-have-it, reality-TV presentation.Well, to the footage at hand: The legendary Mr. Shakespeare is depicted very well with some human flaws (farting). It is interesting how this early in his career, some events from his later plays found their way into the movie. (Skull from 'Hamlet,' 5.1) (His sorrowful presence at the altar on his knees bears a similarity to Claudius' remorse in 'Hamlet' 3.3) That said, the story flows nicely. King Henry VIII's daughter Elizabeth is depicted rather awesomely. (Especially the way her life enables her to feel an understanding for the object of Shakespeare's adoration.) Christopher Marlowe is shown as the already established writer who offers some assistance to Shakespeare's play still in the writing stage. (SIDE NOTE: Marlowe's ""Two Gentlemen of Rapallo,"" ""King Lear II,"" and ""Massacre At Paris"" are some wonderful plays to peruse.) John Webster was probably not the monster he is portrayed as, but at least his nature kind of hints at the nature of the plays he would write. (His ""Duchess of Malfi"" and ""The Holy Trout"" are bloody, but funny.) Ben Affleck is ribald as the Laurence Olvier of the 21st Century.WARNING: if you are very serious and boring about your comedies and especially if you like parrot humour, fuzzy kittens, and if you like the movie ""Mr.Roger's Teatime jokes"" then DON'T watch this movie. This amount of ribaldry is just too damn much for you...these jokes will just hurt your little head. This movie would have you believe that the Queen would actually sit with the common folk at the Globe Theater!The screenplay for this movie is without a doubt, excellent. To nicely intersperse the story of ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Twelfth Night"" into this movie, was delightful to behold. My favorite kinds of movies are ones that are based on histrionics, legends, and nostalgia. I am a big fan of comedies that have stupid humor and political humor, like Monty Python and Mel Brooks. This movie had plenty of that. There's just something about hearing jokes in the kind of accent they used that makes them so funny. It kept me wanting to watch more, even when the mushy stuff was going on.. Either you simply love the Shakespeare-in-Love-gang and their crazy world-perspective, or you love to hate it. If you're in the first group you'll bust your nuts like I did!Coming to the cast, Gwyneth Paltrow did a wonderful job in her role. She definitely deserved the Oscar for the expressions of abawdery she portrayed when enacting on stage as Thomas Kent, while looking wonderful and acting gracefully as Viola. Joseph Fiennes acted great too as Will Shakespeare, and the chemistry between him and Viola was charming. (Hard to believe Fiennes was reportedly soused for much of the filming. He seems rock-steady!) The rest of the cast equally, such as John Cleese, Judi Dench and Colin Firth did a fine job on their roles. Ben Affleck was OK -- the funny thing is that this guy probably took it in the can at fraternity initiations, but still hates all things homosexual.I have an affliction for period piece spoofs but am of the opinion that they could have shown the amazing Nathan Lane more. Hell. I even think Monty Python should adopt Nathan Lane as an official member!FACTIOD: ""Shakespeare in Love"" is a non-stop laugh-a-thon!. So if you want your spirits lifted, you should watch this masterpiece, as, all in all, there is a zany representation of Elizabethan times, some interesting speculation of historical figures, and some fictional personages as well. So, don't listen to the opinions of some uneducated guy, listen to somebody that KNOWS. Go and BUY this movie, have a little patience at the beginning, 'cause after that, you'll be sure to want to see ""Yellowbeard,"" ""Parrot Sketch Not Included: Twenty Years of Monty Python,"" ""Monty Python's Secret Policeman's Ball,"" and Nathan Lane's (Cliff Marlowe)""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" and ""Monty Python & the Holy Grail in Lego.""There is only one thing I have seen that John Cleese was in that I liked more, ""Starballz.""",10.0,Anonymous,History

A pure delight,"Shakespeare In Love is, in my opinion, one of the best movies of the '90s, and entirely deserving of its awards. While less than serious and certainly less than faithful to history, it is conscious of being a comical take on the myth of Shakespeare's personal life, and scores points for sheer delight in the execution. All the cast is excellent, incl. Ben Affleck.Gwyneth Paltrow, who never struck me as a very interesting actress, rises with this excellent material and delivers the best performance of her career, quite on par with, say, Imogen Stubbs' portrayal of Viola in Trevor Nunn's near-perfect Twelfth Night (1996).Shakespeare In Love is a marvelously clever and literary feel-good movie that can be watched again many times.

A brilliant movie that should never have won Best Picture at the Oscars.,"I had seen 'Saving Private Ryan'. I went into the theatre thinking to myself; ""If this movie beat 'Saving Private Ryan' then it must be incredible!!"". As I watch the movie, I am greeted by some of the best acting I have seen in a movie. A brilliant cast with Judi Dench and Geoffrey Rush as standouts. They really stole the show! (A little more time with them would have been nice.) I liked Gwyneth Paltrow, partly because I am a 16 year-old male, and partly because I have seen her in other movies and I have been a slight fan. The screenplay was incredible! You were really made to think that Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet that way! Directing was great. Not a Spielberg by any means, but still good. The sets, the costumes, the sound everything was there! I had a great time watching it...yet I couldn't help but think afterwards that I had been hoodwinked.I was racking my brains trying to think about the little problem, that minor issue that annoyed me about this movie. I kept thinking to myself; ""What am I on about? It was a great movie, brilliant in all respects. What on Earth is it???"". Then it hit me, and I don't think anybody has picked this up about it. The pace.The movie was almost like a Shakespeare play in itself and Shakespeare plays are meant to be taken at a slow pace so that you can understand what is going on. I felt as if after I watched it I still hadn't seen it. It stopped right at the point it should have started. I suppose I might have to see it another time to satisfy my wants, but I don't think it deserved to win Best Picture at the Oscars over 'Saving Private Ryan'. A great and enchanting movie with a brilliant way of going about it.

Brilliant hypothetical historic story,"This is a absolutely fantastic story about the hypothetical rise of the playwright Will Shakespeare in Elizabethan England.It reminds me of a comedy sketch I saw on an Australian high school English education tv program.. Francis Bacon visits Shakespeare in his cottage and asks what's he doing.  Shakespeare replies he's got this fantastic idea for a new show called The Shakespeare Follies.  ""It's got dancers, one ... no TWO swan boats, a full scale army, and the works.""  Bacon looks across to a table and sees a pile of manuscripts, and asks what they are.  ""Oh, they're some other plays I've been trying to put together.  They don't seem to be working that well.  One's about a Danish prince seeking revenge, another's about an old King having trouble with his daughters.  Another is about a Scottish monarch having encounters with witches.  Stuff like that.  But this, THIS is going to be my magnum opus.  I wonder if we can get some exotic animals on the stage, and two full armies, and ladies in pretty dresses on swings, and...""  Part of me would like to think Shakespeare may have been a LITTLE like this.Joseph Fiennes handles the character excellently, seeming to give him some warmth and personality to what must have been a daunting role.  Gwyneth Paltrow gives a lot of stature, poise and personality to her role as the female lead (this is significant in this story).  Commendations also to Ben Affleck, Rupert Everett, Martin Clunes, Tom Wilkinson, Judi Dench, Colin Firth, and especially Geoffrey Rush for providing an excellent comic foil.And congratulations should definitely go to the writers for putting together a snappy storyline with the material.

"Absurd untruths, the poor Bard may be spinning in his grave","First, I'll admit to not being a fan of sheer fictional tales about famous historical figures, who aren't around to defend themselves. Poor Shakespeare may well be spinning in his grave. True, there's free speech, but just because he's the foremost bard of the English language does not give Hollywood the moral right to fabricate whatever drivel desired in order to entertain an audience and make a buck. Were the literary historians not outraged at the time? They should have been. It's difficult to believe this absurdity won an Academy Award for Best Picture.This film concocts a purely fictional story wherein Shakespeare experiences writer's block while working on his new play 'Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter'. Meanwhile, the wealthy Viola, who's a fan of Shakespeare's plays and is engaged to marry the (quite predictably cold hearted) Lord Wessex, has always dreamed of becoming an actress herself. As acting is unacceptable in that era for a woman, she disguises herself as a boy to audition for the part of Romeo on stage. Thus begins a romance between the Bard and Viola, who is his inspiration for the immortal play we now know as Romeo and Juliet.First of all, it's not exactly an original concept, the poor oppressed woman who's downtrodden because of her gender and not free to assume her desired profession, in this case acting. Rather an overworked theme. (I'm a woman, by the way). Gwyneth Paltrow is a lovely young actress, so it's nothing personal. Also, there are wonderful Oscar winning costumes. Really, however, this movie is basically a bedroom frolic about Will. I notice a few are claiming that a more appropriate title might be Shakespeare in Lust.It really isn't right to concoct these fictitious tales, and for those who found it amusing & romantic...well, your entertainment was at the expense of an actual human being nearly four centuries deceased. He may or may not have appreciated it, but is not around to express his views. For those who claim that Shakespeare would be proud, I question these supernatural powers of discerning the attitudes of the long deceased. Instead of wasting time on this foolish movie, it might be better spent reading or viewing one of Shakespeare's plays on stage, or watching Franco Zeffirelli's beautiful 1968 film adaptation of Romeo and Juliet.My son (now a college freshman) was shown this silly Shakespeare in Love during an enriched high school English class a couple of years ago. He could never quite fathom what possible educational purpose this nonsense was intended to serve. Perhaps, as one reviewer suggested, the purpose of this film was to inform the modern world that Shakespeare had sex. Or if it's intended as an irreverent view of Elizabethan England, as some claim, we could well have managed without.My favourite of all the comments read is that this movie has nothing whatsoever to do with Shakespeare other than to steal his good name. And sorry, I guess I'm just not one of those who can get much of a laugh out of the title 'Romeo and Ethel the Pirates's Daughter'. I find it quite a pathetic and juvenile attempt at humour, most definitely not Oscar caliber.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Can you say ""overrated""?","After ""Shakespeare in Love"" won almost every nomination, and beat ""Saving Private Ryan"" for Best Picture, I decided I had to see it.  I never got around to seeing it in the theater, and I had to wait for it to come to video.  After seeing nearly all of this year's Best Picture nominees, I felt more inclined to see it than ever.  I finally rented it on DVD, came home, popped it in, and expected a really great film.  As much to my shock as was my disappointment, it wasn't.""Shakespeare in Love"" is not a bad film, and there are some things I liked about it.  It was a sumptuous period piece, and I admired Geoffrey Rush's performance, since he never ceases to amaze me with his acting talent. Gwyneth Paltrow was fair, although her performance didn't stun me.  However, the whole time I was watching this, my mind couldn't help but drift elsewhere, and I had to wake myself up in order to pay attention.  My point is, it simply didn't grab me.  Most of the Best Picture nominees and winners are films that grab my attention and have a strong influence on me.  This one didn't.  It was a cute love story, but not strong enough in my opinion to receive as much as a nomination.  It deserved awards for costume and set design, and Geoffrey Rush's performance, otherwise no.  This film was not one of the best films of 1998!  No way!Also, in the age of Columbine when theater owners are obsessive about carding children for getting into R-rated films, I can't see how this got an R-rating.  So what if we caught a glimpse of Gwyneth Paltrow's boobies. ""TITANIC"" let us see Kate Winslet in full view, and that got a mild PG-13. There is no explicit violence or sex in ""Shakespeare in Love"".  The MPAA's obsession with sex or nudity in any shape or form onscreen is uncanny.As for the overall quality of ""Shakespeare in Love"", it was well done.  I never said that it was a bad film, and I sort of liked it.  However, the fact that it won the Academy Award for Best Picture, proclaiming it as the best film of 1998, does nothing but disappoint and anger me.",,Anonymous,History

Shakespeare can be entertaining ;),"I've honestly degraded the movie directly after knowing that Gwyneth Paltrow will be playing a major role namely Viola's, but surprisingly I was really amused by her qualifications in acting which arose at once. What I also mean by this is the fact that she's American yet she managed to speak the British accent both professionally and fluently, which is a win for the movie and her. Along with Joseph Fiennes the young handsome version of Shakespeare, they both managed to create a passionate romantic atmosphere which has left a memorable print in our touched hearts. Taking the plot into consideration, I would say that it was so beautifully made that I have finally known what life was like back then in England. It reflected Renaissance by it's simplest detail, speaking about the music, the costumes, the literature and the architecture as well. However it also provided an overview about the historic plot, namely the Elizabethan age and the imperialism. John Madden has really achieved a great accomplishment by portraying the parallels between the fictional play and the film, thus it was interesting spotting these out like for example the unwanted live, and the tragedies and also by directing a movie which is based on the author rather than his work, hence it was such an epic change taking the Shakespearean literature into consideration which are more like an everlasting play which lacks the entertainment and the sense of humour. Summing up, the movie is absolutely worth the seven Oscars it has won, for nothing happens for no reason.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Deserved Best Picture,"Many people bring up this picture as the epitome of an inappropriately-awarded Oscar. I disagree wholeheartedly. I can think of more egregious examples off the top of my head (""Forrest Gump"", ""American Beauty"").This film was expertly crafted, as the reality of Shakespeare's writing his classic love story was interwoven with his personal love life. Such an innovative plot almost deserves an Oscar for that alone. Despite the underlying love story, it's not so syrupy that you lose interest. The film is also a parody on Hollywood and the concessions made on productions. For example, the major money contributors are given roles in the play, despite their qualifications.This is a fun, romantic film with great performances all around. Give me a film with British actors anytime rather than the dimwits we have in America. Such a great cast!---Dame Judy Dench, Joseph Fiennes, Jim Carter, Simon Callow, Rupert Everett (in a cameo), Tom Wilkinson and above all, Geoffrey Rush (not a Brit but close). Rush is hilarious and has the best comic lines in the film. The same year he was in one of my favorite films ""Elizabeth"" as he shows his range in playing a serious role--which he nailed.Gwenneth Paltrow's Oscar was well-deserved--as was Dench's.The music is extremely uplifting and definitely adds to the buoyancy of the film.This is a funny, romantic film for adults and is well worth your time.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A light hand and a light heart.,"One of the best things about Shakespeare in Love is that it doesn't take itself very seriously, and I mean that in the best way possible. The story is told with a light hand and a light heart, and I often found myself smiling. It's not the kind of film, during which you look for inconsistencies or historical inaccuracies. I was perfectly happy accepting that some things were inspired by real events, while others were just... well, inspired.At the time, the leading roles were huge for Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes, and, in the case of Gwyneth Paltrow, that sometimes shows. But, overall, they both do a good job. And they are supported by a really impressive cast. Geoffrey Rush shows off his acting skills and comedic talents in a very impressive way. Judi Dench plays a fairly small role as the queen, but she does it really well. The only supporting actor who proves a bit too weak is Ben Affleck.If you haven't already seen it, I can warmly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,History

What is particularly excellent in this production is how John Madden incorporates so many of Shakespeare's lines from so many plays into this production. Furthermore, my the interweaving of the subplots helps with the teaching of irony, which many freshmen have trouble understanding. Outside the classroom, I highly recommend this film for a ""couple's night"" when people need a good laugh or are in the mood for some top-notch drama.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Predictability kills,"Greatly overrated minorpiece that deals with a fictitious tale about Shakespeare falling in love with one of his contemporary fans.Here's what's wrong with it:Story: basically it's quite a nice story with some interesting plot lines. Unfortunately, the director decided not to make it too difficult for his intended big audience, so predictability kills surprise in almost every scene. No character twists either, everyone stays safely inside their dictated personage. I had the futile hope that Juliette would really stab herself to death with the dagger in the last scene of the play, but alas.Casting: the biggest flaw of the film. I understand the fact that American actors are hired to play Britons, I guess you just can't do without some Hollywood celebs in such a venture. But Gwyneth Paltrow? Joseph Fiennes?? Ben Affleck??? OK, Fiennes is British, but has absolutely no charisma and must have been used just for his good looks. Firth and Dench are quite alright but have only minor parts.Humor: I get sick of this kind of childish, predictable, unwitty and totally unfunny humor.

Acting out two different parts is a big challenge. Together, Fiennes and Paltrow, harmonize perfectly. The script uses a lot of Shakespearan quotes which make the movie especially exciting when you are able to recognize them. It also takes a cute bet on how the story of Romeo&Juliet might have developed. All in all, the plot has a lot of action. You won't get tired watching it. The main focus is on Shakespeare and Viola's love story which is adorable but has not future. I highly recommend this movie because it gives you a good insight in Shakespeare's life and his time.

imaginative and good,"This was certainly one of the most imaginative movies of the year and it was pretty good.  The idea was definitely unique, and it was a thoughtful portrayal of something that didn't happen, at least not to anyone's knowledge.  By bringing Will Shakespeare down to the same level as any modern day young person who is struggling with love, this film has helped us understand Shakespeare as a person, and not just a poet and writer of plays who used words like thou, wilt, and shalt.  It might not have been an accurate story, but it was not meant to be.  And if it helps boost an interest in Shakespeare that might not have been there before for some people, then perhaps it has done some good.  I did think that the movie could have targeted a larger audience by leaving out some unnecessary nudity.  Without the nudity I believe the love scenes would have still had the same effect, and the movie could have garnered a PG-13 rating, boosting audience potential.  Just my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A cracking yarn,"Yes a cracking yarn with just enough accurate historical allusions in terms of characters and locations to make you forgive the anachronisms. But this was never meant to be an accurate and historical account of Shakespeare's life. What it is, is a funny, joyous and irreverent look at the man and his early work.Of special note is the way in which the film draws on the plots of Shakespeare's plays for its own plot and then ultimately turning it on its head by representing his subsequent plays as drawing on the plot of story told in the film. Notably of course, The 12th Night.In fact the film was full of these sorts of ""in jokes"" such as the ragamuffin John Webster (a playwright who would have been the early teen to Shakespeare's young adult) and who is renowned for his dark plots as suggested by his love of blood in the film.The cast was pretty good although I was at a bit of a loss as to how Ben Affleck got cast in his role. The only thing I can imagine is that the director, casting director and script writers clearly love irony (you only have to watch the play to know that) and perhaps they thought it would be funny having a late 20th century star playing his period counterpart. Almost worked but not quite.Not a serious film by any means but well done and much more enjoyable than the vast majority of Hollywood rubbish churned out year by year.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Even though it gets creative as it can be, the solidness of the story is far from satisfying the audience.Note: Joseph Fiennes has the face of villain and acts villain even though he is the protagonist.

Meeting Shakespeare's Muse,"What were William Shakespeare's inspirations?  Who was his muse?  These are questions that have occupied the thoughts of scholars and lovers of literature down the centuries.  This raunchy, brilliantly witty film suggests sly answers to these questions by showing us Will Shakespeare as a very real young man, with a very real, very bad case of writer's block. His new play, ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,"" is not going well.  He has been paid for the play already, and has debts beside.  He badly needs for inspiration to strike, for his muse to grant him a vision.  The fates are kind, and inspiration does strike in the form of Viola, a beautiful young courtesan who loves the theater and wants nothing more than to act on the stage--in an age when women are forbidden to do so.  Viola's gender-bending deception initiates an avalanche of riotous activity as well as a torrent of literary brilliance for Will.  Romeo remains, but Ethel disappears forever, her place taken by Juliet, and pirate adventures on the high seas give way to the greatest love story of all--one mirrored by the love between Will and Viola, and just as impossible.  Joseph Fiennes is wonderful as Will Shakespeare, bemused and befuddled, passionate and brilliant, clear-eyed and heart-breakingly beautiful.  Gwyneth Paltrow continues to surprise and delight with the depth of expression and emotion in her performances.  The supporting cast is dependable and solid--standouts are Judi Dench as a crusty, scathing Queen Elizabeth and Rupert Everett as competing playwright Christopher Marlowe.  There are plenty of in-jokes and references to Shakespeare's work for the literate crowd, but this rollicking funfest can be enjoyed by more than just English Lit majors.

Funny and Intelligent  -  How on Earth did this win the Oscar?,"One of my favourite movies.  Two intelligent writers, Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman, combine to give us their vision of Young Shakespeare as a would-be up-and-coming writer, in the time shortly before he mysteriously changed gear in the mid 1590s and became The Bard.The problems he faces in becoming established are shown as remarkably (nay, mysteriously) similar to those confronting writers today  writer's block, money, producers, and an abandoned wife and children (a woman of roperty  - she has a cottage).  He finds the answer in the form of Gwyneth Paltrow (well, it would work for me) playing the role of her career to date as Viola de Lesseps, daughter of a merchant rich enough to attract suitors from the nobility for his daughter. We know that she is certainly well beyond the reach (for marriage) of a humble player, but she is an early fan of the budding writer, even when nearly all she has to go on is `The Two Gentlemen of Verona'The humour turns partly on the situation of Will Shakespeare facing modern theatrical problems (which however are not necessarily outside the range of what the real Shakespeare might have faced).  But beyond that there constant Elizabethan in-jokes, pitched so that even those with the barest acquaintance with the life of times of Shakespeare will get some, while others are rewards for deeper study.Many people who do not like the film ask how could it have won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1998.  I ask the same question  - given that it is so far superior to those normally recognised by the Academy in recent years (I mean, Gladiator?  Titanic?! The English Patient?!!!).

A must-see film for everyone,"Shakespeare in love is a great film.  I went in expecting a lot, the film has had a lot of good press, and I wasn't disappointed.  Brilliant script, great direction, flawless acting.  Tom Stoppard's script is rife with witty one-liners and clever in-jokes, and John Madden, after proving he was one to watch after Mrs Brown, has now shown us he is one of the great contemporary British directors.  The cast, above all, is brilliant.  In the main roles, Joseph Fiennes is hilarious and believable as Shakespeare and Gwyneth Paltrow is radiant and most impressive as Viola.  The supporting cast is also good, with Ben Affleck playing a Ye Olde English version of an arrogant Hollywood actor, Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth and Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson and Martin Clunes also delivering great performances.  Go see this film, and pray it beats Private Ryan to an Oscar.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Elizabethan entertainment,"Shakespeare being part of Anglo-America's literary heritage, filmmakers still think it worthwhile artistically and financially to seek a new angle on Will's oeuvre despite the plethora of previous productions and relentless dissection of the plays in Eng Lit courses. This clever, colourful and well-paced film asks: who was Will the man, and what drove him to write such enduring plays for the theatre, that most ephemeral of the arts?Well. fear, lust and survival loom large. But this Shakespeare also has a need to be heard and a need to be loved. It is London, 1593, and 29 year old Will (Joseph Fiennes), married to an older woman back in Stratford he hasn't seen for years, is desperately trying to write something to keep the doors of  the South Bank theatre of his hard-pressed not to say singed friend Henslowe (Geoffery Rush) open. There's fierce competition from Burbage's Curtain Theatre across the river. Will has had some earlier success with plays about Kings with Roman numerals after their names, but Henslowe is demanding a comedy to get bums on seats. Will, however, has a severe case of writer's block and even consults a magician/apothecary, the Elizabethan equivalent of a psychoanalyst. ""Fall in love,"" says Dr Moth (Antony Sher), giving him a magic amulet. So Will does, with the utterly unsuitable Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), daughter of a self-made rich merchant.Viola loves the theatre and wants to act, which is a problem, since women are forbidden the stage (boys play the younger female parts). So she dresses as a boy and auditions for a part in the still unwritten new comedy with the working title ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter."" As the relationship develops, Will's writer's block evaporates and a more familiar play emerges. History of course records that the play was a hit, but Will and Viola's fictional relationship hits heavy weather. Viola's father, anxious to improve his family's social standing, agrees to marry her off to the arrogant Earl of Wessex (Colin Firth), who needs the family money for a colonisation plan in Virginia. The final scene (Chesapeake Bay, it seems) connects England with America, and ""Romeo and Juliet"" with Shakespeare's next play, ""Twelfth Night.""We see plenty of street life and squalor, meanness and mendacity, but also we get what can only be described as the healing power of art. Moneylenders and standover men are charmed by the power of theatre in at least temporarily suspending their business activities. The competition, in the form of Burbage (Martin Clunes, not behaving quite so badly here) comes to the rescue at a crucial point. Even Gloriana herself, Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench), is moved by Will's story of true love.It's not too likely that Shakespeare scholars will consider this account of the origins of ""Romeo and Juliet"" as plausible, but the writers, Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, have produced something fresh out of the bones of history and their version is a lot of fun. At one point, QE 1 is faced with a large puddle between her and the coach she is boarding. She looks meaningfully at the assembled nobles who, no doubt mindful of Sir Walter Raleigh's previous gallantry and subsequent preferment, start fiddling with their cloaks. But they are too slow for Gloriana, who, losing patience, strides through the puddle, muttering ""too slow, too slow.""It's all pretty well done and the performances range from more than adequate to very good. Gwyneth Paltrow is not really a natural beauty (nor English) but she is both elegant and spirited as Viola (and very well dressed). When disguised (badly -only Will does not notice) as the boy actor she looks oddly like k. d. Lang and a great deal sexier. It is in this guise that Will first kisses her - a nice reference to the continuing pointless controversy over Shakespeare's sexuality. As Will, Joseph Fiennes and his big limpid eyes carry off the part of moonstruck lover well, though he is a bit young looking for 29. He is not so convincing in the ""genius at work"" part of the role. Colin Firth is great as the nasty Wessex (Darcy without the redeeming qualities). Judi Dench does an effective Gloriana, even though some of her lines as written lacked punch (where's the famous charm?). There are a host of other good minor players, testament to the depth of talent in English Theatre despite the lousy conditions and poor pay for most of them.This isn't Shakespeare, and Norman and Stoppard didn't set out to emulate him, but they have produced, with John Madden's seamless directing, a fine entertainment which the Bard himself would have chuckled over. Stoppard, originally Czech and brought up largely outside Britain, has an outsider's perspective on the English language combined with a mastery of it, and this can produce a surreal effect - at times the dialogue is too self-consciously witty to be emotionally true. The whole thing may be a bit of a pastiche, but you won't notice the joins and it won't put you off Shakespeare, which is more than can be said for a lot of Eng Lit courses.",,Anonymous,History
The Young Bard,"William Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon. Considered to be one of the greatest English-language authors, his collected works consist of 39 plays, 154 sonnets and three long narrative poems. ""The Bard"", as he is often called, has had his works translated into every major language in the world. The writer died on April 23, 1616, aged 52. He passed away just one month after signing his will - a document William Shakespeare ironically began by describing himself as ""a man in perfect health"".Fast forward to Hollywood in the 1990s. Writer Marc Norman had always wanted to investigate Shakespeare's role in the Elizabethan theatre. And suddenly it struck him. The young Bard must have been a frustrated writer, just like himself. It was only when money and success appeared in the playwright's life that the backstabbing, lying and cheating entered the arena. The same elements that play such a prominent role in today's Tinseltown, in other words.Marc Norman sold ""Shakespeare in Love"" to Universal Pictures in 1991. The studio contacted Julia Roberts and Daniel Day-Lewis for the lead roles, and the production seemed ready to go ahead. Then, just a week before the cameras were to start rolling, the two stars dropped out. Panic spread on the film set, and it seemed as if the whole picture had to be shut down. Fortunately, at that moment, Miramax Studios offered to take over the ill-fated project.Apparently, the management at Miramax knew what they were doing. The film was a great success, both with critics and among the public. And things got even better at the Academy Awards. ""Shakespeare in Love"" became the first comedy to take home the Oscar for Best Picture since ""Annie Hall"" won in 1977. In addition, Judy Dench also secured a prize even though she was only on-screen for six minutes. The shortest performance ever to win an Oscar.",7.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best films,"Reading all the negative reviews of Shakespeare in Love makes me feel like a rebel for liking it, but a proud rebel I'll be then!  This was one of the best movies I have ever seen, and while it can be argued for not being historically accurate or overly sensual, or whatever it is some people are griping about, it is still a wonderful movie.Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow are great as Will Shakespeare and Viola, and all of the supporting cast are terrifc as well, but the best part of the movie is the writing. The writing is smart, hilarious (especially if one has some knowledge of Shakespeare's works), and yes, even sensual.  But the story is of an affair between a bard and his muse, what do you expect? Leave your moral convictions and historical correctness aside, and just enjoy the movie for what it is: storytelling with a heart and a wicked sense of humor.Of course, it wouldn't have hurt if it was historically accurate to the least detail, but then that would take away some of the fun.  I have seen this movie more times than I can remember and it just gets better every time.  It's not for everybody (note: very young children in certain sections), but it's far from being a bad way to spend a few hours of your time.Go see the movie!

This movie is one for the movie-buff collection!,"Mere words cannot express the beauty of this movie. One has to see it in order to begin to grasp the majesty, the poetry of the movie. Listening to ""Viola"" Gwyneth Paltrow (Flesh and Bone) reading poems is wonderful. She is brilliant in the part. She deserved the Oscar she won a million times. She is a gorgeous young woman and a great actress. I first rented the tape to check it out because I don't have the patience to watch those endless movies more than once.  I will not say which movie I made me feel that way.  I don't have the patience, or could it be patient?!? Many times a movie gets many Oscars but becomes a sleepy movie in my movie collection or a sleepy rental. But this movie is one for the movie-buff collection!  There is much to be digested after one watches it many times.Viola and Will made a lovely pair. Too bad there is never a happy ending for Romeo and Juliet movies, it would be nice if at least one had a happy ending. The script is brilliant,  composed of interwoven stories, the rhythm of the poetry, the photography, the actors acting in two levels: as actors in the play ""Romeo and Juliet"" and as the characters in the movie. It is just outstanding. This is a rare gem of a movie. Favorite scenes: Will running after Viola in the street and finding out that the he is a she. The love scenes are beautifully done, the nurse and her little fan sitting outside the bedroom and making noise with her rocking chair. Any time Viola reads poetry was lovely.  Gwyneth makes reading poetry look easy, but it is not easy. Her sense of timing and her British accent are impeccable. Favorite Quotes: Lord Wessex: ""I have spoken to your father.""  Viola: ""I speak to him every day, sir.""   [Whispering at Viola's bedroom door] Nurse: ""Madame, the house is stirring. It is a new day.""  Viola: ""It is a new WORLD.""",10.0,Anonymous,History
"A Most Intelligent, Lyrical, Piquant Introduction To Shakespeare's World","I am confident that Shakespeare In Love would be much more appreciated today had it not actually won. The primary nominees that everyone seems to believe to be the deserving winner, in this order, are: Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, or Life Is Beautiful. But mostly it is Saving Private Ryan. I am not going to digress anymore into why Shakespeare In Love did indeed win, whether it was all about politics, who really deserved it that year, etc., because it is not of any real importance. It did win, and it was a deserving film, regardless of its competition that year.Shakespeare In Love tells the story of the one and only William Shakespeare; specifically, his inspiration for his greatest masterpiece, Romeo & Juliet. The year is 1593 and Shakespeare (Fiennes) is a playwright at The Rose Theater. His current play is titled ""Romeo & Ethel: The Pirate's Daughter""; it isn't going very well and he cannot seem to finish it (he even tries some mystical spell for a muse, a lady he finds in bed with another man soon thereafter). Shakespeare's wife, Anne Hathaway, is currently residing in another city and he soon falls in love with a young maiden, Viola de Lesseps (Paltrow), whom he first sees at a performance for The Queen (Elizabeth, Dench), then at a ball.Despite being unable to finish writing it, Shakespeare commences casting for his play, with the assistance of Ned Alleyn (Ben Affleck). He meets a young man with obvious talent, ""Sir Thomas Kent"". Kent is really, of course, Viola. He eventually finds out Kent's true identity and thus begins their rendezvous and love affair.Alas, in the sixteenth century, their love cannot be fulfilled. Not only is William Shakespeare already married and divorce impossible, but, seemingly coincidentally, Viola is betrothed to Lord Wessex (Firth), whom everyone realizes is marrying for the de Lessep's wealth. Discovering Viola's assignations with Shakespeare, he seeks revenge. Shakespeare, himself now disguised as a girl (Viola's cousin), reveals the identity of her lover to be Christopher Marlowe, friend and rival playwright. The news of Marlowe's death (murder) causes Shakespeare much guilt, and Viola is anguished, being led to believe it is Shakespeare. She is greatly relieved to find out the truth. On opening night, Viola is able to play Juliet along Shakespeare's Romeo, despite the sexist policy of male actors only, because she is the only one available whom knows the lines. Their performance, of course, dazzles the audience. At the conclusion of a truly passionate Romeo & Juliet performance, The Master Of The Revels arrives, having discovered Kent's true identity. Kent/de Lesseps is saved by The Queen, whom, rather than reveal what she knows, stealthily lets Viola know that it is time her to marry Lord Wessex and say goodbye to ""Sir Thomas Kent"" and, therefore, Shakespeare. In one of the most poetic and tender farewell scenes, Viola and Shakespeare express their love to each other for the last time.Typically, I do not like Shakespeare of any sort, be it a live play, film, book. I am not a fan of Latin and/or Elizabethan English. All the more impressive, then, that I thoroughly liked Shakespeare In Love. And it was pretty funny! It is always difficult to write an original comedy, let alone set in a different time period, in Elizabethan English! The costuming, of course, was amazing. It is always impressive to see a film that is able to transport the audience to a different era. The award- winning score was beautiful, as was set design.Dench, as evidenced by her less than ten minute Academy Award winning performance, was magnificent. She was exactly how I imagine a true Queen to be: overbearing, pretentious, ostensibly bitchy, but kind-hearted when needed. Paltrow was elegant and alluring as Viola, with a performance I did not necessarily believe to be her best or even Academy Award Winning, but commendable nonetheless. Finnes was well-casted in this definitive role. Probably my favorite character, yet inexplicably under appreciated by most, is Nurse (Imelda Staunton). I loved not only how loyal and loving she was to Viola, but also watching her nervously try to cover for her, like when she was in the rocking chair as the two of them were clearly making love in the next room. Other supporting characters were also convincing. At the end of the day, however, what makes this film so deserving of its accolades, is the writing. One of the most quotable films I have seen in a while, and in such poetic, eloquent, grandiloquent words!""My story starts at sea, a perilous voyage to an unknown land. A shipwreck. The wild waters roar and heave. The brave vessel is dashed all to pieces. And all the helpless souls within her drowned. All save one. A lady. Whose soul is greater than the ocean, and her spirit stronger than the sea's embrace. Not for her a watery end, but a new life beginning on a stranger shore. It will be a love story. For she will be my heroine for all time. And her name will be Viola.""... And thus begins William Shakespeare's next great play, The Twelfth Night...",7.0,Anonymous,History

An almost perfect movie,"Let's start with the script, a tremendous blend of Shakespeare (he was pretty good), Marc Norman and playright Tom Stoppard. The idea that Shakespeare was inspired to write one of the greatest love stories and tragedies of all time is fictional, but inspired. The casting included some great actors, and won two acting Oscars for Gwyneth Paltrow and Dame Judi Dench. Ben Affleck maxes out his portrayal of ""Ned Alleyn"" who portrays Mercutio and is a great counterpoint to Joseph Fiennes' Shakespeare and some great British actors shine throughout even though the focus is on the lovers. The musical themes written by Stephen Warbeck are lush and expressive. (Some of the cable channels tragically cheat us out of the last several minutes while the credits play. Instead of allowing the full emotional impact they promote a lot of often horrid other movies and shows.) This movie deservedly earned 7 Oscars and numerous other awards and likely deserved more.

Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter,"This was good solid entertainment and showcased Ms. Paltrow at her luminous best.

Judi Dench makes for the most formidable Royalty! both here and in Mrs. Brown, so I am rather glad that I did not have the misfortune to have been born into those Eras. That is not to say she wasn't wonderful in the parts, for she was incredible, as always.

Paltrow radiates charm and does a decent British accent. In the silly tradition of Clark Kent and his glasses, she puts on a mustache and nobody recognizes her, including her lover. Fiennes is OK if a bit too brooding as the bard. It's strange seeing Affleck among the fine cast of British actors, but he does not embarrass himself.

My favorite film,"""Shakespeare in Love"" demonstrates writing, acting and production of the highest quality. We see my favorite criteria for judging a film - creativity, humor, love, mystery, romance and adventure - rise time and time again to their high-water marks. I was particularly impressed with the fact that Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman understood that Shakespeare was truly in the entertainment business, and show us a conflicted Shakespeare whose writing is being constrained by his producers. In ""Romeo and Juliet,"" Shakespeare breaks from the popular stage-play themes making their rounds in the city, and is successful in doing so because he shows the audience aspects of human nature, which up to that time had been unexplored in this medium. I wish Hollywood would be willing to take the same chance and produce entertaining, thoughtful and socially redeeming films (such as Tom Hooper's recent success). Hollywood take note, there is a population cohort for whom you've been writing for the past thirty years that has grown up.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Go hear a well-written movie,"Shakespeare in Love forces me to think back to a conversation the late Gene Siskel and his comrade Roger Ebert had on their show one day about the nature of movies, and the idea that encompasses them.  A paraphrased Ebert argued in favor of black and white films because they enhance the whole idea that (paraphrased) ""We, the audience, are taken into a room where the lights dim and for two plus hours we are taken into a dreamy almost surreal world."" And in my mind, Shakespeare in Love perfects this, in accomplishing this very objective, as Siskel and Ebert believed, of movies as works of art.The film itself was a glorious story told with such brilliance and wit that made it very surreal and dreamy.  And much like a good dream that one hates to wake up from, I found myself ready and willing to sit for hours more as Viola made her way across the sand in the end of the movie.There was a tremendous amount working in this film, most of which I credit to the writing.  The parallel of what was going on in the film, with what was going on in the play, was so very Shakespearean.  The use of plays within plays is one of Shakespeare's favorite devices, and Stoppard used it with such a brilliance as we the audience watched the development of Twelfth Night-like plot twists on screen, as the film actors, played actors, who acted out Romeo and Juliet on their stage.  Anyone who knows Shakespeare, surely understands how completely awesome this writing is.As for some of the technical aspects of the film... I did not much care for some of the jump cutting that John Madden used in some of the scenes (i.e. dance scene between Will and Viola) which I am left to assume his purpose in doing so was to show the instant chemistry between the two lovers.  Not really necessary in my mind and frankly, I found it jarring, for more often than not, it (the camera) moved in the opposite direction that the actors danced in, indicating confusion, not synchronization between the two.Which brings me to my final point, that being the under-appreciation of writers in Hollywood.  Newsweek recently published an interview with Stoppard, Begnini, Beatty (Ha!) and two other screenwriters, whose names have escaped me.  The article only reinforced my belief about the necessity of good writers in Hollywood and the unfortunate lack of respect that they get.  After reading some of the critical reviews I am glad to see that Tom Stoppard (who I read somewhere as being, ""The only man smart enough to put Shakespeare's words in his mouth."") is receiving at least some of the credit he deserves.  Without knowing how much Marc Normand helped Stoppard, it is difficult for me to either exclude him or give him the same credit as Stoppard for he has neither a ""Rosencrantz"" nor a ""Guildenstern"" in his filmography.  (A small plug for those of you who haven't seen another of Stoppard's wonderfully written films, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, which I believe he also directed).  I will reside to the fact that the film was well directed, but I can only commend Madden half-heartedly, for most of his success, I believe, comes about as a result of his standing on the shoulders of others (i.e. Judi Dench in Mrs. Brown).  Personally, I think there are a number of directors who would have done a fine job working with the writers to bring the story to the screen.  Perhaps there will come a day when the proper person (Stoppard) will get the majority of the credit regarding the genius of a film like Shakespeare in Love, rather than simply giving it to the default recipient, the director.  Hopefully on Oscar night, Stoppard will get his Oscar, and perhaps one for Madden as well, for the film is nothing shy of Oscar worthy.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Well Crafted story of Shakespeare writing Shakespeare,"Shakespeare in Love is one of those films where every element comes together. However, it is to what level they come together that leaves it at less than perfect.The Art Direction/Production Design, Costumes, Sets  (in short the totalpackage visually) created a convincing and beautiful rendition of Elizabethan England.  Was it an excellent rendition?  No.  The Designers used the saidelements to accentuate specific characters, and almost ignored others.  Only the sets of the theatres, Greenwich, and the de Lesseps House were  tended to with great care.The score is less than memorable, yet it gets a Best Original Score win? Cinematography was done well enough, but there are whole scenes that franklycould have been visualized better.Acting:   The acting is what makes this film play better than it prolly should. Rush, Wilkinson, Fiennes, Paltrow, and Dench  all gave stellar performances. Rush, Wilkinson, and Dench clearly created characters that were, sadly, farmore interesting and entertaining than Paltrow and Fiennes.

Definitely Worth a Watch,"The first time I watched this movie, I didn't think it was anything special. I didn't dislike it, but I didn't come away from it feeling...anything? But I rewatched it several years later, this time with some more knowledge of Shakespeare in hand, as well as a bit of familiarity with Tom Stoppard's writing, and it was much, much more entertaining at that point. I totally understand the popular sentiment that this movie was totally overrated and won awards it shouldn't have, but I also think it's unfairly judged because of that nowadays. Is the acting the greatest I've ever seen in my life? No, but it wasn't bad at all; in fact, some of it was quite good. Are the story and characters Oscar-worthy?

Thoroughly enjoyable take on Shakespeare and the London theatre of his age.,"Watching this again after some years I find it gets even better. It's very funny, very good to look at, and has a plot which while quite over the top historically in fact tells you a lot about the greatest dramatist of all time & his age, about artistic inspiration, about love. There are so many good character actors in it, all deftly bringing their characters to life. The principals are all superb - Fiennes, Paltrow, Firth, Dench, Callow, Wilkinson, Sher, Staunton, Affleck and the rest. The death of Marlowe is moving - all the more for being off stage - and the whole theme of hopeless love is treated in a bittersweet way which is quite moving. At the end, though, it's the humour which stays with me; the sly references to our present preoccupations especially. Tom Stoppard blazed a trail years ago in ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" to the possibilities of using Shakespeare as a jumping off point; in this respect this film's a worthy successor years later.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Shakespeare In Love wins The Best Picture a.k.a 'You got to be kidding me'!,"Okay,here is the thing.There is no much to say about Shakespeare In Love.It's a delightful and sometimes funny and charming movie that you will enjoy watching but that you will forget in a year.This movie actually won The Best Picture Oscar against Saving Private Ryan.Give me a break,will ya?It's a good movie that has a few moment's and that's it.There is nothing special in it!A tons of movies like this one are made every year.If you want to watch a delightful movie that has humor in it then i recommend you As Good As It Gets.It's five times better.I can understand it won some Oscar's for it's technical aspects but to award this movie with the best screenplay Oscar when La Vita E Bella and Saving Private Ryan are it's competition is just sinful.It's a sin.Just as it is a sin to award it with Best Picture or The Best Actress In A Leading Role!!!

Top notch Film,"This extremely cleverly scripted screenplay bears the hallmark of Tom Stoppard's finest work. An excellent idea that playfully presents the life of Shakespeare in an accessible if somewhat fictionalised manner.Cameo appearances of other noteable renaissance playwrites (such as Marlowe and Webster) add to the intellectual appeal of the film, as does the continual (and often quite subtle) quotation of Shakespeare's own plays within his character's dialogue. All this combined with modern references to Psychiatric treatment and London Taxi Cab drivers (the boatmen on the river Thames) result in a witty and touching cinematic masterpiece.To cap it all, the Coup-de-grace of the whole production, comes at the climax with one of the finest productions of Romeo and Juliet one could hope to see, acted by some of the finest actors available to Hollywood. If this was released unedited, perhaps as part of a DVD special edition, I would surely buy it.All in all, a quality movie. Well worth a look.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Shakespeare in Love,"Set during the later reign of Engand's Queen Elizabeth, this joyful drama sees poor old William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) having a bit of a creative drought. Lacking ideas and cash, and being pursued by both Richard Burbage (Martin Clunes) and the wonderfully dead pan Geoffrey Rush as Philip Henslowe for work he's supposed to have already penned, things are looking a bit bleak. When Gwyneth Paltrow, an ardent theatre fan prohibited from taking to the stage by virtue of her sex, dresses as ""Thomas Kent"" and auditions for a part, he sees through the disguise quickly and his creative juices once again begin to flow... Snag is, she ""Viola de Lesseps"" is engaged to the poverty stricken ""Lord Wessex"" (Colin Firth) and Virginia bound - as soon as he can raise the dowry from her father... What ensues is a rapid-fire, lightly comical, romantic drama that sees quite a collection of acting talents contributing well to the ensemble effect of this story. Fiennes shines as the playwright in trouble - frequently - as do Paltrow, Rush, a surprisingly effective Ben Affleck, Imelda Staunton as her worldly-wise nurse with Jim Carter as the onstage version of that persona and Barnaby Kay as the mischievous little ""Nol"". The costumes and sets are magnificent; the writing from Marc Norman and the newly knighted Sir Tom Stoppard is witty and stimulating - cleverly incorporating quite a bit of the original bard's efforts into their screenplay as they go. It would have been easily possible for this embarrassment of acting riches to have overwhelmed this story, but John Madden keeps all pulling well in the same direction. The film will doubtless be remembered more as Dame Judi Dench's consolation Oscar (for not winning for ""Mrs. Brown"" the year earlier), and as far as they go her performances are fine - but there is much more to this story of the trials and tribulations of a bard in love. A wee bit long, it seems to end more than once, but it is still a story the eponymous writer himself might well have enjoyed.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent movie!,"I've just come from seeing Shakespeare in Love and I am indeed that, in love. It was a fabulous movie with a superb cast. Paltrow played Viola with a passion that I don't recall having seen from her until now. Ben Affleck has redeemed himself from his turn in the blockbuster (or is that lackluster?) Armageddon. Fiennes, with those magnificent eyes, is every woman's dream. Dame Dench was a scene stealer as always and it was great to see Colin Firth again. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.

Love and laughs,"William Shakespeare is struggling with the writing of his new play, Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter. Look at the title of that play and it doesn't take a Shakespearean scholar to see where this is headed. Yes, this will be the story of the making of Romeo and Juliet. Not the true story but a fanciful notion of what might have been. And after watching this film you can't help but wish that this had actually been the way it played out. Because it's a great story. A smart one too, with a script so chock-full of brilliant little nuggets that Shakespeare himself would be proud. It's a story of forbidden love, Shakespeare weaving the events of his own life into the famous play we know so well. But along with the love there are laughs as we watch Shakespeare and his players struggle to bring Romeo and Juliet to life. And there are so many sly, witty references to other famous works of Shakespeare that it is probably impossible to catch them all. Like any great story this one requires great performers to give it life. Happily this film has great performers in abundance.Joseph Fiennes plays Shakespeare and captures wonderfully all the frustrations of a struggling playwright. He also makes for part of a great pair as Shakespeare struggles with his love which cannot be. The woman he falls for is Viola De Lesseps, a woman of privilege and, not incidentally, a huge fan of theater. She falls for Shakespeare just as hard and just as quickly as he falls for her. But unfortunately their love is doomed as she is promised in marriage to the rather odious Lord Wessex. Meanwhile Viola, huge theater fan that she is, is determined to play a role in Shakespeare's newest play despite the prohibition on women performers in this era. Disguised as a man she wins the part of Romeo. Shakespeare uncovers her true identity and their love continues to bloom even as she keeps up her charade. She is his inspiration, his lover and his lead performer. But her charade cannot last and neither can their love. Eventually, and inevitably, all hell breaks loose.The part of Viola, a dual role really, is a very challenging one to play and Gwyneth Paltrow does a magnificent job with it. She's a beautiful, radiant, charming woman who can slap on a fake mustache and a wig and fool everyone into thinking she's a man. A life with two sides and Paltrow is letter-perfect throughout. As a woman she's a wonderful lover. As a man she's a heck of a performer. Of course her dual life causes complications. It also causes laughs. This is not a film to leave you rolling in the aisles but there is a lot of good comedy here, and smart comedy at that. And while it is Fiennes and Paltrow at the heart of the story who are most responsible for carrying the film there are so many other fine performances here. As Queen Elizabeth Judi Dench isn't on the screen much but she makes the most of every moment she has. Such a great presence and she manages to provide some humor as well. Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson and Colin Firth all get their moments to shine. And playing a cocky, egotistical actor there's Ben Affleck, who plays the part with a knowing wink and plays it wonderfully. This is a film with a lot of charm and plenty of wit. Maybe it never hits the highest comedic heights but it will probably have you smiling throughout. Yes, as so many have stated, the fact that it beat out Saving Private Ryan for Best Picture is rather baffling. Doesn't mean it's not a good film in its own right though. The screenplay is brilliant, the performances are terrific. It makes for, if not Best Picture material, a thoroughly enjoyable diversion.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Romance and Genius...,"""Shakespeare in Love"" should have been cinema's ultimate homage to William Shakespeare, not through an umpteenth adaptation, or adaptation's adaptation, to one of his iconic plays, but by putting the iconic playwright within the framework of an original movie plot; original in the sense that it turns him into the subject of a real-life yet loosely fictionalized biopic, a romantic comedy and something of an educational film. We learn a lot throughout John Madden's film, about stage, art, business, royalty and naturally, the genius of Shakespeare, the man who was put in the top 10 of the most influential people of the last millennium, the most highly ranking artist, above Mozart and the Beatles.I hate to use the word 'multi-layered' because it makes a movie sound like architectural work instead of than something being guided by genuine inspiration, but hey, if anything Madden's film proves is that even the greatest masterpieces were not made by a snap of a finger and were build upon many other factors than inspiration. Like ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""Shakespeare in Love"" is a multi-layered accomplishment, a work of art that can be enjoyed on many levels, confidently overlapping, but always with romance at the core. If the film's story isn't likely to leap over the centuries like ""Romeo and Juliet"", it doesn't matter; Will and Viola aren't supposed to steal Romeo and Juliet's thunder but to incarnate the seminal inspiration to the iconic couple. That's their power.Sadly, for all the reasons that can make ""Shakespeare in Love"", a great journey into love, passion and an immersion in the world and business of theater at the dawn of Queen Elizabeth's reign, the film is remembered as one of the worst Best Picture winners, the one that dared to steal ""Saving Private Ryan""s golden statuette at the 1999 Oscars. Spielberg's war movie was an instant classic, a film that immediately topped all the 'Great Films' list, and to many users and even official websites, it is now an objective truth that ""Shakespeare in Love"" didn't deserve the Oscar. And instead of being a love story about a love story, the film had become a trigger to an enduring hate story with the Internet users. Hated and even loved for the wrong reasons, some would love it just because they hated ""Saving Private Ryan"" with passion, which doesn't say much about both films anyway. Now, where do I stand?For me, ""Shakespeare in Love"" isn't just one of these conventional costume dramas with sword fights, antechambers' plotting and feather-writing, and this comes from someone who loved the Best Picture co-nominee ""Elizabeth"". The film carries a sort of self-referential wit, as if it was conscious on its own craziness, it starts with the working title of the classic pay ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter"", it's funny but it feels real. I mean, did you know that Walt Disney intended to call Mickey, Mortimer Mouse? The process of the creation of the play and how it is shaped by the real life events in the film is the kind of delights I love to see in a film, true or not. The part where Ben Affleck's character suggests Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) to keep the title ""Romeo and Juliet"" had the same resonance than that moment in ""The Social Network"" when Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) tells Zuckerberg (Jess Eisenberg) to remove the ""The"" from ""The Facebook"" or when Zuckerberg says no one can't wear a sign indicating if he's single or engaged, hence coming with one of his most ingenuous ideas.That's the ransom of success and worldwide popularity, you can find countless inspirations for Romeo and Juliet's key scenes and I love how the two stories drive each other until the ultimate culmination. I also love how it still manages to encapsulate the conventions of its time like the forced marriage with Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), some thrilling duels, a few balcony meetings, nurses, antechambers plotting, and even the cross-dressing that prevailed in the theater at the time, and that earned Gwyneth Paltrow her Oscar. Indeed, women couldn't play in a stage, which makes you realize why comedy was the strongest suit to embody the notion of love. And the film even manages to showcase some daring anachronisms, one of my favorite being the ""psychiatrist"" played by Anthony Sher. In this fascinating mess, you can't tell fiction from reality and you don't really care, for the film is fun from one bit of another, and is populated by a great gallery of British actors.Now, the real issue, is ""Did it deserve the Best Picture?"" well, even if I didn't give it the Oscar, ""Saving Private Ryan"" wouldn't be my second vote, the irony of 1998 is that it featured two costume dramas and two war movies, ""Life is Beautiful"" has at least the merit to tackle a very thought-provoking idea and make an enchanting fable out of tragedy. Spielberg's film works on one level, which is the terrific realism of the war battles, but that's all, if you get deeper in the plot, you can easily spot some moments where it sinks into manipulative schmaltz, where you realize that this war is between good and evil guys, while it's true that there was an evil ideology ruling the side, you can't make a war movie and imply that every soldier deserved to die, this is too dangerously simplistic. So to all those who believe ""Saving Private Ryan"" was the better one, I want to say why? The answers will all focus on the battles, story-wise or acting-wise, the other movies didn't deserve less.""Shakespeare in Love"" had the merit to venture in many ideas, many genres, and be enjoyable on many levels. It didn't expect to compete against Spielberg's film, it might have benefited from Weinstein's lobbying, but to hate it on this sole basis isn't the stuff being passion for movies is made on, or constructive criticism.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Credit also to the amazing Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, Dame Judi Dench and the rest of the marvellous cast.

"Creative, light and very well interpreted, ""Shakespeare in Love"" is not the best film of 1998, but that doesn't mean we should close our eyes to its merits","Written by Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman, ""Shakespeare in Love"" brings us the famous title character (Joseph Fiennes) at the height of a creative crisis, unable to write his new play that, initially, was supposed to be called ""Romeo and Ethel, the daughter of pirate"". However, his inspiration comes back in full force when he meets the beautiful Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), a high society girl with whom he lives an intense forbidden romance, which will serve as the basis for his new work.Extremely well structured and creative, the script by Stoppard and Norman employs a fable tone to the narrative, bringing a Shakespeare even funny in his despair in the face of the creative block that affects him. Developing yet other interesting characters like Viola herself and Geoffrey Rush's flamboyant but lovable Philip Henslowe, the script only slips by creating an extremely one-dimensional and despicable Lord Wessex, leaving little room for Colin Firth to demonstrate his talent. Tom Wilkinson, on the other hand, conveys all the insecurity of Hugh Fennyman before his participation in the play, in a simple and touching moment that humanizes a character hitherto unimportant, while Judi Dench embodies the powerful Queen of England with authority, conveying security in each uttered sentence, in a quick and efficient participation that, even so, would never justify the Oscar she received.If, on the one hand, the film was responsible for revealing to international audiences previously little-known English talents, such as Tom Wilkinson and Imelda Staunton (both of whom would be Oscar nominees for future works), others end up being underused on the scene, such as Geoffrey Rush and Simon Callow. (previously seen in Four Weddings and a Funeral, 1994). Then we come to the Gwyneth Paltrow issue. This work resulted in his first - and so far only - Oscar nomination, which was converted into a win. And not even her laughable disguise compromises her acting, as the narrative clearly plays on this otherwise uncomfortable aspect, as when the boatman claims that her disguise ""wouldn't fool a child"" after revealing to Shakespeare that Thomas Kent, in fact, is a woman.Any of the other contestants that year - Cate Blanchett, Emily Watson, Meryl Streep and our Fernanda Montenegro - had infinitely superior performances. However, these four presented a record in the drama, different from what Paltrow proposes. Her performance is refreshing, passionate, youthful, and completely suited to what the role demanded. In another year, in another dispute, no one would complain of her victory. Perhaps her biggest problem is being an American - despite the perfect accent she defends - in a typically English character. The same misperception occurs with Ben Affleck, the production's most notorious casting mistake - the actor is literally lost, with absolutely nothing to do but enjoy his own charm.In the plot, Shakespeare, the main point of interest of the argument, is who we follow in the opening half-hour. However, from the moment the virginal Viola enters the scene, everything changes. After that moment, the viewer's attention is directed to her, making the historical character a mere supporting role. It should also be noted that we are dealing with a work of fiction, and not a historical treatise. So such maneuvers were possible, even if not very desirable. Resulting in a common love triangle, it still has the misfortune of investing in a frustrating and open ending. The filmmakers lacked courage to make their decisions, leaving the lovers together - as would be desired by most - or pushing them away once and for all, eliminating dreamy and fanciful subterfuges.Filled with elegant dialogues inspired by Shakespeare's work, the screenplay uses several moments of the romance between the playwright and Viola as inspiration for famous passages in the story of Romeo and Juliet, such as the meeting on the balcony and the night of love, which come shortly after it. Live these experiences with your inspiring muse. The text also makes a curious mention of John Webster, a contemporary playwright of William Shakespeare who specialized in tragic plays such as ""The White Devil"" and ""The Duchess of Malfi"".Conducting this engaging narrative with confidence, John Madden still has merits for making the central relationship of the narrative believable, as the success of this novel is essential for ""Shakespeare in Love"" to work. Obviously, the good chemistry between the actors collaborates a lot in this regard. Much less talented than his famous brother, Joseph Fiennes lends lightness and charisma to the playwright, doing very well in special moments, such as when he tells the end of the play in a rehearsal, in which the expression of relief mixed with resentment on his face conveys the the author's satisfaction for having completed his work and, simultaneously, the affliction of the man behind the artist for losing his beloved woman.Aiding in our complete immersion in that environment, the exceptional reenactment of London conceived by the production design of Martin Childs recreates the city's dirty streets with precision and still creates grandiose environments like the theaters and Viola's house, as well as the costume designer Sandy Powell. In the portentous clothes of the people of the upper class, contrasting directly with the torn and ragged clothes of the poor segment of the population, still using clothes in the rehearsals of the play that refer directly to the aforementioned classic ""Romeo and Juliet"", from 1968.Through the composition of the shots and the chosen color palette, Madden and his cinematographer Richard Greatrex also make several visual references to ""Romeo and Juliet"", as in the dance scene and the couple's conversation on the balcony. Exploring the beauty of the scenery very well, Greatrex's photography does even better in the beautiful night scenes, which gain a special color thanks to the directors' choices, as in the conversation between Shakespeare and Viola on a boat, where their faces are illuminated while the rest of the plane is dominated by shadows. Madden also composes beautiful shots of their first night of sex, in a classic Hollywood love scene that works very well here for the charisma of the characters and the stylistic choices of the director.Still on the technical side, the editing by David Gamble gives the feature a pleasant rhythm, also serving to open up Shakespeare's source of inspiration by interspersing scenes from the play's rehearsal and their novel, in an elegant sequence that works even better thanks to the soundtrack. Delicate by Stephen Warbeck. Another inspired moment happens when the actors rehearse the sword duel and are attacked by the gang from the other theater, starting to mix rehearsal and reality in a ballet skillfully choreographed by the director. In this same sequence, when Shakespeare and Viola hide under the stage and kiss, notice how the surrounding sound practically disappears, in an interesting narrative resource that illustrates their perception at that moment. It's as if the world stopped for them to enjoy that moment.Set to a now darker soundtrack, tragedy takes over the screen as Viola discovers the existence of Shakespeare's wife and, seconds later, the death of Marlowe (Rupert Everett) is announced, at a key moment in the narrative that begins to prepare for the climax. This sensation is amplified by the closing of the theater and the revelation that she is a woman in the last rehearsal, creating the conflict that will lead us to the exciting finale of ""Shakespeare in Love"". Prepared with care, the climax in the theater is precisely driven by John Madden and enhanced by passionate performances. So, when the performance of the play ends and the applause comes effusive after a brief silence, the viewer is also euphoric by the beauty of what he sees on the screen, a great example of how to use clichés efficiently. As predictable as it is, it works very well.The well-tied ending still opens the way for Shakespeare's next work known as ""Twelfth Night"" and starring a woman named Viola, which attests to the quality of the script, which makes good use of the interesting idea of mixing the work of William Shakespeare with fictional events from his personal life. Creative, light and very well interpreted, ""Shakespeare in Love"" is not the best film of 1998, but that doesn't mean we should close our eyes to its merits. Mixing real facts and characters with fictional events, the feature entertains us with grace and lightness while allowing us to accompany a true genius in the creative process. And what feeling can give us more inspiration than love?That same year we were faced with titles such as Gods and Monsters (1998), The Thin Red Line (1998), The Truman Show (1998) and Out of Sight (1998), in addition to the national Central Station (1998), all much more historically relevant. However, the debate ended up being reduced to two overrated works, this one presented here and Saving Private Ryan (1998), in addition to the melodramatic Life is Beautiful (1998). But these, it seemed at the time, had the best weapons to sell. And the result is that almost fifteen years later, the most popular ones continue to perpetuate the obvious, while the depth remains restricted to those who make an effort behind it.

Nice masterpiece.,"My mother was the one who introduces me to watch this movie on the DVD she got five years back because she knew I have to study a few of Shakespeare's works (it's the case - Twelvfth Night, The Merchant of Venice & A Midsummer Night's Dream) in my English Literature class. And later on when I found out about the original rating for this movie here in my country, I became flabbergasted. I wasn't even of age when this movie came out here.Anyhow, I still survived watching the movie anyway.William Shakespeare (played by Joseph Fiennes) was trying to write this play he has been writing on. He has run out of ideas and is desperately needing of money. Then Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) appeared and the two began a forbidden relationship, given Lady Viola is betrothed to Lord Wessex (Colin Firth). Viola actually became Shakespeare's muse for the eventual play which is maybe one of the most famous ones in our time - Romeo and Juliet.Some may wondered why guys have to dress up as women in plays in Shakepseare's time because at that time, women were actually not allowed on stage. But Lady Viola violated the rules at a great cost, given she did knew of the consequences.Overall, it's not what maybe some are expecting of a biography of Shakespeare's life. It's just a love story. I do actually like Queen Elizabeth's (Dame Judi Dench) appearance too. Or maybe it's because I'm one of those who are always fascinated over history.

If I actually identified everything I found unappealing in this film, I would exceed the 1,000-word limit, so I will only point out a few things.The overly sentimental outpouring of love between Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes ruined this movie for me. (It was enough to trigger the upchuck reflex of even the strongest of stomach.) She, while not a BAD actress, was certainly not good enough to win the Oscar that year. (I maintain strongly that the award should have gone to Cate Blanchett, who was brilliant in ""Elizabeth"".) He, on the other hand, cannot even hope to reach the level of cinematic excellence that his brother, Ralph, has. The lack of facial expressions he brings to the role makes his character flat, and completely uninteresting to the point that one can hardly recognize that he is the main character of the story.""Shakespeare in Love"" was a great blunder, and I fail to see why the Academy gave it seven Oscars. Perhaps this is another reason the Academy Awards are taken less seriously year after year.",,Anonymous,History

It's a lovely film and one this viewer is very happy to recommend.,"Our two protagonists are Will Shakespeare (Jospeh Fiennes), struggling playwright with a bad attack of writers block and in need of inspiration, and Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) an innocent but aristocratic young beauty. She disguises herself as a man in order to tread the boards and explore her love with the poetic prose of her favourite playwright and suddenly his inspiration returns, from which is borne Romeo and Juliet, possibly the greatest and most tragic love story ever to make the stage.However, this film isn't tragic. It's a beautifully realised romantic comedy, crafted with dollops of wit by it's writers Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman. They cleverly weave Shakespeare's beautiful prose into their story, and create a concoction both laugh out loud funny and yet beautiful, with moments of tragedy adding weight to what might otherwise be just a fluff.A wonderful cast play it beautifully. Fiennes and Paltrow are excellent as the two romantic leads, but the supporting cast match them superbly. Special mentions for Judi Dench as an eminently regal Queen Elizabeth, Geoffrey Rush as a suitably put upon and seedy Philip Henslowe, and Tom Wilkinson as Hugh Fennyman, his journey from harsh moneylender to theatre lover being beautifully played. Colin Firth, Martin Clunes, Ben Affleck, Simon Callow, Imelda Staunton, Jim Carter, Mark Williams all contribute to a simply wonderful ensemble of talent, performing this wonderful conceit with the necessary wit and flair.John Madden brings these facets together and allows them centre stage. The actors and the script weave their magic, immersed in a convincing recreation of Tudor London.

This is what beautiful film making can be.,"I've grown up watching many older movies and I am always struck by one thing:  these movies that have stood the test of time have endured because they have SCREENPLAYS.  All About Eve, Adam's Rib, It Happened One Night--great films don't just have a hacked story augmented by many flashy effects or an explosion at the end.  They have something to say, a reason for us to listen.  This reason is for us to renew our love of words, our love of other human beings, what makes life beautiful. Fifty years from now, Titanic and Armageddon will be the three o'clock movie if they're lucky. Shakespeare in Love will have joined the ranks of the classics, and I will watch it and remember the first time I saw it with my friends.

Writer Tom Stoppard takes a few liberties with reality and time to bring you the ""True"" story behind Shakespeare's genius, which would never have surfaced if it were not for love, friendship, tragedy, and a Virgin Queen.Young Shakespeare has writer's block. Then he meets and falls in love with Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) the daughter of a nobleman, Viola, on the other hand, is interested in the forbidden fruit of acting.This film is set with one-liners and many witty inferences as each character plays off of the other. We almost had the play ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter."" My favorite line is when Philip Henslowe: The show must... you know... William Shakespeare: (prompting him) Go on!Do not miss Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth. Her few appearances add spice to the film.Also, see Judi Dench as Titania inA Midsummer Night's Dream (1968).",10.0,Anonymous,History
If you go to Monster Truck Rallys - you won't like this film.,"This is for all the people who wrote bad reviews of this film. HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS FILM???? The whole point of the film is that Shakespeare was a hack who got most of his ideas from his contemporaries and events around him. You know it's not true, but Stoppards script is peppered with lines that Shakespeare uses in his R&J script. It's a farce and you just go along for the ride. Good example: a befuddle Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes are discussing => Rush: ""The show must.... must .... must"" Fiennes: ""GO ON!"" These lines are throughout and are Golden! Fiennes is good as Shakespeare; Paltrow is good as Viola (I wouldn't say it was Best Actress work but very good). Rush should have won an Oscar for his role-he is hilarious. The sets and costumes are very authentic and the music is appropriate and easy to listen to while the yarn unravels. The narrator of R&J has a stutter issue. If you take it seriously, it could be construed as offensive; but taken in context as the story unfolds, this is hilarious. Kudos to all involved.

"Shakespeare in Love--good title, great movie","As Ned Alleyn (Ben Affleck) and the Admiral's men prepare to perform their production of Romeo and Juliet, Ned tells ""the money"", Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson), ""Pay attention, and you will see how genius creates a legend."" The same could have been said to any extras, cast, or crew on the set of ""Shakespeare in Love."" The movie covers a little more than three weeks in the life of the bard (Joseph Fiennes).  He has writers' block, but the moneylender Fennyman will kill, or perhaps cut off the nose of, Philip Henslowe, who is expecting the play ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter"" to be finished yesterday. After an affair with Rosalind, Richard Burbage's seamstress, goes bad, he finally finds his muse in Viola de Lessaps (Gwyneth Paltrow).  The daughter of a wealthy ex-shopkeeper, she is betrothed to marry Lord Wessex (an especially dastardly Colin Firth) after her parents return from the country in three weeks.  In the meantime, however, she dresses like a man and adopts the name of Thomas Kent to play the part of Romeo. I was at first miffed by the use of Shakespeare's most famous, but not greatest, play for this movie, but given the inside jokes and parallels, I quickly forgave.  ""I say a plague upon both their houses..."" a religious fanatic says to a crowd, preaching against acting.  After a night of lovemaking, Viola and Will argue about whether or not it was, in fact, the rooster or the owl they just heard.  Perhaps the most clever inside joke is the character John Webster, as an eager boy whose favorite part of the play was when Juliet stabbed herself.  Few viewers would know that he will grow up to become one of the next generation of English playwrites, famous for his use of blood and violence. The movie has beautiful cinematography, and even more beautiful and unrealistic language.  ""Love knows nothing of rank, or riverbanks."" Will says, arguing with Thomas Kent.  ""This is not life, Will, it is a stolen season."" says Viola.  She's right--but what a beautiful stolen season it is.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Absolutely Gorgeous,"For those who remember being forced to endure Shakespeare at school as a dusty, dry and thoroughly tedious affair, Shakespeare in Love is the film to change your mind! From start to finish, the film is colourful and captivating, and the audience is made quite aware of the tongue-in-cheek attitude with which it has been made. There are light-hearted references throughout regarding Shakespeare and his contemporaries, but even if you are a complete Shakespeare ignoramus, this won't hinder your enjoyment.Joseph Fiennes is stunning as the besotted Will Shakespeare and Gwyneth Paltrow's Viola convincingly balances the fine line between genteel Elizabethan Lady and feisty young woman. Supporting roles by Judi Dench, Geoffrey Rush and Tom Wilkinson add some excellent comedy touches. The performance of Romeo and Juliet within the film itself is the icing on the cake.I would equate the experience of watching SiL to watching a live theatrical performance - you are whisked away in a world of colour and splendour for 2 hours and you almost don't want to leave.

call me a romantic...,"This movie asks this question: what if William Shakespeare had lived the life of Romeo during the writing of Romeo and Juliet? As Shakespeare falls for a girl high above his rank, pursues her in shadows and behind stage walls, and comes to blows with her noble suitor and the whole of England, the action of Shakespeare in Love and scenes of Romeo and Juliet weave in and out of each other with style and grace.Stories such as these can usually be called contrived, and indeed might be called such here, but somehow, I just don't care. Maybe it's the artist in me, or maybe (and more probably) it's the acting, directing, and screen writing, but I couldn't help but be charmed, pulled in, and thoroughly affected by this wonderful film. At every turn the acting and writing managed to provide beautiful romance while sidestepping the dangers of being stilted and contrived as the two stories are made to coincide. The result is a natural, livable story that disarmed me and kept me with it dramatically. Paltrow's radiance and range pulled me in and I fell in love with her just as Shakespeare was. Fiennes's performance was just unassuming enough--then explosive!-- to make me let my guard down, empathize, fear, and hope with his character. The glorious ensemble cast, including the indomitable Judi Dench and the realistic and human Geoffrey Rush put the last nail in the coffin of any doubts.

"Good, but definitely not great.","After finally watching ""Shakespeare in Love"", I find myself not understanding what all the fuss was about. Sure, the costuming is excellent and the acting is very good across the board, but there really isn't anything here to elevate it above the status of an enjoyable romantic comedy.What really stops ""Shakespeare in Love"" from being a great film is the lack of a real climax.  The movie seems to be content with having a performance of Romeo and Juliet be its climax.  While it is an excellent stage production, it really doesn't provide any of the tension or emotion that is essential in this scene that the film has been building up to.  In fact, I found the entire movie to be lacking in this department; it doesn't involve the audience enough in what is happening.It is because of this fact that one should not watch ""Shakespeare in Love"" with the intention of finding anything out of the ordinary.  When it comes right down to it, ""Shakespeare in Love"" is certainly not a great film, and most definitely not the best one of 1998.

Best Movie Ever Made,"I watch a lot of movies.For about 40 years, I ranked Spartacus as the best ever made. Literate script, brilliant acting and a story that transcended age and time. How can you go wrong with a screenplay by Dalton Trumbo, direction by Stanley Kubrick and a cast that included Charles Laughton, Lawrence Olivier, Jean Simmons and Peter Ustinov? (Forget the fact that this was also the best work of Kirk Douglas - an underestimated actor - and Tony Curtis.) Then came Shakespeare In Love.There is, quite simply, no better movie ever made. For one thing, it has a truly perfect script. It is a Shakespeare play, within a Shakespeare play. All of the ingredients are there. Mistaken identities. Men playing women (and a woman playing a man!) A doomed romance. A tortured artist. Sex, love, and rock and roll. Pick your metaphor. Shakespeare in Love has it.The only problem this movie has, (and the only reason it isn't on IMDb's top ten) is that you have to actually have read and seen a little Shakespeare to appreciate it. This leaves out about 90% of the movie-going public, who can't even manage to shut up in the theatre, much less read a book occasionally.Too bad for them.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A Lord Wessex point of view.,"It is indeed a wonderful love story, a strong script, a strong cast; it's clever, intelligent and beautifully edited.Viola is a young and beautiful woman who falls for words and poetry, a bit like Roxanne in Cyrano de Bergerac, and as Shakespeare doesn't have a big nose, they fall in love. The big bad guy is supposed to be Lord Wessex and he could be bad I supposed if he weren't played by Colin Firth ( who delivers as always a delicate performance and gives a deep inner life to his character).Lord Wessex is a bit like Darcy in Pride and Prejudice: no one has a good opinion of him in the audience, Darcy is proud and distant, Lord Wessex is not romantic, raw and really doesn't have a clue about women. This could be the perfect beginning for a love story... that will never happened.  It is indeed a real mystery to me: How can Viola resist the first look of Lord Wessex in their first scene at the theater?As for Joseph Fiennes he is a good Shakespeare but I wonder how better it could have been if Shakespeare In Love had been made earlier and Colin Firth had had the part of Shakespeare as planned!

Not big and not clever,"Fair enough, 1998 may not have been the best year for Oscar contenders, but there were definitely some better movies than this out. Why not give the prize to Wes Anderson's 'Rushmore', or Todd Solondz's 'Happiness'. Why not be really controversial and look overseas, Sweden's 'Show Me Love' and Germany's 'Run Lola Run' are fabulous examples of film-making...and no doubt all films mentioned are massively superior to Shakespeare in Love. The Academy awards had already embarrassed themselves and proved that their shiny golden statuettes aren't worth the stand they're presented on with the handing over of 'Best Picture' to the abominable 'Titanic' over the massively superior 'LA Confidential', among others. I would have thought that they would want to redeem themselves in the eyes of their loyal followers the next year, but obviously they simply don't give a damn. In spite of having a good premise; a love story that fuses the central themes of Romeo and Juliet with events from the famous author's life, the film simply falls flat. It's a tedious and rather dull affair.I'm not saying that the crew didn't try to make the best of it; it's got energy and a camp style that would have been great if it wasn't out of place, but something is wrong and the movie just cant seem to give itself what it needs to succeed. Too many British films seem keen to implement camp British humour, and although it works now and again; it certainly doesn't always, and it is that implementation that is this movie's main vice. Because of it's campy style, it is difficult, if not impossible, to take the central romance seriously and because of that the film is never going to work. The humour does give the film an element of originality, but unfortunately it's one element that it is better off without. The cast is impressive, as it features a wealth of talent, but none impress much. Joseph Fiennes doesn't have enough charisma to take on a meaty role such as Shakespeare himself, and Gwyneth Paltrow simply looks out of place among the rest of the cast. On the whole, the film is neither funny nor touching and since those are things it strives to achieve, it fails.",5.0,Anonymous,History
An homage to Shakespeare and his times.,"`Shakespeare in Love' is a must-see movie. It is suspenseful, exciting, and romantic - all things a good movie should be. And, lets face it, there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.The film takes a real event (the creation of the play, `Romeo and Juliet') and presents a fictional reason why that event occurred. And if the fictional reason is plausible (as it is in `Shakespeare in Love'), then the movie can be fascinating for the audience. In the film, the reason behind the creation of the play was a fictional romance between Shakespeare and Viola.Several of the comedic situations in the film are classic Shakespeare. These are situations involving women dressed as men, mistaken identities, and the use of disguises. The comedy arises from the consequences of the characters being in these situations.The world created by the director feels real enough to step into. But you would have to be careful where you stepped. This was the point made by the incident where a bit of garbage (or sewage) was thrown out of a top floor window and narrowly missed one of the characters walking down the street. This was a fairly common event in Shakespearean London.In the film, the portrayal of the back-stage feeling the actors had when they were rehearsing or performing `Romeo and Juliet' was very real. I felt like I was there. The film made me feel what it would have been like to be in the audience who saw `Romeo and Juliet' for the very first time. How lucky that audience was!The scene where the stutterer presented the prologue is totally realistic. A stutterer suddenly getting his or her voice when giving a speech is a well-documented phenomenon. (By the way, the prologue, as presented by the character in `Shakespeare in Love' was far superior to the prologue in Baz Luhrmann's production of `Romeo and Juliet' - starring Leonardo DiCaprio. In my opinion, Luhrmann's `Romeo and Juliet' was a very poor interpretation of Shakespeare.)The film gives you an understanding of the oppressed role of women in Elizabethan England. You could really feel sorry for Viola being forced to marry a character like Wessex, just because Queen Elizabeth gave her approval - which was the same as a command. (The monarchy, at that time, was still a powerful institution - when the queen said jump, you jumped.)The business world of theater was believably portrayed, and you could understand the growth pangs of the industry. The film also demonstrated how money, in addition to Shakespeare's need to create, spurred the growth of the theater.The language in the play seemed like it belonged to the era. The movie slid effortlessly between the real Shakespearean language and the pseudo-Shakespearean language the screenwriter made up. (Imagine if the film had used 20th century English; it would have been totally jarring.)There were lots of in-jokes for Shakespearean fans. Check out the character holding the skull. (A homage to the grave yard scene in Hamlet.)`Shakespeare in Love' had a lot of clever touches. One I really liked was the scene where the Lord of Wessex thought that Shakespeare was a ghost.The acting was excellent. Colin Girth as the Lord of Wessex was a great villain. He seemed real, not just a caricature of evil. Joseph Finnes as Shakespeare was fantastic. You could really identify with him. Also, Gwyneth Paltrow was an excellent casting choice as Viola as she projected the right combination of strength and vulnerability. She was also a character one could identify with.`Shakespeare in Love' is a great film. Not only is it engaging, amusing, and suspenseful, it will bring Shakespeare to everyone. Shakespeare need no longer be the aloof and mysterious topic many imagine it to be. Not that the movie will make Shakespearean English any easier to understand, but it may motivate people to take that little bit of time necessary to understand the Shakespearean text and, thus, enjoy the play. Certainly they may want to see some of the excellent film versions of Shakespeare, such as Franco Zeffirelli's `Romeo and Juliet' (1968), Zeffirelli's 1990 `Hamlet' starring Mel Gibson, and Kenneth Branagh's 1996 production of `Hamlet.'The DVD has two excellent commentaries. They are well worth listening to.See this film, and you will know why it won seven academy awards.",,Anonymous,History

One of the Best Pictures of 1998,"To be clear about things, this is what Shakespeare in Love is.  Shakespeare in Love is a comedy of mistakes about one gentleman in Verona (or, in this case, Elizabethan England) desperately trying to concoct Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter by the Twenty First Night.Shakespearean puns aside, Shakespeare in Love actually does center about a young William Shakespeare (Joseph Finnes), writing a play on assignment known as Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter, in a period of no less than three weeks.  However, he is making much bother about something: the fact that William Shakespeare, one of history's most prolific playwrights, has writer's block.In former times, he was able to enjoy himself in adulterous fashion with everyone from the tired wives of Halifax to Othellina, the Mooress of Venice.  Not one of the eight wives of Henry VII can do a damn thing to complain about this lover.Now, however, he is Hamlet, serf of Sweden with his beloved Ophellia.  He has no inspiration, only angst.  He does not like it as it is. This is, however, until he finds himself smitten with Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow).  This temptress causes an emotional tempest.But, keeping with the pilgrim's passion, he lusts after a woman engaged (do I hear Prince Paris in the wings?), this time to Lord Wessex (played by Colin Firth, who lost another girlfriend to a Fiennes boy in The English Patient).  Lord Wessex comes across with all of the charm of Yiago, Othellina's trusted friend, but he does it in such a funny way that you have to love him.In fact, you have to love the entire movie.  The way that you see the evolution of Romeo and Ethel evolve into Romeo and Juliet while a similar play is being shown in their lives is a perfect postmodern device: used before and equally well with Rozencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, the highly satiric and intelligent play that launched Tom Stoppard onto the literary scene by telling the story of Hamlet from the view of the friends sent to spy upon him.Hey!  I went a paragraph without using a pun!  I'm going to my myself something from the merchant of Paris!The performances are worth writing sonnets about and put Caesar Augustus to shame, one of them already having earned a Golden Globe for Best Actress (Paltrow) and the movie is magical to watch.What is most interesting to watch, however, is the shrew taming that Stoppard demonstrates over his script.  Equally included are postmodern devices and plain old storytelling.   Grounding humor mixed in with things King Richard the First and Fourth could have been proud of, not to mention any of the Henrys.   Almost every line is tainted with Shakespearean reference.  So, when you see someone laughing their head off for almost no reason, let them: there probably isn't an un-funny line in the script.In fact, there are equally many lines there for just anyone.  The way it opens has Geoffrey Rush bartering a deal with a loan shark to save his feet from coals.  It has funny quips like, when Shakespeare begins talking in iambic pentameter, Rush saying ""prose, please"".The fact is that Shakespeare in love is incredibly funny, incredibly brilliant, incredibly beautiful.  It's exactly as I like it.  Next to Saving Private Ryan I would have to call it the best film of the year, and boy is it a close second.  Shakespeare buffs like myself will get all of the inside jokes, non-Shakespeare fans will be swept off their feet by the love story and by the humor that they'll get.  Everyone will enjoy, from Timon of the New York City Homeless Shelter to the King of Lears, Bill Gates.It doesn't even have an unhappy ending!

Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman wrote probably the most imaginative and best screenplay of this year. This screenplay is funny, touching, romantic, erotic, and in some cases, heart-breaking. One of the best acting performances this year came from this film. Joseph Fiennes is absolutely taintless as the troubled playwright. Geoffrey Rush gives a very funny and outstanding supporting performance. Ben Affleck also gives a well thought out performance as the upstart actor. But, this film's spotlight goes to the talented Gwyenth Paltrow. Although she has shown she can do period comedies in Emma, she shows she can be a demanding presence on screen as a lead role,as a love interest, and as a very interesting character actress. All in all, this is a film that everyone should see. This is on my Top Ten list as Best Films of 1998 and Best Film of the 90's.",10.0,Anonymous,History

It doesn't always make sense but it's a witty comical romance,"In London in 1593 the theatre industry is shaky for Will Shakespeare.  He's lost his muse and is struggling to write his new comedy `Romeo and Ethel the pirates daughter'.  Lady Viola Lesseps, frustrated by the theatre's lack of women dresses as a man and lands the part but also Shakespeare's heart. With the production in motion Shakespeare must battle forbidden love, debts and troublesome actors to produce his play.A far cry from a traditional piece this sees a colourful blend of tradition, comedy, modern wit and a sheer abandonment of history in favour of entertainment.  Even the cast shows the mix of theatre and populist culture, in it's inclusion of stage actors and a range of TV comedians from such as `the fast show'.  The story is absurd, but happily Stoppard and everyone else knows it and lets us know it as well.  For example Viola's poor `man' disguise is revealed by a boatman who says to Shakespeare that it wouldn't have fooled a child.  (Although in fairness Shakespeare himself used this device on many occasions).The story is full of romance and comedy is equal measures and is really well pulled off by all the cast.  The problems of the laziness in the script are well handled - as Henslowe keeps telling us `it'll work out, it always does'.  For example, Queen Victoria appears in full gear in a theatre - but had gone unnoticed for the whole performance.The cast are superb and play the whole thing with a huge amount of fun that is befitting the material.  Fiennes manages something that he rarely does - he is good!  Paltrow is OK, but definitely doesn't convince in the scenes where she acts as Juliet in the play.  Affleck is better but you can't help but feel that both American stars are only there to make it sellable in the US.  Judi Dench is only onscreen for about 10 minutes all told and she isn't that good - she is very cold and distant, not really allowed to give her Queen any character.  She won an Oscar but lets be honest - she was given that out of sympathy for her not getting it for her superb Queen Victoria in Mrs Brown.  She didn't deserve it for this, but then I suppose most Americans aren't smart enough to work out that this was a different film! The rest of the cast are really good made up of quality stage names and comedians - Rush, Wilkinson, Callow, Anthony Sher mix effortlessly with Martin Clunes and Simon Day.It's all a bit daft but it's done with such a sense of fun that it almost carries it off.  Enjoyable tosh posing as theatre!",,Anonymous,History
totally deserves the Oscars,"The movie is the story of young William Shakespeare in a lack of inspiration and with no money.

A gem of a movie,"What a wonderful surprise of a movie. I went into the theatre looking forward to this movie, but not quite certain it was going to be for me. I feared it may be over my head, or that it would be one of those films that left me with my eyebrows raised, wondering if the critics saw the same movie I did.Well they did see the same movie, and it is everything it's been hailed to be and more. I was enchanted by this film. It was one of the most cleverly written and unique movies I have seen in a long time. The parallels between what Will writes in his play and the actual plot of the movie were ingenious. Joseph Fiennes has been added to my list of must see actors, and Gwyneth was, once again, elegant and a joy to watch. The supporting cast was nothing short of brilliant, especially Geoffrey Rush, who stole every scene he was in.This movie is a gem from start to finish;  It's rare that I leave a movie wanting to turn right back around to see it again. I felt that way after Shakespeare in Love. It's the reason I keep going to movies-once in a great while you get lucky and find one like this.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Made for the 21st century sensibilities...,"Like so much Shakespeare I've seen on stage or screen for the last 40+ years, this is not William so much as earnest Shakespeare, with little magic in the handling of the language & lots of nyah-ha-ha acting. A pity because every generation seems to become more distanced from the real poetry that should be there. Alas, today, it all seems to have become...show & tell.

Romantic Bard,"The first time I viewed Shakespeare In Love, it was a romantic evening, and I think I got lucky. At my age, I don't always remember. Anyhow, the babe and I thought handsome Joseph Fiennes a romantic young Bard, and his impossible, indeed, star-crossed love, Gwenth Paltrow, delightful. For us fellows that have taken up the pen, Shake is a hero, and we're more than willing to imagine our less talented egos upon the master; therefore, making our pathetic literary dreams come true for at least ninety minutes.The second time around on DVD, ah, a popular Academy Award Winner it still is, but I had more reservations. You see, I began to desire the real thing. I wanted to see the actual play. I loved the set of the old Curtain Playhouse. I wanted to see Romeo and Juliet as the 1946, Olivia production, Henry V, had duplicated a Globe presentation.The problem, a lesser farce has been pinned to a great work of art. It's not the writer, Tom Stoppard's fault. I panned his Brazil, but I give him marks for a clever recreation of olden times and a romanticized Shakespeare, interesting.Oh, Paltrow's hair, long and flowing in her family mansion, short, boy cut on stage, I don't get it.

contrary to popular critique,"Let me say first that I am NOT a fan of this film.  Though I must say that the acting, directing, costumes and plot of the film were intelligently put together, I was nevertheless disappointed with the kind of ""passion"" that was portrayed in this film.  ""Passion"" IS NOT sex.  It is a fusion of love and desire.  In this movie, I saw the two main characters ""go at it"" because of this strong PHYSICAL attraction.  I'm not sure this is the kind of message we should sent to our society today.  As much as I am displeased with this film, I must say the writers were incredible and they did an absolutely amazing job of piecing everything together.

Sigh.  About the Oscar...,"Obviously it would have been more just to give the Best Picture award to ""Life is Beautiful"", but I'm in two minds as to whether or not this would have been a good thing.  Foreign language films have always been implicitly disqualified from being declared Best Picture, so much so that they have their own special category - so why not be honest and disqualify them explicitly?So let's rule ""Life is Beautiful"" out.  GIVEN the remaining nominees (""Elizabeth"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Thin Red Line""), I don't see how anyone could deny that ""Shakespeare in Love"" was at least a plausible choice.  Some people are understandably upset that Miramax ""bought"" the award, by advertising heavily, but this has been going on for decades - and at least Miramax had the grace to keep its advertising out of the film itself, unlike certain other entrants I could mention.  This is a film that was made first and entered into competition afterwards.  There's not a trace of pomposity about it, not a single character pointing out to us, for the benefit of the judges, that the script is profound.  Grandiloquent posturing has often won in the past (""Dances with Wolves"", ""Unforgiven"", ""Forrest Gump""), and I'm rather pleased that, at least this once, it didn't.  I'm also pleased that the award went to, loosely speaking, a comedy.  THAT hadn't happened for 21 years, and I'm not sure it will ever happen again.Anyway, I don't see how it could be that there are people who actually RESENT a film so beautiful, charming, and intelligent.  Granted, it tells us nothing about how Shakespeare created his plays, but how could it?  And would it be cinematically interesting even if it could?  I doubt it. ""Topsy-Turvy"" (possibly the best picture of 1999, by the way, and not even nominated) went into the nuts and bolts of staging a theatrical work in greater and more loving detail than any other film I've seen, but on the topic of primary creation - how Gilbert came up with his words, how Sullivan came up with his notes - it was silent.  What was there to say?""Shakespeare in Love"" is more concerned with what Shakespeare has in common with everyone else, and also what he has in common with other artists - even the untalented ones.  That it's not a serious historical account is established by the working title it offers of ""Romeo and Juliet"" - ""Romeo and Ethyl, the Pirate's Daughter"".  (It's a joke straight out of ""Blackadder"".)  The point is that we see a plausible picture of a genius living and breathing, which he does the same way everyone else does.By the way, if you want to see Geoffrey Rush at his best, in his best role, this is it.  He's perfect in his small role of eccentric theatre manager (although he fails to steal any scenes from more capable performers like Judi Dench, Joseph Fiennes, Colin Firth...).  He should stick to this kind of thing.  There is, as everyone has noticed, a distinct shortage of good character actors.",10.0,Anonymous,History
9 on a scale of 10,"I went to this movie in 1999 because it won an Oscar. I don't know Shakespeare and don't care - gobbledygook.

I enjoyed the movie, but I was dealing with major emotional issues literally during the movie and it affected my judgment. What I'm not sure of is whether it made my opinion of the movie stronger or weaker.For future reference.....It is not a good idea to go see a double story about the greatest unfulfilled loves in the history of storydom WITH the person who you are going through an emotional crisis with!

"Light-hearted fun, but...","Shakespeare in Love was a good movie, and I enjoyed it, but I walked away wondering what all the fuss was about.  It's a clever script, the acting is good, the set is superb...but in the end I found it rather ""fluffy"".  And it's up for how many Oscar nominations--11?Script?  Well maybe.  It's clever and fun and I think Shakespeare himself would have approved.Best picture?  Best director? I reckon Private Ryan was harder to produce, and so was Elizabeth, and both of those films would get my vote in these categories before this one.Best actress? Paltrow was good, yes, but her role wasn't that challenging, and her performance can't equal the complexity of Cate Blanchett's in Elizabeth.  In fact, I found her rather unattractive as a ""lad"" and wondered what Will could possibly see in him/her.  (I reckon this was a bit of a sop to that handful of Shakespearean scholars who maintain that Will was probably gay...)  Judi Dench was only on for a few minutes and didn't do anything other than handle her role and the fine script well...what any quality actor would do.This film was ""low-brow"" Shakespearean theatre at its best, and like the original Shakespeare comedies, it seems to be drawing all sorts of people into theatres for a taste of the Bard--and that's great.  The whole film--indeed the script--relies heavily on theatrical convention (Stoppard is, after all, best known for his stage plays) and it screens like a lively stage performance.  It's fun entertainment with some delightful performances, clever comic touches, and a fine script...but it surely isn't the best the year has to offer.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Not an accurate movie in any degree,"What a horrible pretentious movie. I mean, seriously.

Did they mention any of this? No. 2) Shakespeare was rumored to be bisexual. Any bisexual encounters? Not sure, didn't watch enough to know. 3) Shakespeare didn't have short, spiky hair. Hair like that didn't come around until 1998. ""The greatest love story never told""? How about ""The most horribly misleading love story that shouldn't have been told but we went ahead and did because we don't know how to do research""?

Style and Good Writing Conquer Big Budget and Special FX,"A joyous celebration of love, the theatre and creativity, Shakespeare in Love is one of the most lively and entertaining films to hit the movies in some time.  Here, the star isn't massive special effects, or big budgets splashed across the screen, but intelligent, witty writing and performances that touch the heart. When I saw this film for the first time, I worried that the writers would try to find a way to have a traditional happy ending, but having seen the name Tom Stoppard as one of the writers, I shouldn't have worried.  This is a film that stays true to its vision of the joys and sorrows of love, and how that love can drive us forward even in the worst of times.  Not only did I laugh, I felt good as I left the theatre. See it on the big screen if possible, and definitely a keeper when it's released on DVD and video.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant romantic comedy about birth of Romeo & Juliet,"It's pathetic to me that, because Big Harvey campaigned so very hard for this movie to win awards at the Oscars, somehow, because he is now benighted, Shakespeare in Love is therefore undeserving of its gongs and the beneficiary of some kind of underhand behaviour. What a load of tripe. People always have to swing like a pendulum in their collective, judgemental absurdity.Shakespeare in Love (1998) is a delightful, festive, humorous film. It has a script by Tom Stoppard. I'll write that name again. TOM STOPPARD. A great playwright, a worthy successor of The Bard, and of course one with a strong connection, his breakthrough play, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead. See the movie of that too, it's brilliant.Fiennes and Paltrow, Rush and Wilkinson, Staunton and Dench, Clunes and Willaims, and the list goes on: they're all superb in this film. It makes Shakespeare, often perceived as intimidating, fun, playful, joyous, romantic, emotional. British films are usually small, cheap, if they're by Curtis they're saccharine, or by Loach they're dreary. Here's a British film (American money) that is a festival of action, danger, desire, hilarity. It's one of those films that make one glad one went into a theatre at the multiplex to see a movie in company with a hundred strangers, with whom one then shares a happy experience, a communal understanding, an enriching one.Comedies have a right to be honoured too, not just sulky dramas about war or disease or poverty or pogrom.

The chemistry between Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow goes unmatched.  There are very smart, funny lines and cute little inside jokes for those of us that know the story of ""Romeo and Juliet"" well.  Ben Affleck has a small but hilarious role as a very theatrical hero, a leading man on all stages.  Gwyneth does a fabulous job with her role as an aspiring actress in a time when that is not allowed, forcing her to dress as a male to get on stage.  This leads to a few very funny scenes in the film.  And Joseph Fiennes gives the darkest, most powerful portrayal of the bard.  The two leads look good together and act well together.

Fine job of depicting Shakespeare,"Shakespeare in Love is a kind of flight of fancy about the source of Shakespeare's inspiration being a woman he fell in love with but could not have.  It should hardly come as a surprise to think that Shakespeare should have been inspired by being smitten, since so much of his best poetry emanates from characters who are in love, but the film portrays him as a struggling playwright who has recently been painstakingly penning a play called ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter"" and finding it unbearable.This is clearly before he had found his way as one of England's most prominent playwrights.  He is under pressure from the owner of The Rose, a theatre in fierce competition with The Curtain, across the river, where Richard Burbage has just stolen Will's latest play and presented it before the Queen.  The Rose itself is threatened by its moneylender, who wants to see a play on stage in two weeks that will fill the house and make him a fortune.  Meanwhile, all of the thespians auditioning have chosen to quote Marlowe as their demonstration.Obviously, history dictates that ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter"" will undergo signifigant changes before it hits the stage.  Shakespeare finds his will and pen being moved by his love for Lady Viola, a minor noblewoman who is due to be married to the arrogant Lord Wessex.  Wessex is suspicious of Will from their first meeting, and his worst fears are confirmed by the Queen, who interrogates Viola according to custom, to approve her for marriage, and then tells him, ""Have her then, but you'd be a lordly fool.  She's been plucked, and not by you.""  However, he thinks she is in love with Marlowe, since Shakespeare identifies himself as him.Soon, as the play gradually is shaped into what would become ""Romeo and Juliet"", Viola secretly auditions for the role of Romeo under the guise of a non-existent actor named Thomas Kent.  She is perfect for the role, except for the fact that she is a woman, and therefore barred from the stage. Paltrow gives a winning performance in a character that has to do a sort of Victor/Victoria switch, by playing a woman playing a male actor who plays a female part in a play.Judi Dench is one of the best things about the film, bringing her characteristic wit with her into her role of Queen Elizabeth.  She is sharp-tongued and unrelenting, but demonstrates subtle sympathy at a crucial moment.  I also enjoyed Joseph Fiennes as Will Shakespeare, who finds the right tone of the tormented artist without creeping into melodrama.  Tom Stoppard does a good job of bringing the language and readings to life.  See it even if you never read a word of Shakespeare.",,Anonymous,History
"Yes, Saving Private Ryan got robbed! But it's still a fine film!","Shakespeare in Love is an alright film. I like the casting of Tom Wilkinson, Imelda Staunton, Judi Dench, Anthony Sher, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Affleck, etc. It really is a first cast. The script is better than good, almost great. The directing is also first rate. But this is where I agree that another film by Steven Spielberg should have won the Best Picture for the Oscar. What Shakespeare lacked, Spielberg well provided for in his triumphant film of the Normandy landing. Yes, Tom Stoppard is a wonderful playwright, very cerebral, and it is a good love story. I don't think it was Paltrow's finest performance to date but then I like Shallow Hal better. The film is worthy to watch for historic and educational purposes. It is also a very entertaining film as well. It has a humorous moments. First of all, Judi should have won an Oscar for a role earlier in her performance in ""Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown.""

Great Movie,"Shakespeare in Love was an exceptional movie about William Shakespeare falling in love to help him create one of his most beloved plays Romeo and Juliet. The movie featured a relatively new director named John Madden, who had mostly directed or produced mostly TV series or TV movies. He didn't have to much experience when it came to big motion pictures, so it was already a little risky in inviting him to direct the movie. Luckily, the movie had casted some well-renowned actors including, Gwyneth Paltrow (Sliding Doors, Seven) and Ben Affleck (Academy award for screenplay in Good Will Hunting). Besides the cast, the movie contains a lot of references to Shakespeare that makes the film more enjoyable to those who love his plays. Some include the character Viola (Paltrow) dressing up as guy, which is a reference to Shakespeare's play Twelfth Night. Also, when Shakespeare is writing, a paper lands on a skull he has lying around, placing a reference to one of his most famous tragedies, Hamlet. With the many historical references and decent cast, the movie did exceptionally well as it won seven academy awards, including best motion picture and best leading actress (Paltrow). Overall, the movie was well done, leading a rise in fame for those involved, especially the main cast and director.",9.0,Anonymous,History

As good as they are saying and better,"This movie is perfect. I can't think of any way it could have been improved. I've never been much of a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow.  However, after this movie, I learn it was not because she has no talent, but rather there hasn't been a movie until now which aptly displayed her talent.  (Although I did think she was very touching in Seven. Tiny part though.)I predict that now Joseph Fiennes will become something of a matinee idol. His eyes just about make you want to jump on the screen.  Although he's not as conventionally handsome as Ralph, I must say he is much more sexy because he exudes a kind of warmth, energy and vitality which Ralph seems to lack. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't put either of them out if they showed up at my doorstep.However, I digress.  The supporting cast is superb.  The plot is incredibly clever. The weavings in and out between the play being performed and the story on the screen are jaw-droppingly well-done. The production values and costuming and make-up right down to the rotted-out teeth are completely authentic-looking. I can't say they are authentic because I didn't live then but they sure seemed to be. Kudos to the editors of this film.  The pacing is downright stimulating.And being a Shakespeare lover, I'm excited to think that a rash of new Shakespeare aficionadoes may be awakened by this movie.I must also say that it is incredibly, meltingly romantic and I'm a very very hard person to impress on that level.  I cried buckets and wanted to cry more but held back because I was in the middle of a sold-out theater. There is unbelievable chemistry between Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes. This is probably going to sound shallow but I was amazed considering Gwyneth's real squeeze, Ben Affleck, was in the cast and probably present for a lot of the physical contact between her and JF.  What an acting coup! IF she doesn't win the Oscar, I will be very disappointed.Geoffrey Rush was a scene stealer, and I also enjoyed Tom Wilkinson from Full Monty as the theater owner/apothecary.

I did, in fact, see all of the other nominated Best Actress candidates, and I have to say that Gwyneth was deserving of her award (wish there had been a tie with her and Cate, though).  Judi Dench was also highly worthy.  I can't say that this deserved Best Picture over ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but in any other year it certainly would have deserved the top prize and I can't do much complaining about its win. Very, very highly recommended and I'm looking forward to seeing it for a third time.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Shakespeare was never like this in school.,Luckily most of the dialogue is not like his plays we read in school. Very neat plot and superb acting.  Definitely deserved all its Oscar nominations.,9.0,Anonymous,History
Why the Oscars?,"I must say I was somewhat disappointed from seeing this movie. The queen and the costumes certainly deserved theirs, but for the rest I had expected something more. The story didn´t really grip me, and the abundance of love scenes didn´t help much. I had expected something more from an Oscar winner. Like I said, the queen deserved hers: her performance was strong, her tongue sharp as a knife, and she was very convincing in her role, being captured in her high position and obviously loathing everything around her and bored to death. Lord Wessex performed well too: I was impressed at his portrayal of the disgusting and spoiled nobleman.",5.0,Anonymous,History
One of my favorite movies!,"Shakespeare in Love is a film that you can see and feel the brilliance at the very start of the picture and it enchants you to a state of delight. The screenplay is the picture. It's an ideal screenplay that is unexpected to be so enthralling and clever. The film celebrates Shakespeare's life, explores his greatest writing achievements, most obviously being Romeo & Juliet, but other iconic pieces get a few homages. Fiction life imitates art so wonderfully, you could fool a naive man with a claim this was a fact-by-fact biography. Any theater/English influenced person could easily wish this story the way it all actually happened. It uses real-life fact to build the fiction, and it's still a hilarious, romantic movie to watch.Mirroring Romeo & Juliet for most of the film, Shakespeare in Love gets to explore ironies of social issues at the time and the ""truth and nature of love"". This film sets an example to non- artists, an artist's inspiration for their work. One of the easiest routes for producing wonderful writing, music, or paintings is love. Shakespeare in Love is one of the few romantic films that actually is completely successful in capturing love. Some say, you must go back to Shakespeare's original works to acquire great acting or truth in theater or entertainment, and Shakespeare in Love does successfully allow the lead couple act out Romeo & Juliet, but it also sets a precedent that all you need is good writing making romance and narrative just as tantalizing as the classics. A good deal of fun can be had by the audience watching Shakespeare in Love, it's also contains moments of hilarious comedy. But Shakespeare, Romeo & Juliet, and this movie prove Judi Dench's character, Queen Elizabeth, wrong on love, who claim that true love can never be captured in the theater.Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow dazzle in the depth of their strong characters and passionate romance. Paltrow has such powerful charm and lovability behind Viola and Fiennes creates a great depiction of the most popular scribe in history. Judi Dench's cameo is a wonderful addition. The costumes are a degree above other period piece's clothing design, enriched in creativity and elegance. The sets and cinematography are beautiful, the editing breaks down the wall of the viewer's imagination, and its underlined with a romantically epic musical score. The director, John Madden, makes all the risky components of a film with so many intricacies into a sweeping masterpiece, that's hard to sit through without smiling and even harder to leave with tears. Rating: 10/10; Grade: A+.",,Anonymous,History

Paltrow and the screenplay,"This film was a lot of fun.  The screenplay was brilliant.  Weaving actual events and made up events to create a witty comedy/period piece.I felt that the cast was great.  Paltrow outshone them all though as Viola De Lesseps. She was ultimately luminous and radiant, sporting an authentic English accent.  You actually think that she could inspire Shakespeare to write the play we love so dear now.  She deserves the Oscar that she is most likely to win (as does the screenplay).",9.0,Anonymous,History
Paltrow glows in giddy period comedy,"Knowing your Shakespeare is a help but not a must in this fictional episode from his life.  It is chock full of quotes and devices from his plays/sonnets, as well as knowing references to his contemporaries.  All performances are stellar, but most impressive is Gwyneth Paltrow's radiant depiction of Shakespeare's inspiration.  Not only can you feel her emotions but she must have the best accent coach in New York!  Judi Dench, Ben Affleck, Joseph Fiennes, and Geoffrey Rush throw themselves into their often amusing but never undimensional roles.Still, the joy of this movie for me was its appreciation for the words and the rapturous experience of writing them.  The swirling lovemaking/rehearsal scenes, especially that of the balcony scene, draw you anew into the workings of Shakespeare the Playwright Genius even as you listen to words you read/heard a million times in English class.  Maybe this film will kindle a love of Shakespeare's work in skeptical moviegoers who only give it a chance because of the cast list.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Superb,"I found that Shakespeare In Love was a superb film.  The view of  the creation of the greatest play ever written created an insightful look at what it may have been like in reality.  Of course: there's really no way to tell for sure I do not believe, but if the accounts that occur in Shakespeare In Love are indeed how Romeo & Juliet were written, then William Shakespeare's life must have been as grand as that of his plays.  The biggest regret I have after seeing this movie is that I was not born with four limbs, for surely it deserves more than 2 thumbs up .",9.0,Anonymous,History
What great movies are all about!,"""Shakespeare in Love"" was most certainly the best film of 1998. Brilliantly acted, beautifully photographed, refreshingly free of trendy special effects for the sake of special effects, and conveying genuine human emotion, it is what the best movies have always been about.Written, Directed, Produced and performed with obvious care if not love, this film addresses the intellect and the emotions as did the bard himself. Shakespeare would have approved of this paean to love and literature.It is incredibly accurate historically with one important exception. Christopher Marlowe was not killed in a mere tavern brawl. Indeed, the ""official"" story of Marlowe's death alleges that one Ingram Frizer killed Marlowe in self-defense as the two men argued over the ""bill"" or the ""reckoning"" as it was called at the time. But there is more to the story than that. It was not a tavern but a government ""safe house"" owned by Eleanor Bull who had connections to Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth I's master spy. Marlowe himself was known to have been in Walsingham's employ and had been since his Cambridge days. Marlowe was a spy.A number of scholars have raised compelling questions about the suspicious nature of Marlowe's death and have raised the possibility that he was murdered that night in Deptford. Shakespeare, himself, seemed to have been less than happy with the official coroner's report: ""When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room."" --William Shakespeare, ""As You Like It"".Clearly, this is a reference to Marlowe, his verses, and his death ""...in a little room"" in Deptford in 1593.""Shakespeare in Love"" is wittily rich in fact and allusion. Discerning audiences will appreciate it.",,Anonymous,History
Judi Dench outshines all!,"If you want to admire real acting then watch Judi Dench's performance as Queen Elizabeth. Her appearances are brief but immediately we feel we are in the presence of a royal personage. A toss of the head, a withering glance and some cutting remarks immediately establish her character.  We hang on her every word, every movement.  I found the character of young Will Shakespeare lacking in a certain warmth.  After all,Shakespeare was a man who could write on every aspect of human nature.  I thought the bustling crowd scenes were well executed down to the last detail and the Rose and Curtain theatres had just the right atmosphere.  The dialogue infused with Shakespeare's words from his famous plays was clever script-writing and should appeal to a wide audience.  But on the whole, despite some good individual performances, I expected more from an Academy Award winner for best film.  It must have been a nightmare for the director handling those energetic crowd scenes which he did so well. But perhaps he should have spent more time on Joseph's interpretation of young Will Shakespeare.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"It's a good movie, but it won a lot of Oscars that it didn't deserve.","Taking Shakespeare and transporting it to the cinema is always an audacious gesture, I have said it in other reviews and I repeat it. Here, however, what was transposed to the canvas was the author himself. At the end of the 17th century, we followed Shakespeare's struggle to survive in the artistic and literary world. Uninspired and in need of money, he tries to write a romantic play without success. Everything changes with Lady Viola, a young aristocrat in love with the theater who does not accept that women cannot step on the stage freely, deciding to enter the new production of Shakespeare disguised as a man.Of course, the script is entirely fictional and none of this has happened to the real bard. Despite the fact that the film is set at the right time and has some historical rigor in relation to the sets and costumes, the historical rigor ends there. The characters behave like us, in the middle of the 21st century, and reveal our mentality, not that of people four hundred years ago. In fact, the film skillfully mixes the two, so skillful that it can be dangerous and give the audience the idea that all of this was true or based on real facts from William Shakespeare's life. The film combines a good romance, the absurdity of the story told and a kind of silly humor that works well and makes the film light and pleasant. If you think about it too much, everything will fall apart, so it is better not to do it and let yourself go.Joseph Fiennes is good for the material he was given and what he was asked for. He knows how to be romantic when he has to be and funny when he has to. Gwyneth Paltrow is beautiful and makes a good pair with him, they get good chemistry. Ben Affleck is OK, Geoffrey Rush is funny. On the negative side, Judi Dench only appears because it is necessary and will play the queen.Now let's face it ... the film was highly awarded at the Oscars, with seven statuettes (Best Film, Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Soundtrack, Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction, Best Secondary Actress, Best Actress). But did the film deserve them? I honestly don't think so. The film is good, but not good enough to earn the highest award in the industry, especially when competing with much more serious and heavy films like ""Elizabeth"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"". Likewise, Paltrow doesn't look as good in this film as Cate Blanchet in ""Elizabeth"". Judy Dench almost won a career Oscar here because she doesn't even appear for ten minutes in the film. Personally, I think the film deserved only the awards for Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Soundtrack and Best Costume Design. But since I wasn't the one who awarded the prizes that day ...",5.0,Anonymous,History
For Love of the Play...,"It seems there's quite a bit of resentment directed towards this film, which I can't really understand.  Yes, it was a surprise that it won Best Picture as opposed to Saving Private Ryan, but I view both films as being totally different and equally as worthy of winning the award.  Shakespeare in Love is a beautiful love story, an incredibly funny and witty film, and a stunning visual masterpiece.  For anyone who loves Shakespeare, literature, or the theater, this film is a celebration of that world.  It is not a cliche - I can't think of any other film that similarly glorifies the fascinating world of the playhouse and the genius of the greatest playwright in history.  We are transported back to Elizabethan England to experience what it must have been like to witness Shakespeare performed for the first time, and it is an exhilarating experience.  If you've ever stood on a stage to take your bows, reveling in the applause from the audience, feeling that unique rush that only comes from a performance well-done, you'll appreciate this movie.  Take another look at this film if you've only seen it once, and keep what I've said in mind.",,Anonymous,History
Heart Opened Up ...... two hearts met each other,"Obviously this is a kind of movie that no one could love but at the same time academy can give it an Oscar.

But this movie is one of the few that very small population can understand. They can understand that this is a useless movie except the one point, it is useless to watch and can't be recommended to anyone except for one point, that whenever one finds fulfillment, one finds what he desires, one finds out his second part, he can cross any limit and can work in a much better way. This second part is not his soul but his dreams, his physical requirement, and his natural lust, which can be anything usually like beauty, power, respect etc. This 'portrayal' or the depiction of situation when two finds their desire and what goes on with their emotions is extremely nice, sensual, beautiful, and lustfully shown. The lack of control, flowing away and oozing emotions, lust all are just great in this movie. Other then this portrayal of emotions, there is nothing else in this movie to watch. Some good actors have acted so foolishly and even some got Oscar nominations. I have no idea of this but the idea and concept laid in the movie is extra ordinary and special, it is not important but it is different.The biggest conclusion that this movie unintentionally points to is that the ultimate Freedom and ultimate Fulfilment provides Capability of any kind and immense Happiness.

The more Shakespeare you know, the more references in the film you're going to get, and the more impressed you're going to be.It's an interesting hybrid, in the days of Post-Modernism when more movies are just referencing other movies.

"Well, some people like it","Clearly some people are able to enjoy this movie as a romantic comedy (I saw one comment headed 'Shakespeare would have been proud'), while others see it as trashy and misguided. My suggestion is that people who enjoy historical dramas, and insights into the creative process of staging etc., also take a look at Mike Leigh's 'Topsy Turvy'. Another era, a completely different kind of production to Shakespeare, but a movie that I think is far superior.Why? Well, Topsy Turvy engages with the actual work and era of the authors - in this case, the Victorian light opera writers Gilbert and Sullivan - whereas SinL makes no real effort to link to Shakespeare. Of course, lines are quoted all over the place, but the context is more Monty Python than anything resembling Shakespeare's world. The whole thing is so disconnected, it drifts aimlessly about grabbing bits and pieces of other genres, getting a few laughs from putting modern cabbie banter in the mouth of a river lighterman while attempting to insert a realistic Elizabeth I in the middle of high-stakes drama.Here was a golden opportunity to bring the past to life and show Shakespeare's work coming together in an accessible but believable way. Instead, Stoppard decided to simply dress up a dumb romance with the trappings of a another era to give it superficial originality.Not destined to be a classic.",1.0,Anonymous,History

The young bard gets inspiration,"This movie was definitely one of the top films for capturing the elements of a young Shakespeare in the Elizabethan age, all the while managing to entertain us.  Joseph Fiennes definitely establishes himself as a rising star in this one, and Gwyneth Paltrow portrays her character in a way I've never seen her do before.  Geoffrey Rush, as well as other more minor characters (such as Ben Affleck) round out a superb cast. The story itself is somewhat, but not altogether predictable, too.  It was interesting to see young Will visiting a crude psychologist, for example, because his quill would not write.  In addition, the inclusion of such literary/historical figures as Richard Burbage and Christopher Marlowe makes this movie somewhat educational as well.  Unfortunately, school classrooms will not be able to view this because of some sexual content that does, in fact, move the plot forward.

I've liked Paltrow since FLESH AND BONE in 1993, and here, she gives a performance full of zest, heart, humor, and shows the joy of acting at its purest.

The most delightful film I have seen all year!,"As a fan of all things Shakespeare I experienced all the emotions possible watching 'Shakespeare in Love'. From joy to passion, longing to loss.

Not meant as a a literal depiction of Shakespeare's life, the film gives us a what-if-it-happened-like-this scenario that takes us through the development of one of his most famous works 'Romeo and Juilet'. Finding his muse and true love in noblewoman Viola (Gwenyth Paltrow) who longs to trod the boards - a big no-no in Elizabethan England - Shakespeare creates 'R & J' around their romance and the circumstances that surround it. Although Paltrow is getting well-deserved raves for her performance, the real credit should go to Fiennes who breathes life into a man who has been seen for centuries as a literary icon, more than as a man. Fiennes carries us through the film sharing all of the emotions, tribulations, and triumphs that Will goes through.

This film is a must for all English majors and would even recommend this for high school students to show that William Shakespeare was a young man with mortal emotions and feelings and not some untouchable old man who liked to ""confuse"" people with his style of writing.I'll sum it up by recalling Vernon Shure's opinion...it is a great thrill to see a movie with substance while entertaining at the same time!",10.0,Anonymous,History

But this was just the beginning.This play serves as the ultimate turn-off for potential Shakespeare fans and established ones alike. Skeptical neophytes often dismiss Shakespeare, assuming that fans are merely drawn to Elizabethan pronouns, accents, and costumes. Their prejudice will be confirmed by this picture, if they assume this is a reflection of the real thing.The language is uninspired, even by Hollywood's standards. Bugs Bunny does a better job of twisting a line. The hallmarks of Shakespeare's writing go missing here.I wonder - how many people were tempted to read a Shakespeare play who never had, based on a viewing of this movie?

Lovely Story With a Lot of Thought Put Into It,".""Shakespeare in Love"" is well-documented movie that was literally taken by the heart by those who contributed in making the movie. The story focuses on the legendary playwright and legendary stage director William Shakespeare on his quest in search for inspiration to find a potential muse that would eventually lead to one of his best written plays of all time, ""Romeo and Juliet"". It takes you the events and tragedies that inspired him to write this endearing tragedy that has to this very day being one of the greatest plays ever written. Legenday playwright Mark Norman and Tom Stoppard mentioned in the DVD features that they were always curious of what kind of a person William Shakespeare was like before he reached the iconic level.Although nobody really has an accurate portrayal of the man, we are led to assume that he was no different than anybody else who was entering in the field of writing. ""Shakespeare in Love"" gives its audience the assumption that he was poorer than dirt, hungry for sex and most of all struggling to fit that final sentence into proper grammar. The historical account was very well in terms of accuracy as we get the feeling that we have stepped into the metaphoric time machine during the Elizabethan time period in England. We get the feel of the customs, the laws, the clothes and the mannerisms that the civilians of that generation lived. The DVD extras provide you with a lot of depth on what to expect in this provocative period piece.The one thing that short changed me a little bit was the lack of mentioning of the name Christopher Marlowe. For those who don't know who Mr. Marlowe, he was Shakespeare's apprentice who many also went as far to believe that he was Shakespeare's ghost writer. His life ended tragically when a tavern brawl ensued and he was beaten to death at the young age of 29. But the execution delivered here was handled so convincingly, it puts our skepticism to rest. Sure the lustful scenes at the beginning will surely fog up your lenses, but then again there are steamy romantic interludes in ""Romeo and Juliet"" so this should come as no surprise.The cast features an elaborate ensemble of talented performers to make this film more real and very captivating. The leads and supports all turned in sublime performances I'm not really sure which one stood out the most. Joseph Fiennes was excellent in the titular character He is the definitive Lothario who's light on his triumphs and failures. Gwyneth Paltrow was the right ingredient for the perfect muse for what would lead to the greatest and saddest tragedies to ever hit the center stage. Paltrow herself was probably the inspiration that Norman and Stoppard needed to create their modern day masterpiece. Colin Firth shines as the manipulative, conniving villain Lord Wessex and Ben Affleck was at the top of his game as the suave thespian Ned Alleyn.Alleyn doesn't come up on the acting spectrum on his own. He has a slew of other fine thespians all vying for their big break. In the beginning of the movie, the film has a soft and gentle feeling to it. In the second half, we see a more tragic and a more involving storyline as the film goes into progression. Dame Judy Dench feels right at home in the period piece genre as her majesty Queen Elizabeth I. Her costumes are so punctual to the period it feels like they should be exhibited at the Smithsonian itself. The costumes were just one of seven Oscar nominations this movie received. Other notables include Best Screenplay (Norman and Stoppard), Best Actress (Gwyneth Paltrow), Best Supporting Actress (Dench) and three others.

My only regret is that I hadn't seen it in the theatre before the academy awards so that I could know what the entire audience was truly cheering about. I hope that Gwyneth Paltrow continues to choose roles that allow us to see what a wonderful actress she is. I loved the way they combined some of the story lines of Shakespeare plays to add realism (inspiration) to the movie. Pleasantville might have been a tad more original but S.i.L. was truely the better picture. I enjoyed S.P.R. but it didn't need to win. It was a remarkable film in all aspects. The academy did independent studios a great service by letting Shakespeare in Love win. ***** out of *****",10.0,Anonymous,History
Highly Overrated!,"""Shakespeare in Love"" is nothing more than a nice little movie.  All of the media hype that it has received goes to show that good marketing can go a long way.  Best Art Direction of 1998? That honor should've gone to ""What Dreams May Come"". Best Costume Design of 1998?  Everyone who actually saw ""Elizabeth"" knows that film should've received that honor.  There's so much buzz about the ""Shakespeare in Love"" script.  The only interesting thing about the script consists of a few witty lines being said by the characters here and there in the movie, but that's it.  The best thing about ""Shakespeare in Love"", which was Joseph Fiennes' performance, was almost completely overlooked.  Judy Dench (who although is an excellent actress) was excessively praised for only eight minutes of screen time.  And of course, the most obvious ""praise"" that this film has received was for the overexposed and overrated Gwyneth Paltrow.  In this film, all she does is speak with a British accent, put on a boy's clothes and a mustache, and show her breasts--those are all things that could've been done by virtually any actress.  Yet, Gwyneth went on to win several awards for one of her most dull performances.  She gave a more challenging performance in ""Sliding Doors"".  Meanwhile, Cate Blanchett in ""Elizabeth"" was beyond overlooked for one of THE best performances ever. As far as ""Shakespeare in Love"" being considered the best film of the year: I thought it was one of the better films of 1998, but it certainly was not that year's best film.",,Anonymous,History
"Very good, but...","Here's the thing. I really enjoyed ""Shakespeare in Love."" I am a fan of Shakespeare's works, and even though I know this film is not the least bit historically accurate, I was still fascinated by this concept that Shakespeare's plays could have been inspired by a secret romance such as the one in the film. I loved watching how much his play ""Romeo and Juliet"" changed throughout the film and his romance evolved the play until it became the one we all know and love. There are great performances in this film, including a best actress Oscar for Gwenyth Palthrow. For me, the most noteworthy performance is Judi Dench, an absolutely flawless and funny performance as the Queen, for which she won a much-deserved supporting actress Academy Award. I do have a few small problems with this film. First, there are a few parts in the movie that come off a bit cheesy to me, such as Shakespeare pretending to be the maid by covering his head with a sheet. Also, what about a man dressed as a woman being mistaken for the woman pretending to be a man? I don't know. It seemed cheesy to me. With things like that in the film, it doesn't seem right that the film should win Best Picture, especially when it was up against two nearly perfect nominees, ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Life is Beautiful."" All in all, a fun and fascinating film, but not perfect. Had it not won Best Picture, I probably would not critique it so much, but despite that, I recommend it, especially to those interested in Shakespeare.***1/2 out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful,Beautiful","This has got to be one of my favorite movies.  Shakespeare in Love balances comedy, romance, drama, suspense, brilliant film making, and amazing performances. I must admit that at first I was somewhat skeptical, being a true lover of Shakespeare, I feared that this would be another historical documentary on his life.  However, I am so glad that it went beyond my expectations. The direction, cinematography, editing, and writing was of sheer brilliance. The costumes very absolutely breathtaking and gives the film it's beauty and mood. Never have I loved a cast so much.  Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Finnes, Geoffrey Rush, and Ben Affleck, just to name a few.  I always thought Paltrow was just a glamorous movie star but with Shakespeare, she proves that she can really act and not just act, but act well.  She deserves the Oscar for best actress because no one else could have portrayed Viola better than she can.  Joseph Finnes was just as brilliant.  The little brother of Ralph Finnes can act just as well.  The supporting cast was remarkable.  The movie would not have been what it is without them.  I absolutely adore Dame Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth! The score was beautiful.  Director John Madden cleverly weaved the score throughout the film, helping to add texture and bring out the genuine emotions of the film. Bottom line is: this is a must see film for all film lovers.  It doesn't matter if you like Shakespeare or not,  but as long as you love great films, you can't miss this one.  10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Spritely, clever, and funny; it has held up well","It's a romantic comedy set in 1593 in London, England. It follows several weeks in the life of William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) during his authorship of ""Romeo and Juliet."" He is still a young writer, establishing his reputation with theater owners Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) and Richard Burbage (Martin Clunes). He falls for a wealthy young woman, Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), who loves the theater and poses as a young man to play a role in the play. Some of the actors in the include Ned Alleyn (Ben Affleck), Ralph Bashford (Jim Carter), and Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson), who also financially backs the play.Viola is engaged, against her will, to pompous but poor Lord Wessex (Colin Firth). Wessex comes to suspect Christopher Marlowe (Rupert Everett) of seducing Viola. Queen Elizabeth I (Judi Dench) makes several remarkable appearances, as does Edmund Tilney (Simon Callow), the Queen's theater censor.""Shakespeare in Love"" is a delightful comedy that makes merry with many historical personages and the plot of ""Romeo and Juliet.""

missing credit to Caryl Brahms and SJ Simon,"This film is very substantially based on the book No Bed for Bacon by Caryl Brahms and SJ Simon - from the opening sequence of Shakespeare respelling his name, through most of the jokes and a substantial amount of the plot ( the love story between Will and a disguised Viola is just one among many labyrinthine subplots in the book), through to the light, witty but erudite feel of the writing, giving Elizabethen England a contemporary feel without losing the period detail (out of which comes much of the humour). It's one of my favourite books, and I missed a credit to it. It's a great read if you can find it. Why is it not there in the spinoff publications? Why has nobody mentioned it?

"I liked it. One HUGE quibble, tho...","Biased or not, I came out of the theatre feeling satisfied, but only such that can come from a calamari appetizer.The movie did not come from the greatest script. In fact, most if it was either derived from Shakespeare's own noggin, or taken directly out of his tragedy, Romeo and Juliet. It's an irony to find the peak moment of the movie to be the presentation of the play itself; the most unoriginal portion of the movie. Shakespeare's mellifluous words poured from the actors' lips with such craft that I dared wonder why they did not just do a better remake of Romeo and Juliet instead. In all fairness, the script had its clever moments, even with the borrowed creativity. Will's impersonation of Banquo's ghost was brilliance unexpected.(I do wonder, tho, whether the back story of the writer and actor's plight promoted some bias to the academy's judges. Not a bad point, mind you, just a theory =))My biggest rant, and it is quite big, aims at the way love was told in this story. It seems to me that the producers wanted to give the audience what they wanted, not what they needed. Love is good, and the fruits of such love should be just as wonderful. Hurrah for Will that his muse could inspire such beautiful words from him. Right?Has anyone forgotten about Mrs. Shakespeare? It disgusted me to see her portrayed as a hindrance! It doesn't surprise me anymore why people nowadays are so divorce-happy. And can one really attest that it was true love that brought Will and Viola together? I don't know, but the incessant sex with accompanied verse gave me an impression that these are just two souls who get a libido when reciting poetry.All in all, a good movie. But let's not cater to the masses' cravings for a few more pennies in the piggy bank next time. Please?",,Anonymous,History
A great film,"Although a little over-rated and it doesn't deserve all those Oscars, Shakespeare In Love is still a brilliant, funny, romantic film with excellent acting all round, including a brilliant turn from comedian Martin Clunes as Dick Burbidge. The setting is excellent as the times of 16th century England are captured effectively in the scenery and costumes. Joseph Fiennes is great as William Shakespeare who falls in love with Gwyneth Paltrow's Viola de Lesseps. Problems arise as Will is already married to Anne Hathaway and Viola can't go anywhere near him because he is at the theatre all the time and women aren't allowed on stage. Viola then dresses up as a man and Will thinks that he (Viola) is gay. But it all gets sorted out and they both love each other dearly and have to keep their affair quiet as Viola is due to marry Lord Wessex, played by Colin Firth. It is a delightful tale which shouldn't be missed even if it puts you off with the word 'Shakespeare'.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"I didn't think it was outstanding, but there's a lot to be said about Shakespeare","""Shakespeare in Love"" didn't jump out and shout 'I'm a classic movie and you will worship me for years to come' but it DID quietly whisper a subtle elegance in execution. Witty, charming, bawdy, dramatic... words to describe even the bard's own work. Though some people found some of the allusions a little esoteric, I was laughing most of the way. Shakespeare's own themes were reflected in the one screenplay - love, drama, passion, mistaken identities and misplaced affection... along with some slapstick fun.

Completely Overrated,"This movie shows the power of marketing. As history clearly records, the Weinsteins shoveled this thing down the throat of every Academy voter - the first instance of a studio bringing the ""academy campaign"" to the public's attention. They created a false buzz about how good the movie was, immediately setting off a ""me too"" reaction. No one wanted to be the critic who didn't ""get it."" The same thing later worked for that piece of high-school drama level garbage - ""Titanic.""Before this film was up for Oscar contention, all the payoffs, favors and heavy-handed sales-pitches went on behind closed doors. However, the scheme was a resounding success because this very mediocre film, with very decent, yet not exceptional, performances, took home three Oscars - including best film. To anyone who isn't aware of how Hollywood works, don't for one instance be fooled into thinking this was really the ""best picture"" of 1998. It just had the hardest-hitting academy campaign. And because it won best picture, some audiences have convinced themselves that what they saw was actually something special. Marketing - it can work miracles.As for the film itself, it is definitely a lot of fun to watch. While it's got its moments of melodrama, Fiennes is affable and does a nice job of giving a silly story some gravitas. Judi Dench, who laughably won the Oscar for best supporting actress, despite having only minutes of screen time (remember that campaign!) is quite effective - very cold but with a noticeable undercurrent of humor at the absurdity of the existence of a ""Queen."" The weakest performance is Paltro, who does a fine job, but never draws you in enough to care much about her character.

not much,"Close your eyes when Judi Dench speaks and I think you'll hear strong echoes of Bette Davis. As in ""The Private Lives Of Elizabeth and Essex"" and ""The Virgin Queen.""

I think anyone with a literary bent could unleash a torrent of interpretative explication on it. So, here goes nothin'.  The shipwreck is Death, the drowning victims are the innumerable generations of nobodies lost to History, and the survivor, Viola, is the Muse (Art), who, like her twin sister, Hope, [another survivor, trapped in the safety of Pandora's box,) crosses the barren wastes of chaos to the fertile forests of meaning and redemption.  If you study the composition of the closing shot, you'll see that the credits{text, language,} are superimposed over the treeline in the middle ground,  while the strolling figure of the Muse {Viola} traverses the barren sands {chaos}. If Shakespeare is considered as the great organizer of experience, then this scene invests his works with an organic fecundity that resonates throughout the ensuing historical attempts of war and capitalistic endeavors to stave off the inevitabile triumph of Thanantos.

Very Disappointing,"My first thought when I heard the plot of this movie was one word:  hokey. I mean, a woman dresses up as a man to be onstage and inspire Shakespeare, etc.  Come on -- we've had movie characters cross-dressing to get a job from ""Tootsie"" to ""Victor/Victoria"" to ""Mrs. Doubtfire.""  I couldn't understand how a plot like that could generate such hype.  But a friend of mine assured me that it was great, so I saw it anyway.  Unfortunately, my opinion of the film did not change much after I saw it.Nothing about the plot was original.  I kept waiting for a fantastic, new plot twist that would make me sit up and say ""wow.""  It just didn't happen though.  I mean, who could not watch this movie and just *know* that there would be a crisis right before the play that would threaten that (gasp!) the play might not go on?  Come on.  This movie wasn't all bad though.  The costumes and the settings were great and very colorful, and the directing was strong.  Also, the film did have some nice inside-jokes about literary characters, etc, such as the real reason why Chris Marlowe was killed, and some funny parodies of the Hollywood lifestyle, etc.  But inside jokes do not a great movie make.Now, I don't want to sound like this is a bad movie.  In fact, it was a rather enjoyable way to spend two hours or so.  But it simply didn't live up to the hype.  My thoughts on why it won the Oscar:  maybe the voters heard the English accents and fell into the usual American trap of assuming that anything with an English accent is automatically brilliant, intelligent and witty.  Or, they could have heard that Tom Stoppard wrote the script and done the same thing based on his reputation as being one of the premier playwrites of our day.  Perhaps Hollywood just loved the jokes on itself that were in the film and couldn't resist giving it all those Oscars. Whatever was the reason, I think it's  a shame that this film took many Oscars that other films deserve.  I would like to see how this movie stands up twenty years or so down the road.  Which movie will ultimately be more memorable -- this pleasant, slightly above run-of-the-mill comedy, or great movies like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""La Vita E Bella,"" or ""A Thin Red Line""?

"Shakespeare's ""Mighty Ducks""","First off, let me say I really wanted to like this movie. I'd heard nothing but great things about it, and a friend whose opinion I really trust said even not being a fan of Shakespeare that I would like it.Well, I didn't. I'm not a fan of Shakespeare, though I do appreciate the artistry of his works, and therefore much of the ""magic"" of this movie was lost on me. And that means what was left for me to see on the screen was a very middle-of-the-road romantic comedy with a plot right out of ""The Mighty Ducks,"" or any other come-from-behind sport movie you can think of. You've got a group of misfit actors (hockey players, baseball players, football players etc.) with a leader who's viewed as a loser by the public at large. He loves a girl who is dating a total jerk but because of social pressure their true love is to be denied. The home team is about to lose everything-- they can't get fans to pack the stands and are about to go out of business. Somehow Our Hero must turn his lovable band of losers into a cohesive team which he does through a series of wacky encounters. He even manages picks up supporters who were formerly against him, but see what he is trying to accomplish and lend their support. After much preparation, things look like they are going to fall into place. But right before the big game plans fall apart and the mood turns dark: the girlfriend is going to run off with the jock. The best players are sidelined. Some evil official is going to throw the game. The guy who can't do anything right is going to have to make a Big Play. My goodness, how will they ever overcome such odds?The same way they always do in movies like this. The girl dumps the jock and declares her love for The Hero. The home team pulls out a stunning victory by pure strength of heart that gets a standing-o from the spectators. Even the guy who couldn't do anything right even overcomes a disability and becomes a hero. The crowd goes wild as the underdogs come in for a big win. But it's not over yet! The evil official steps in to declare the underdogs cheated-- the game is lost! But wait! An even higher power (which usually makes an appearance earlier in the film expressing only a mild interest in the game) shows up out of NOWHERE to publicly humiliate the bad guys and to validate the victory of the ragtag band of misfits who worked so hard to accomplish their goals.This is a very cynical take on the film, but if you think about it, I think you'll agree that the plot is a very standard by-the-numbers affair. I thought the acting, direction and design of the movie were well done but I'd seen the story far too many times before, and ended up being bored as a result.

Amazing-romantic story,"I think Shakespeare in Love; which I see more than five times, is extremely good and lovely. It was directed by John Madden, produced by Marshall Herskovitz, Marc Norman and David Parfitt, and written by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard. The main characters are Joseph Fiennes as William Shakespeare, who is a handsome man, and Gwyneth Paltrow as Lady Fiona, a pretty and blond woman. This superb romantic, comedy and historical film was filmed in England and it happened in 1590. The film is about how Shakespeare finds the inspiration he has lost, to write Romeo and Ethel the pirate's daughter. He meets Lady Viola, with whom he falls in love, although she was engaged with a man called Lord Wessex. While they live an amazing and strong romance, he is writing the sonnets to the play. The plot changes from a comedy to a stunning drama. They read together feeling as if they are Romeo and Juliet. One day the Queen knows about the relationship and orders to Lord Wessex to marry her (Viola) as soon as possible. Unfortunately, they got married on the same day of the show time of the play. But on this day the main characters get ill and the only people who really know the script are both of them: Will and Lady Viola, so as the phrase says, "" the show has to continue"" they do it. The play was a box office hit. As I'm concerned it is my favorite film, The costumes are amazing and the scenery is exactly as those times.For me it is a comedy, drama and romantic-love story.

At the first of the movie she was intriguing and luring, but as the movie unfolded, she really became stale. I think that, other than Paltrow, the acting was great. The cinematography was great. The costumes were great. But really, folks, the story was lame. It was too basic and fundamental to keep my attention. And the sex scenes between Paltrow and Fiennes became excessive and unnecessary after the third one.

Charming theatrical fun,"This is one of those Best Picture winners that gets all the crap because it beat an obviously superior film, namely Saving Private Ryan. And yet, I feel like the backlash against John Madden's film is overwrought. Shakespeare in Love is a fun, witty comedy of a film, the kind of movie that people often say they want the Academy to award, a fun crowd-pleaser. It just happened to go up against one of Steven Spielberg's best accomplishments that hit a cultural vein upon its release. Oh, and The Thin Red Line should have won.Anyway, the story of Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) finding his muse in the Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a story that jumps head first into the lore around Shakespeare, the period in exacting detail, and revels in the words while providing that kind of look into an artist's life that never really feels real but can often be quite fun as he pulls details from the world around him to place into his work. The action is centered around his writing of Romeo and Juliet (the obvious choice because it's a romance and probably his most well-known play) and the business of theater. That business is centered around the owner of the Rose, Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush), who is in debt to Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson), only put off from burning Henslowe's feet because of the flurry of promises Henslowe makes about the upcoming play from Shakespeare, currently titled as Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.The problem is that Shakespeare is in the middle of a block, can't write, and has no idea what this play is supposed to be about. He goes from inspiration to inspiration, zeroing in on a woman named Rosaline (Sandra Reinton) before she betrays him with the Master of Revels Edmund Tilney (Simon Callow). His salvation comes in the form of the Lady Viola, so in love with the theater that she goes to every royal performance in front of Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench) and gets to the point where, with the help of her nurse (Imelda Staunton), dresses up as a man so she can act in the newest Shakespear play, taking on the name Thomas Kent.What gives the film its charm is so many different elements all running together, but I think part of it is that everyone just loves the theater. It's one of those films that takes a specific subject, like, say, food in Tampopo, and does everything it can to make the audience fall in love with the subject as much as those making the film. It's an infectious look at the ins and outs of theater, its writing, funding, and all of the intricate efforts to just keep the show going on. It's captured in things like Henslowe's insistence that everything will work out no matter what, having no explanation for how or why a plague shutdown of all theaters would just go away, and, of course, it does. Because this is a light comedy, and it's okay to introduce that kind of block and dismiss it just as quickly for a laugh.There's, of course, a romance to be dealt with, and it's two people connecting through the joys of theater, Shakespeare figuring out that Kent is actually a woman, keeping her secret, loving that she's a huge fan of his, and letting her become his new muse, injecting slivers of their little forbidden romance into his writing. It has no connection to the actual writing, influenced by the ancient writings on Troilus and Cressida, but it's a fun romantic fantasy. The performances from both Fiennes and Paltrow are lively and energetic, more than enough to help buoy the action beyond its rather thin premise. Their main obstacle is less their class differences but rather that Viola's father has agreed for Viola to be married to Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), a comically out of touch man who expects Viola to fall at his feet whenever he enters a room. I have to end up comparing him to Cal in Titanic, and I feel that Wessex works better not only because Firth is a better actor than Billy Zane but also because it's treated lightly and comically in general. It's a tone thing.Another aspect that really helps is, touched on already, is the ensemble behind the main two from Rush to Wilkinson to Ben Affleck as the self-involved actor Ned Alleyn, lied into his role of Mercutio as the lead and steadily realizing it while also being one of the only people in the troupe to realize that he's in something good, everyone else too busy and distracted to see beyond the next unwritten page to see the larger picture. That all comes together during the first performance, sort of done illegally but just within the law to get it going, as all of the actors work through their issues, including Shakespeare having to take the part of Romeo after Viola was found out, Viola taking the part of Juliet when the young man playing the role suddenly has his voice drop, and the whole thing coming crashing down when Tilney comes to shut the play down.It's a comic series of events, played lightly and entertainingly by a game cast that never lets itself take the material too seriously. It does try for some emotional heft with the central romance, working well enough but operating on rather conventional and cliched grounds while the rest of the movie around it is too in love with the theater and its machinations to really give the romance the kind of tonal attention it probably needs to soar above the rest of the film around it.Still, the rest of the film is witty and fun. It's a good bit of fun. I really enjoy revisiting it once every few years to rediscover its pleasures. Everyone is game. Everyone is having fun playing around an amusing script in a well-realized recreation of sixteenth century London. Sure, Saving Private Ryan deserved it more, but Shakespeare in Love is a fun addition to the list. Also, The Thin Red Line was the film that really deserved it.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"The inspiration of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, with a twist.","""Shakespeare in Love"" demonstrates the ability to mix good humor with romance and sincere drama.  So many movies seem to lack chemistry between the main characters, but this is should not be included.  I warn you, many jokes refer to other Shakespeare work so you may not quite understand why half the audience is laughing when you didn't think the line was very funny.The movie could be considered one of my favorites.  The acting was superb, and the plot ever so carefully laid out.  It gives a personal life behind Shakespeare, but also puts his work into perspective.  If it had been based on a true story, it would have been incredible.  The writer's imagination and knowledge of Shakespeare makes the movie even more enlightening.4.5 stars out of 5",10.0,Anonymous,History
Delightful speculation on Shakespeare's life,"John Madden has made the historical adaptation his own with Mrs. Brown, Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love. He knows that it's detail that matters in period dramas. In this delightful speculation on Shakespeare's life fans of the bard will enjoy the comic references such as his constant practising of his signature and his rivalry with Christopher Marlowe. Joseph Fiennes is cast as a very cool, unbuttoned shirted Shakespeare and his romance with Gwyneth Paltrow's Viola is convincing and beautiful. In fact, the casting is one of the best things about this film. So many great British actors such as Colin Firth, Simon Callow, Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson and Rupert Everett bring charm and grace to the picture. Comic turns from Martin Clunes, Simon Day and Mark Williams keep the film's tone comical but not distracting from the serious themes. The comic tone of the film is important because one must remember none of this actually happened. It's all a speculation based on certain facts. The encounter between Shakespeare and Marlowe is particularly enjoyable,similar to Chaucer appearing in A Knight's Tale. It comments on their, perhaps friendly, rivalry and overflows with nods to the audience. Although there are a few inaccuracies such as Shakespeare's muse being a woman (it is clear from his sonnets that most of them were written for a man. Maybe a film about Shakespeare's male romances would be more interesting considering that homosexuality was even more of a taboo back then) most of them are comic and done on purpose. This comical aspect stops people criticising the film for being overly misleading and fictitious. Shakespeare in Love is supposed to be an emotional yet lighthearted movie-going experience. Although there are purposeful comic inaccuracies the detail is another fascinating thing about this film. From the muddy streets and falling excrement to The Rose theatre, the authentication is astounding. The theatre really looks like the Globe in London, maybe it is. The costumes and other sets are also very realistic; you can just feel the tightness of the corsets and the softness and tangibility of the costumes. It shouldn't have won the Best Picture Oscar but its these beautifully detailed sets and costumes which secured it. Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard even make the script authentically Shakespearean with the gender confusion, exploration of love and the somewhat tragic aspects later in the film. Shakespeare in Love is an astoundingly beautiful and detailed work with such great acting talent and amusing script that it will keep audiences dazzled and delighted for years to come.",5.0,Anonymous,History

A moment in time,"Great movies often contain memorable scenes. Sections of film which are done so well, crafted with such care that they stay with us and define all that makes film going the experience it can and should be.

The premier of a new play galvanizes the high and the low. Indeed, the groundlings can't be restrained. They want in and so does the viewer. Pan shots convey the excitement and set the table for what comes next.

Everything A Movie Should Be! Just Not The Best Of 1998.,"I am a huge Shakespeare fan, so I found this movie very captivating and well-done. This had everything a movie should have to high degrees. That is why it won so many awards. Thing is, as much as other say, this is not 1998's best movie. Like others, I agree that Saving Private Ryan is the best. But my personal favourite is American History X, as it has the best acting and I have a deep personal connection with it. But SIL is a better piece of film than AHX. If I'm not mistaken, Shakespeare In Love is mostly fictitious. So the script writers came up with their own dialogue in Elizabethan language. Do you know how hard Elizabethan language is to comprehend and write? The movie being Elizabethan impressed the heck out of me. The whole movie isn't Elizabethan, but the parts that are, I am proud of. The sets and costumes are breathtaking and the acting is very good too. The whole style covers up an ordinary love story: William Shakespeare is writing Romeo & Juliet and falls in love with wannabe female actor pretending to be a boy. They fall madly in love, and it helps him with the story and with future plays. But there's rivals and feuds that get in the way. Sounds dull and unoriginal? Well, it's not Truman Show or Life Is Beautiful, but the script, music, acting, sets, and subplots are enough to make this movie very lovable. Sure it has its dumb moments, but not enough to ruin a perfectly fine movie.I must say this again. Shakespeare In Love has everything a movie should have.",10.0,Anonymous,History

So many Oscars...,"Why? Why does this movie have so many Oscars? I guess I would never know. But, well, since I am not much of a fan of the romantic comedies I decided to see the movie just because it has so many awards and the critics said it is a great life-changing movie. I think I will never thrust the critics again.The movie itself is quite entertaining, the decoration is beautiful and it is an almost good fairy tale. But here is the problem. 'Shakespeare in Love' isn't any better than a made for TV Disney movie. It doesn't deserve all these Oscars and nominations. While most of the actors are great they don't have anything to act. I can't even remember Geoffrey Rush's character. Yet, he has an Oscar nomination for this movie. And why did the Academy even nominate Judi Dench? She is a great actress really but she had less than ten minutes screen time. I am saying screen time, not acting. It is kind of insulting to her talent to get the Oscar for a movie in which she doesn't have anything to play. I would be much more happy even if she was nominated for the role of M in the Bond movies. And what's it with the best writing award? This is just another story of how love defeats anything. No one would even notice it if there was not Shakespeare's name in the title. There are thousands love stories better than that. What makes this one so special? Well, that is it. I didn't like the movie. May be if there weren't so many undeserved awards I would rate it with 5/10 or 6/10. But with so many Oscars it should have been much better.",1.0,Anonymous,History

"""SHAKESPEARE IN LUST"" would have been a more appropriate title...","""Playwrites teach us nothing of love"" says Queen Elizabeth in this film. She might as well add ""either do screenwriters....""""Shakespeare in Love"" has many qualities that make it a better than average film.   The sets are excellent, the costumes are beautiful, and the acting,for the most part, was first rate.   The script is witty, and filled with cute, little ""inside jokes"" for those familiar with the plays and literature of Elizabethan England.That being said, in my opinion there are some serious flaws, which cause it to be quite a bit inferior to other films nominated for the 98 Oscars.  Yet it is obvious that what I consider to be ""flaws,"" Hollywood considers ""virtues.""   My review is for those who find this film to be less than virtuous.The only thing this film has in common with the historical Shakespeare is the name ""Shakespeare.""   This is a highly fictionalized account of his life; however, I do not consider this a flaw.   It is obvious that the writers are using Shakespeare as a vehicle to create a parable of the Hollywood film industry, complete with sex, money and psychoanalysts.  The use of Shakespeare for this end is actually quite clever.  In this day and age, where biographers feel free to inject themselves as a fictional character into the ""historical""  biographies they write, then this fictionalization of Shakespeare is par for the course.   The screenwriters also are interested in presenting a possible motivation for Shakespeare's writing of ""Romeo and Juliet:"" Shakespeare was madly in love at the time. Yet it is in the handling of the ""love"" story that I've encountered the film's most serious flaw.The film's two lead characters; ""Shakespeare"" played by Joe Fiennes and ""Viola"" played be Gwyneth Paltrow; have a mutual ""love-at-first-sight"" attraction to each another.   This attraction is quickly followed up by consummation in Viola's bedroom - an activity in which the two of them engage in rather frequently throughout the course of the film.  Often they recite lines from ""Romeo and Juliet"" to each other while copulating.About midway through the film, Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench) states ""Playwrites teach us nothing of love;  they make it pretty, they make it comical or they make it lust - they cannot make it true."" This piece of dialogue is the hinge upon which this whole film turns - and with it a wager is struck in response to the queen's  query: ""Can a play show us the very truth and nature in love?""Of course a play can show us the very truth and nature in love - hence the film's thesis: the motivation behind Shakespeare's writing of ""Romeo and Juliet!""  Unfortunately, the film attempts, by association,  to take that challenge upon itself as well.  In my opinion, it fails miserably.   This is just another example of a pretty, comical, and lusty Hollywood film - nothing more.  I did not come away with an enlightened viewpoint of love and truth - rather I thought it more of a highbrow pseudo porn flick.  Sorry - two lovers reciting Shakespeare to each other while doing the horizontal bop does not bring clarity to the meaning of ""love"" to this reviewer.As I stated earlier, this is not an Oscar caliber film, and didn't even deserve the nomination.  All the other nominated films were far more ambitious and told much more compelling stories.  So why then DID this film get nominated - let alone win best picture???Well, one has to keep in perspective the two films before it that have won Oscars - ""The English Patient"" and ""Titanic.""   ""Shakespeare in Love"" kept lockstep with the philosophical underpinnings of those two films, and by towing the party line, endeared itself to the Hollywood elite who votes for these things.""The English Patient"", ""Titanic"", and ""Shakespeare in Love"" all deal with a woman either promised to or married to a man who they either despise or find less than desirable.   Then comes along the ""love of their lives,"" and, despite the woman's engagement/marriage convenant, they go  off and embrace their ""forbidden love.""  Hence we are subtlety told that marriage/engagement is an evil that keeps one from finding true happiness.  In order for these films to work, they have to resort to times and places where woman had much less freedom of choice than they do today.  But the underlying message remains the same for all three.In Hollywood USA, marriage is probably viewed in that way by many involved in the entertainment industry: a sort of ancient, masochistic custom that has outlived its usefulness.  Any film that portrays marriage as an obstacle rather than a blessing finds quite a receptive audience amongst the moral relativists who make up the film industry.  (One wonders why many entertainers even bother with marriage at all.Keeping this in mind, one sees how the other films could not possibly win.""Elizabeth"" shows the process by which QE1 becomes the ""virgin queen.""   If there's any subject that could be considered taboo in Hollywood, then virginity has to be it.  Hence, this film didn't have a chance.`Saving Private Ryan' was a throwback to old fashioned ideas like ""duty,' ""honor,"" and worst of all, ""self-sacrifice"" - none of which play that well in modern day Southern California (except when the sacrifice of self is used for the preservation of the ""forbidden love..."")    ""The Thin Red Line"" - makes the terrible error of showing how one's adultery can have a rather negative impact on the adulterer's spouse - a concept unheard of in the land of self-indulgence without consequences.   And don't even get me started on ""Life is Beautiful....""If you think that ""Shakespeare in Love"" WAS the best film of '98, then I have a few others for you to try on for size: ""Savior,"" ""Pi,"" ""Rushmore"" and ""Dark City.""  They all are far more compelling than SIL could ever hope to be.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Very Good,"Oddly enough, there seem to be a number of negative comments regarding this movie. Unfortunately, I think many people saw it AFTER it won the awards and got lots of praise and found that it did not quite live up to their high expectations.In my opinion, however, it is a very good film. It is surprising, actually, that it was not made before - very little is known about Shakespeare's personal life, and much of what we consider ""fact"" is still uncertain. This leaves quite a lot of room for experimentation.The plot was nice, and it was lots of fun to see common themes from Shakespeare's plays appearing in the film. The only problem I had was the fact that Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) was disguised as a boy. I think it was used because women disguised as men often appear in Shakespeare's plays, but it is an overused concept. Every novel of historical fiction that I have read about Shakespeare uses this, and it gets a bit dull after awhile.As for the acting, it was very well done. Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow were good in the leads, and I particularly enjoyed Ben Affleck's performance as Ned Alleyn. In an uncredited performance as Kit Marlowe (he only appeared for a few minutes), Rupert Everett was as good as ever, and I wish that we'd seen more of him. His character is discussed throughout the film and has even convinced me to read some Marlowe which I have never done.Overall, I enjoyed it very much, and I think it deserved the awards it won.",,Anonymous,History

It's finest features, however, lie in the simple telling of Shakespeare's stories.  Joseph Finnes explanation to the players of Romeo and Juliet resolution is stunning.  Gweneth Paltrow gives an exquisite performance as Young Will's adulterous love, yet scholars may argue that the vision in much of Shakespeare's writing would not reflect her, but someone much different.

A Better Love Story Than Romeo and Juliet Itself...,"England, 1589. A young playwright named Will Shakespeare is trying to start a new play. He is up on a ""deadline"" and rival playhouses are all over him to produce the work. It seems Will can only write about something personal to him, for instance, his latest muse. Romeo and Rosalind, he'll call it. No, Romeo and the Pirate's Daughter? Not a good title. Will doesn't know it, but an unknown, upper-class wannabe actor/actress up for a part in his unwritten play will be his Juliet. Shakespeare IN LOVE, John Madden's winner for best picture of 1998, presents this speculative story of a struggling literary giant with such originality and sensibility, it may surpass Mr. Shakespeare's own fable of forbidden love.Joseph Fiennes IS Willie Shakespeare in a performance so strong and passionate, it is simply amazing how overlooked it was. The film is written so well, the words erupt from the actor's mouths much like Shakespeare's own plays do. Screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard even address the long-time myth that Shakespeare was not the sole creator of the most famous literature ever written. Collaboration comes from suggestions in a pub, speakers in the street, and real-life experiences. Could it be that the Bard himself also took his own life experiences and filtered them into his own work? Maybe. It is certainly a practice universally performed by modern writers, authors, and poets. This is Shakespeare IN LOVE's premise and the love story portrayed is both eloquent and sensual.Gwyneth Paltrow is the object of Will's affection and superb at recreating Elizabethan charm. You find yourself falling in love with her. ""Romeo and Juliet"" comes about through their experiences together. Fiennes even climbs a tree up to Paltrow's balcony, a great moment from the play. This is all juxtaposed with the play's rehearsal. These scenes are tender, but they also inspire laughter because of what we already know about the story of Romeo and Juliet. Geoffrey Rush provides some more comic relief in a screenplay with so much depth, it is a unique work of art. Each character is given enough screen time to make an impression on us. Even Dame Judi Dench's 8 minutes of Oscar-winning acting is a treat.I've never seen Shakespeare himself portrayed. This is pure fiction, but Fiennes breathes life into the mysterious figure behind so many colossal texts. For Shakespeare illiterates, you can still enjoy the picture. Everyone speaks in prose, not poetry. A general knowledge of Romeo and Juliet would be helpful, however. The film looks and feels of the time, but a great love story of the 16th century is brought to life in 20th century cinematic fashion. Did it deserve the Best Picture award? No. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did. No matter. It is a true wonder to watch.RATING: 10 of 10",,Anonymous,History

Bravo!,"In a holiday season so full of movies that so closely missed their mark and earned a respectable four out of five stars, it's quite a breath of fresh air to finally see a film so deserving of a full five out of five. Wonderful acting is combined with a brilliant screenplay and meticulous attention to being a period piece in John Madden's latest film, ""Shakespeare in Love.""While the premise is somewhat kitschy, the screenplay is brilliantly run along its lines and the acting is just superb. Joseph Fiennes plays a struggling young William Shakespeare who finds that his writing abilities have been of late dissipating rapidly. In desperation, he tries to launch a new play, prematurely entitled ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.""At tryouts, Shakespeare is none too impressed with the abilities of the players until the final actor takes the stage. This actor, however, is reluctant to be encountered by the over-eager Shakespeare and makes a hasty retreat.All is shown to the audience that this actor is truly Viola De Lesseps, who is soon to be betrothed to the detestable Lord Wessex, played by Colin Firth. However, as women were not allowed to enter onto the theatre stage in 1593, Viola continues to assume the identity of a man and returns to the playhouse, only to be cast in the part of Romeo.Viola's ruse is soon discovered by Shakespeare and they fall madly in love, which is where the movie really takes off. Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow are magnificent together and absolutely shimmer onscreen. The screenplay, by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, is a treat in itself and even some of Shakespeare's writing is creatively interspersed in the script.Truly a film not to be missed and one that will hopefully enjoyed by many this holiday season.

The performances of the lead players was in my mind rather ordinary, (Tom Wilkinson had by far the best lines) and I left fearing critics alike had - rather predictably - gotten caught up with the bardwagon.Having shared my views with others I'm tired of hearing 'oh but you must have missed the clever references to some of Shakespeare's finest works..'

The Bard would be rolling in his grave over this twee romp.,"Seven Oscars(tm)? How could the Academy have got it so wrong?The first, and most crucial failing of Shakespeare in Love (SinL) is that it attempts to set a love story against Romeo and Juliet, the greatest love story in English literature. What we are presented with is a twee excuse to throw around some clever' Shakespearian allusions from terribly boring characters in a film which ultimately offers no genuine insights for the audience.The first hour of SinL rolls on happily enough and I was eager to play along with the notion that The Bard's inspiration for Romeo and Juliet came from his own lovelorn life. But then it dawned on me. There is nothing actually being delivered. The gags are forced. The ham-fisted direction clearly telegraphs plot progression so any tension is lost. Which leaves us, poor viewer, with the romantic musings between Joseph Fiennes as Shakespeare and Gwyneth Paltrow as aristocratic Viola De Lesseps.These two spend an enormous amount of time spouting Shakespeare-lite' dialogue to each other that will make even the most strong of stomach feel queasy. The only real respite comes from two lame swordfights that come so out of the blue as to be just irrelevant swash-buckling.Fiennes brings only two facial expressions to his role in SinL: Wide-eyed and worried and wide-eyed and besotted. Paltrow offers a little more and exhibits some flashes of passion. Dame Judi Dench, however, is a high-camp parody of Queen Elizabeth. The only real use she and her character provide is delivery of a conclusion to try and desperately wrap up this lame gambol. Lets not even mention Geoffrey Rush.As for the depiction of Elizabethan England hailed in other reviews, does it occur to anyone that we only see two city' streets? A vision of sprawling, plaque-ridden London this does not make. Indeed, the two theatres in which many scenes are set are clearly the same set, only one with a little more aesthetic trimming. Yawn.However, even this jaded viewer suddenly found himself engaged by SinL. Finally, Romeo and Juliet gets performed and we get a few tantalising scenes from the play. I must admit my spine tingled. But what does that say when the best parts of a film were written four hundred years ago.The film does nothing to dispel the cliche notion either of Shakespeare being the domain of men in tights but it will hopefully whet the appetite of the uninitiated.Otherwise, forget this nonsense and wrap your eyes around the real deal. Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet is an excellent presentation of the play in a contemporary setting and is hugely entertaining. Something Shakespeare in Love falls way short of.",,Anonymous,History

Even Ben Afleck is perfectly cast as the Big Name Actor wheedled into the production in order to cement a deal with the Money.

A Charming and Witty Love Letter to Theater and Romance,"Shakespeare in Love is a delightful blend of romance, comedy, and historical fiction, offering a playful reimagining of how the Bard found inspiration for Romeo and Juliet. The screenplay is sharp, filled with witty dialogue and clever references that theater lovers will appreciate.Gwyneth Paltrow shines in one of her most memorable roles, bringing warmth and charm to the film, while Joseph Fiennes embodies Shakespeare with passion and vulnerability. The supporting cast, including Geoffrey Rush and Judi Dench, adds depth and humor to the story, making every scene engaging.

disappointment.,"I had high hopes for this film, and overall I was let down. Although all the actors performed admirably, and the writing was jaunty, the overall fabric of the film was gauzy and torn with cliches. I would expect more from Stoppard after Rozencrantz and Guildernstern. If you've seen Romeo and Juliet, you've basically seen this movie. Considering R&J is my least favorite Shakespearean play, I'm not surprised that I didn't like it. Much of the plot centers around the juxtaposition of Shakespeare's ""real life"" as it influenced the writing of R&J.The bright side of this film was the comedic element, which was refreshing and witty. However, it hardly could compensate for the triteness of the love story, in my opinion. Actually, Branaugh's A Midwinter's Tale was a much better film about the production of a Shakespearean piece (Hamlet), although it didn't star the Bard himself. Not to be a historical stickler (especially due to the fact that there is little hard biographical evidence about the life of Shakespeare) but the film also lost points with me for venturing so far into the realm of speculation and fiction.Overall, I would recommend this film to anyone who is fond of Romeo and Juliet, or of ""timeless love stories."" People not familiar with Shakespeare (works or life) will be able to enjoy the witty humor and trotting pace of this film. Yet for the rest of us, it would be best to wait for two for one rental night.",5.0,Anonymous,History

A wonderful film,"Shakespeare in Love is a film about great literature disguised as a romantic comedy.  By following the romance and adventure of two very sympathetic characters (Shakespeare and Viola), the audience is shown the magic of great literature.  Generations of high school students have been force-fed the works of the Bard without being given any feeling for how truly special they are.  This film personalizes the romance, the comedy, and the profound sadness of Shakespeare's work.  Above all else, it is accessible.  A filmgoer with very little knowledge of Shakespeare can leave this film with a greater appreciation for and interest in his works.All of the performances are wonderful, but special mention goes to Geoffrey Rush as an hilariously bedraggled theatre owner.Incidentally, try not to judge the historical facts of the film too closely.

"Fun, entertaining, but not as rich as Elizabeth","If you liked Elizabeth, you will probably enjoy this lighthearted romp.  If you do enjoy Shakespeare in Love but you haven't seen Elizabeth, see it.Not being a seasoned movie critic, I can say only that I came away from this film preview having really enjoyed the show.  It was fun, witty, entertaining, and even vaguely intellectual.  However, it was also (too often) slow paced, and perhaps not as intelligent as it presumed itself to be.  The bittersweet ending was drawn out perhaps too long, but it still worked for me.On the whole, the actors do not disappoint.  Joseph Fiennes as a youthful Will Shakespeare was outstanding once again (again = playing opposite Cate Blanchett in the 1998 release Elizabeth).  Gwyneth Paltrow, beautiful and convincing.  Judi Dench strong and confident as an amused Queen E.  However, this movie is not to be taken too seriously - the focus is definitely entertainment, not history.  There is little pure Elizabethan dialog (only during the plays/practices, which are brief enough to hold the interest of a mature audience).  The set is fantastic, but not as dreary and perhaps accurate as the outstanding props/set/scenery in Elizabeth.Bottom line: if you are looking for a historically exact docudrama suitable for mandatory viewing in graduate-level history courses, disappointment awaits you.  However, if you seek a reasonably intelligent but thoroughly entertaining date movie, allez vous!Criticisms: a little heavy on the love scenes and on Paltrow's naked upper torso, but no raunchy orgasms or full frontal nudity.  The set is wonderful, but perhaps too pretty, too glossy for the time period.  A better glimpse at the life of W. Shakespeare was desired but not delivered - we never see him eat, bathe, change clothes, or otherwise live.  Occasionally slow paced, particularly during plays/practices.  Play dialog delivered rapidly, presumably so as not to lose the audience.Cautions: no belly laughs, just numerous good-humoured chuckles, and one or two sniffles.  It helps if you are familiar with a few of Shakespeares plays, but is not necessary.For the entertainment, I gave this movie a solid 8.bis@priv.net Vancouver, BC",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A charming, witty, engaging romantic comedy","Shakespeare in Love is a charming, witty (how could it not be with Tom Stoppard as one of the screenwriters?), engaging, and sophisticated romantic comedy.  I was entranced with the love story between Will and Viola; intellectually intrigued by the parallel development of Romeo & Juliet and Twelfth Night, two of Shakespeare's most popular and accessible plays, pleasantly taught some details Elizabethan theatre history, such as the multiple jobs that the lead actor in a company performed:  Ned was star, company manager, assistant director or choreographer, and dramaturg all at once; and amused by the suggestions of the real sources of Shakespeare's ideas and lines.The entire screenplay animated the writer's motto, ""If it's good, steal it."" The Puritan preaching hellfire and brimstone is the source of the immortal line ""a rose by any other name.""  Viola suggests Orsino as the name of the Duke in what will be Twelfth Night.  ""Orsino.  Good name"", is Will's response, just as it was to Marlowe's suggestion for the title of Romeo and Juliet.  Could that play really have been as great with the title Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.I could go on and on, but words do fail me.  See this film.  Enjoy it. Revel in it.

Hollywood at its best,"This is the kind of movie the Academy loves and through its love, rewards.The script by Stoppard and Norman is erudite and cunning, passionate and playful, filled with witticisms by and about the Bard; and the parallels to Shakespeare and his work, especially the play within a play, Romeo and Juliet, and the play to come, Twelfth Night, are marvelous and a bit miraculous. The romantic direction by Madden conjures up an Elizabethan England and its London theatre with enough lusty color to delight the poet himself. The acting is wonderful with Gwyneth Paltrow conquering a very demanding and delightful role as Viola/Tom Kent that will beckon and challenge actresses for decades to come. Joseph Fiennes as the young Shakespeare writing his Romeo and Juliet on the fly, fired with the energy from his adulterous love for the lovely Viola, is better than advertised.Of course what would a Shakespearean play or a great Hollywood movie be without its bit players and supporting roles? Judi Dench as the queen in her Academy Award winning performance gives the impression of somebody doing something marvelously well but with such ease as to look unemployed. (I stole that line from somewhere.)From the gutter snipe with his rodents to the queen's bad teeth, from Colin Firth's delightfully villainous Lord Wessex to Geoffrey Rush's wise, but bumbling stage manager, from the tavern trollops to the gentry at the ball (in which the sonnet within a play from Romeo and Juliet is once again given life by Fiennes and Paltrow) everything is expertly presented.This is Hollywood at its best.

What's love got to do with it,"The premise of this film comes from a sliver of historical information, Billy Shakespeare, who wrote what is considered by many to be the definitive love story, supposedly had a secret love while he lived in London. Who that person is, we don't know, and did she inspire him to write Romeo & Juliet.The result is not one of my favourite movies, however it seems to be well received by people who either don't know any Shakespeare or who don't like his works.It's success comes from the fact that most of the characters are played very straight, with the exeptions of Lord Wessex and the theatre owner (played by Geoffrey Rush).Here are the things I like about this movie. Beautifully shot Well acted Interesting concept Some very funny lines and some serious moments Lots of in jokes that only people who know Shakespeare would get (too many Hollywood movies dumb down jokes in case the audience wouldn't get it) Historically accurate in set design and little detailsThings I didn't like Shakespearean plays acted from the 19th century tradition rather than the mass appeal approach needed to make money Too much Shakespeare Lots of transformations in characters that are left unexplained (the inverstor who goes from being the Hollywood producer type to the awed fan with no explanation or growth period) Lack of historical accuracy in the charactersSo the bottom line is, if you don't like Shakespeare or if you don't know who he is, then you will love this movie.

Such a romantic movie...,"I absolutely adored Shakespeare in Love.

It was so well written and it truly made you swoon over their love. The two actor's chemistry really is remarkable. It kept you entertained and interested the entire movie, and it even made me cry a tiny bit. However, I wish they grew more on the personal side of the romance instead of the physical and intimacy side of it, truly. I think it would've made the movie better.

Wonderfully funny and real, the screenplay is top-notch, the dialogue true-to-life and hilariously contemporary, yet somehow Shakespearean at the same time.The musical score left something to be desired, in this reviewer's opinion; it was a bit too...modern...and didn't add to the ambience of the film at all.Joseph Fiennes did a fine job as Shakespeare; comedic, passionate, crazy, moody...but he looked too much like the artist formerly known as Prince, and that was disconcerting.Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect in her role as Shakespeare's love and as Romeo in the stage play, as was her terrific nurse, who was wise and funny.

Ben Affleck's characterization and interpretation of his role was beyond incredible, as was the memorable portrayal of Queen Elizabeth by Judi Dench...kudos for both!This is a joyous, lilting, lyrical evening at the movies!",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Beautiful Fantasy,"""Shakespeare in Love"" is a beautiful, lyrical masterpiece.  Shakespeare's beautiful words, supported by Stephen Warbeck's music the beauty if its star, Gwyneth Paltrow, and its sumptuous costumes make this warmhearted and funny fantasy a pleasure from beginning to end.  One does not have to know much about either Shakespeare or his times to enjoy the movie but if one does have a bit of this knowledge, the film is even more fun.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Appalling,"How could this boring, vulgar work win so many Oscars? How could so many people think it is a great movie? And how could the great Tom Stoppard be co-responsible for such appalling tripe?To talk about the historical errors would be pointless, because the whole movie was one long rewriting of history. Not clever or original rewriting, but a farcical (in the sense of low farce) reworking of the life of our greatest playwright into the cliches of the 1990s love (or more correctly, lust) movie.To be avoided like the great plague of 17th Century London.",2.0,Anonymous,History
A romantic comedy with brains,"Forget your high school memories of Shakespeare being difficult and highbrow--this film captures more of the real Shakespeare: bawdy, hilarious, and very accessible for your average commoner. So what if it's fictionalized our the wazoo? It's fun, sexy, and is a rollicking good time.The casting is fantastic--Joseph Fiennes is perfect as Will, Gwyneth Paltrow is surprisingly radiant, and Ben Affleck is an ingenious casting choice for a small but important role.Should be required viewing for all HS students being forced to endure reading Shx from a book.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Just hand them an Oscar, ok?","Stoppard's influence is written all over this brilliantly-crafted satirical humor in Shakespeare's honor.  Fiennes and Paltrow are believable and their performances refreshingly genuine.  The period's costumes and set were detailed and absolutely perfect.  Judi Dench as the brash, insightful Queen Elizabeth was a wonderful performance to behold.  ""Shakespeare in Love"" deserves some recognition as one of this year's best films.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Charming, uplifting, virginal innocence of Gwyneth/Viola","This movie is similar in texture, tone and comic relief to Kenneth Branagh's movie ""Much Ado About Nothing"". The two main protagonists are somewhat larger than life, but the theme of love is contagious. Finally the underdog of the 2 rival men (namely Will Shakespeare) is partially victorious over his pompous and philistine competitor and succeeds in earning fame and fortune. Much like the Academy Awards really! Gwyneth Paltrow's innocent charm is a knock-out and is genuinely refreshing to watch. A well-constructed and satisfying tale for a broad range of viewers. I ended this movie feeling joyful and invigorated.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Multi-level masterpiece,"Interweaves several Shakespeare plays with comedy and drama threads into a fine tapestry of a movie.

"witty, romantic, and fabulous acting","although the writers of the film failed to realize that the colony of virginia had another 15 years to be found, i found this movie immensely enjoyable.  besides this error, the script for this film was witty, romantic, and extremely clever.  i have always been a fan of tom stoppard and hope to see him and his co-writer recognized for their effort this oscar season.the best part of this movie, for me, was the phenomenal acting. i have never seen joseph fiennes before, but he impressed me beyond belief.  he evokes the same intensity and charm of his older brother ralph, but he has a wonderful comic timing that is lacking in ralph (and this is an admission from a huge ralph fan!).  geoffrey rush and judi dench are both huge treats in this movie...rush especially cracked me up.  but i have to give the most credit to gwyneth paltrow.  she is an actress that i used to pay no attention to, but she really outdid herself in this role and deserves all the accolades she receives.  from a former non-fan, i now have the greatest respect for her.overall, this is a lovely, whimisical romantic comedy that everyone should see.  if you are a fan of shakespeare's, then you will definitely enjoy the many witty references to his plays.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Non-serious view of Shakespeare may be best approach,"Shakespeare in Love is a delightful and very funny film.  It's unhistorical but an entirely valid artistic appreciation of Shakespeare and his works as popular entertainment in both his time (theater in confined spaces) and our time (this movie is, after all, an adaptation of Romeo & Juliet) and--credit Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman's literate, fast-paced screenplay--poetry and prose for reading.Joseph Fiennes is very intense as Shakespeare, credible but in his intensity maybe too 20th century in style. Indeed, this is accentuated by a great gag at the beginning in which he lies on a couch and analyzes his situation--writer's block--under the questioning of one Dr. Moth.  Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful as Viola and, when pretending to be a young male actor, does Romeo in so attractive a way I found myself wondering if she could conceivably follow Olivier and Branagh and portray Henry V.  Of course, in this film she also has the natural role as a well-endowed blonde of unusual attraction (and acting ability).All the secondary characters are terrific, particularly Geoffrey Rush as the impresario Henslowe, Martin Clunes as his rival Burbage, and Tom Wilkinson as a less than angelic angel named Fennyman.As father of a couple of PG/PG-13 daughters, I can hardly wait for a couple of years to show them this movie on tape.  Right now the sex is too graphically bawdy.  Were it not for this sex, in fact, I would instantly want every high school English I or II class watch this movie for the simple reason that a movie that is great entertainment because it is none too serious should have the great benefit of stimulating a very serious interest in the whole Shakespeare--the bard and the guy, his sonnets and his jokes, the plays on both stage and page.One unbelievable thing about this film:  Universal opened it at exactly one small art house in San Francisco.  I just can't believe they didn't put more money into marketing it and open it at several multiplexes.  Maybe John (Shakespeare in Love) Madden can give the impresarios and moneymen at Universal some character roles in his next movies to improve *their* characters!",10.0,Anonymous,History
A marvelous movie,"Shakespeare in Love is a marvelous movie. This is what going to movies should be like all the time: lifting you out of your everyday life and worries into a magical world. Silly, funny, charming, harrowing, and truthful all at the same time, it works on many levels. It's an homage to Shakespeare; it's a love story so beautiful and true that it hurts; it's a satire on modern Hollywood. And somehow it manages to blend all these together with never a false note, always both true to its own spirit and to truth itself. The ending is bittersweet but honest, with no contrived happy ending. (And while it does take liberties with history, the liberties are self-consistent and never distracting.)As for the cast, Gwyneth Paltrow seems to glow throughout, even when disguised as a man, and the other players, many familiar from various British productions, are superb and frequently hilarious.The movie has the cleverness of Pulp Fiction without the ugly violence; the characterizations and perceptiveness of Sense and Sensibility while being much more fun; the magic and sense of fun of Star Wars with better acting and a better script. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Complete waste of time.,"The first time I saw this I switched it off fifteen minutes in - the borrowed lines from Shakespeare and the laughable and wince-inducing attempts at humour are off-putting to say the least. Being forced through a sitting (having sworn never to attempt a viewing again) I found this to be tedious and lacking in plot and imagination. Think Romeo and Juliet rehashed, badly. The only highlights were of course, Judi Dench and occasionally Geoffrey Rush as the bumbling theatre owner. Oscar-winning indeed - must have been a film drought that year. Spend your time watching Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet instead.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"A Fun Little Movie, with Reservations","This is an fun little movie, and a fine companion piece to ""Rosencrantz"" by Stoppard.  It's full of humor and romance and all the acting is first-rate. Lots of little ""in"" jokes please those of us who love Shakespeare, and there are lots of insane little touches (an Elizabethan psychologist, for instance) give it levels of meaning.  One quibble:  there's too much graphic sex, most of it thrown in as a cheap laugh.  This makes it quite unsuitable for children, who would probably be well served by this movie if they could see it, as an introduction to Shakespeare as the equally unrealistic (and exquisite) ""Amadeus"" was to the music of Mozart.  It should've gotten an NC-17 rating for these absolutely unnecessary shenanigans.  Sex in movies is always funnier, and also more romantic and even sexier, when it's implied rather than shown (and here I don't refer to the scenes between Shakespeare and Viola, but we see more of Gwyneth Paltrow than is absolutely necessary. Other than that, it's a fine movie for adults, and if they are literate and not snobbish (a rather slim number, but we're out there) it is an enjoyable sex romp.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent!  Don't miss it!,"This is a wonderfully entertaining movie!  The writers have provided a ""what if?"" situation surrounding the difficulties Shakespeare experiences in writing his new play ... he finds love and the problem is solved ... or is it?  It's funny, it's believable and has some very unexpected lines for that time period, but they work!  There doesn't seem to be any weak spots -- the actors meld together into an ensemble that makes you believe they ARE those characters.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A marvelous invention and thoroughly enjoyable ensemble collaboration,"A sneak preview last night in aid of the Canadian Olympic Association gave viewers a thoroughly enjoyable cinematic experience - moving them from laughter to tears, and back again - all brought about by the marvelous invention of the plot and screenplay blended with impeccable performances of a superb ensemble cast. The director's deft hand was everywhere to be seen, but not forced or truly ""noticed"" except in retrospect. I will look forward to seeing this again when in general release, and believe that, much the same as John Madden's ""Mrs. Brown"", this opus will find itself in the Oscar race this time out, perhaps garnering more than the 2 nominations of his prior work.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Call me crazy . . .,"But I just can't jump on the bandwagon for this one.  I did enjoy the movie, but I don't believe it was the Oscar winning masterpiece that it has become. It was funny, enjoyable, romantic, and had some great performances, most notably Judy Dench and Geoffrey Rush.  But it was very cliche, and the romance offered nothing original--just more Hollywood mush.  I love Shakespeare (who doesn't), but somehow I would prefer to see his life realistically depicted, than portrayed by beautiful young Hollywood stars. Gwyneth Paltrow played the exact same character she plays in every single movie she is in.  The Oscars weren't cheap, though . . .they were bought with over 6 million in promotional costs.  And it worked!I hate to be cynical, but I don't think they were truly earned.  I am sorry to offend . . .if you like the movie, that's wonderful.  It is obviously very popular, so perhaps I am in the wrong.  I just felt it to be sickeningly commercial.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Not overrated,"This film has one of the wittiest screenplays ever. Not only does it sustain the central conceit of the plot. It works on several other levels. The script is loaded with references to other Shakespeare works. Many of which require multiple viewings to catch. Take it from one who has read *ALL* of the plays that there is much to savor here. Anyone who complains about historical inaccuracies should automatically have their opinion discounted because they obviously didn't 'get it'. This film is intended as an affectionate tongue-in-cheek love letter to Elizabethan theater. OF COURSE there are anachronisms. It's part of the fun. Did anyone else notice the coffee mug on Will's desk that said 'Present of Stratford Upon Avon'? How about him going to what appears to be a session of psychoanalysis? The structure of the plot itself is ingeniously crafted to echo 'Romeo and Juliet' but in subtle, indirect ways. This film is alive in every sense of the world. Anyone who refers to it as a chick-flick or flighty entertainment is not at a very high level of artistic engagement. As a matter of fact they are just at the right level to be impressed by the banal platitudes of 'Saving Private Ryan'.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Best Movie of 1998?,"Featuring an almost certain academy award winning script and best actress performance by Gwyneth Paltrow, Shakespeare in Love may also pick up awards for Judi Dench (best actress) and Joseph Feinnes (best actor).  Amazingly, it takes precious little ""suspension of disbelief"" to imagine that Shakespeare's most famous love story began as ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate Girl"", but evolved into Romeo and Juliet on account of his personal love life and the debt problems of his theater-owner. Very highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,History

Excruciatingly Overrated,"I hate this film with a burning passion! There is no way that I will ever appreciate one aspect about this movie, from beginning to end I was stunned by just how dull, uninvolving and pointless it was. There is no reason why it had to be made, what are the film makers trying to prove, that William Shakespeare had sex too? I do admire Shakespeare's work, and I do believe that he is probably the best play writer in history, but if someone was going to make a sem-fictional film about his life, they could of at least made it moving and engaging, qualities completely absent here. The 1999 Academy Awards made a dreadful mistake by naming this Best Picture instead of ""Saving Private Ryan"", which was an immensely better film in so many ways. Just watching 5 seconds of it would be more entertaining than watching ""Shakespeare in Love""'s entire length. But aside from all my negative comments, I can't deny the fact Joseph Fienne's performance as Shakespeare was excellent, and Gwyneth Paltrow's portrayal as his lover was fine as well, but it was far from being Oscar worthy. Cate Blanchette's performance as Queen Elizabeth was definitely better than Paltrow's, it's just a shame that the Academy made so many bad choices. A truly disappointing film.",4.0,Anonymous,History
