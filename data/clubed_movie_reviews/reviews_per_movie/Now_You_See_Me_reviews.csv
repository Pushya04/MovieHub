Turn your brain off and enjoy...,"At this time, there are already 530 reviews for ""Now You See It"", so I'll try to be brief. The film is about a group of four magicians and mentalists who have been given a brilliant plan by an unseen genius. Again and again, the quartet perform seemingly impossible stunts and always seem many steps ahead of the police. And, in the process, they do HUGE magic tricks that are pretty much impossible. The presentation is VERY smooth and very slick and the overall production looks great. It has great music and effects. But, on the negative side none of this really makes a lot of sense and there is no way you can enjoy it if you think. This is especially true at the end (where there is a profession of love that comes from absolutely no where!!)--which is a gigantic cliché and made no sense whatsoever. The bottom line is that if you turn off you brain and enjoy it on a very superficial level, you'll enjoy it. If you try to make sense of it all, your head will explode. 'Nuff said.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Watchable but lacks depth & substance,"This is one of those movies that is somewhat entertaining upon first viewing but is easily forgettable and has nothing of substance to make a second viewing possible to enjoy. The plot is convoluted as we don't know what the main characters are doing or why. In fact, everything we know about the 4 magicians is revealed in the first 10 minutes of the movie and after that there is ZERO character development! The entire movie appears to have been made solely for the sake of the ending and yet it was so cliché that I was actually a little angry about the way they did it. It's unfortunate that in the filmmaker's attempts to be clever they neglected the most fundamental elements of storytelling: plot and character.Like a magic show without magic, you may find yourself somewhat entertained but inevitably wind up disappointed in the end because they left out the most important part of the show.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
trying desperately hard to be more intelligent than it is,"Overall a showman of a film. Flashy, loud with bells and whistles and big personalities, an exciting premise... illusionists rob banks using (supposed) magic but the four horsemen are just puppets in a game, but the hype is more than the substance of the film itself.You'd expect suspense, twists, intelligent plot misdirection and all sorts of thrilling viewing? No. This film tries to be a lot more intelligent than it actually is. Like Atlas (Eisenberg) says, ""Always be the most intelligent person in the room"" or something similar, this film thinks it is being intelligent but actually it's not challenging enough. It gives too much away, isn't as unpredictable as it should be (really, you couldn't see that ending coming?) and just isn't as clever as it promises. The tricks I really wanted explaining weren't... the ones that were more obvious, were explained. The ending actually isn't a denouement, as it's been laying clues all along - and anyone who's seen a lot of films can see the ""twists"" coming a mile away. I focus on the twists and reveal because as a heist movie, the end is the big reveal. But, unlike Oceans Eleven, for example, it has more or less handed it to you on a plate already.The actors were good. Morgan Freeman and Woody Harrelson stealing the show, of course, with Dave Franco doing a bang up job with some incredible physical acting, stunts and so forth. I'm afraid Jesse Eisenberg didn't convince in his character and was annoying after a while, Franco rather underutilised really. Isla Fisher was good but clearly the ""glamour"" rather than a serious character, which was a shame as she was good.This was supposed to be a big blockbuster film, big back drops, epic stunts and huge crowd scenes, but it failed to deliver. As heist/magic genre films go it's not that great, and The Prestige was far more cerebral and gripping. Entertaining to a point but I got a bit bored, and some of the scenes were too long - chases etc. If you are a fan of heist films or magic you'll enjoy it, or are a fan of particular actors, or will just enjoy it for what it is and don't want to be challenged intellectually, it's a great film. I think Hollywood endings are just too commonplace. 6/10 for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Promising idea sunk in key areas,"""Now You See Me"" came out of nowhere and became the sleeper hit of 2013, getting good word of mouth during its theatrical run. Having seen the movie for myself, I am kind of puzzled by its popularity. Certainly, the movie is far from the worst movies I have ever seen - it's colorful, and doesn't have a dead spot despite running almost two hours long.But there were some things about the movie that annoyed me enough to prevent me from liking it. The biggest problem is with the characters. Except for Freeman's character, there is not one likable character in the movie. The law enforcement agents investigating the magicians are loud and obnoxious, and the four magicians come across as extremely smug. (Also, there is no attempt to give the magicians real and separate personalities - they all act alike.)The characters were the main reason why I didn't like this movie, but there were other problems as well. One other major annoyance is the depiction of the magic acts. They have been jazzed up with CGI and other special effects so they don't feel like REAL magic acts - they come across as artificial. Also, as the movie progresses, the various feats the magicians pull off slowly become more unbelievable (and not fully explained) that eventually I wanted to cry out loud, ""Oh, COME ON!"" Less slight of hand and a more realistic approach would have been a much better approach.(Note to Michael Caine fans: His role is really just an extended cameo appearance.)",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Wow.,"There are a lot of reviews already for this movie, so it is unlikely anyone will read mine. But I feel like I have to weigh in on this movie.This is the most fun I've had watching a flick in a very, very long time. This movie is a riot! It isn't quite as clever as it thinks it is. Most of the surprises weren't terribly surprising; off the top of my head I can identify at least three that I saw coming. But I don't care.It was fun! It was funny and engaging and I found myself simultaneously rooting for both sides. There is no shortage of action, the dialogue is peppy, and - unlike almost everything else I've watched lately - it's never boring.Do yourself a favor and don't analyze. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Movies don't have to be life-altering.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The real magic is that they trick you to believe this is a good movie,"And I will not back up with this statement. It is a good movie, because it's not a boring movie, but it is that kind of movie that you watch once and walk away and forget all about it.First off, let me tell you why movies involving magic tricks don't work. Because magic is for live audience and everything made on camera loses the main purpose of magic. In order to enjoy it, we have to subscribe to things that defy plausibility, we are obliged to take unrealistic facts for granted. But let's say we're OK with that. The Illusionist or The Prestige worked that way.The real problem here is that the storyline is cynical and walks on a path of plain 'by the book' twist after twist after twist scenario, even though they lack of substance, motivation, trying to create an undeserved WOW effect. Plus, they forced in a classical fling to satisfy all viewers. There are major unrealistic events, but I guess the movie is not for us who try to find logic, but for those who just want to be entertained and see sparkles.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Like a Vegas Show, Entertaining but Lacking of Much Else","Imagine Now You See Me as Ocean's Eleven meets The Prestige and you sort of get what director Louis Leterrier was going for with this film. Is Now You See Me as successful as the aforementioned films? Not necessarily, but it's a fun movie that deconstructs the acts of modern magicians.The story follows four Vegas magicians, known as the Four Horsemen, who rob a bank in the middle of one of their shows. What follows is a cat-and-mouse thriller where the FBI chases after these magicians, always one step behind, trying to figure out how they did it.Where Now You See Me works best is when Leterrier creates cinematic sequences showing us how these magicians used real-life magic tricks to befuddle and dupe both their victims and the FBI. As well, if you want a film with twists and turns, this one will not disappoint. While most of the major twists can be found out before revealed, there is still a joy in watching those twists unfold, thanks to Leterrier's Sherlock Holmes' style of visual deduction. However, the script often falters in one of the most crucial areas, that of character.Leterrier and company are constantly trying to balance the breakneck pace with the large cast of characters, and it just leaves the characters hanging out to dry. Character development is sorely lacking in Now You See Me, to where I never really cared about any of the characters. Part of this is because the film is constantly shifting points of view. The first thirty minutes follow our Robin Hood-like magicians, and then it switches to the FBI agents tracking them down, but then the film has the magicians constantly one step in front of the FBI to the point that it makes the FBI often come across as buffoons, and I find it hard to care for characters who are so easily fooled. Ultimately, I feel that had the film focused entirely on one set of characters, like the magicians or the FBI, the film would have been stronger and been easier to find a focal point, but as it is the film's core is often muddled.While Now You See Me may not be a grand slam, it's still entertaining, thanks to the thrills and visual style of the film. Bottom line, if you're a fan of the heist genre, you'll like this movie. For me though, it just lacks a further script rewrite to have become one of the best examples of the genre.I give Now You See Me an 8 out of 10!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A fun ride, but something's missing","This is an interesting concept, surely not a genre played out much in Hollywood. The cast is jam packed with all stars giving great (but not their best) performances. The missing piece of the puzzle? Character development.That's not to say that there is any lack of interesting characters, each of the four horsemen bring a very unique style to the movie (besides Henley, she's rather weak as a character), and the sheer amount of Talent present in each scene guarantees that you'll be entertained.10/10? Hardly. But definitely a solid 8 for me. Entertaining, fun, and definitely a concept worth exploring on the big screen.

Las Vegas Turnabout,"""Now You See Me"" (2013) is a tremendously fun film starring Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine.Four magicians (Eisenberg, Harrelson, Fisher, and Franco) are invited to an address. Inside, they encounter a few tricks. A year later, these four have become The Four Horsemen and are doing a show in Las Vegas. They end the first performance that we see with a bank robbery that doesn't look like an illusion.The FBI gets right on it and sends in an agent, Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo) and Interpol sends one as well, Melanie Laurent (Alma Dray). Rhodes is arrogant and thinks figuring out how these four did it is going to be easy, but it isn't, even with the help of a big-time illusionist exposer (Freeman). Of course, that robbery isn't going to be their last as the agents become more and more frustrated.Be ready for the twists and turns, distractions, and sleight of hand. Nothing is as it seems.Highly entertaining film, with good performances from the young cast, working alongside two major pros, Caine and Freeman. I know the film is preposterous but so are a lot of plots. When a film is well done, I say just relax and go along with it. I'm always amazed at how people review a film like this as if it's Citizen Kane. My advice: If you want reality, don't watch movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"""A Sleight of Hand That Falls a Bit Short""","""Now You See Me"" is an engaging heist film that cleverly blends magic and crime, offering audiences a thrilling ride filled with impressive illusions and unexpected twists. The plot revolves around a group of illusionists, known as the Four Horsemen, who use their magical abilities to pull off elaborate heists during live performances, all while evading the law.The film's strong ensemble cast, including Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, and Mark Ruffalo, delivers charismatic performances that keep the energy high.

The direction and cinematography effectively capture the flashy world of magic, keeping viewers entertained with a visual feast of tricks and dazzling performances.Beneath its captivating exterior, ""Now You See Me"" struggles with some narrative issues. The pacing can feel uneven at times, and certain plot twists may come off as contrived or overly complex, leaving some viewers scratching their heads. Additionally, while the film presents an exciting premise, it occasionally sacrifices character development for the sake of spectacle.""Now You See Me"" is an enjoyable watch for those seeking a blend of thrills and clever trickery.

Missing the Magic,"Now You See Me is the sort of movie that relies entirely on spectacle and style without much of anything underneath the surface. The plot centers around a band of Robin Hood-esque illusionists with an affinity for robbing banks and the team of FBI agents tasked with bringing them down.We are first introduced to our protagonists, a group eventually called The Four Horsemen, through a look at each of their individual acts. The movie fails, however, to develop any of them beyond these lifeless, cardboard cut-outs. The same is true for the rest of the cast as well. There's a pair of bumbling FBI agents, a washed up magician aiding the feds, and the Horsemen's benefactor who are never given enough depth to make for really compelling characters.This movie does contain some relatively cool tricks, but some are a bit too grand to be believable. One in particular involving Isla Fisher floating above a crowd in a giant bubble is a tad ridiculous. All that being said, it's entertaining enough to pull you along for the ride and it can be a pretty darn fun ride at times as long as you don't look too closely.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Unique, Keeps You on the Edge of Your Seat with All its Twists and Turns","I absolutely love this film. ""Now You See Me"" is like nothing I've ever seen before. ""Now You See Me"" tells the story of a group of magicians called The Four Horsemen who use their skills to pull off some of the greatest international robberies of their generation. Featuring Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKenny (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), the Four Horsemen make a dream team of street magicians. Since they have made their stunts public, allowing the world to ""witness"" the robberies, authorities are in hot pursuit of the four, now wanted criminals. Detective Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is accompanied in his search for the illusive magicians by Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) and French detective Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). Will the Four Horsemen be able to pull of their final act without being caught, or will it be curtains for the criminal performers?The plot is so original and full of fresh ideas and witty comedy. I love how fast paced this film is, I swear there isn't a dull moment from beginning to end. The plot itself has so many twists and turns it should be a pretzel, but it keeps the audience guessing the whole time and hits you with major shock factor. The acting in this film is incredible. It features a group of incredible actors - Morgan Freeman, Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Woody Harrelson and many others. I love how each character has a unique quirk and personality that you can really see, but they all work together so well. The cinematography and special effects in this film are phenomenal. It is bursting with rich colors and textures, drawing you into the magic and making the illusions appear so real. The soundtrack is also amazing. It is suits each scene very well, while keeping a consistent theme and feel throughout the movie. ""Now You See Me"" is definitely not one to miss.It's hard for me to pick a favorite character because I love all of the Horsemen, but when it comes down to it I have to say I like the characters Daniel Atlas and Jack Wilder. Daniel, played by Jesse Eisenberg, often tries to assert himself as the head of the Four Horsemen. He is controlling, very specific and difficult to deal with, but he is also the funniest character which is attributed to all of his demanding qualities. I love every film Jesse Eisenberg is in and I think he is perfect for the role of Daniel Atlas. I also like Jack Wilder, played by Dave Franco, because he is the craftiest of the magicians. He isn't the ""card trick"" or ""read your mind"" type, he's just a good old fashioned pick-pocket for whom no door is ever locked.. He is sort of the ""muscle"" to the operation because he is able to help the horsemen get out of tight situations and he is also very funny.My favorite scene is when the Four Horsemen have to escape from the FBI after their second robbery. Jack Wilder has to stay behind to burn secret files. When he has an unexpected run-in with Detective Rhodes, an action filled fight sequence and high speed chase follow. This scene is filled with suspense, action and incredible stunts and it shows that the Horsemen are always two steps ahead.I recommend this film for ages 12+ because of violence and mild mature language. Overall I give ""Now You See Me"" 5 out of 5 stars.See Raven's video review on kidsfirst.org",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A bit of summer magic,"""First rule of magic: always be the smartest person in the room."" J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg)In the case of the magical little entertainment called Now You See Me, you don't have to be the smartest person in the audience to be charmed by the illogical ""magic"" of the tricks or the script. In a takeoff of traditional heist films and homage to recent films like The Incredible Burt Wonderstone and The Prestige, with a smattering of smart, sometimes humorous chatter, this film moves at rapid pace (French director Louis Leterrier knows how from his Transporter films) with a lack of seriousness about the tricks, which are mostly explained as the film moves on.Those revelations will bother purists who don't want to know the secrets or critics who demand a reasonable arc for the story. Like the magic itself, the film eventually captures the imagination enough to suspend disbelief and just go with the fun.The ""four horsemen"" (Atlas, played by Eisenberg; Merritt by Woody Harrelson; Henley by Isla Fisher; and Jack by Dave Franco) create three successive magic shows, one in Las Vegas, a second in New Orleans, and the third in New York. The stakes rise incrementally as they appear to be playing Robin Hood to their large, American-Idol type audiences by showering them with money from their magical heists. The FBI with Agent Dylan (Mark Ruffalo) is in hot but bungling pursuit.As in most thrillers, there are minor twists, and the final one that stretches credulity, or that some will see coming, along with a hopper full of smaller ones even naïve I could see from far off. Besides, like the Oceans films' heists, it's not about the heist or the magic. It's about the slick magicians, their easy banter, and comeuppance for the real baddies.Outrageous set pieces like the car race will disconcert those looking for a tightly-told narrative. The magic is as always questionable because film deals in magic with practically every frame. However, the cast is delightfully comic, the direction speedy and tricky, and the entire film wants you in on the magic. For a summer film, that's a magic formula.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Entertaining spectacle,"I had a fun time with this film. It's honestly worth watching just for the big reveal, as with all magic shows.

"Smooth,cool and fun","Loved this movie. Gotta say the ""cool"" factor got to me in every crucial aspect of this flick. It is difficult to be ""cool"" without being corny or coming off silly. Even Woody H. is getting to be enjoyable to me and he's never been one of my fav actors. The storyline is simple and it moves fast with no time to get bored. Each character is acted out really slick, not superficially deep (although I would have enjoyed more character development) and kept my attention.The two heavies, M. Freeman & M. Caine, were very good, of course, and give the movie two solid performances that complement very well the other cast members. Mark Ruffalo was spot on - gosh he's good, why hasn't he made more movies I wonder? (Love him as the Hulk).Jesse Eisenberg is so dang believable that he better do something else quick or he's going to be forever etched in my mind as an illusionist! His character's glances and demeanor are great with, to me, an underlying sense of he can't believe how good he & the other 3 are at what they do. I loved that about each character - they weren't arrogant to the point of unbelievability or boredom. It's like they all were on a ride they could hardly believe. LOL, I kept looking at Isla Fisher and thinking, ""Is that Amy Adams?"" But I knew it couldn't be. And Dave Franco - the look-alike baby Franco brother did a good job with his smaller part.I know I've said it already, but this movie is cool. It had me believing that the tricks could be done. One of the best movies for what it is - entertainment, plain and simple. My friend and I left saying, ""good movie, I liked that."" Definitely a big screen movie.Oh, and guess what? They guessed the card I & my friend picked! How'd they do that??",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Caper film that is a little too dependent on surprises,"Now You See Me is a film that is all about obfuscation. Focusing on four magicians that perform feats of wonder first separately and later together, from the first frame on, the film engages in cinematic sleight of hand. However, that formula backfires on the film: by constantly trying to engage in trickery, the audience finds itself always on the lookout for it, and by the time it starts winding down, most of the potential surprises are rendered moot by the fact that we were looking for and expecting said surprises. Thus, while Now You See Me is fun and engaging at times, as a twist-filled surprise machine, it falls flat on it's face.As the film opens, we are introduced to four illusionists: fast talking street-level card sharp Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), ""mentalist"" and small-time con man Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), spoon-bending junior magician Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and show-stopping high-thrills Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher). All of them are given a special card with an address and time on it, and when they all show up at the prescribed time and place, a small apartment in New York, they discover what appears to be a quite elaborate set of plans. Flash forward one year later, and the four magicians are performing as a single act under the moniker The Four Horsemen and are being bankrolled by millionaire Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) During their debut performance in Las Vegas, they close their act with a rather spectacular accomplishment: they transport a French audience member to his bank in France and proceed to steal several billion dollars from it and magically transport it back to the Las Vegas auditorium where they pour it onto the audience.Unsurprisingly, this gets the attention of the FBI, and agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is assigned to the case. He teams up with Interpol agent Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent) and interrogates the Four Horsemen, but with nothing to pin on them, is forced to let them walk. Rhodes seeks the counsel of former magician Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) who now spends his time debunking magicians, revealing what is ""behind the curtain"". With Bradley's help, Rhodes is able to unravel what happened at the first performance, but the Four Horsemen are already moving on to New Orleans for their next show and Rhodes and Dray are trying to stay one step ahead of them.Now You See Me is a film that is intended to keep us on our toes, to leave the audience guessing and wondering what the next revelation is going to be. Sometimes these kind of films can work well, engaging in misdirection and providing red herrings and dead ends for us to believe in before showing us what is really going on. Where Now You See Me missteps is that, from very early in the proceedings, the film telegraphs its intentions so loudly that most of the enjoyment of being caught up in twists is lost. That the twists are such a central part of the film is obvious from the start and makes them less engaging than if they evolved more naturally out of the narrative. Now You See Me is designed and built almost exclusively to keep us guessing but by focusing almost exclusively on that, it overreaches.Now You See Me isn't helped by the fact that the main characters are, save for some quickly introduced character moments and a few exchanges of witty dialogue, almost completely ciphers. Atlas, McKinnney, Wilder and Reeves are barely developed at all, and frankly, excepting for the moments they are performing their stage acts, are not even afforded that much screen time. The screenplay does play a bit with the intentions of the characters, but it is obvious that we are supposed to be rooting for them at times, and it makes it difficult to work up much enthusiasm for them when we barely know them. More screen time is afforded to Rhodes and Dray, and the two develop a romantic chemistry that is palpable at times, but, much like the other characters, they are largely pawns of the screenplay, but they are at least given more to work with than the magicians.Director Louis Leterrier films Now You See Me in Michael Bay mode: the camera rarely stops moving for more than a few seconds. During the magic acts, especially the first one in Vegas, this does bring a degree of style to the proceedings but at times the over reliance on an endlessly moving camera can prove distracting. However, Leterrier does keep the pace brisk and the energy level high. Now You See Me certainly can't be called boring.If Now You See Me succeeds anywhere, it is in the casting. Leterrier has pulled together a strong set of performers and, especially regarding the Four Horsemen, what is sometimes lacking in the screenplay is made up for by likable actors. Eisenberg makes Atlas a fast talking smart alec with a nice streak of charisma, Harrelson gives some fun wisecracks and Fisher is, once again, a strong sensual presence with a degree of toughness. Morgan Freeman can't help but class up anything he appears in and his turn here is no different, his Bradley is nice mix of arrogance and charm. Ruffalo is also at his dependable best, a man fighting to stay with his fugitives while barely managing to stay on top of their capers.It may sound like I am down on Now You See Me, but that isn't completely true. By the time the film was over, I found myself pleasantly engaged and entertained at times, but so much is wrapped up in the film's obvious Rube Goldberg plotting that you can't but help feel disappointed when the film doesn't really deviate from where you expect. Now You See Me is like sneaking a peek at your Christmas gifts: knowing what is coming isn't as much fun as not knowing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Excellent,"I watched this film mainly because of the actors that play in it. But the title seemed very provoking to me. It's like the film is playing with your mind as well. You are being transferred into the world of illusion where you can't be sure about anything.Every scene is a surprise. Action and entertainment joined together. I loved everything about this film.The first film I compared this film to was Inception. In the same way, if you lose to keep up with what's going on, you will eventually lose the whole plot and the best thing is to just start watching it again. If I were you, I would not have any breaks during the film for whatever reasons. One missed scene and you're basically out of the plot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Wow, such pizazz and showy stuff, and such a thin veneer of a plot","Now You See Me (2013)The entire movie is about pulling wool over your eyes—as clever as you might be, you'll never figure out what's happening. So you just have to rush along for the ride. And quite a ride it is, filled with legerdemain and fireworks, sleights of hand and feats of prowess. People disappear and people get out of and into handcuffs with one frame of the movie camera. You want to look one way but the camera looks the other and wham, another surprise.Yes, it's the movie the wins, without quite succeeding as a movie. It's like someone winning at a game by cheating. Impressive—not! And yet it seemed like fun for awhile.There is quite the starry cast here, though two of the biggest stars have only a few minutes (literally) of screen time, sprinkled throughout the film. Michael Caine is shown as the money man behind the hiring of the four magicians in their sudden rise to the top. And Morgan Freeman is shown as the hunter of magic charlatans. (And no, there is no connection to Batman here.)The four magicians are kind of a Dream Team pulled together in the first twenty minutes of the movie, and at first you think you'll see more of their individual acts, which are kind of fun. And different. One is a shyster on the streets, another a kind of trickster mind-reader hypnotist (played beautifully by Woody Harrelson), another a showy big production woman, and the fourth a wizard with cards. After they get together, however, it becomes a version of ""Oceans Eleven"" with magic thrown in. The big sham even starts in Las Vegas.If all you want is pizazz, this movie is for you. It's nothing but! And it's quite well made technically and very fast paced. But if you want to get in on the tricks and be not only surprised but also held in suspense, there are too many easy twists and tricks of cinema illusionism at work. In fact, a key problem with magic in the movies is that you can't quite believe it because you can't trust the camera-work and editing. And there are certainly many tricks here that are only possible by splicing one piece of film to another—you know that seeing it on screen, and just have to say, ""It's a movie, it's okay.""One final element is the convincing, hard-boiled detective, played by Mark Ruffalo. He seems to be the dependable thread a viewer can cling do amidst all the swirling and disarray. A necessary element.

massively insulting to the intelligence of audiences everywhere,"by far one of the worst films I have seen in some time, it takes massive leaps that require the watcher to suspend their disbelief to the point that you actually have to dumb yourself down to believe the plot. The CGI prestige was laughable and all in all the film was disrespectful to magicians, illusionists and hypnotists by depicting each of the horsemen as a smug, know it all dick. The plot barely carried itself and the acting became poorer as the story went along. I would only suggest watching this film if you fancy feeling like you have smashed yourself in the forehead with a hammer and then had Satan jack off into your mind.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Just made no sense,"I wanted this movie to be fun and witty, with some twists and turns that resulted in a decent Friday night experience. However, this movie ""makes less sense than Cloud Atlas"" (actual quote by the boyfriend). The writers/directors tried desperately to make more twists and turns than is possible in any realm of reality or fiction, there was little to no character development, and I was disappointed. You can tell that they spent a TON of money getting wonderful actors, awesome lighting and special effects, but it was wasted because even though we are pretty smart people, very little about the magic tricks and especially the ending made any sense whatsoever. I gave this movie 6/10 for its visual effects and camera work, but the story sucks. There's a line ""always be the smartest guy in the room,"" and it feels like the writer was obsessed with being smarter than his own audience, which is insulting and lame.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Unbelievable (not in a good way) and tedious,"I call this genre of movies ""Keep track of a lot of junk and try to figure out what's really going on, but we'll make sure you're wrong,"" a.k.a. ""puzzle movie."" Too much work. Can't be bothered. I want to be entertained, not put to work. I gave it a 6/10 for some entertaining bits, and because I did like the characters, but the overall storyline was very annoying and *tedious*. A movie should be enjoyed, not tedious. And I think the reason it was hard to figure out what was really going on was because the explanations for so many things were just not plausible or believable. Also, I would have liked for the story to give more time to the skeptical side of magic and skepticism in general. The story alludes to the reality that magic is just distraction and illusion, but it doesn't tie that deception into life in general—that we should be more skeptical in all areas of life, for example.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Very entertaining with some originality,"Just caught the film on Friday opening weekend. To sum it up in one word is ""entertaining"". It has the special affects you would expect from ILM behind the scenes. While a few plot mechanism may seem familiar, there is enough original content and spin that it will keep your attention throughout. It has light humor throughout which keeps the experience light hearted. The strong points are the script, acting, directing, cinematography, and visual affects. Yes, it is about stage magicians, but movie magic is used to keep the illusion alive and not actual stage theatrics. The only noticeable weak point is it has potential to be a little bit better in execution of some of the plot twist and it keeps a few important details a little too subtle for one viewing for some viewers.It is a story driven film and not so much a character driven story. There is enough character development to make sense but not balanced enough to feel as engaged to every character. You will understand the characters but may not root for them as much as I'd like. Morgan Freeman certainly holds the screen well and his lines keep people up to speed if they miss something. His character is something of an in movie narrator, but done well from a writing and acting perspective. Jessie Eisenburg's character is also entertaining and engaging as one of the Four Horsemen (the name of the magical stage performers).It has multiple plot twist, some big and some small. These keep you engaged and trying to guess the next move or explain what just happened. A good film to watch with friends and talk about afterwards.It has a good mass appeal and has only a little cussing (3 words I can remember), violence (from car chases), or intense scenes (magic tricks gone wrong where possible bodily harm is implied but not seen) to not keep the younger viewers away. The plot twist may be too complicated for non-teenager youth. Overall it is very entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Abracadabra,"Now You See Me is a dazzling heist films heavy on style, visual trickery and fast edits. Four amateur magicians (Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson and Dave Franco) are brought together by an unknown controller who groups them together as The Four Horsemen and they soon become top Vegas magicians.However that is not the end of it. During the finale of an act they pick a random audience member who appears to have teleported into his bank vault in Paris. He is told to switch the ventilation system that blows out Euros on to the Parisian streets. The audience go crazy and the next day the Four Horsemen are brought in for questioning by the FBI.The bank in Paris was robbed and a prop used in the magic act was found at the scene in Paris.The magicians are being investigated by a determined but dim FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) and an Interpol detective (Mélanie Laurent) who seemed to be more in tune with the conjurer's slight of hand techniques.The Four Horsemen have a patron (Michael Caine) who promotes their shows and latest tricks. Morgan Freeman is on their trail as he makes a living in exposing magicians tricks and helps out the FBI.This is just the beginning though. The Four Horsemen become folk heroes as it turns out that their victims are people or corporations who have duped or cheated the ordinary person and now it is payback time.Director Louis Leterrier keeps his show moving using effects and dazzle. It is frothy fun as the Four Horsemen use all manner of trickery to evade their captures but you kind of guess who the real mastermind is going to be. The clues are laid down as we go along.I was concerned as to why the Morgan Freeman character was deemed to be a fall guy, he might have been smug but he was not a villain. Also these amateur magicians had skills so magical they must have studied at Hogwarts school of magic. So despite being an enjoyable film, it does fall down on logic but it is fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""Now You See Me"" is something to see","Rating: 3 out of Fordyce (Very Good)It is always nice to see something different at the movies.

Look closely because the closer you look the more you'll ignore this film's foolishness,"What You Should Know – Look closely because the closer you look the more you'll ignore this film's foolishness. Like most summer blockbusters it doesn't make perfect sense, but that doesn't stop it from being a fun film to watch especially with that incredible, though unbelievable, ending.What Works – The misdirection is impressive. The story isn't about the four magicians or the heists they ""magically"" perform. While that would have made more sense this movie moves in cheap tricks and clever nonsense.What Doesn't Work – All the unanswered questions. There is a scene where a romance is sparked, but it never ignites and another scene where they argue about where they will go once they perform their final trick, but they don't actually go anywhere. There are a lot of missing parts that leave this puzzle filled with too many holes to see the big picture.What I Thought – Wait for DVD Now You See Me is what any magic act should be – fascinating to figure out and tricky when revealed. Mark Rafflo stomps around most of the movie so upset at any moment you'd expect him to turn into The Hulk and Jesse Eisenberg plays the same smart and smug ""genius"" he did in The Social Network. That's not a great mash-up – at least not great enough to see in theaters. Instead of having audiences leave in awe and applause, there is a residue of deceit and dissatisfaction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fun on a very superficial level,"Most people love illusionists and magicians, arguably making something of a comeback in the entertainment mainstream thanks in part to people like UK based Dynamo.Director Louis Leterrier has crafted a thriller come caper movie that wants to be the ""The Prestige"" but set in modern times.We meet the four performers, street card sharp J Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), mentalist Merritt McKinney (Woody Harelson), not adverse to uncovering secrets and erasing them for a suitable fee. Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) robbing people blind whilst performing his magic tricks and finally Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), an escapologist with a penchant for the macabre.This eclectic band are pulled together as a group following the receipt of the mysterious Taro card requesting them to meet at a certain time and place. Unbeknown to this merry band, they are being played but by whom and why? We then jump forward in time and the group are performing sell out shows on a huge stage at Las Vegas as the ""Four Horseman"". The act is all about illusion and after showing their appreciation to their benefactor Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine), the grand finale showcases a multi million dollar fake bank heist. The group then distribute the ""proceeds"" to a highly receptive and appreciative audience.Following the realisation this may not be an illusion but a bank robbery hiding in plain sight, the FBI are called in. Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), who looks like he slept in his clothes, gets to meet his classic mismatch partner in the form of Interpol agent Alma Vargas (Melanie Laurent).The couple then attempt to track and unscramble what is real and what is not. They are aided and not so much abetted, by another shadowy character Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). An ex-magician for hire who now earns a crust unmasking magicians tricks by explaining how they are performed, which seems a real killjoy way of earning a living.The set up is good and the cast list has great depth of experience to call upon. However, despite this fertile ground many opportunities are wasted. Freeman and Caine get very little to do, Ruffalo and Laurent have zero screen chemistry with the former giving every appearance of needing to phone his agent to ask why he is involved at all The four horseman actors acquit themselves well enough but the whole enterprise is let down by a very weak and implausible story which does not hang together or stand up to scrutiny. A bit like the art of illusion itself, distract the audience with lots of shiny glitter and movie stars and maybe they will not notice the plot makes no sense.I suspect when all the reveals are complete many will ask, really was that it? The film did well at the box office so we may see another go round, lets hope the next time they pull the rabbit from the hat, it's clutching a better script.SummaryFun on a very superficial level but overall with so much talent available and an exciting premise, this is disappointing and could have been so much more.As the tag-line says ""The closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see"", which is very apt for the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Now You See Me isn't the worst, but it isn't the best!","I went to the cinema last week. I was undecided but I opted for choosing ""Masters of Illusion"" or ""Now You See Me"". We look at your poster and title, we denote the illusion that there could be around the movie and noticed even the fantastic cast. Liked of power greet one thing. I went to the cinema through the coupon of newspaper Sol, what is of praising, discounting three Eros. Think this yes is benefit the seventh art, the reading and the easy access of spectators a movie.The film was not a disillusionment. It wasn't exactly the best movie that I saw, but I think that earned the ticket. Despite a history slightly weak, had each good dialogues and some enthusiasm, and some attention in their characters. The film speaks us of a group of four illusionists each with your specialty since hypnotism, hands savvy, magic with objects and surprising tricks of evolution of technology. Found themselves due to a superior strength and magical (that after revealed-if be more surprising and Funny), that the joined, forming the Four Horsemen. So far, nothing mysterious, just a beginning of film to know the characters, so one filled to go to the main story. After make a fantastic bank robbery Créditique Republicaine of Paris, that maybe if reveal a simple magic trick. How is obvious, the FBI needs make your own research to ascertain how can the assault have occurred in Paris if were in Las Vegas.The film was very Soft Spot in the its history base, but perhaps had a good development. It smells the Oceans's Eleven, but with more skepticism and mysticism, and it is clear that this film surprising when we know the true nature of the tricks. The essence of film is what has to best: their tricks, their premonitions, and the background of history similar to of Robin Hood, only with more secret and enigmas. The dialogues showed become quite good and epics.The cast shone without major excesses, but were glitzy as illusionists. With guy of who knows trick, but not wants tell. Loved the character Woody Harrelson, the comic side of the film, and the character Morgan Freeman, the destructive side of the mystery we really want to know, but we were disappointed after he destroy the fantasy that is the trick.Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt were writers of this argument, and Louis Leterrier was the filmmaker. Changed of a register sci-fi and fanciful for a movie with new meanings and full of illusion. Several are the ideas that come of the film. We begin by having faith in what feel and then we let ourselves fantasize by little fantasy that still exists in the world. E we still have let people from stealing at those corrupt rich to give to poor and worthy.Think one sentence of film is very characteristic than is the world of magic and illusion. ""Closer you look, less you actually see."" Or ""Closer you try see, least certainly shalt see."" Try having curiosity and try to discover the illusion, which then end dead, like the cat.You go see, but not wait a movie astonishing.BETTER: The tricks and smells of Ocean's Eleven.WORST: The weak arguments, filled with pieces of pudding.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Now you see me, now you don't.","The title of this movie almost sums up how the film is presented. All that's missing is the second half of the saying: ""now you don't"". It goes to say that at some points this movie is fun and entertaining, hence the ""now you see me"", and at other times it can become almost the opposite, ""now you don't"".The movie presents an interesting concept from the start: a group of illusionists who perform bank heists during their shows and reward the audience with the money. The plot is interesting yes, but the amount of plot holes overall over-lap the amount of a well structured story. There are times where the movie simply makes no sense. I found myself struggling to keep up with the excess amount of twists thrown in, along with the brutally fast pacing of the film. On the plus side, some of these twists are exciting and lead to some great moments, and some of the ""action"" scenes, if you will, are fun to watch. The magic tricks and illusions are especially interesting. However, more often than not, the plot as a whole fails to deliver, despite the occasional exciting scene.Director Louis Leterrier's direction style didn't always seem to fit this movie. The pacing was way off, and there was little to zero character development, making it seem like a group of characters were thrown together for almost no good reason. Now again, there are occasionally parts where I felt the movie was moving along fairly well and it had me interested, but too often the movie lacked proper pacing, and suffered from non-existent character development throughout.The cast ranges from the mildly to the highly experienced, with the likes of Dave Franco to Morgan Freeman, Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg. It's a talented and diverse cast that is brought together, and each actor does a great job in their respective roles. Again, the one thing that hurt the cast was the lack of character development. Mark Ruffalo, Isla Fisher, and Michael Caine round out the solid cast and to reiterate, all give great performances.In Now You See Me, there was a great opportunity to create an interesting take on the heist-related genre. At some times, the movie is entertaining, showing off some fun, mind-stretching action scenes that leave you wanting more. Unfortunately, more often than not, the incomplete plot, under developed characters, overly fast pace, and misleading feel for the movie prevents it from being something bigger and better.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A very good film that moves at a good pace.,"I've just read a review on this film that says they wished they'd turned off after 15 minutes and gave it 1 out of 10 because they couldn't give it 0. Obviously they were looking out of their window when the film was on and maybe watching a pigeon fight or something. This film is a good bit of fun with a good bit of action in it. The movie is about illusion, and of course the whole premise of illusion is, 'You can do anything'. It's actually very cleverly woven together with enough twists and turns to highlight the distractive techniques used in 'Magic'. There is a great twist at the end, which some people may have got, but not many. So, yeah, I'd say to the reviewer who says 1 out of 10, stop reviewing films because you're not good at it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Things are not as they seem in Now You See Me,"One genre that can really entertain when done right is the heist flick. For them to work one of the most important things is to have a creative approach to the heist or the heist itself. Lately there have been very few adding anything new to the genre, but with Now You See Me they look to have tried to add a bit of magic to the struggling genre literally. With a great cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine does it create the spectacle it promises or are the trailers all an illusion?Now You See Me follows an FBI agent and an Interpol detective track a team of illusionists who pull off bank heists during their performances and reward their audiences with the money. For once a film got the heist element right and delivered a clever and engaging story to go along with it. This isn't a perfect film by any means, but thanks to the magic element, which is usually a film killer, it takes it to a level that keeps things moving in an interesting direction. While the trailers showcase the magicians as the leads, this isn't quite the case. Make no mistake they are in the majority of the film and deliver the best parts of the film, but this movie follows more of Mark Ruffalo's detective as he is obsessively trying to solve this case. Typically Ruffalo is great and he is decent here, but just not up to par of his normal performances. Most of this is due to the character not being all that interesting and the attempt to thrust more depth into it that was really not necessary. The rest of the cast have great chemistry and chew up the scenery around them with Michael Caine really the only one with very little to do. The heists are fun to watch and ponder how they pulled it off even though some of them are predictable, but for the most part create a great presence on screen. While not a lot there are some great action moments here and there that were pretty surprising featuring Dave Franco that probably were not all him, but still fun to watch none the less.With the exception of some of the useless character elements to the Ruffalo character the rest of this movie is pretty entertaining adding a unique twist to the heist genre that has been missing. It probably would have been even better if the main focus had been on the magicians also known as the Four Horseman, but who knows maybe the less is more approach is why it worked so well.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Movies about magicians keep getting better,"We've come a long way from the unbelievable, magician-insulting crap that was the Prestige.Where the Prestige got just about everything about magic and magicians wrong, this gets it right., There are one or two minor flights of fancy (I don't think the bubble levitation is workable, but I could be wrong.) but by and large it is very true to both the art and the ethic of the magician,Magicians since the time of Houdini at least have been very aware that our dark cousin is the con man, and we hate them and seek to expose them wherever we can. In this day and age, the con men wear suits and run corporations and banks, and in spirit there is no netter group of people to challenge them then magicians.In addition to getting the small stuff right, this movie gets it right in the large. Just when I was shaking my head and saying ""this can't be done, the safeties aren't there and it depends too much on people doing the right things at the right time"", the movie pulls out the ONLY solution that solves all those problems.Like all great magic tricks, there is only one good solution, but the magician distracts from it to the point that we don't even realize its there.Sadly, I think this movie suffered from the problem many really good movies about magic do... they are so faithful to the hidden art that no one but practitioners believe its real. Ironically, the more absurd a movie about magicians is, generally the easier it is for the audience to swallow. The more accurate, the less the common man believes it.Which is probably why The Prestige did so well and this so poorly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Expected more from the concept, didn't like to know I was being misguided","I've heard some good things about this movie, seeing my brother told me it was something quite different and I knew it had quite the star cast, so seeing I liked the combination of Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson in Zombieland, I was very interested in seeing this.At first I didn't know where this movie wanted to go. There was a lot of misdirection and blank holes to be filled. Figuring that they would be filled in on the course of the movie, I continued watching. (I'm a curious guy.) Step by step, more and more of the objective of the 4 Horsemen was revealed, learning more and more why they were doing what they were doing. Now, I like a bit of misguiding, but I don't like to know that I'm being misguided. It makes the movie progress slow and the tid-bits of action and special effects feel like they were included to up the pace. It's like watching a mediocre magic show, knowing you'll be misguided in the usual kind of ways.There is nothing wrong with the acting, you can't go wrong with this cast. I just feel that there was more in this concept than there was done with and you can't only rely on the actors to fill that in.

After a bank robbery for which they have an air-tight alibi, they were performing in front of hundreds of fans at the time, they are brought in by the police to be investigated.

All bark no bite.,"If you like strong and logical plots, you are likely to dislike this one. It's all about appearances and show in this one, rather than actually being brilliant, the characters and story just ask you take their brilliance for granted.The story revolves around illusionists (implicitly portrayed as demigods I would say) and how they manage to fool everyone and get a little fooled themselves. Of course, with all this fooling around there are always chances that something might strike the funny bone, that is to say it has its humorous moments now and then but on the whole the illusions and tricks etc. is just more of a dazzle than something logical and realistic. There is not much depth to the characters and a lot of misdirection to make the climax more effective, but the misdirection only adds to the illogical nature of the plot and makes the story hollow.Having criticized enough the good parts for me were the cocky-as-usual Jesse Eisenberg and some of the funny moments but nothing else.

Slick all-star nonsense is still nonsense,"Now You See Me starts out really well. A group of illusionists are brought together and within a year they are playing Vegas together and appear to rob a bank in Paris remotely. This draws in the FBI and Interpol but how can they prove anything when it all seems so impossible and so hard to prove? This setup offers a twisty and engaging plot but sadly it is one that never gets delivered upon. Instead what we get is a constantly moving film that is loaded with stars, money and special effects but nothing of nay real substance.This approach works really well when it comes to the slickness of delivery and how polished it all feels, but it is so very unsatisfying as a whole product. The twists and turns of the film are almost all nonsense – slickly elaborate and delivered with pace for sure, but with nothing behind of any substance. As a result I stopped caring about the plot or about working out what was going on behind the theatrics. Movement appeared to be the all and after a while I tired of it. The slick delivery is all well and good and it is added to by the cast – so many faces, so many quality actors all getting handsomely paid but doing very little. It felt like a waste.It isn't a terrible film by any means; the pace and slickness makes it work on that level but it does very little else which is engaging or memorable.

With a shocking end and the perfect cliff hanger leading onto the next movie I guarantee that you'll love this one. Would definitely recommend to watch this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Enjoyable in parts but somewhat overrated,"There is entertainment and action in abundance in this colourful, glossy and, at times, highly enjoyable, film centred on the world of illusion, deception, and the magician. And, at times, we appear to be treated to explanations as to how tricks were done, but sadly, in doing so, many important pieces of the descriptions were simply ignored because they were inexplicable. It kind of takes the biscuit when you explain the easy and, perhaps, most dramatic parts of trickery but fail on the subtleties where the real tricks occur. But the context of the film is how trickery can be used to fool us all via the many diversions the film uses along the way.Of course you have to suspend reality watching this film or it can get a little tiresome, which is probably why I found it enjoyable but only in parts. It is a good twenty minutes too long and kind of waffles it way through the final five minutes or so. The actors seem like they're having a good time and the sets are fabulous. But the whole seems to add up to something a little less than satisfactory.Six out of ten.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Magic and Character development were lacking, but surprises entertained","It is very important to realize that this movie must not be spoiled. I will not be discussing anything not shown in the trailers, and I ask you not to go looking for such secrets online, but only by watching it yourself. This movie is designed to entertain, and to a degree it does just that.I haven't seen many of Leterrier's films, but I enjoyed this about as much as The Incredible Hulk, but more than Clash of the Titans. There were still disappointments. Magic movies have been a great interest of mine, and from the trailer I had to wonder, does Michael Caine + woman in a tank = The Prestige? Truthfully, the similarities stopped there, including magic's screen time.Despite magic taking up most of the trailers, it was too scarce in the film itself. I wanted more magic. I know that doing so would take screen time from Ruffalo, but he wasn't the best of the bunch. In fact, they were Freeman, Caine, and Laurent, respectively.The screen writing didn't allow for many to develop character well. The Four Horsemen were usually smooth-talking brick walls. And was that Dave Franco I saw? He had no screen time! (except for brief fancy dodging falling fighting)These character holes would be acceptable if the movie were a large show. But as mentioned before, magic only came in smaller pieces, when at all. Some were amazing, some were old already, and some were hilarious.It seems like I didn't appreciate the movie much, but I could only talk about what I didn't like. The rest, the secrets, I loved but can't talk about. Suffice it to say that many surprises are in store, and they're worth watching the movie for. That said, it's best to go in without guessing and predicting, because seeing the many reveals is where most of the entertainment lies. Don't spoil it for yourself.This is a film some would be happier seeing in theatres, but if you don't think you'd spend ticket money for this, you'd probably regret it, so wait for DVD.As a warning, there is a suggestive/inappropriate scene near the beginning that ends up going nowhere, but children's eyes should be turned aside. Also, there's a moment in a Mardi Gras parade that needs to be avoided, and minor language throughout. I'd recommend this movie for 17+, not only for these, but for the understanding of the secret material I can't bring up.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fast paced modern magic excitement..,"This movie started off good and stayed that way. Right from the jump you're thrown into a instant mesmerizing view of excitement. After that I felt like I was flipped straight into a coliseum of amazing special effects ( or at this point I can't say it wasn't * pause for dramatic affect * MAGIC - picture me doing wavy magic fingers, OK stop picturing me doing that I'm done now ) Mind blowing action that I did not expect from this genre of movie mixed with a storyline and plot that kept me wide eyed and interested every step of the way. All the actors did an incredible job. No one was out shined. Every line was delivered excellent and was Believable. This is easily a movie I can watch multiple times with the same excitement as the first. I won't spoil anything for you except the fact that this movie was money well spent.

One of the best movies of 2013,"As someone who enjoys trying to figure out what's coming next 'Now You See Me' was incredibly entertaining. Perhaps you'll fare better in terms of whether or not you can guess what's happening but regardless it should be a fun exercise.Aside from that the performances were all really good. The director had a nice pace in terms of have things progressed and there didn't appear to be any parts of the movie where certain scenes were clearly sped up (a personal pet peeve of mine).I was able to see a pre-screening for the movie so there could be some bias in my review (free movie helps, right?) but I am planning on going to see it later today so I obviously don't mind paying full price to watch it again. That and I've pretty much told everyone I know that they should see it in the nicest way possible in order to keep expectations reasonable.Definitely recommend you to go see it because it's a fun movie/experience :-)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
I Hope You're Able To Suspend Your Disbelief!,"Now You See Me may lack great characterization or a tight script, But I'll be darned if I didn't say I was dazzled and razzled by the film. It shouldn't have been entertaining as it was, but I was able to suspend my disbelief for two hours and I was able to be transported into some sort of fun alternate reality. But the CGI is great and it was used at the right times instead of just constantly.Louis Leterrier's film is about a group of magicians named The Four Horseman who are magicians on the outside, but on the inside they are actually bank robbers. When FBI and Interpol catch their scent, this ensues a thrilling chase where the Horseman must stay one step ahead of the FBI.This film boasted a nice set of attractive actors and actresses. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson were excellent, proving their A-list status. Isla Fisher and Dave Franco were great supplements to the previous two. Franco actually had a great scene involving a tense car chase. Mark Ruffalo was really good as the lead FBI agent. Finally, who can forget about the great Morgan Freeman and the great Michael Caine?Overall, Now You See Me is a really fun movie and I was certainly dazzled. The CGI and the set pieces were great. I can also say the same for the acting and the directing, which makes up for the lack of a good screenplay and characterization. It is action-packed and it is funnier than I thought it would be. Out of the two films based on magicians that came out in 2013, this film is the better one. Sorry Jim Carrey! I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Not bad at all,I enjoyed this film for a number of reasons. It was well acted by everyone and had an interesting plot. I loved the magic and it seamed the actors had gone to a lot of trouble to appear convincing in each of their roles. But the main reason I enjoyed it was the end. I genuinely never saw it coming! Great twist! My only criticism is that it could have been even better.

It's a promising start as a fun interesting movie that gives us a little insight into magicians. Then it turns.It becomes all flash and little substance. The heists keep coming. It's like the movie is its own trick. They keep pumping up the flash in order to disguise the lack of a good story. The final twist is just fool's gold. There is no foreshadowing.

Mind Boggling and Wonderful,"Happy to see one of my favorite actors, Jesse Eisenberg, preform in another successful and overall good film. I had high expectations for this movie, knowing that it is full of great actors.It was a very well written movie and the plot was genius which worked hand in hand with the great actors. The plot twists in this film are just spectacular. It will have you on the edge of your seat throughout and wondering how they perform each trick. But the end is what makes the movie blow your mind. For some people, you may get lost during the movie or even bored. But if you stick it out through the end you will appreciate the greatness of the movie. As the movie progresses and the conflict becomes even bigger and bigger it results in more wonder and curiosity. It was very unpredictable throughout which made it all the more enjoyable. One of the best movies I have seen this year and is with out a doubt worth seeing. Any movie lover would enjoy this film and i recommend to all.

"A complex brain twister that is fun, brilliant and stylish","WOW!!!That's exactly how I feel about NOW YOU SEE ME. Frankly, I don't see why many dissed the film. Perhaps, because this one constantly urged them to actually use almost 90% percent of your brain to decode the tricks in the entire movie from start to end.No doubt the movie is a mixture of numerous tricks ranging from optics to numbers to common logic. And there were also some that still remained to be explained; supernatural maybe. Nevertheless, the movie was both totally mind-blowing and mind-boggling.To be honest, I'm not all too crazy with Louis Leterrier as the director. I mean his take on the 2010 remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS was quite a disappointment.However, the ensemble cast was amazing, cool and slick; just as I had expected them to be. But the intricacies of panning out the plot was a complex one. So much so that there was an essence of solving a mystery a la the Nicholas Cage's film, NATIONAL TREASURE. There was also that essence of Dan Brown's ""Robert Langdon"" style which we saw in THE DA VINCI CODE and ANGELS & DEMONS.However, the more intriguing charm about NOW YOU SEE ME is that it actually compels the audience to think as to how the ""magicians"" were able to literally trick the audience. In other words, it's like watching that TV show, ""Secrets of Magicians Revealed"" with Morgan Freeman played its TV-equivalent of Mitch Pileggi who revealed how each of the tricks were pulled off.No doubt there is a twist to this one and you would constantly try to figure out who was behind the whole grand plan. At times, I was convinced that it was Freeman himself but he was none other than a red herring.I mean the plot got so twisted that I simply gave up and chose to sit through the movie as the end revealed the real mastermind. In actual fact, this person was right under our very nose that we didn't see it coming.I'd see it again.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Definitely wasn't what i was expecting,"The most I can say about Now You See Me is that it was okay. I don't think that it was spectacular like many critics are saying. Now don't get me wrong, this movie had one of the most interesting ideas I've seen in a while. The idea of magicians using their act as a front to rob banks and give some money back to the little guy was what drew me into this movie in the first place. But once you're sitting there watching its just kinda like ""eh"". I don't mean to sound snobby, I just think that maybe the movie talked itself up to much and it suffered because of it. For one thing the movie moves really fast for itself. By this i mean that once the horseman acquire their act in Vegas and Mark Ruffalo is called in to catch them after the bank robbery it just feels like i'm already in the middle of the movie. As the movie progresses it eventually catches up with itself, but regrettably this made it hard to watch. Also i felt like the protagonists didn't get enough screen time, I get that if we saw too much of the 4 horsemen it would have given away the secrets to their tricks and such thus sort of ruining the twists at the end but i felt like they could have given them a few more scenes that didn't exactly inform the plot but kind of provided some fan service. I think the thing that baffled me the most though was how supernatural the film got. I was expecting the usual magician tricks or y'know things that seemed a bit believable. But after the scene with the curtains and Isla Fisher floating in a giant bubble, all preconceived notions of reality sort of went out the window. So in conclusion i give ""Now You See Me"" a 6-10 it was so-so.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

As a screenwriter myself, this is one of stories that never ceases to amaze me. The depth, the detail, the reveals and the nuance that went into this is incredible.

Exciting and well paced,"I was so excited by the trailer although I thought the trailer revealed more than it should.I had high expectations for the movie and it delivered more than I expected except for the ending.Different people will feel differently about the ending but in my opinion it was not much convincing, need to have more proof on how it happened. But apart from that, the movie had a good pace where everything is happening at quick sessions where you don't see scenes wasting time. Jesse Eisenberg was great again,I was so impressed with his arrogant character in ""The Social Network"" and he has actually inherited some of those characteristics to his character in ""Now You See Me"" too. His style of speech gives a great personality to the character he plays. In stories like this, (like Italian Job, Ocean 13) although our story leaders are robbers or con artists, we want them to win. We like them to succeed. But will NYSM story leaders win their game against the determined FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo)? What is Thaddeus Bradley's (Morgan Freeman) role behind all these?

Can you see me now?,"I do like to know as little as possible about a movie before I go ahead and watch it. Movies like this one almost make no sense watching if people tell you more than a few pillars/plot points of it. It's about magicians, but also about crime. It's also a thriller, but also very funny almost like a comedy.Intentions may not be clear, but they will be by the end of the movie. And while some things seem to convenient (like a relationship that seems to build too fast), the movie does work and warrants more than another viewing. It's been a while since a movie was as mysterious yet so intriguing and rewarding as this is. Prestige by Nolan comes to mind (which is slightly better, so if you haven't seen that one, go check it out, though not as funny and light as ""Now you see me"" is)!Great entertainment, great actors and a stunning finale",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Would-have-been-beautiful-movie spoiled by poor writing and a million plot holes,"""Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see"" - while the makers of this movie have been pushing this message ever since the trailers came out, even after walking out of the theater, it has been hard for me to figure out what kind of a movie this is - no matter how closer (or farther) I look at the issue!Alright, this is a movie about magicians (who call themselves The Four Horsemen, no biblical reference intended). But, is this a movie about magicians performing magic? Please stop thinking on the lines of Nolan's ""The Prestige"". It is hard to look at the movie from this ""magic"" perspective because magic does not form the essential crux of the story. Well, there is magic throughout the story, some of which well explained and some of which totally bizarre and unexplained, but the magic is simply not the central theme of the story. Of course, towards the end of the movie, people disappear in carousels, and re-appear in France; however, a simple climax twist not-so-well connected to the movie proceedings does not do enough justice to the infinite number of unexplained magic tricks throughout the movie. It would have been amazing had some of the mind blowing tricks been explained; the only plausible answer to the question: ""Why were these tricks not explained"" is that the story is simply not related to those magic tricks. Is this a heist movie? It started looking like one initially; though there is some stealing involved, it did not feel like one at the end. Wait, is this simple, plain revenge? Ah, the final minute of the movie conveys this idea, but at that moment, the viewers can definitely figure out the answer to the million dollar question: ""What type of a movie this is?!"", with the answer being: ""Who cares!""""Now you see me"" is a perfect example of taking a good story, getting an amazing cast to work for you, but spoiling the fun for the audience with some poor screenplay writing and direction. For most part of the film, the story does not seem to head to any particular direction or with destination in mind at all. The magicians are supposed to perform three acts - first in Las Vegas, second in New Orleans, and third in New York City - and each act is supposed to top the previous one. While the first act sets up the stage for the movie, the second act creates so much excitement for the audience. Unfortunately, the final act along with some preceding and succeeding scenes is mostly responsible for the letting the entire movie, and hence the viewers, down!It is easily possible to write pages after pages praising for the entire cast, and they actually deserve it. Be it Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco who star as the Four Horsemen, Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent as the policemen who try to catch up with the magicians' tricks, Michael Caine (who, I thought, did not have much to do!) or Morgan Freeman, all of them have performed extremely well. Halfway into the movie, I started thinking whether Mark Ruffalo or Jesse Eisenberg was the main character, especially since Eisenberg appeared so sparingly after the first fifteen minutes of the movie, and it was a full Mark Ruffalo show from thereon. However, what was supposed to be a cat and mouse game between them did not create sufficient tension to captivate the viewer.The real problem lies with the script and direction. Though the first half of the movie sets up the stage well, it drags between the first and second act, and right immediately after the second act as well. Good writing should have upped the ante after the second act, but the movie sets off as a torn kite without a clear direction. May be that's why when the final twist - which is supposed the awe the audience - appears, the viewer is already frustrated with the one million unresolved plot holes, and hence, the reaction to the twist is: ""Oh, OK! The movie is over, let's get out of the theater!"" Worse, if somebody were to try to make some sense out of it, there are a million questions about the story, particularly regarding the fifth horseman whom Mark Ruffalo has been searching for throughout the movie - very contrived, the entire episode looked.In all truth, I liked the overall story and in parts, the movie was fun. Even the climax twist was not a let down, only the events that culminated in it were! If alone, they concentrated some more on those plot holes, if alone they had a more taut script to tie down the viewers, if alone the movie had a clear destination instead of the dumb third magic act, if alone Louis Leterrier and co. had steered the ship better, the film would have turned out to be an amazing heist-cum- revenge-cum-magic movie! Unfortunately now, the movie is none of the three!What I saw:Direction: 3.0/5 Writing: 2.5/5 Acting: 3.5/5 Music: 3.0/5 Cinematography: 3.5/5What I felt:Degree of Tautness: 2.5/5 Emotional Quotient: 2.5/5 Intelligence Quotient: 3.0/5 Entertainment Quotient: 3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The trick is on you if you pay 12.00 to see this movie!,"The movie is called ""Now You See Me."" And by that, I assume they were referring to the plot. Nice one guys- I was fooled! This is what happens when a screenwriter writes from the ""outside in"" instead of the ""inside out."" It's all about outside elements (plot plot plot, twist twist twist) and no inside elements (human motivation/emotion). Honestly, I couldn't give a spoiler to this movie if I tried, because I have no idea what it is about. No-one does. It was just the filmmakers making up whatever cliché was convenient for them at the time and trying to twist the plot so much that YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. Oh spare me that horse crap! It's always sad when movies TRY to be 3 steps ahead of an audience.NEWS FLASH TO DIRECTOR Louis Leterrier. We're smart now. You know.. audiences. Maybe this flashy, celebrity packed mis-direction movie would have worked in the 90s, but unexplained magic tricks are boring to us now. We don't fall for stupid, predictable camera manipulation anymore.We know you've been rubbing one out to The Illusionist and The Prestige every night for the lat 3 years, but let's be honest... you can't one up The Illusionist, or the Prestige. Those are masterful movies that should be left alone. You might have been able to pull this off had it been a TV series. But you had about 20 plot points that went nowhere, because you have no time to develop anything substantial with a feature film with 20 plot points (Cloud Atlas being the only exception). When you finally revealed the big secret, the audience I was in was disinterested and distracted by all the gaping holes left over from Act 1. Forget Act 3. Car chase sequence? Really? (no that's not a spoiler, because it was not a central part to the story). Speaking of story... It was interesting that the filmmakers choose not to include back-story- or motives- or subtext, or indications of character inspiration, or clues onto what certain symbols meant. It was just all one big, fat convenient mystery that ends in the most overdone Hollywood cliché one can imagine. We didn't know who to root for. Just because Morgan Freeman looks like he does and talks like he does doesn't give you a free pass to bukkake your action sequence fantasy all over the screen. Morgan Freeman is not Marlin Brando. His presence doesn't transcend the story. Even Brando himself couldn't have made this a good movie, because you wouldn't have time to invest in him because it's BAM BAM BAM, next plot point, next plot point, twist, twist, twist. The audience was thinking, ""Hold on! Slow down! Wait, what? Huh?""Honestly, I don't want to waste any more of my time thinking about this turd. Just do yourself a favor and wait for it to come out on Redbox. At least then you'll only bitch about throwing away 1.50.

"It's not really a kind of magic, but it is oddly watchable in spite of what is wrong with it.","Actually, my card in the opening was the Queen of something. It was red - Hearts, I think. Honest(!) And yet, it wasn't SUPPOSED to be the Queen of Hearts; it was supposed to be something else, something more obvious and yet at the same time just as random. ""Now You See Me"" is like that - cheeky without necessarily being obnoxious, playful without being disagreeable. You know what you saw, sort of, and your head tells you one thing while some other part of your body cries out something else. It's a good opening - one that commands your attention as the character literally speaks into the camera, but ultimately one which opens a film unable to command as much awe as it thinks it is able to. Like any slight-of-hand trick, it is more style than substance.Much has, of course, been written about how cinema itself is essentially a magic trick; an illusion created by projected light and a series of still images moving rapidly in order to create the impression of motion. We know what we watch is often not real, though sometimes it can be, and on other occasions it is difficult to entirely discern. ""Now You See Me"" is a strange, warped celebration of this fact - a little fatuous, but it uses the bare-bones of the joyous idea of trickery to propel it, and it is good fun while it lasts.The film tells the story of four New Yorkers, bound by the ability to feign illusion to varying extents, being brought together by an unseen character in order to conduct a series of daring public shows. Danny (Jesse Eisenberg) and Henley (Isla Fisher) are your standard stage-magicians, while Merritt (Woody Harrelson) and Jack (James Franco) more resemble con-artists, with Harrelson in particular specialising in the conspicuous art of mentalism. One day, out of nowhere, they each receive suspicious tarot cards which inform them to frequent a local address (a Youtube analysis by Plebtier questions as to whether or not anyone would actually go), only to find it mysteriously unoccupied but for a small presentation which binds them for the rest of the film.Within one year, the group, nicknamed The Four Horsemen, are in Vegas conducting what looks like the robbery of a bank on the other side of the world via the bending of space and time. Here, the crew pick a Parisian man out from the crowd; send him into his bank's vault and then seemingly suck millions of currency out, over the ocean, and into the arena - betraying science in the process. And yet it must have happened, because we saw it happen, don't we?The actions of the Horsemen attract the attention of Mark Ruffalo, who plays an FBI agent by the name of Rhodes, and who, along with a French Interpol agent, seeks to find out just what the Hell is going on. His introduction sees him storm, typical for the archetype, down a corridor in a police station; enter an office; fire off his dialogue and get on with things. Later on, he will sit dishevelled at a bar and consume alcohol in very small glasses. Cliché or diversion? The Horsemen in custody, no one can actually prove anything in spite of the show - are you REALLY going to charge someone for defying physics? Propping the film up is their manager Tressler (Michael Caine), who keeps them under his wing. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, plays Thaddeus Bradley - an ex-magician who profits from revealing the secrets behind other magicians' tricks and who serves as a sort of direct communiqué to the audience when they are most scratching their heads.The film repeats what it does during its opening stunt on a further two occasions, the last of which ties in with the film's climax, creating something which is at once quite stupid but strangely watchable. The film is stuck in a strange no man's land between what is believable in the real world and what we consider movie escapism - if we accept that aliens can come down to Earth and turn into automobiles in one film, why can't a handcuffed magician transfer the keys to his cuffs into a coke can AND break free in the process? Because it's impossible, that's why.It is a curious thing the film has essentially drawn influence from the first ""Ace Ventura"" for its plot, though more curious is that we are asked to believe a Frenchman could've been so persuaded to go to Vegas in the first place; that this motley group might be able to perform armoured van heists; rig explosive getaways and that Caine would be stupid enough to go back to New Orleans if he had history there. Again, we turn to the analysis of Plebtier - when a character steals a black sedan during an escape, it seems as if he does so by chance, yet the film would have you think it was part of a wider, carefully constructed plan involving a crash on a bridge.By the time the film ends, what have we actually seen? The idea, though far from watertight, is quite good fun - it is too convoluted, though is a good crack up to the point it stops and I was, to its credit, still into it by the time the final act was rounded off. There is a whole ream of questions one could ask related to FBI background checks; the presence of GPS bugs in cell phones; how you organise all this without even meeting your insider; why Danny and Henley would even turn to high-scale crime in the first place, and I don't think all of it adds up, though I did enjoy the journey to realising that not all of it adds up...",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Not perfect, but definitely worth seeing.","Don't be fooled. You will not leave the theater being disappointed. This film does not disappoint. The true magic is its ability to capture your attention. It engages you in the story whether it is outlandish or not, that is the thrill of the film.I was let down by the lack of character development overall. It was evident throughout the movie, and the audience never gets a true look into the protagonists' personalities, which could be argued 'adds to the elusiveness of the magicians' but it was definitely lacking in that department. This is partly due to the writing. The writing could have been better, but then again no writing is perfect.However, the film was a solid 8 overall for me. It delivered a perplexing plot of a chaotic and mystical game of cat and mouse. It did not fail to induce good laughter. The overall story inspired thought in the audience, and the resolution was closed well, yet still left room for interpretation which I enjoy. Believable? Hardly, but is magic believable? Appreciate this movie for what it is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Smoke and mirrors,"Well this movie started out interestingly like one of those thrillers, a bit like Ocean's Eleven but with magic and hypnosis. However, the execution and the way the characters move are really strange at times, with no explanation. Like how does this person know a certain matter? Why does this person suddenly do that? How to a lot of questions?Ironically, this movie is indeed what the premise is about, basically magic tricks. Smoke and mirrors. Deception but to entertain, as one guy in the movie indicated.The greatest question though, is that if the mentalist is so amazing, why does he not simply use mass hypnosis on everyone? Or are all the ""hypnosised"" people stage actors? There is just so much plot holes and fantasy involved that even the supposed climaxes seem anti-climatic, some scenes were also incredibly predictable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good Movie,"I hang with professional Magicians who ripped this movie. I am also a magician. One said to me that he expected the whole movie to have actual magic tricks. If that was the case go to a theater magician production. THIS IS A MOVIE. Everything that was done was based on actual magic tricks and could have been done with real effects but a lot was done with editing or CGI. This was done because the amount of time that all the actor/actresses would have had to put in to be able to pull off the effects would have been almost a year. No one has that amount of time to put in for a single movie. I enjoyed the movie a great deal. I thought the writing was tight, the acting good, I have two problems with the movie. One the editing, the fight scenes are editing so badly you cannot understand what is going on. Either the editor or director wasn't comfortable with themselves and elected to go with fast editing which ruined that part of the movie and actually pulled me out and I had to push my way back into the movie. Second, everything was resolved",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
This movie is undoubtedly spectacular from beginning to end!!!! Everyone go watch this movie now!!!!,"This film was absolutely amazing. I simply cannot describe the emotion I felt while watching this. I especially loved the romance between Isla and Jesse. If they ever make a sequel, they should include more romance between them! I highly recommend watching this film. I have watched this thrice already! Jesse Eisenberg also did a wonderful job! This truly is my favorite movie. I would rate this a solid 9.5/10, which rounds off to 10/10. I hope they make a sequel focusing more on the 4 horsemen instead of the FBI. The effects were fantastic as well. I also loved the unexpected plot twist at the end. The first time I watched this, it left me a bit confused, which is a good thing. I couldn't stop thinking about it.

"Not brilliant, but not bad","Although this movie has no spectacular elements in it, it was overall entertaining. With a fun plot and premise centering around four street magicians united by a mystery character, the movie moved at a quick pace. These four main actors were well casted and likable, with memorable quips and sarcastic retorts. Albeit, that's really all they were: likable. They were not developed at all, but rather introduced quickly to set up the plot of the movie. The movie lacked any real conflict for these main characters that would take them from flat descriptions to more dynamic people. They conveniently eluded the police at every turn; they all survived; and they all were happy. You couldn't help but root for them, but something felt like it was missing.Aside from the four magicians, Melanie Laurent, Mark Ruffalo's love interest was almost unbearable. I couldn't help but cringe each time her and Ruffalo interacted; it was beyond corny. At certain points, I was admittedly even laughing at it. Furthermore, at the end of the movie, the ""surprise twist,"" was so unrealistic and impossible that it made the rest of the movie slightly more absurd. The cool plot and idea of a hidden player who united them became droll because it lost all believability with this ending. And when the characters got onto a magical merry-go-round at the end. I mean come on, really?Take this movie at face value, and know what you're paying for. It's no cinematic genius by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a fun, light-hearted action with likable and interesting protagonists. All these elements combined to make this a nice, feel good movie. I was entertained and distracted for a solid two hours, and hey, I think that alone is worth something",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Not Houdini but A Few Good Tricks,"Now You See Me (2013)*** (out of 4)Entertaining but far-fetched action picture about four magicians (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco) who use their talents to pull off some bank robberies. An FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) and a former magician (Morgan Freeman) try to figure out exactly how the tricks are being done and especially since there's no logical explanation. If the trailer for NOW YOU SEE ME left you feeling somewhat cold like me, then the movie itself is actually much better. The trailer would make you believe that this is just going to be a silly little movie and it is to a point but there's also a few nice tricks being done in the screenplay and director Louis Leterrier also manages to do quick a magic trick himself. Throughout the film we're told to believe in magic you can't look too closely to the trick. I think if we look too closely at this story we're going to have many logical problems but the director does a good job at making you forget these and just takes you along for the ride. There's no question that I was entertained from start to finish because the screenplay is good enough to keep you on your toes and you're never quite sure where the story is going to take you. Another plus is that we're given a pretty good cast and each one does a very good job in their parts. Eisenberg plays the brain like no other can. Harrelson has that sly charm working well. Ruffalo is good as the cop and pros like Freeman and Michael Caine never fail. Melanie Lauren is also extremely good in her supporting part. The film offers up some dazzling cinematography and there's no question that the look of the film is very impressive. NOW YOU SEE ME isn't a masterpiece but I think it's a very well-made film that at least does what a cheap magic trick does and that's entertain you.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

More like Meh-gic,"'Now You See Me' is occasionally fun, and at times even clever, but it's also vapid, pretentious and too often stretches credibility to the breaking point—and then way, way beyond. Even a movie about magic has to be grounded in reality, and every trick must have some sort of explanation or it's a cheat. 'Now You See Me' tries to ""Abracadabra!"" its way around this fact once too often.At nearly two hours, this act threatens to get old long before the end credits, but a really good cast and energetic direction hold it all together until the final twist puts a satisfying(ish) bow on the whole thing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

All Flash and No Depth; Average Summer Fare,"I'm not sure what I was hoping for with NOW YOU SEE ME, but I should've known going in that I shouldn't expect a real tight, suspenseful heist film. That might be what I wanted, but director Louis Leterrier was more interested in putting out another flashy summer action movie. The movie's not much more than a flashy spectacle that attempts to shoehorn a big ""twist"" into the end of the film, but it all left me feeling a little disappointed at the end. As a big fan of THE PRESTIGE, I have a nasty tendency of going in to movie's centering on magicians with high hopes that it will strive for that level of drama in the world of magic. This year I've been let down twice: this and THE INCREDIBLE BURT WONDERSTONE. Though Leterrier's magical heist film is nowhere near as derivative as that Steve Carell dud. Instead, it's just your average ""turn off the brain"" summer entertainment. NOW YOU SEE ME opens with introductions to four low-level magicians: J. Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg) is a semi- successful street magician, Henley Reeves (Fisher) is Atlas's former assistant who's gone on to create her own act, Merritt McKinney (Harrelson) is a mentalist struggling to regain his former fame, and Jack Wilder (Franco) is a street-level sleight-of-hand artist. Each of them receives a mysterious invitation that soon leads to an immensely successful show together as the Four Horsemen. When their show in Las Vegas concludes with the seemingly magical theft of millions of Euros from a bank vault in Paris, FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo) is assigned with an Interpol agent (Laurent) to put an end to it before the Horsemen strike again.There are a couple problems I have with this movie. I was hoping, if nothing else, that it would treat the magic in the movie as true illusions. I loved the idea of stage magicians using their craft to dazzle audiences with their show while baffling the authorities with their crafty heist jobs. The movie abandons any hope of that by incorporating CG effects into the illusions, giving them an otherworldly appearance and ruining any feeling of grounding in reality. During the first Horsemen show in Las Vegas, Leterrier uses some horrible CG effect for some floating black clothes in the reveal of the ""transporter"" and reinforced it in New Orleans when Henley takes flight in a giant bubble over the audience. Feasible? Maybe, but it felt like a little too much and suddenly the magicians didn't feel real. Next is the whole concept of ""The Eye"". The Eye is some secret society of magicians dating back to ancient Egypt that was dropped into the plot as some sort of motivation behind the magicians' heists. I don't know about anyone else's opinion, but personally I would've enjoyed it more if the magicians weren't supposed to be anti-heroes but really were just incredibly talented thieves that used their shows and complex illusions to get away with incredible robberies. The Horsemen's selfless acts are secretly manipulated and funded(?) by an unknown fifth figure a fifth Horseman. The reveal at the end of the film of the fifth Horseman's identity is one I saw coming but also hoped I was wrong about because it was just too lame. In addition to being somewhat disappointing, it also raised a lot of questions/problems about everything that had preceded it. Not to mention all the logistical problems behind it.But, if you're ready and willing to shut down your brain, NOW YOU SEE ME is a decently fun two hours. There's a fair bit of action in the film and director Louis Leterrier has proved skills in the genre (yes, I liked THE INCREDIBLE HULK). There's a pretty wicked fight scene about halfway through the film between Ruffalo and Franco that ends with the obligatory overblown car chase every successful summer blockbuster needs. And the glimpse into the Horsemen's more grounded illusions and how they pull off some of their heists is pretty cool. Plus, you really can't complain with such an awesome cast on hand. Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Michael Caine, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman, and Melanie Laurent. It's a pretty stacked team here. If the material were stronger, we'd probably have a real killer movie. The material doesn't live up to the potential of bringing all these choice actors together. Still, they bring their usual quality performances to the game and that alone is enough to earn the movie some brownie points. All things considered, NOW YOU SEE ME balances it strengths and weaknesses to be a serviceable summer action movie. Set your expectations to mid-level and you'll be fine. With a sequel on the way and that lame fifth Horseman reveal finished, maybe the filmmakers can wow us with the next inevitable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

And one thing I have to say is the Franch blondy acts very well although her character has little chance to express. Comparing with these old famous Freeman and Tressler the youth do a better job, but I'm not here suspecting there acting skill maybe it is because the wrong character.

"Fun, but fails to amaze","""Now You See Me"" started quite convincingly that makes audience curious of how they did that trick. Their first show at Las Vegas as The Hourseman when they rob a bank is really interesting to see and I thought this movie would be promising, complicated and mind blowing. But unfortunately after that scene, this movie becomes slow and tries to be smart for audience which is actually not. I found myself bored and exhausted watching half of the movie. There are many questions to this movie that has no answer to be explained. The trick itself is kind of impossible and not makes any sense that only could happen in a movie. In other words, audience is forced to accept that the concept of the movie is brilliant. The chemistry between characters here are also poor development, chemistry is one of the most important aspect if people want to create this kind of movie.

Obviously they weren't really done to a realistic tone, but the scenes made you feel like you should believe.The character development lacked heavily, giving the magic tricks on screen more character than the characters themselves. You're introduced to an array of characters immediately with them all impersonating a certain cliched stereotype, leaving the audience to decide the rest.Timing was an element that could have been worked on a bit more, with lines and certain parts of speech being overlapped by others saying their lines, with the main contributor being the incessant overacting of the few actors.Mark Ruffalo does a brilliant job expressing his character, making the audience take in every breath and every bit of frustration he lets out.Overall the movie was promising, and did deliver up until the end.

"Incredibly contrived, lazy script wastes the acting talent","Now You See Me starts off promisingly, but sadly spirals downhill very quickly. Nonsensical ""magic trick"" after nonsensical ""magic trick"" goes completely unexplained, and save for one minor trick near the start of the movie, the explanations behind those few for which explanations are attempted become more and more nonsensical. Few films ask you to suspend disbelief to this degree, and the rare few which do are universally terrible.There is a great cast in this movie, and although the CGI is often mediocre, the cinematography is of the standard you'd expect from a mainstream Hollywood film. And yet, all is wasted because of a plot with gaping holes in it, the size of the Holland Tunnel. No attempt is made to fill them in, either. You watch scene after scene, asking yourself why you're even continuing, and hoping above hope that all will resolve itself in the end.It doesn't. The ending is even more childish and ham-fisted than the rest of the movie. Now You See Me is a staggering disappointment, and it all comes down to one of the weakest scripts in recent memory.What a shame.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A visually stunning, mind boggling, magical extravaganza","This film is about four magicians who team up to perform the most spectacular magical heists ever seen in history.""Now You See Me"" tells the story of how four magicians perform the unbelievable heists while on stage, such as robbing a bank in Paris while they are on stage in Las Vegas. They give away the money to the audience, making them an overnight sensation. It also thrilled me to see it, as it is refreshing to see a heist in Robin Hood style! All the magic involved in the heists is explained, with credible explanations as to how they did a seemingly impossible thing. I like this a lot, as it is easy for a film to fall victim to movie logic, i.e. it's magic and therefore it can be ridiculous and non-sensible. The constant cat and mouse game is thrilling, and the end gets even better. When a group of people seem to be two steps ahead of the game, they are in fact three steps behind. Nothing is as it appears, echoing the theme of magic.""Now You See Me"" is a visually stunning, mind boggling, magical extravaganza.

started out good but ended terribly. simpler might have been better,"Now, i will not claim to be as good as the writers of this film. The 1st ten minutes captivated me and i was ready for an explosive movie. Jesse Eisenberg and the sleight of hand... Woody Harrelson and the hypnosis... Isla Fischer appearing in a crowd instead of being eaten alive by piranhas...Then... holes began to appear. By the middle of the film, i knew who the employer of the Four Horsemen was. And i am not a magician either... it became quite predictable.All in all, i still enjoyed. The end really popped the balloon and deflated the hype. Simpler would have been better.

Look A Little Closer,"The critics, and others, point out that the characters were 'thinly developed' and that the movie lacked substance. It is true that the characters are rather thin. But they, the actors/actresses, are just stage props.The stereotypical magician is frequent;y assisted by an attractive assistant. In such shows, the magician is the main character and the assistant distracts the audience. Here 'the magic' is the main character and it is the qualities of magic that are developed throughout the movie. The 'human characters' are the stage dressing - the 'attractive assistant', for the magic.Viewed in this way, the plot is not scattered but flows from one aspect of magic to another throughout the movie and does not lack substance.The tag line in the movie says it all - the closer you look, the less you see.My conclusion - good entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Seeing Is Definitely Not Believing!,"Magic at times can be so amazing that it literally will leave you dumbfounded, speechless, and wondering what the heck just happened.

Most of the magic/illusions and tricks were no great surprise and were fairly predictable. Although Disappointing in this area, the movie was actually very entertaining. Jesse Eissenberg has proved that he is no ""flash in the pan"" and really shone in this movie proving that he can handle a sizable role. Isla Fisher was as gorgeous as ever but with no real meat to her character she was there more for the aesthetics. Melanie Laurent, a relative newcomer to American audiences really caught the eye and could be one to watch for the future.

"Good Trailer, Poor Film","I'm not wholly sure why I don't like this film, but I really don't. I think that it tried too hard to be clever, and I clearly didn't 'get it'There is nothing wrong with the cast, I like them all and there's no one I would single out as having an 'off day' or providing a poor performance. There are many twists and turns in the script, which I would normally approve of but I'm not sure that the lack of a story is the problem. The main story is unnecessarily convoluted with a condescending need to re-cap events and explain how you were misdirected the first time you saw this. When the director keeps showing me something and then saying that wasn't what happened it doesn't take long for me to stop caring about what just happened. The result is a film that's much too long and takes far too long to get to the point so that when the final twist did happen I just didn't care anymore.I was intrigued by the great trailer for this film, but it over-sells the actual film which was very disappointing.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Now You See Me - Intelligent, unpredictable and quite original","This film is based on the magic trick efect. Starts off by letting you believe you know how it works, but at the end it shows you that you weren't (almost) always ""one step closer"".The directing is good, no visible mistakes found, but I have to admit that is, same as the script, a bit exaggerated when it comes to some scenes. In spite of that, Louis Leterriermanaged to direct an alert movie which amazes with every scene.The script isn't that abundant in originality, borrowing sketches from another genre films.

Oh No You Don't,"Review: I believe anything is worth seeing at least once, especially so for an original idea; magicians that rob a bank, how has this not been done before? Which is why I was particularly excited to go see ""Now You See Me"". However, I am somewhat superstitious when it comes to watching movies in theatres, every time during a movie when someone leans over and whispers to me something like ""this is actually pretty good"", my expectations start to dip, and with that they are met. It's almost a self fulfilling prophecy I think a film is about to head down hill and it does.""Now You See Me"", is a perfect analogy for Common's film career, as well as his starring role in the movie. The scenes that lead the audience through the first two acts of this movie are all very enjoyable. The action is of course fun to watch and well staged, and the characters, though all mostly one dimensional are played by good looking (the women anyway) and very charismatic actors, and the film has many funny moments. I felt duped though as the magicians themselves are pretty much sidelined, and the majority of the screen time is given to Mark Ruffalo. It's the Ruffalo show! His romantic sub-plot with Melanie Laurent really doesn't go too far or is that compelling, which is ridiculous. Because it seems Mark Ruffalo phones it in here, yet how can you not fall in love with Melanie Laurent? (shown below) In short on that matter, I'll just say its not on the ""13 Going On 30"" level of romantic tension.Oooh stop it! Melanie Laurent you are too cute! The Director can't quite pull all the threads in this film together. The whole film hypes up its ending as something to amaze, but it seems to lack any meaningful resolution or conclusion in my opinion. I mean it all comes together, just not with much sense A lot of it just kind of happens, entertaining but meaningless. As the credits suddenly rolled I was left disappointed and bewildered knowing the marketing team got the slight of hand on me. Overall Scale: +1",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"The Closer You Look, The Less You'll Actually See","This film surprised me not only with it's intense action scenes or the originality of the plot but by the comedy being able to co-exist with all other elements. My attention was immediately captured by the film's energetic intro which will not lose you through the entire movie. This isn't a type of flick where you really need to turn off your brain, at times it has mildly ingenious tricks which will easily please you. The main thing this film exceeds at is the way it keeps the audience guessing the conclusion/twists, it will work your brain actually tricking you in the process. The movie takes advantage of Eisenberg's usual ""smart-ass"" character, Woody Harrelson also shines, raking in most of the laughs. It truly is magical, in it's twists and action sequences. This is really like a 2 hour Las Vegas show without the Las Vegas cost. As a comedy it meets expectations as well as a thriller, it keeps you at the edge of your seat ultimately deceiving you with it's unique yet realistic twist.

Good- dont think about it too much,"The Movie overall was enjoyable, I thought that the characters arcs could have been explored more, It was really about the misdirection of the magic tricks, and making you wonder how the magicians achieved the tricks. If you're looking for a movie that blows your mind and tricks you every step of the way, this is a movie for you. That said, it's definitely not perfect. Like I said before, the characters aren't explored, or even likable for that matter. Jessie Eisenburg basically just plays an arrogant douche (which he's gotten pretty good at), Woody Harrelson does not get time to shine, Ilsa Fisher's not really in the movie either, and Dave Franco's character is essentially used as a plot device. However, I did find a lot of the characters besides the magicians to be very interesting. For Example, Mark Ruffalo did a fantastic job as the FBI detective, Morgan Freeman did a fantastic job (as always) as a stubborn magician stopper. Lastly, Micheal Caine also did very well in the short amount of time he was given, making his performance as a selfish and arrogant businessman very well done.The third act is definitely the strong point of this film. It ties up the plot, gives a satisfying twist (which I won't spoil here), and wraps up the story. You will leave wanting more mystery and suspense, and will want to know what comes next. If the third act was not done so well, I would probably only give this movie a 5 or 6.Now as far as rewatchability, I don't think this movie has that. Like any movie, the suspense is just not the same as soon as you've watched it once, especially with mystery movies. This movie, I think gets progressively worse and predictable the more you see it, so I'd probably advise watching it once, and maybe again before you decide to watch the sequel.Positive:Direction

The magic is lost on me,"Now You See Me starts off promisingly, but ends on a rather flat, contrived manner which wraps up its predictable plot lines cleanly but artificially. The magic in Now You See Me was lost on me because it is too outrageous, too unbelievable, as opposed to being clever. The combination of magic and heist in this film fails because magic is about fantasy and ludicrousness. Heist is about reality- about careful planning and coordination. Many of the films revelations(which are inevitably the most satisfying part of any such film) may not be entirely predictable, but are still anticlimactic because the qualities of a good heist are absent- the stunts pulled here are too ridiculous and too fantastical for the audience to suspend their disbelief. While the cast is strong and does have individual flavour, the Mark Ruffalo and Marie Laurent characters are really not written well. They are given stock characters to portray, and the ending is quite unforgivable. This is a shame because the first portion of the film was actually quite entertaining- it proves that when a heist film has a witty script, a suave, assured sense of direction, and a clear focus on its protagonists(rather than some outside FBI agent), it can really succeed quite well. But of course the rest of the film never quite lives up to this quality in the first portion, which made for a terribly overall average film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Smug and stylish,"""The closer you look the less you'll see,"" is the tagline for this stylish, superficial crime caper from director Louis Leterrier, whose previous directorial credits include the Edward Norton ""Incredible Hulk,"" and ""Clash of the Titans."" Well I'm not sure what the tagline is getting at, other than a possibly general warning about magicians. The plot is a lot of smoke and mirrors, rather like the tricks the magicians play, and apart from the major twist near the end, is confusing. It was all rather like ""Ocean's Eleven"" but with a weaker cast. Having said that, the script was pretty good and the actors carried it off very well, Woody Harrelson probably being the best of them. Jesse Eisenberg brought the same smug confidence he brought to ""The Social Network,"" Morgan Freeman was excellent, as ever, but Michael Caine was underused. The tricks themselves were impressive, until you remember that Hollywood can do anything with special effects anyway. There looks as though there may be a sequel, but I'm not sure I will bother with it.

Despised it - and not giving it any stars.,"I'm not going to talk about the movie, it's not worth it, and plenty of other reviewers have covered all the aspects I would talk about anyway. All I will say is that movies like this one are why I haven't been to the cinema in over a decade, and why I won't waste my money on any streaming services. And I'm angry that I wasted $2 on the DVD of this one that I found in a thrift store. There are better things to use $2 for. I tried the 30-day free trial for Amazon Prime because I wanted to see 2 movies on there: Ricky Stanicky; and the remake of Roadhouse. Both were garbage, and I think movie studios knew it and put them on streaming because they knew these movies would've tanked at the box office. Movies have been garbage for years now (The Lost City; Jungle Cruise; Uncharted; The Wolf Man; and the list goes on) and are simply not worth paying to see. I'll only buy the DVDs if they're $2 or less at a thrift store, and even then, as with Now You See Me, that is still sometimes a waste of money. What happened to Hollywood? I don't know, or care.

"Mainstream Hollywood, but in fact quite good","I mostly watch art-house movies, but once in a while, Hollywood surprises me in a positive way. I really enjoyed watching 'Now You See Me'. Amidst the mindless violent crap and the overdose of special effects that Hollywood usually produces (I admit, perhaps I'm a bit prejudiced) this film stands out. It's a fast-paced, well-acted and original film that doesn't give you a chance to get bored. Of course, It's light-hearted entertainment and nothing more, and in some scenes the Hollywood predictability gets the upper hand. The car chase is a tired cliché, and the developing romance between two detectives is out of place in this film. I would also have appreciated a less cheesy ending.On the other hand, the start of the film is wonderful. In four short, fast scenes, the leads are introduced. Each of them is a magician and we see them performing their tricks. It's exciting, it's funny and it's spectacular. The scene introducing Woody Harrelson is the best: he is great as a mentalist who can blackmail his adulterous victim in a few seconds, while his wife is standing by.The film is essentially a traditional heist movie (think: Ocean's Eleven, Reservoir Dogs, The Italian Job) with a bunch of specialists who come together for a huge bank robbery. Only this time, the specialists are not professional bank robbers, but magicians, who call themselves The Four Horsemen. And they rob the bank while performing their show in Las Vegas.This original concept is worked out very well. The tag line 'The closer you look, the less you see' is not just a phrase, but serves in fact as the main theme throughout the film, even up to the last surprising twist.I was also pleasantly surprised by the soundtrack. For a change, it is not full of rock songs or spectacular sound effects, but has a nice, catchy orchestral theme that is being played during the magic shows of The Four Horsemen. A little detail I didn't like is the title. It's bland, forgettable and not related to the theme. Why not 'The Four Horsemen', or 'The Eye'. Something more intriguing would have fitted the theme of illusion versus reality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Pass the Popcorn review,"Now You See Me is the newest movie directed by Louis Leterrier, the man who brought us mainly mindless action movies like The Incredible Hulk, Clash of the Titans and Transporter 1 & 2, which is interesting since all the trailers presented Now You See Me as a movie that strives to become something more than a mindless action movie - they presented it as a somewhat intelligent crime/thriller movie. But, hey, even the movie itself says 'come in close, because the more you think you see, the easier it'll be to fool you'. And that's what happened, I saw the trailers and thought I will be seeing an intelligent crime/thriller movie; and I was fooled. Instead I got a boring, fairly mindless movie with some, clearly, needlessly long action scenes.Let me start of with the plot first. So, what is Now You See Me about? I could say that Now You See Me is a movie about 4 magicians called the 4 horsemen - consisting of J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) whose magic acts are a front for robberies, and try to escape an FBI agent who is after them. I could also say that Now You See Me is about an FBI agent named Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) who, aided by an Interpol agent named Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent), is trying to catch these magicians. I could even go as far as to say the movie is about an ex-magician named Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) who tries to expose these 4 magicians and make money off of it. Furthermore, there is Michael Caine somewhere in the equation.I really applaud the movie for assembling such a great cast (maybe the best cast I've seen in a while), however Now You See Me's greatest merit is its greatest flaw. There are just too many characters in the movie, and none of them get enough screen time. Moreover, there are too many subplots, and the movie constantly changes its focus. Who are we, the audience, supposed to root for? For the magicians to succeed in their plans? For the agents to catch the magicians? For Morgan Freeman to reveal the magicians? As a result of these rapid focus changes and the undeveloped characters I completely lost my interest for the movie half way through. Which is a shame, since the majority of the cast are wonderful actors who could have shined in their roles - had they only had something to work with. Eisenberg and Harrelson have no chemistry whatsoever nor do they share much screen time, in spite of the superb chemistry they showed in Zombieland. The only pair that's worse than them are Laurent and Ruffalo, who are awkwardly forced into a romantic subplot.Of course, if you don't care about the characters and just want to see some pretty good scenes with amazing magic tricks (which were the best part of the movie), a somewhat decent and original story and obligatory car chase scenes, knock yourself out! Your money will be definitely well spent if you're not looking for anything more than a forgetfully fun movie. As for myself, I think the movie's title - Now You See Me - is pretty fitting. This is, hopefully, the only time I'm seeing this movie and never again. Since I don't want to get fooled again.Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"An entertaining film, despite some heavy criticism","With a splendid cast of actors and with a story hanging on the unbelievable, Now You See Me is quite the entertaining film and one which truly pulled me into it. Needless to say I've already read some of the hate posts here on IMDb, and while on a reasonable note, these complaints don't actually resonate with me, as I found the movie to be great and exciting, despite its flaws. The basic premise is that a group of former solo magic performers, team up at the request of a mysterious figure, and end up robbing banks during their performances as The Four Horseman. This action quickly gathers the attention of the FBI who assign an agent who, along with an Interpol detective will try to decipher the ultimate trick. As was said, the plot execution is borderline insane and one can see the problem some of the viewers had with the film. Also the four main characters seem to act merely as plot devices and lack any real development. As far as my view is concerned on these points, my conclusion is that it doesn't really matter to me, since I watched this movie to have a little fun and to enjoy being tricked, as is the case here. As much as I enjoy a well crafted movie, Now You See Me is a perfect example of a movie that has worrying flaws, yet achieves what I wanted from it, and that is top notch entertainment. And I'm 100 fine with it.Rating 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Though it's entertaining throughout, and has two actors from the Nolan franchise (Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman), don't compare it to Nolan's masterpiece in the magic realm, 'The Prestige'.The whole cast is incredible, and play characters different from their previous roles, but the characters lack depth and texture. The character interactions and one-liners are filled with adequate amount of wit and humour. Though the characters seem interesting, their presence is lost in the stupendous situations and ridiculous twists.I have to say once again, the movie is spectacular and keeps you hooked from beginning till end, but there's a difference between being tricked and being cheated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
So good I can see a part 3,The story is fantastic. The actors were perfect for their roles. The framing was a little too much; meaning vengeance could have been played out differently. I really dig the love scene towards the end; never thought they'd hit it off. Part 2 should be a good one too. I can't wait to see if Danny boy gets it on with magic hottie. Is it possible for Lionel to fake his death for part 2? The chemistry is so smooth that I even see a part 3 that could work. Here's a little magic for the future tip: Abbra Cadabbera (spell check) you keep making great films I keep buying great tickets!

A Good Movie,"""Now You See Me"" is a good movie and is definitely entertaining. There is not a whole lot else to this, though, other than those two things. I do believe this film has substance, but not too much. It is mostly just an entertaining crime thriller with some comedy and romance mixed into the equation, which spells out 'fun' for me.I like this movie, but it is not the best. Sometimes, the movie felt somewhat contrived, trying to be really smart and unique, when it really does things that have been done hundreds of times before. Now, this movie does it all fairly well, but like I said, it feels a tad bit forced sometimes. The ending had a huge twist which I sort of saw coming, because as I have said, it has been done before. It could have been done a little better, I must say. Also, I do think the film might have been more interesting had it been a more science-fantasy-like film, although that is just my opinion. The film presents an interesting concept, but the twist ending tramples on that concept a bit. Maybe I set my expectations a little too high, but whatever the case is, it is a fine flick that is great for watching with family or friends.""Now You See Me"" has a great cast, consisting of mainly big-name actors and actresses. I enjoyed their acting very much. Plus, the film's special effects were superbly done, and some of the more action-like moments were very thrilling and kept you close to the screen, wanting to see what happens next. That is saying a whole bunch, considering I am not even a fan of action at all.Maybe a second viewing will change my perspective of this film, but for now, it is a solid 7 out of 10. Recommended!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
LOVE this movie,"Undoubtedly, one of the few movies about the magic which I adore. It is filmed very good, the spec-effects are very good. They give the atmosphere of magic and that the feeling as it actually happens in real world. Also the plot is very interesting. It caught my attention from the first minutes of the film and till the end I was watching it with a huge interest. The actors are also chosen very correctly and suit their roles perfectly. Their play is on a high level. Overall I loved this movie very much. I have watched it multiple times and sure will watch it more cause you will never get tired of the plot and the story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Appallingly dreadful film,"If you're going to make a film about magic that at least pretends to have some relationship to reality (e.g. involving the police and Interpol), then why not try to make it very slightly credible? This was mind- numbingly awful, totally unbelievable on every level and an insult to the intelligence of everyone watching it. Total drivel. How established stars like Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine (who usually appear in good films) were persuaded to take part in this rubbish is beyond me (although Ben Kingsley was recently in a worse one, so they are not the only offenders). I don't mind suspending disbelief when watching a science fiction or comic book based film, but not when watching one which tries to pretend to even a bit of reality. Complete garbage and a total waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.,"If you're are looking for entertainment and you don't really care about the depth of the plot then this is the movie for you. The cast was really great especially Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Mélanie Laurent (Melanie was really sexy), Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine. People who were just looking for pure action and thrill have really enjoyed this movie but those who wanted more said the plot is lacking and there was really no development in the movie. I didn't even know where the climax was. It has aerial shots that was used in big budgeted movies and you can see the modernity of the visuals used. Some parts were really corny like Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent's love affair and the time Isla Fisher went inside a big bubble and just levitated. It's not an analytic movie, I thought they were a bit trying hard if they were aiming for that. SO AGAIN, it's up to you if beauty is external or more of internal.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fantastic stupid-over-the-top entertainment!,"This movie knew exactly what it wanted to be from the start and it delivered. It's a preposterous, unrealistic, thrilling non-stop joy ride from beginning to end and I loved every ridiculous second of it.

Surprisingly Fresh & Predictably Stale At The Same Time. ♦ 73%,"The only bad thing, which is a big one, is the dialog style. Maybe the editing had to do with it sucking big time. Other than this, Now You See Me is a shocker!Why? Because it has twists, turns, chase sequences, betrayals & most importantly, revenge juxtaposed into its screenplay. The story is nothing to boast about, but the plot definitely cracks a punch. Writing is fresh, like I said.About the staleness, performances are tad cringe-worthy. Mark Ruffalo & Jesse Eisenberg are what I'm talking about. Maybe it had to with their characters; that is the point - lots of maybes here! So, 7.3 out of 10 for this surprising attempt by the guy who gave us the Transporter series.Music is gold, cinematography is silver while CGI & VFX are platinum.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended to people who love caper stories, with Hollywood smeared onto it. Nothing in the story, by the way!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Sort of Ocean's 11 Meets Houdini: An Enjoyable Flick About the Power of Illusion,"Is magic real? Maybe. However for centuries there are those who don't have one ounce of true magical ability in the literal sense of the word but are able to convince others they do, usually audiences willing to suspend their ""disbelief"". These people are called ""magicians"", and magicians have been performing before amazed crowds since Antiquity and the Middle Ages to the present. The film in question ""Now You See Me"", the first half of the phrase ""Now you see me, now you don't"", takes us into the world of magicians. The main performers, four diverse magicians of mediocre talents, have been brought together to become the Four Horsemen, I assume their name deriving from the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as labeled in the Book of Revelation.Four different magicians have been summoned by Tarot cards for an unknown purpose: Merritt McKinney, whose card is the Hermit, a hypnotist and mentalist (Woody Harrelson), Daniel ""Danny"" Atlas, whose card is the Lover, an arrogant illusionist (Jesse Eisenberg), Henley Reeves, whose card is the High Priestess, an escape-artist similar to Houdini (Isla Fisher), and Jack Wilder, Tarot card Death, a sleight of hand illusionist and street magician (Dave Franco). At the beginning of the film they were magicians who performed spontaneously for small crowds. Through the Tarot cards, they are summoned by an unknown ""benefactor"" and eventually financed by Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine), an insurance magnate. In a year, they evolve from unknown street magicians to a nationally-known headline act, the Four Horsemen. They perform in large venues in Las Vegas and New York.Their escapades catch the eye of FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and U.S. law enforcement when they appeared to have enacted a magical heist from a bank in France. Interpol in Europe also gets involved, and they send a young inexperienced agent Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent), a French criminal researcher who has interest in the occult. As the stunts of the Four Horsemen keep getting larger, involving ever-larger sums of money, Alma and Rhodes find themselves battling a formidable foe. The Horsemen use their magic ""act"" as a kind of misdirection, and the FBI and Interpol always seem one to two steps behind them. The FBI starts to question the motives of Alma in part because they wander if there is a ""fifth horseman"" as yet unknown but pulling many of the strings.Also on their trail is Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), a modern-day skeptic whose show and DVD's expose ""magic"" fraud, similar to Houdini's exposing of séance frauds in the early 20th century. Thirty years previous to the events of the film, Thaddeus exposed another magician, Lionel Shrike. His career was all but ruined at the hands of Thaddeus, until he decided to engage in a comeback by attempting to escape from a safe thrown into the Hudson River. He never escaped and was presumed dead. As a result, the ""magic"" community has had an adversarial relationship with Thaddeus. FBI agent Rhodes tries to ingratiate himself to Thaddeus, hoping the exposer of magic fraud will help them capture the Four Horsemen. The game becomes a kind of cat and mouse in which Rhodes is bent on exposing and arresting the Four Horsemen and using Thaddeus as a kind of double-agent. However, Thaddeus appears less than impressed with the FBI, and although he's not entirely on the side of the Four Horsemen, he seems to admire their tricks. He also has his own agenda, wanting footage for his upcoming show.A fun-filled, action-packed heist-thriller with a certain amount of intelligence. The acting is superb, and the cast of the Four Horsemen are diverse enough we buy into their little eccentricities. Freeman makes an excellent Thaddeus Bradley, constantly pointing out the ineptitude of the FBI. And Caine is a good billionaire magnate who stays somewhat behind the scenes to finance the money-making endeavors of the Four Horsemen. During the film, different miss-directions are explained by Freeman which is half the fun. A good escapist film. But don't try the stunts at home!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fun magical heist movie,"This is a bit of Ocean's 11 meets The Prestige and I'm sure some people will find it derivative, but the mash up of magic and heist movie worked for me. This was tremendous fun from the beginning more or less until the end (more on that later). We meet our four magical heroes in montage fashion that recalls Ocean's 11: each is shown working their own routines and then receiving a tarot card telling them to meet at a specific place and time. A year or so later, they have a magical act together in Las Vegas under the name The Four Horsemen, where they tell the crowd that they will rob a bank live on stage. They then – supposedly – teleport a French banker to his Parisian bank to steal thousands in Euros and leave a calling card, the money is then rained down upon the crowd. Later shows in New Orleans and New York follow the same format. In New Orleans, we see that their act is a kind of Robin Hood gesture, as money is stolen from an insurance magnate and redistributed to foreclosure victims.Morgan Freeman stars as a former magician who now makes a living debunking magic acts and trying to figure out the gang's method; and Mark Ruffalo is the federal agent attempting the catch the Four Horseman committing a robbery. The main cast – Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco – are wonderfully charming. There are a few one liners that fall with a thud, and a couple plot points that might have been better developed, but the movie is a breezy ride most of the way through. Dave Franco, as always, should get more screen time.The central mystery to this plot is who is pulling the strings; who summoned the Four Horsemen to their meeting and organized each of the heists? The answer, when we receive it, is a bit unfair and leaves many open questions. The more you examine the questions, the less they make sense; though repeat viewings may disprove me. This isn't a Sixth Sense kind of ending where you should have seen it coming all along; it's more of a Murder of Roger Ackroyd solution where the perp wasn't even really a suspect.I think that many people will feel cheated by the ending. Still, this movie was an hour and 50 minutes and I thought some more development and additional scenes could have been included. When I want a movie to stretch longer, it's definitely working for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Its not all about magic its the misdirection that was played quit well!,"Recommended by far.
I always say especially in scary/horror movies that producers need to learn misdirection. Its about time in a while I really got into a movie & now I can't wait to see part 2. A lot of the times when I watch movies its easy for me to pretty much predict; yet I'm very close most the time. The acting was perfect, the timing was perfect, & they made a very believable outcome to misdirection. Lets just say they had me fooled & they need to make a horror movie out of the same concept.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Fun to watch, just not too closely.","""I was a hundred and forty million dollar distraction?""Distractions are key to magic tricks, diverting attention to successfully pull off illusions. Now You See Me is filled with great distractions that attempt to hide obvious flaws within the plot and characters. However, the big twist (which is to be expected in a film centered around magic) is a good enough final act to make the film superficially entertaining and enjoyable.The film has a wide variety of cast members, including Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine. In the film, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine's characters are portrayed negatively, which is a bit off seeing these old gents play personas that are far from their usual, likable statures. However, Morgan Freeman still gets his scenes of explaining exactly what is going on at the moment. The four magicians (Eisenberg, Harrelson, Fisher, and Franco) aren't very interesting as characters, mainly because they aren't given the chance. The film jumps back and forth between the escaping artists and the FBI, Dylan Rhodes and Alma Dray (Mark Ruffalo and Mélanie Laurent), that it becomes confusing as to who the main protagonists are. The way the film is put together limits character development, which is why even by the end of the film I found myself not caring about the magicians whatsoever. Their over-the-top personalities are smart distractions for the lack of character development.Story wise, the film is pretty much one big setup for the final plot twist. The viewer isn't told exactly what the motivations are for the magicians to continuously break the law. Therefore, it becomes slightly confusing as to why the magicians would abandon their successful lives in Las Vegas to become fugitives. The act of leaving their elegant lives goes directly against their personalities - street performers (who obviously love the attention) finally get their own Las Vegas show only to throw it all away. It seems as though even the magicians themselves lack information as to what the end goal holds for them. Perhaps if the viewer is shown that the magicians care more about being the best illusionists rather than having an endless amount of cash, their conflict throughout the film would be a bit more believable. Showing them to be con artists and thieves in the beginning of the film (both which have the end goal of making easy money) doesn't really help the story. But, the twists are elaborate enough to distract from the holes in the plot.The chemistry between Dylan and Alma, along with the action and chase scenes, round out the film for a wide range of audience members. While the film isn't focused on action, the chase scene of Dave Franco's character running from Dylan has interesting choreography and a good amount of suspense. Other similar scenes demonstrate that the film looks great visually. However, the CGI makes some of the illusions look fictitious, even though the film does not cross over into the realm of fantasy or sci-fi like The Prestige. In addition, a number of scenes are filled with real life impossibilities. It is important to note that Now You See Me can be best enjoyed by following the big picture rather than paying too close attention to the plot and character development. Ironically, the closer you look, the less there really is to see.So in a way, the film with a budget of $75 million is a $10 distraction for people who want to have a fun time with magic. Sure the plot and some of the characters are trivial, but that doesn't mean that the film can't be entertaining - and it is. And that's what really matters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Come In Close. Because the More You Think You See, the Easier It'll Be To Disappoint You...","""Come in close. Because the more you think you see, the easier it'll be to fool you..."" Not only do the distributors of Now You See Me use this piece of gripping dialogue as the tagline for the film, but exhibitors will also utilise it to trick international audiences into delving into their pockets and wasting their time with this enormously disappointing and unexciting caper film. Now You See Me follows the story of four magicians, known as The Four Horsemen, as they captivate the world with 'magical', near inexplicable bank heists before rewarding their audiences and supporters with the money they take. The only trickery happening here is being hypnotised by the highly intriguing trailer, only to find you yourself have been robbed as you sit in disbelief that you paid to see a film that is about as unique and intricate as a card game of snap!Despite the sensational ensemble of Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Mélanie Laurent, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, they fail to assemble accordingly. They all deliver satisfactory performances but are not given the opportunity to flourish as we may have seen them do so in past roles. This is primarily due to the fact that director Louis Leterrier, along with the writers, attempt to pull too many rabbits out of the hat at one time and so rather than enjoy one bunny at a time, we instead see a ton of terrific actors be undervalued and restricted in showcasing their talents. Most oddly, The Four Horsemen (Eisenberg, Fischer, Harrelson and Franco) are even given surprisingly little screen time after their thirty minute introduction as the film begins.In all fairness, Now You See Me does remain consistent. Consistently unintriguing that is. The film's aforementioned tagline, along with unsubtle hints scattered dubiously throughout regarding the illusionary concept of misdirection, completely ruin any surprise and twist that the 'suspense' film has to offer. By doing this the film leaves little to be unveiled during the climax, one would think, though time is actually wasted explaining all of the plot points you already guessed, while conjuring up new components to the story that remain unresolved and/or illogically explained to the extent that even in a film about magic/illusions, you fail to believe any of the tricks being performed. The illusion of cinema fails as much as the illusion of magic fails to prevail in Now You See Me.Now You See Me is comparable to the student who believes they are the cool fresher on campus, the funniest, with a unique personality, and a mistaken sense of self-intelligence that causes them to continue to contribute to seminars despite the fact they never answer anything correctly. No, in fact, Now You See Me needs to be told by its peers (let's say that's us) that it is not nearly as intellectually gifted, cool, witty or exceptional as it pretends to be. You most certainly will not miss out on anything if you chose not to befriend this dull, generic and embarrassingly misleading film, that is posing as an intricate and sophisticated figure on the surface.When the first thought on my mind after exiting my cinema seat after Now You See Me was ""I actually wish the film had been sold out so I could have returned home to watch The Prestige (2006) or see Man of Steel (2013) again"", it pretty much encapsulates my attitude towards the disappointing Leterrier film. While there is nothing necessarily evident to hate in Now You See Me, there is not a single component to commend as great either. Now You See Me is truly a forgettable 115 minute time thief, and though I have Seen it Now, I would have preferred instead to have missed it and been kept under the illusion that it was in fact an intricate tale, rather than a misdirected fail.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Magical Fun and Clever Schemes,"Abra Kadabra my friends, and like magic another weekend is upon us and another round of movies. This week I start my reviews off with a Crime/Thriller that chooses to use stage performance, illusion, and trickery to pull off the heist. That's right I'm reviewing Now You See Me, a movie that promises to be magical, just not Lord of the Rings magical. So put away your wands and spell books, and get out your deck of cards as I give my two cents on this movie.Let's get right into some of my likes for. First thing has to be the clever plot/execution of this movie. Now we have seen plenty of crime movies over the last decade that use the same stale plot of a highly skilled team pulling of an impossible task of bringing a corrupt man to justice. Now you see me takes that stale plot and reconstructs into something that seems fresh and new. Instead of an elite band of mercenaries, we have four misfits who practice different tricks of the magic trade. They are pulled together by some mastermind who opens the door with a rather shady invite and a year later the adventure starts as the Four Horsemen are forged. Cue the Vegas scene, made famous in the trailer, where the audience, both fiction and real, are dazzled by an elaborate show where the eyes are fooled by the sleight of hand. Only rather than making a simple toy appear, the result is money robbed from a city bank miles away. This allows me to transition into another aspect of the movie, the design of the tricks. In this film, many things were planned out, every detail intricately laced into an adventure that is both intense and impressive. While there are some classic magic tricks done, pick a card and making rabbits disappear, there are some other acts that have more complexity to it. Although these CGI heavy stunts are a bit fake and far-fetched they still were creative enough to wow me. Even more impressive to this reviewer, was the fact that the tricks were linked to the master plan, many specifically chosen for a purpose other than entertainment, cleverness at its finest.Another trend you might notice in other crime movies, is that nine times out of ten the police force are either ignorant or idiots. Well good news, they still are, but this time there is a little more ingenuity to some of their force. Led by Mark Ruffalo, the police actually learn a little from their mistakes and with a little guidance from an outside source, attempted to change their strategy. Ruffalo and company not only bring on the opposing force to the Horsemen, but also provide an opening for other characters to enter into the movie, often to explain how the tricks work. You heard me right, the magicians' secrets are revealed in this movie, but done so to help tie together the loose ends left behind after the excitement has passed. How could this explanation get any better? Simple bring on Morgan Freeman, an actor whose voice and talent bring the retired magician bent on deciphering secrets to life. Like many of his roles, this character has humor, wits, and a little input into helping with some of the shallow character development. With this in mind, if you don't want to find out how the connections fit you need to either leave the theater at points in the movie, or avoid seeing it altogether. Bottom line the movie is connected and all the characters are involved in some form or manner.So with a bunch of characters you may wonder how the acting is in this movie. In a nutshell most of the actors are playing the same roles we've seen in other films. Jesse Eisenberg still plays the arrogant jerk, who is incredibly clever and gifted, and insults everyone else. For some reason though, I do like his character in this movie, as the attitude goes with the theme of the movie. Isla Fisher is still bubbly, but this time she isn't some shallow air head who only cares about sex and shopping. Ruffalo does a good job as well, acting as an integral cog for most of the movie. Similar to what we saw in Avengers, Ruffalo has quirky one liners, a smart ass attitude, but still retains a serious demeanor that rounds the character out. My favorite actor of the night though is Woody Harrelson, who has all the qualities from the Hunger games, minus the drinking and add some running. Overall there are really no surprises when it comes to acting, I enjoyed all of them and I am sure you will find someone to latch onto in this movie.This movie is definitely a fun summer movie with creativity bursting at every seam. Yes the plot is fairly predictable, and I do agree the plot is a bit old. Yet this movie has many good things about it that makes it worthy of taking a trip to the theater. It is exciting, with a plethora of chase scenes and fight scenes to keep the pace going. Although some of the mystery is ruined by Freeman's deductive reasoning, there are still some underlying secrets that keep you intrigued into the movie, like who the mastermind is and what are the motives for pulling off the pranks. Yes there is a bit of cheesiness in the plot, and some of the stunts they pull are again a bit far-fetched that some people may roll their eyes, but for those who like a lot of imagination and clever execution, this movie is for you. So what do I give this movie? My scores are Crime/Thriller 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Twizard Rating: 84,"Everyone loves magic tricks. The wonder has been ingrained in us since our childhood. And movies about magic are usually just as enjoyable. This one is no exception.Four individual magicians--each with a different specialty--get summoned by some mysterious master magician to join together and perform ""tricks"" to steal from the rich and give to the poor. Meanwhile, a frustrated FBI agent, played by Mark Ruffalo, can't seem to figure out how it's all happening. He teams up with a female Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent) to put a stop to the madness.The dynamics among the magicians are fun and kept very light. The tricks they perform are, at times, very fascinating to the point that we wish we could go to Vegas to watch their show. We become invested in the lives of these people because the writers let us. But then something happens--our focus is forcibly changed.For the last 60-90 minutes we are pretty much solely focused on Ruffalo's character. We don't want to be, but we are. And as we travel deeper into the story, the befuddlement steadily increases. Luckily, the film makes itself fairly easy to focus on to somewhat help negate the convolution.It helps to rewatch this movie. But then again, seeing behind the curtain--which is the ending-- may cause you to feel like you've been manipulated. Realizing the filmmakers trick you into seeing what they want you to. And depending on how much you like magic tricks, you may or may not be happy about it.But see, putting together a movie is different than live magic tricks. Filmmakers can make up their own rules, using cuts and edits to change your perspective--not slight-of-hand--making much of it feel contrived. Personally, I wouldn't say that it bothers me. It just feels too easy here.We do get a good bang four our buck with plenty of subplots. There is one about Morgan Freeman who plays a magic debunker smugly trying to crack these elaborate tricks. He has a rivalry with Michael Caine, who acts as a financier for the magicians' performances. Caine exits about an hour in, but Freeman has much left to accomplish. And amidst all the action, there is an obvious romance building between Ruffalo and Laurent.But all of the story-building amongst the characters only helps to thin them all out in the process. There is little depth. And the depth that's established feels forced.Mind you, none of this changes the fact that this film is wildly entertaining. How can you call it anything but? It's gripping from beginning to end, and the way it's set up, you will probably end up wanting more. Give it huge points for that. Beyond that, though, I can see why people feel slighted.Twizard Rating: 84",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fun and energetic heist-thriller with a marvelous cast,"From Louis Leterrier, director of The Transporter (2002), Transporter 2 (2005), and The Incredible Hulk, this crime heist-thriller follows four magicians: Daniel Atlas (played by Jesse Eisenberg), Merrit McKinney (played by Woody Harrelson) Henley Reeves (played by Isla Fisher), and Jack Wilder (played by Dave Franco), who host a reality show on-stage where they use their magic skills to rob banks around the world. Their amazing magical abilities soon draw to attention to FBI agents Dylan Rhodes and Alma Dray (played by Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent) who go investigation in search of an explanation behind their robberies, and an eccentric mastermind Thaddeus Bradley (played by Morgan Freeman) who desperately tries to expose their illusional power, leading a wild chase in search for secrets and hidden plots.Now You See Me boast some creative ideas and executes them in an ""okay"" way. I can't say I was too impressed with them. With the plot involving magicians who use teleportation techniques to rob banks for living, you would expect few plot twist and turns somewhere along the way. Sadly this film doesn't have much of these. But that's okay, the thoughtful storytelling, decently constructed characters, and strong pacing make up for some of it. The biggest disappointment however, is that the film lacks suspense and thrills that make it more exciting. The whole premise of how the characters use their magic to manipulate the minds of people is clever, but it's never gets interesting. The cast is very great on the other hand. Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, and Dave Franco demonstrate some great performances as the main characters. Morgan Freeman did an alright job as the main antagonist, although he felt a bit miscast.Overall, Now You See Me isn't too bad of a movie. Maybe if the plot was better developed or at least was a given a better direction, this will would feel more captivating. Also, suspense and thrills are what is this film is missing and really needs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A group of street Magicians pull off their best act yet!,"Thriller as a genre doesn't cease to entice you because it is a sphere that doesn't have a beginning or an end. The more you roll, the more you will have! Here's one movie that is a sphere in its own entity – 'Now I can see you'! It didn't entice a title, does it as a movie?The movie teasers let the plot out! So it's all the more fun to see how the script has been executed. Magicians turn infidels! That's the only thing we can leak out. How they use their talents is what is enticing! Looked like an old story to us but there's something new in here!Director Louis Leterrier, where have you heard that name before? Transporter series of course! His work seemed like an 'Oceans 11' extension but it is only a mere comparison because both the movies deal with heists. The director hasn't tried too hard. He's kept things simple and scripted quite a decent movie.Technically sound, the movie does have its share of flaws and importantly blank spaces in the plot itself. That's because the director has chosen to get the characters called 'The Four Horsemen' to do the talking rather than the plot by itself. When you see bad, there's always a good bloke who wants to end the menace. Mark Rufallo as the cop has his FBI shoes on and tries his best!Let's talk about the pace of the movie. May be the first 60 minutes were like a Japanese magnetic train and then the following time frame till the end seemed like a tad tiring disclosure of facts. Should the screenplay be a little faster, the movie would have been even more engrossing to watch. Seasoned actor Morgan Freeman gets his bunch of dialogues, at a very nagging time of the movie, making it all the more tiring for the viewer.Explanations for most unanswered questions were answered towards the climax. It seemed like, 'a few questions, don't have answers'! Finally an element of suspense that we wouldn't want to leak here doesn't quite go with the audience because the entire premise of the movie is not convincingly explained.Let's give the errors a pass, the almost convincing robbing techniques, highly imaginative modern day illusion depiction and not to forget the characterizations of each of the individual street magicians, this movie has every reason to be a time spending investment!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
I'd sooner have watched a couple of episodes of the Kardashians,"Give me a couple of forks to poke out my own eyes. It's really hard for me to see the good name of New York City pulled through the mud like this, with Michael Caine on a rope behind it. I know it's about magic and illusion but give me a break, next time stick to sawing women in half, it's more believable than this stream of effluent. The only thing that kept me from hurling a cup of confetti at the screen were the scenes of the Big Apple, from whence I'd just returned after a wonderful 2 month stay. If I'd have known that they were making a movie this bad while I was there, a movie which has now tainted my memories, I would have tried to find the set and get the police to close it down. Acting; terrible. Romance angle; filmed in a refrigerator. Plot; a piece of hanging macramé, more holes than string.

"Entertaining movie, not lacking magic","The movie opened strong with a lot of magic tricks, but the rest of the film also was not lacking in magic either. The whodunnit's appeal came from the use of ""magic"" tricks and it also was generous with action, making for a truly exciting movie. I was thrilled through the entire film.The characters were each sharp and specialized in their own tricks. Eisenberg was, of course, given a snarky, arrogant personality with witty lines and the magic tricks to back it up. I felt that Ruffalo was taking to much time away from the amazing magicians, but he also did a good job. The only downside is that Dave Franco had almost no speaking lines and little screen time. All in all, the film was excellent and full of FUN.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Nolan-esque spectacle. Illusion, crime & superb cast.","Some people spend the duration of magic shows trying to spot the sleight of hand, to work out how the magician fools the rest of the audience; others sit back and allow themselves to be amazed by the illusions; a few convince themselves from the outset that all magic is genuine, that they are in the presence of a miracle worker and the naysayers be damned. Audiences will inevitably approach Now You See Me in much the same fashion, and that will have some bearing on how much they enjoy it.Take heed: don't think; just roll with it.Four magicians each receive a mysterious tarot card invitation to an address that holds secrets and a challenge. The reward is membership of the exclusive, perhaps mythical, magic circle known as The Eye. A year later, rebranded as The Four Horseman, they perform a spectacular sell-out show in Las Vegas that culminates with an apparent bank robbery and redistributing the cash to their audience. Is it magic or just a remarkable illusion? FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) regards it as nothing more than an elaborate crime and launches an aggressive hunt for the truth to expose and capture the Four Horsemen.Though Now You See Me lacks the drama of Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, it's a thrilling romp that begs to be seen at least twice; once for the spectacle, twice for clearer understanding. It's no mindbender, like Inception, but is a thoroughly enjoyable romp that will keep some people guessing. The biggest surprise is that it comes from Louis Leterrier, the director of clunking bombs The Incredible Hulk and Clash of the Titans. Who'd have thought?Take the bling and blast of David Copperfield (who is credited as the inspiration), give it a screenplay with some criminal zing and what would once have been known as an all-star cast and that's pretty much Now You See Me. Dave younger-brother-of-James Franco holds his own as street illusionist Jack Wilder against the 'above the title' star power of Woody Harrelson (Merritt McKinney), Jesse Eisenberg (J. Daniel Atlas) and Isla Fisher (Henley Reeves) as the Four Horsemen. There's very little in the way of character development but this isn't that kind of film. This is a movie where the stars play second fiddle to the spectacle and the quips, snaps and asides to each other are seasoning to the visual feast.Now You See Me feels like a Nolan film (though he appears not to have been involved) in tone, character and casting choices, not least of all for the double act of Michael Caine as Arthur Tressler, multi-millionaire financier of The Four Horsemen, and Morgan Freeman as Thaddeus Bradley, the debunker of all things illusory. But it never feels like a rip-off because of it, more a case of beneficial influence.It's difficult to pick out a performance that overshadows all others here because Now You See Me is a superb ensemble piece that deserves to be seen for the grand scale. I'm not claiming it's a modern classic, nor that it will feature in the top ten at the end of the year, but like last year's Chronicle it's stomping good fun and a flick worth having on the hard drive for one of those evenings that require a beer, feet up and a small amount of thought without the need for pure reality.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Adventure, Magic","Something different then usual, I gotta say that flow of the movie is constantly changing from one to another trick and twist but everything goes in the same direction and that is the goal of the magician's team-up and that is to give a show to the audience.

OMG the worst movie ever,I have never seen such a wannabe-interesting lack lustre film in such a long time that this movie has motivated me to register on IMDb just so I can warn people of how bad it is. Acting-lame Characterisation-one dimensional and fit for children Plot-more holes than a Swiss cheese grater and the 'love' interest/sub plot was the icing on this lame cake-seriously.I get that some movies don't have to be believable and can transport us to an imaginary world where we are entertained and dazzled. This film tried so hard on so many levels but failed in every single way possible. With a movie this large and with so many people involved and so much money thrown at it to come up with something so dire highlights the sad state of a sector of the American movie- making industry.Please do not make a sequel-partly because I will want to watch it to complete this review...A score of 7.4-IMDB reviewers you should be ashamed.,1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A genuine disappointment any way you cut it.,"Yes, a genuine disappointment any way you cut it. There's nothing clever or even very fun on display in this movie. You spend 95% of the film wondering why an actor as great as Mark Ruffalo agreed to play the dumbest cop/federal agent ever put to film. When you get the answer, it validates the film's own shallow stupidity. What a waste of a great cast. Morgan Freeman is useless and absolutely wasted in this effort as is Woody Harrelson. None of the Four Horsemen magicians are fleshed out at all and the narrative shifts suddenly between Ruffalo's character and brief peeks in to the actions of the four magicians. It just doesn't work at all as a compelling story.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Predictable Yet Entertaining,"This Magic meets Danny Ocean movie certainly keeps you on the edge of your seat. And though some may find the plot convoluted or characters underdeveloped, I found the movie to be fast paced and entertaining.Synopsis: A team of Magicians who calls themselves The Four Horseman pulls off a series of flashy heists, thereby being chased by the FBI and Interpol. As FBI agent Dylan (Ruffalo) and Interpol officer Dray (Melanie) begin tracking them, they start to suspect that something bigger might be at play behind these flashy heists.Plotwise, I could predict almost all of the twists (movie is full of it), and was even able to circle out the mysterious Fifth Horseman. But I admit the final twist was really cool and unpredictable.Almost all the characters were quite good, but my favorite character from the movie was Jack Wilder (Dave Franco). The one scene where Wilder fights FBI agent Dylan was nothing short of exceptional. My other favorite would be McKinney (Woody Harrelson). His wise-cracking mentalist persona was quite entertaining. The only actor whose talent was under tapped was Michael Caine. His role was too short and could have been easily done by any other actor.The soundtrack of the movie was good and matched seamlessly with the heists. The pace of the movie does get a bit slow towards the end of the movie, but the surprise ending more than makes up for it.This movie is no 'Prestige' or 'Illusionist', but it holds its own. If you are expecting some sort of character development or serious drama, be warned its not that kind of movie. In fact, lack of character development is what keeps the pace of this movie fast. Possibly one of the better heist movies in recent times, it's meant to be enjoyed and not pondered upon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The part he played was so believable that you could not for a second guess the plots and turns in the movie.The movie will keep you hooked and engaged.

Let's see an interesting magic trick,4 great magicians got together and formed a magic group called 4 Horseman. One of their shows became a problem for interpol and the FBI after they performed a magic trick of removing money that was in a bank safe.Now You See Me became an interesting movie for me. Now You See Me is a fusion of magic films with criminal acts. A combination of magic tricks developed into a criminal plan. Presenting an interesting story premise with a series of magic trick actions with the intention of revenge. This film is quite fun and exciting so that the conflicts that occur in the film are not very visible and run smoothly. The film has a good finish with quite shocking scenes. Four Kuda Riders who are brilliant at performing magic games with each character complementing each other. Each actor has a different type of magic thus expanding the knowledge regarding magic. I like the scenes that feature the trik dismantled by Thedeus so that there is a balance in seeing magic. The trick can be explained well.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"An entertaining, exciting, fast, fun, and funny, magic show.","Film opens and introduces us to three male street-magicians, in reality just street hustlers, and one female, who at least has the distinction of performing her tacky show in a proper venue. They meet up. They know each other, at least by reputation, although two have worked together before on magic shows. Together, they create a magic show that takes them to Las Vegas. Here they perform their magic show with a magic act that teleports a member of the audience into a bank vault, then transports the money to the show. Yes!, the bank has really been robbed!, by magic! Enter, the forces of law and order, who then arrest our magicians. The rest of the film is a battle of wits between the magicians and the forces of law and order.The early part of the film has our street magicians working their magic while engaging in fast, and smart, patter. A little irritating, but not half as irritating as the always moving, spinning, and swirling, of the camera. Thankfully, this calms down somewhat after a while. So stick with it in this early phase because viewing will become more comfortable, although the pace does not slacken during the film.There are car-chases, and other chases, fights, magic-fights, funny magic-fights, funny scenes and magic scenes.

Fast-paced - great cast - high-quality realization - thrills from the first to the last minute,"""The Incredibles - Now You See Me"" is now a good 10 years old, but it hasn't lost any of its freshness. This may be mainly due to its incredibly good pacing. Right at the beginning we get to know the 4 magicians with their respective extraordinary talents, each character has a unique quirk and personality. The whole thing happens so crisply that you are immediately captivated by each one. There are no deep character details with information about their past in the foreground but the concentration is on the high art of distraction and illusion in the here and now. All four are embodied by great actors (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Isla Fisher), who are completely convincing and make a smart witty troupe that complement each other wonderfully and harmonize perfectly. As if that weren't enough, the cast is also supplemented with Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Mark Ruffalo as allies or adversaries. So there is nothing else to say than that the entire cast was chosen magnificently and each shines in his role.""Now You See Me"" is like nothing I have ever seen before. The plot is so original, full of fresh ideas and witty comedy. The movie is entertaining like a gigantic Vegas show, with mega beautiful and successful effects.The camera shots and special effects in this film are phenomenal. It is bursting with rich colors and textures that draw you into the magic and make the illusions seem so real. The strengths are the script, the acting, the direction, the cinematography and the visual effects. Yes, it's about stage magicians, but movie magic is used to keep the illusion alive, not actual stage theatrics. The soundtrack is also great. It fits each scene very well and maintains a consistent theme and feel throughout the film.I especially love the fast pace, coupled with a plot and action that kept me wide-eyed and interested every step of the way, and that doesn't really unfold until the end. The plot itself has so many twists and turns, it keeps the audience guessing the whole time and provides a great addictive factor.I really liked the idea behind it, being a sort of magician-Robbin Hood. The magician's cousin is the con man, they try to expose them wherever they can. Nowadays con men wear suits and run businesses and banks.The film is full of suspense, action and incredible stunts and you are curious to see the next trick on a larger scale. Very nice also that it is explained how the riders did div. Tricks, so there are no important open questions.Personally, I do not feel at all the desire to look for possible logic errors in such a film, but can fully engage in the illusions and magic and simply enjoy.This movie is a lot of fun and contains a lot of action. It's all about illusion, and of course the premise of illusion is ""you can do anything."" It is actually very cleverly interwoven with enough twists and turns to highlight the distraction techniques used in magic.-------------
Conclusion:
Outstanding - This movie completely enthralled me from the first minute to the last. This is a movie that I can watch multiple times with and always be swept away. It is an absolutely entertaining popcorn action movie full of mystery, drama, action and humor. This film is simply fantastic. A very clear recommendation from my side, this film should not be missed in any case.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
magic fun,"I have somehow missed 'Now You See Me', a very entertaining movie directed by Louis Leterrier when it was released four years ago. Luckily, it's one of those movies that do not lose their appeal that fast, and then it's summer time, so the right time for fun and entertaining films. The only detail that seems overcome by time in this film is the usage of phones phones with geo-positioning systems.As smartphones took over the market, and applications as Google Maps became ubiquitous, the cops using keyboard based not-so-smart mobile phones seems to have happened twenty and not four years back. It's kind of a lesson for film-makers which may find more and more difficult coping with the pace of progress of our smart gadgets. Maybe the sequel avoids this mistake.'Now You See Me' combines two genres - the big robbery and the magicians movies, with more emphasize on the later. 'The closer you look, the less you see' is the key saying of the film which tells the story of four magicians with different specializations brought together in a team that combines huge magician shows a la David Copperfield with bank robberies. They are supported by a finance tycoon (Michael Caine), followed by a former magician (Morgan Freeman) whose pastime is exposing on TV the tricks and frauds of magicians, and have of course all the FBI and Interpol on their tracks. The roles of manipulators and manipulated, suspects and innocents change all the time, and as in a good magic show we are never sure what we exactly see on screen.The story may have a few holes that cannot be filled even by magic, but the convention works well, and is well supported by the actors. Watching Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine is always a delight in this kind of roles that they enjoy playing in this epoch of their careers. The rest of the team does a good job as well, with special mentions for Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson.

"Between financial and magical thriller, promising but losing bounce in progress","The movie starts with big premises: the abilities of the four illusionists are enchanting, and the idea of them being summoned and moved by a mysterious eye sounds really enthralling. The first part is developed through dynamic and vigorous sequences. The link to America's tragedy of Katrina, with an attack to insurance companies could also be interesting. Moreover, the rational explanation of the tricks results quite involving and intriguing, and the viewer feels torn between the need to understand how the tricks were made and a more subtle desire to believe in magic.And, to tell the truth, the picture never loses the viewer's attention, it's fast- paced, never a dull moment, but then, in the second part, something changes and the movie turns more into an action movie with chase sequences, punches, violence and moves away form those promising premises, hurrying towards a hasty finale with an interesting twist but lacking the solidity of the first part. The cast helps make a difference, although I found the big Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine a little under tone, I appreciated the boastful performance of Woody Harrelson and in general the freshness and vitality of the younger cast. On the whole, the picture is worth the ticket, two hours of real entertainment are granted, but I cannot deny some disappointment in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

I like Magician,"The title appeals to me a lot ""Now You See Me"" is like nothing I've ever seen before tells the story of a group of magicians called The Four Horsemen who use their skills to pull off some of the greatest international robberies of their generation.The movie ""Now you see me"", I have to say, ""cool"" is a movie that brings out the magic of robbery. Witty comedy The plot is complicated, and there are many turns. But keep the audience guessing all the time and shock you. The acting in the film was incredible that The fast-paced action is not boring and has surprising tricks that we didn't expect. I like that each character has their own unique quirks and personalities. But they all work together very well. The special effects in the film are magical.

Weak script,"Now You See Me could have been a good movie if only the writers team, or should we say the lame duck team, took the trouble to do their job correctly.The story is just a big, little clear catch-all, riddled, from end to end, with quite flagrant incoherences, and punctuated by, probably, one of the worst twists ever. Indeed, this twist is ridiculous because totally unbelievable, it doesn't produce any effect on the viewer, but most seriously it instantly annihilates the credibility of the film as a whole ! And it seems like a dream when, just before, Morgan Freeman serves us up with a totally absurd and unrealistic demonstration... having to explain an outcome, above all in such a didactic and unsubtle way proves well that the script doesn't hold water.This quite incredible failure of the story inevitably cripples the movie, which anyway only possesses two assets that are its dynamism and its cast, except the unbearable Mélanie Laurent who makes one grammatical mistake every three sentences and seems to be reciting her lines more than anything else, and Jesse Eisenberg who seems stuck in his Zuckerberg role, mumbling all the time. As for the cinematography, it isn't fundamentally bad but very cliché — as the soundtrack — with, for example, a lot of circus shots, a technique Leterrier used and abused of, apparently as little inspired as his writers.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Good story, poor acting","I am genuinely a fan of movies that play with magic. The Prestige and The Illusionist are among my favourites, and I believe their strong plots and my childish imagination make these movies seem magical to me. Although Now You See Me is more of a theatrical act for contemporary audiences, the one category this movie completely fails in is acting.The magicians themselves are fairly amiable. You have Jack, the humble boy who wants to make it big. Then you have J. and Henley, who have some kind of relationship going, but that is all but disturbed by Merrit, the old pervert with a good sense of humour.Now don't get me wrong, this movie was quite amusing and funny at times. But at others (especially in emotional scenes), I felt like cardboard could have had more expression. The acting from the detectives was generally dull, and even when there was a fair bit of tension, it just felt too insincere.I am glad nonetheless for watching this movie, as I was entertained for the whole duration.

Amazing movie,"Just saw this movie on Pay per view. It is one of the most interesting and entertaining movies I have seen in a long time. The acting is wonderful-especially Mark Ruffalo and Morgan Freeman. Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Woody Harrelson and Isla Fisher are the perfect ""Four Horseman"", backed initially by an enigmatic Michael Caine. Melanie Laurent adds a nice touch as in Interpol agent who may (or may not) have her own agenda. The plot is intriguing, with many twists and turns that really surprised me-and my son-in-law-who was watching it with me. I just wonder what kind of mind can come up with all the twists.

"If you're looking for a nice Sunday afternoon Matinée to relax the mind, you can't go wrong with the fun yet cheap trick of ""Now You See Me""","It's a rare treat these days that we get a new property to release a movie right in the heat of summer blockbuster season which is usually limited to huge comic book movies, comedies, and other franchise driven films. ""Now You See Me"" is making up for its lack of entitlement with an exciting cast made up of some of the best young actors in the business who are thrown into the mix as street magicians with hearts of gold. It's a rich concept of magic meets ""Ocean's Eleven"" that certainly raises a brow or two, but does this movie bring the real magic or is it just made up of mirrors and cheap parlor tricks?Read full review here: wp.me/p1tyJd-rC",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Lol. People don't understand anything nowadays!,"I liked it in the theater, and I liked it today, when I watched it again.
It had a lesser impact because I knew the twist and turns, but the magic tricks were still awesome, the escalation of the whole con and revenge well done and the movie has no malice, no unnecessary deaths to give it ""meaning"", nor any casualties. You have to see this movie. It worths the time.Having said that, It is true though, that the dialogue and parts of the story seemed forced at points. Also, some actors do some amazing work while others are, at least in my opinion, quite awful.Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Freeman and Caine are amazing. Melanie Laurent and Ruffalo do their best effort to sell some too forced story beats, and Ruffalo in particular struggles to give his character any charm or believability, stuck in the middle. Isla Fisher and Dave Franco were a cringe fest.SPOILERS! SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSA LOT of people saying that Mark Ruffalo's character being in the FBI, just to have revenge about his dead father (another magician) is too much work not to be ridiculous.IT WAS ""THE EYE""!!!!! The secret organization called ""The Eye"", has enough power (and in a too obvious comparison to the Illuminati) to pull some strings and easily make Ruffalo an FBI agent.Now. You can call the tricks unbelievable to your taste, and that's your taste. But they are more or less as unbelievable as the one of the Ocean's Eleven movies. In my opinion, the movie is good enough to let you forget the implausibility of all and ejoy it",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
How to waste a great cast of actors,"I was surprised at how stupid, nonsensical and repetitive this movie was with such an incredible cast of characters. The preamble is good: a group of mentalists and illusionists gets picked up by a mysterious third party who turns them into a team and turns them into a Las Vegas sensation while a secret plan unfolds underneath. But that's where everything stops making sense. From then on it's a series of car chases with the police, magic shows in prominent theatres around the world while a man tapes the illusionists to try and unmask their tricks. But why he does it is never clear and never will be until the cheesy, predictable finale. Besides the spectacular special effects and camera movements, there's nothing here. And two incredible actors like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are completely wasted in roles that hardly make sense in an already disconnected storyline.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Very disappointing and boring in the end.,"I was so excited for this movie when I first heard about it and saw the trailer but was I wrong about that. It's hard to pinpoint where the movie hits all the wrong spots but my personal issues were the lack of likable characters, lack of character development, the mediocre plot and the overall execution of the movie.Of course this is my personal opinion but the 4 ""main"" characters in the movie appear to be the 4 horsemen. They are not. The only time you'll really see them is during their show and a few short scenes here and there, the rest of this 2 hour long movie isn't about them. That's first. Second is the fact that I was completely unable to like any one of them. They are arrogant and are just s uninteresting because they have no personality, no sympathizing or deeper moments at all. And the half attempted ""budding romance"" moments feel so out of place and forced, the movie would've been better off without them. But the worst thing is that I can't even properly dislike them as ""persons"" because there are almost no personal moments with them. They're just so uninteresting and cast aside that I couldn't feel anything watching them. There have been a few background story hints/mentions but really, not even close enough to begin character development, which doesn't happen anyways so no loss there I guess.I also didn't like the police guy (whom seems to be the main character according to the screen time he gets) or the woman he works with. What is she doing, especially at her final scene in the movie? What the hell man. Anyway it's ridiculous and not in a funny way, the whole police force and their inability to capture these 4 guys is just painful to watch. It gets old so quickly and painfully predictable that our magicians will pull a trick out of their sleeve to escape. I quickly started rooting for the FBI because I couldn't fine even a small reason to like these guys but the FBI was so damn incompetent it made me want to fast forward thorough the entire movie.Another major point is the plot. Or perhaps lack thereof. Yes you do wonder; ""where does this all lead to"" but really, the ending feels rather a anti-climax and I didn't even care anymore at the end of the series since you can guess what happens. Yes. The plot is so freaking transparent that you can literally guess the ending after watching a third of the movie. Maybe not the entire thing or all the elements but for the bigger part you can. And that's not a very good thing if you ask me. There are also a few plot holes/ridiculous things that really bother me that you can't cover up with ""it's magic"" that make the whole thing even more ridiculous.I don't want to spoil to much and yes, some complaints can be rebuked after watching the whole movie but it's not a good movie. So freaking much wasted potential, flatter than cardboard characters and in the end it's nothing more than a C-rank action movie ""thrilling chase"" that keeps dragging on for over 1.5 hours.To summarize; is it a good, well thought out movie with in depth characters? No way, not at all. Is the movie entertaining? Kind of, it's dragged on for way too long but it's not bad. Should I expect something of this movie? No. Don't. Do not watch the trailer, it's several times better than the actual movie. But the movie is time killing and in the end it's not bad. It's just not that good, not that good at all...",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great Dharma movie!,"If you are a student of the dharma, and have come across the sometimes mystifying analogy of a magician, the audience and the latecomer.It is used to describe what reality is experienced like from the perspective of: a) an Arya (someone who has seen emptiness directly, met the divine) b)a ""normal"" person who has not and c) someone in the direct perception.This movie displays this analogy in a fun and profound way.There is also this beautiful element of surrender and faith to the Teacher (the lovely Maitrei) as analogous to the higher ""secret"" teachings.______FROM ACIDHARMA.ORGCourse II, Class Seven, Answer Key, cont.193) Explain the three different perceptions of the three different people in the metaphor of the magic show. Who are the three types of real people that these three represent?A magician in ancient India throws a small stick on the ground, utters a magic incantation, and sprinkles some special powder in the area. This makes people who have been standing there see the stick as a horse or cow. Other people join the crowd later; they don't see the animal, because they weren't there when the spell was cast.The spectators see a horse and believe that there is one there. The magician sees a horse as well, since the spell affects him too, but he knows it's not real, and doesn't believe in it. The latecomers neither see a horse nor believe that one is there.The spectators are like a person who has not yet seen emptiness directly, since they see things as self-existent and also believe that they are.The magician is like a bodhisattva who has seen emptiness directly but who is not now in the direct perception of emptiness: things still appear to them to be self-existent, but they don't believe what they see.The latecomers are like someone who is not a Buddha but who is in the direct perception of emptiness: things neither appear as self-existent to them, nor are they believing them at that time to be self-existent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

MAGIC is always the answer to everything.,"NOW YOU SEE ME is crime/thriller film directed by Louis Leterrier, starring Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fischer, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman & Michael Caine.The film revolves around 4 magicians, who rob a bank, using magic. The police want to know how they did it, and why.The trailer of Now You See Me, was quite short, to be honest. It didn't reveal a whole lot of information, however, it gave just enough to engross the viewer. The idea of magic and detective worked quite well together and since it was a story never touched before, I decided to give it a shot, and so I booked my ticket for Now You See Me.My immediate conclusion at the end of this film: IT IS ONE HELL OF A TIME. Yes, magic and good acting has managed to get the better side of the audience. With such a great star cast, Now You See Me is a smart, intelligent film with many twists that will only be understood when watched under close attention. The final twist, at the end, is one you don't even see a mile away; its that good.So, Now You See Me is a great time. It takes a lot of thought though, but if you do so, its possible to understand the whole case and have a great experience.

Super fun and entertaining. All the fun of the Ocean's series with the feel of the Prestige. Watch this movie. I say A-,"""The more you look, the less you see."" Four of the best magicians in the country are given a mysterious card telling them to meet at a certain place at a certain time. One year later they are known as the four horsemen and they begin to stage the biggest tricks of their lives, the first of which involves robbing a bank. When the FBI begins to question them the four magicians elude them and stay ahead of everyone trying to stop them pulling off bigger and more impressive tricks. I have said before that expectations have a huge impact on how much you enjoy a movie. If you have high expectations you are usually disappointed and vice versa. This is a rare exception where I had high expectations going in and still really enjoyed this. The movie has all the fun of an Ocean's movie with the writing of a movie like the Prestige. While this is pretty much a heist movie it has an original twist on the genre and the movie sucks you in right away and keeps you watching right up until the end, which seems to come too soon. The cast is perfect and the movie is very entertaining. I highly recommend this and it is one of the best I have seen this year.

Be sure to ""look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see"".The film as a whole was generally satisfying. The casting was absolutely wonderful; I wouldn't have changed a thing. They all brought something to the film, and didn't take away from the storyline. The cinematography was very effective. Like watching a magic trick live, your attention was brought to various places. As soon as you thought you caught up and were one step ahead of the supposed con artist, they were really three ahead of you. ""How did he do that?"" was a constant thought throughout various scenes for me. Although camera angles were constantly changing and some may argue it can distract from what is really happening, in this type of film it was very effective.Although the ending to the movie was slightly predictable, the moments leading up to it on the silver screen were impressive.

That's another thing... I found the tricks weren't explained that well (especially the last one) and didn't make that much sense. They were all just covered up with loads of glitz and glamour, loud self-satisfied music and random crowds cheering as if that would rub off on the audience.The story is pretty entertaining and unpredictable with some good chases, cop banter, cool magic and romance (although they could and should have progressed with the romance element more).

No, I'm talking about that convoluted ""twist"" at the end that is completely fake, unrealistic and implausible.

awesome,"its an awesome movie, you walk out of the theater and try to learn the tricks that are done in there, has suspense and is exciting,has a element of surprise, you should watch it at least once or you shall die. I love magic, and films about magic, like 'Houdini,' 'The Prestige' and 'The Illusionist.' This is a film about magic. Although it is pretty high tech, a lot of the magic tricks in it are very traditional, based on trickery and misdirection. While it runs a little long, the fine acting by the outstanding cast and the high production values make this an entertaining trip. The brilliant heist caper and the fascinating realm of illusion blend flawlessly in the summer's most intelligent film..",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Honestly, one of the single most underrated movies of the year!","Initially, upon watching the trailer and being a fan of practically the whole cast, i was really excited to watch this movie. However, on the day it was released, i searched up for reviews about it, just for my own satisfaction, and for some reason a lot of critics didn't find the movie interesting or suspenseful enough.My answer to that is: WHAT?The entire movie, every single minute was hugely interesting and suspenseful. And i have to admit, i was pretty impressed with the cast as well, except for maybe the interpol agent, since her character seemed a little too weak overall.Anyway, i went to watch the movie with low expectations, and good for me, because my mind was blown a thousand times more than if i had high expectations about the movie.It's an overall fun movie, and i would definitely recommend everyone go watch it, particularly teenagers. Everyone else as well, of course, except for maybe people who have a tendency to figure out the entire plot in the first 15 minutes.It's an entertaining watch and i am flabbergasted that there has not been much hype about it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Best Movie in decades,"This would have to be THE best movie for many years it is nail-biting and the action and twists do not let up right up to the fall of the curtain. All the actors and actress are sensational. The action is very exciting and not overdone which has far too much now days. No Sex and NO SWEARING, lovely mini skirts thou, this is a nice change, there is no need for language like they use in pretty well every movie now days. It put a cheap aspect on the movie and make the actors look cheap. Right from the beginning the movie grabs your attention and you do not want to go to the toilet, the magic is brilliant , and the expiation of the goings on is good to understand the happenings.

An enjoyable new spin on the heist film,"'Now You See Me' cleverly takes the much used heist concept, adds a bit of magic and ends up being an entertaining and smart film.A lot of its success comes from the talented cast. All four of our Horsemen have charisma by the bucket load, with Eisenberg and Harrelson's banter being a particular high point. I thought Isla Fisher was good too. I haven't seen the sequel as yet, but I imagine she'll be missed. It's testament to the film too that people like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are popping up in small roles too.Yes, the plot has holes in it, and the final third is chaotic to say the least, but if you stick with it you get a great twist that isn't unlike a magic trick in itself.I'm surprised Hollywood felt this needed a sequel. I thought this was a good one off.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Unrealistic magic tricks!,"This is what happens when you use high visual effects to show magic tricks, they lose their realism and become a fabricated cartoon. The few tricks in the introduction were fairly decent setting up for a promising movie, then it unfortunately faded away by the first group act and became a joke in itself.The reason why i still gave it a 7 is because it was still somewhat entertaining with a stellar cast. Also the ending was a mere ""wow"" moment but that doesn't excuse for unrealistic tricks and desperate plot convenience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Why? No Reason.,"It frankly doesn't surprise me that this film has received more positive than negative feedback; it gives an audience almost everything the trailers and cast lead them to believe they'll get. Plenty of twists, turns, face time with noteworthy actors and a story that doesn't force you to believe in magic in order to believe what's happening on screen. All that being said, there is a minority of viewers, myself included, who know they could have done much more with all the talent and potential lying within Now You See Me...or maybe they couldn't, and shouldn't have bothered to try.I'm hesitant to say the movie is bad, because deep down it truly isn't. Everyone, from Woody Harrelson to Michael Caine and every name-drop in between does their job and fits in snug with what's going on. Somewhere between the intriguing first 20 minutes and the disappointing last hour or so, I kept asking myself, ""why am I not enjoying this?"" The answer? It could have been so much more.Hasty references to the ""why"" of it all do nothing to satisfy the curiosity of the curious, and when the final credits rolled, I realized that this was the point all along. Even after the major reveal takes place and you finally understand the ""how"", the ""why"" never materializes. The introduction of the film makes that question the focal point, and the rest of the film does its best to make you forget you ever had the question in your head to begin with.Again, I can understand the praise, but I felt as if left the theater having been cheated out of my money. Considering a couple of the main scenes in the film, perhaps this was the filmmakers' entire goal to begin with. It wouldn't surprise me in the least. Regardless, most people seemed to enjoy it, so there's no reason to bash it any further than by saying it simply wasn't what I wanted it to be. It happens sometimes.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The plot was very complex and kept you guessing. The cast made their characters funny and for the most part, likable.

"""The closer you look, the less you see.""","Any show you go to see, whether it be magic shows or the movies, rely on dazzling and guiding the audience to a surprising and enjoyable outcome, ultimately making the audience believe that what they see is real. In Now You See Me, the principles of magic are used in this interesting premise: magicians who use their skills in deception and illusion to stage daring bank heists in front of the eyes of their audiences and the police.This film is not as deep or thoughtful as other magician-themed films, like The Prestige or The Illusionist. As a heist film, however, it's phenomenally entertaining. The film sets up the cop and robbers characters with playful energy and chemistry, before breaking out the visually-impressive theatrics and action scenes. It's not big on action, but the film does move fluidly, and above all, the characters are fun to watch. I'd say it's every bit as enjoyable as a film like Ocean's 11, The Italian Job, or The Thieves.Critics will likely find fault in the plot, which requires some huge suspension of disbelief to accept. Given the twists and the liberal use of magic tricks, plot holes are bound to be present. It might be especially frustrating to watch the more fantastic moments and wonder how these characters could pull off such trickery; the film does reveal the particulars of what's going on with the overall heists, but there are other moments where the film seems to assert that magic is actually happening.However, there is a certain theme to the picture, stipulating that ""the closer you look, the less you see."" Indeed, if you scrutinize this plot too closely, you'll miss out on the larger experience. The film practically implores you to just sit back, take it as it is, and enjoy things as they are. If you can suspend disbelief and go with the flow, you'll find that the plot is structured in wild and unpredictable ways. There are certain things to the story that could have been explored more, but perhaps a sequel is in order. Critics would say that the characters are all unlikable, and it's hard to know who to root for: I was personally enthralled by the whole cast, and was actually rooting for the magicians, for I found them all to be lively, rounded, and surprising at times. They aren't terribly deep, but they have surprises of their own.Some of the film's action scenes get a little jittery, but most of it has solid photography and editing. Acting is superb all around: everybody puts on a playful and energetic performance. Writing is not bad. This production has good-looking sets, props, costumes, and okay special effects. Music is really hip.The film asserts that magic is not about understanding how tricks work, but in making audiences believe in it, and making them smile. If you're the type who wants to look closely and find something deep, artistic, or even logical about Now You See Me, then the less you'll see. I was able to accept the film's illusion, and it made me smile at times, for it is an enjoyable show. If you can accept the film's illusion, then you might find it enjoyable as well.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A Fun Magical Ride That Will Keep You Thinking,"This opened as a very low key movie release locally. However, I kept reading praises about it from social media, I resolved to give it a try and see for myself. I had a lot of fun watching, and I believe, so will you.The fascinating premise of the film begins even before the opening credits. We meet four talented magicians who had been summoned by a mysterious hooded stranger who left them each a invitation card marked by an eye design at the backs. A year later, they were the toast of Vegas, calling themselves the Four Horsemen, staging big elaborate magic shows. One performance, they picked a Frenchman ""randomly"" from the audience to create the illusion that he had robbed a bank in Paris. Police and Interpol get involved when money really disappeared from that bank!That incredibly staged heist is only the beginning of a puzzling roller coaster ride of a film that will keep you wondering to the very end. Director Louis Leterrier (whose debut was ""Transporter"" in 2002) has executed a very energetic, intelligent and most importantly, entertaining film.The actors were all so eager, smart and funny in their roles. Jesse Eisenberg is believable as a control freak street illusionist. Woody Harrelson was a down-on-his-luck mentalist is outstandingly hilarious. Isla Fisher has gone a long way from her awkward debut in that Scooby Doo film. Just when you thought Dave Franco is just a minor player, he will surprise us with an exciting fight scene and car chase. And on the other side, Mark Ruffalo is just so right as the harassed police officer who always seemed to be two steps behind the magicians. Veterans Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman add their cool credibility to the mix, as they always do to any film they are associated with.While it is a pity that we do not get to meet the four magicians more in depth, and some of the illusions and action stunts were too impossible (and too CG), I think we can overlook and forgive those little quibbles. Do not think too hard and over-analyze about the twists and turns this film takes you on (especially in the final minutes), just sit back and enjoy the fun ride while it lasts. It is, after all, all about magic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Interesting, but not great","As I often am, I am shocked by a rating of 1. I have seen terrible, unwatchable movies - this was not that. So 1 ratings seemed out of anger for people who's expectations were poorly metI can't really discuss the plot much, other than to say it's quite twisty. But hardly the incoherent mess some people claim. Heck, I know of a top rated detective movie who's plot makes less sense. If you are looking for a brilliant plot, this is not it, but it's interestingI enjoyed the characters quite a bit. The acting was quite acceptable. There were some very charismatic characters, which I always appreciate.There's a lot of cool effects. The tricks are not totally unreasonable. It's not as clever as say, Oceans 11, but I think they tried. Consider it a sort of weird heist movie, with some twisty stuff thrown in.I watched it all the way through, and did not hate it. In fact, I would probably watch it again. I admit I like illusion and heist movies and a reasonable amount of plot twists so why notThis is neither the best or the worst movie ever made.

"Four magicians unite under mysterious circumstances, creating a live display claiming to do the unthinkable, robbing a bank on the other side of the world.","Louis Leterrier's thriller bases itself around the concepts of misdirection, showmanship, deceit and ultimately, the power of magic to stun and confound an audience, leaving them wondering at just how the feats that they have witnessed have been pulled off. Jesse Eisenberg's Daniel Atlas invites our fullest attention, claiming ""the closer you look, the less you see"", in an opening gambit that promises intrigue and suspense, which also acts as a (possibly) unintentional device for viewer reaction, namely, will we be taken in and wowed by what we are about to witness.Any film of this type is likely to bring about comparisons to Christopher Nolan's excellently dark 2006 thriller ""The Prestige"", with the on screen presence of Michael Caine only serving to reinforce such correlations. However, where Nolan's effort looks to explore behind the façade and mysterious surface of the tricks presented, ""Now You See Me"" chooses to shy away from much that could be seen as real explanations, instead allowing a high paced caper to take place, largely centred around the cat and mouse chase between the four conjurers and the law enforcement team led by the slightly unbelievable pairing of Mark Ruffalo's exaggerated sceptical field agent Dylan Rhodes, and Mélanie Laurent's inexperienced desk agent Alma Dray. This immediately takes the film tonally away from the territory of ""The Prestige"", thus placing it firmly in its own space, but leaves the viewer pondering upon the potential lack of substance that shying away from the deeper explanations may indicate.However, as the 115 run time of the movie progresses, it becomes clear that to dissect and over analyse every move of the twisting narrative is clearly not the point of this film, and as such, the best way to approach it may be to simply sit back and enjoy the tumult of events as they unfurl before your eyes. The 100mph plot rarely takes a break to allow for reflexion, preferring to let the A-list cast take centre stage, with performances admittedly sometimes bordering on the edge of credibility, Morgan Freeman's disgraced ex-magician Thadeus Bradley being a case in point, in a demonstration which, in the end seeks not to deceive, but instead to entertain.Undeniably, the film does fall down in certain aspects, such as a shaky script, and the lack of depth which wont allow the audience to ""see more"" on repeat viewings, but, in a summer dominated by comic book heroes and city-levelling CGI, ""Now You See Me"" at least offers an entertaining alternative watch which can be largely enjoyable, so long as the obvious thematic comparisons which have been made to more accomplished past films are not kept in mind for too long.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Now You See Me ''All style and no substance'',"This has to be one of the worst films I've seen in recent memory. Even now I'm still trying to think of the good things to say about this film if any. If I was to pick a highlight in the film it would be Woody Harrelson, whose on screen presence adds some interest and comedic value to the story but apart from that this film was pretty much downhill from the moment it started.The motives for the characters are half baked and there is no build up to any of the plot points. Everything is rushed and gives off a this film is too smart for you to understand vibe when it really isn't. Every scene consists of constant blabbing and for the amount of dialogue in each scene none of it is worth remembering. The main problem I had with the film is the over all story or lack of. Maybe the screen writers ran out of ideas and just thought to themselves ""Lets throw in another plot twist for good measure"".It's surprising that such a good cast would agree to be in such a poor film and that so many people on IMDb gave it a good review. If you want to see a good magic themed film then watch the Prestige or the Illusionist as they are well written, tense and enjoyable films compared to Now You See Me, which is just a mess.

"Tricks are new, plot .....aged","I was drawn to rent this film based upon the trailers and TV spots. I'll confess a slight aversion to the work of Mr. Eisenberg, who inexplicably annoys me. The movie also stars Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman in supporting roles.My reviews will never give away significant plot twists or spoilers but you might want to know what the movie is actually about.Four moderately successful (depending on your measure) street magicians are summoned by an unknown party for initiation into ""The Eye"". ""The Eye"" is an ancient secret society of magicians who ""protect real magic from those who would use it to rob, steal""....vote the wrong way...etc. In order to be accepted, you must follow instructions with blind obedience and be a pretty talented illusionist. The rest of the plot centers around a series of high profile robberies and pursuit of the magicians by the FBI and a professional ""de-bunker"" of magic (Freeman).Where the film works: A very talented cast. James Franco's younger brother Dave does very well. Harrelson is great and ended up with most of the movies funniest lines. As the group's ""mentalist""/hypnotist, he is also arguably the most dangerous. Caine & Freeman could bring complexity and depth to reading ads for the 64th street Hy-vee meat counter, so you know they are always solid. Obviously the movie is going to contain some wild and exciting stunts that stretch the SOD (suspension of disbelief), but they play well. Where the film let me down a little: Since ""you've gotta put a girl in it"", Mélanie Laurent, is cast as a French Interpol agent. She is sent to America to work with the FBI. Ruffalo plays the FBI agent, but his performance is lacking in depth. ((Hmmmmmmm .... man.....woman.......I wonder what is gonna happen with that.....)) Honestly, what I disliked the most was that I was expected to root for criminals. Not a new plot line, but I didn't particularly find the justification for larceny that compelling and a number of hi-jinks they pulled in order to escape capture (in the real world) could have easily led to the harm of hundreds of innocent people. The ""sexual content"" referenced in the MPAA rating relates to a couple of brief non-explicit comments. There is profanity/vulgarity and a couple of fight scenes (very well choreographed, I must admit)My wife only said ""Come on.....(side eye)"" a handful of times, so it isn't entirely preposterous.

Joy to watch,"'Now you see me' has one of the best starts for a movie in recent times and though the ending doesn't keep up with the start, on the whole the movie is still great. I am a fan of Jessie Eisenberg and had high expectations for this movie and it did not disappoint. You never feel less entertained in any of its parts.The movie opens with such a bang, right from the very first scene. Whenever a magic trick comes about, you feel like you've let out your inner kid. The first half hour is just pure joy for watching.The pace of the movie lasts and amps up till the very last parts of the movie. Leading to this point the tricks seem to get a little ridiculous and even more so as it ends.

There is no way Morgan Freeman knew all that so correct to every inch of particular details. I did not find the character of Alma Dray to my taste. The romance is totally unnecessary in the movie.There definitely are few blunders and errors in logic as it is in any movie. But my views are put together in a dialog from the movie, paraphrased: ""It's not how it's done that is important, but at the end it did put a smile on your face and that is what I paid to watch"".It is one of those movies that you need to watch more than once to absorb in every little detail of it, though there might be few details that might not be to your liking.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Great, if you like ridiculous films","Hollywood seems obsessed by making films about magicians where the magicians turn out to have real magical powers. I've seen a certain mainstream film in the past that did the same thing and I hated it for cheating the viewer. NOW YOU SEE ME isn't as blatant as that, but it still has one ridiculous scene after another which would have been physically impossible in real life, thus making this a delusional fantasy of a film. Having all the magic done in-camera without cutting away would have done much to remedy this situation.A problem of having an over-confident group of protagonists in a movie is that their characters are all annoying, and that's the case here. A smug Jesse Eisenberg is the worst, but Woody Harrelson is little better. Isla Fisher only seems to be around so she can show off her body in tight clothes and push-up bras. Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent do better as the cops investigating the cons, but it's left to the seasoned old-timers Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine to give the most professional performances.In any case, NOW YOU SEE ME is an unlikeable film. There's a lot of incident going on here, and with it a lot of cheese. The CGI effects of fire and the like are very disappointing. Throwing in random car chases and fight scenes is over the top and doesn't work very well at all, as by the end it all seems rather overblown and pointless. Needless to say that this was a hit in America and a sequel has followed. Great, I can't wait.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Mediocre entertainment,"As most people already wrote, the twists can be seen coming from a mile away. The final reveal got me a bit off guard as I guess my brain went by the basic Hollywood standards (the foreigner is the ""bad guy"") but nevertheless, 90% predictable down to the actual ""magic tricks"".Especially these magic tricks, however, are the biggest flaw of this movie. If you want to sell ""magic"" as elaborate tricks you should stay away from CGI effects that do not work in real life and/or you should at least try explain these tricks (especially the complex ones) more so if you already have a debunk character in the movie anyways. Otherwhise you have a merger of tricks and CGI-real-magic, that this movie is trying to permanently deny. The tricks that get explained in the movie are your basic stuff that has been known by every schoolchild since ...I don't know the past 100 years? and their use within the movie is soooo predictable, so many MANY ways of using more clever tricks.... and all failed.Writing of characters and dialogues definitely not based on reality, and filled with typical American stereotypes of ""balancing the world"".

If you rob a bank, this doesn't hurt the ""evil"" bank (little hint - its ensured!) it hurts the little people that have their money IN the bank.....Now the good parts: Acting was decent and visually the movie is quite nice, take away the overused 360 camera movements around the main characters.Lots of colors.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Refreshingly fun,"How refreshing it is to see a film where the child in you is brought out and bewildered. I found myself smiling from start to finish in awe of the magic and suspense.Perhaps it is the magic or rather trickery that had me smiling; you don't know how they do it and a part of you thinks it is magic. But of course you know it isn't there must be a trick. Either way you have a good time regardless. I found myself agasp much in the same way someone would be if they were personally tricked by a magician.It is cleverly written, humorous, and has action.

'What is magic? Focused deception. But deception meant to entertain.',"This movie is magic. It is simply fantastic entertainment that keeps the viewer glue to the screen trying to figure out the impossible things that are happening to a superlative groups of actors playing well written roles (written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt) and directed with aplomb by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk, Transporter 2, Unleashed, and the soon to be made Now You See Me 2!) whose imagery and imagination is endless.The story is simple but inordinately complex in the way it is shared. Four magicians each answer a mysterious summons to an obscure address with secrets inside. A year later, they are the Four Horseman (Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco), big time stage illusionists who climax their sold out Las Vegas show with a bank apparently robbed for real. This puts agents Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) of the FBI and Alma Vargas (Mélanie Laurent) of Interpol on the case to find out how they did it. However, this mystery proves difficult to solve even with the insights of the professional illusion exposer, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). What follows is a bizarre investigation where nothing is what it seems with illusions, dark secrets and hidden agendas galore as all involved are reminded of a great truth in this puzzle: the closer you look, the less you see. Add to this rather amazing cast the talents of Michael Caine, Michael Kelly, Common, David Warshofsky, José Garcia, and Elias Koteas and the talents of Brian Tyler, musical score and the cinematography by Mitchell Amundsen and Larry Fong and this film becomes addictive.

Fun as a time killer but nothing more,"Now you see me is what I would call a ""sunday evening"" movie. It's fun and flashy enough to be entertained for a few hours but lacks more substance to be memorable. It's the kind of movie you can have fun with for 2 hours and then forget the next day.With a cast of well known actors and a plot about a group of people pulling off what seem like spectacular robberies it's clearly that it is aiming to be a ""Oceans Eleven"" kind of movie, but it dosen't quite get there.My main problem with this movie is that the basic idea here is that ""you think it is magic but it actually isn't"", and that would have great if they would have shown them use clever and creative tricks to fool people. But ,sadly, more often than not we see the main characters use tricks that seem too fantastic to be true, and it dosen't help that most of them are done using CG animations and special effects. All the magic they use is just taken too far to be believed, not only in the illusions but also the fact that one character seems to have super human hypnosis abilities and others can pull off crazy tricks with no preparation.Movies like Oceans Eleven are more enjoyable because even though you know robbing a casino is hardly as easy as they make it look... almost all of what they do has some form of rational explanation backing it up. I don't know if you can Robb a casino making the stuff they do, but I do know that at very least that stuff can be done, and that just isn't the case with ""now you see me"" as only a handful of tricks are explained and the writers want the audience to just believe that all the CG/FX tricks going on have a rational explanation.If you take what I've already said into consideration and add the fact that there is little to no character development (we hardly get to know them)and a ""shocking"" ending that feels so forced that no one will be ""shocked""... it's easy to see why this movie is nothing more than a fun and flashy flick to watch and forget the next morning.I have been told that there will be sequel, and hopefully they manage to make a movie that is as clever as what they think this one was",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

magicians target the most hated people,"What I noticed about ""Now You See Me"" is that the magicians play tricks on bankers and insurance men. No doubt this is something that people would have to like in the era of the Great Recession. Even apart from that it's a pretty good movie, showing the characters pulling their tricks and figuring out how to always stay ahead of the authorities. In addition to the cast presented on the poster, the movie also includes Mélanie Laurent (Shoshanna Dreyfus in ""Inglourious Basterds"") as an Interpol agent who isn't about to take crap from Mark Ruffalo's FBI agent. That also means that Shoshanna Dreyfus costars with Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) costars with Batman's butler (Michael Caine) costars with a frequent narrator (Morgan Freeman).I really liked the movie.

A bit all over the place but ultimately entertaining,"Lots of bad reviews out there for this but I didn't hate it. It is a bit all over the place though so that even with the fantastic cast, original story and all the flash it just failed to impress me much in the execution. It sorta feels 'Oceans'ish except with a with a group of magicians known as ""The Four Horsemen"" who pull off brazen heists during their performances, the proceeds of which they share with the audiences. This raises the attention of FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) who spends the rest of the movie trying to catch them.Its a caper film and very watchable, in fact there were moments were I thought it was going to be a really good movie but it never quite lives up to itself. Some parts of it are clever, others stupid. A lot of the story happens off screen then is just briefly explained by the characters or assumed by the viewer. There's a big car chase in the middle that comes out of nowhere and a crazy lukewarm romance going on between Ruffalo and a French Interpol agent. Towards the end it becomes almost fantasy-like with shades of 'National Treasure' thrown in and the actual ending just goes on and on; its over, wait another sub ending, another explanation, the credits, another thrown in bit scene.I did enjoy the extended cast though, as well as the initial set up and coming together of The Horsemen (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco) The banter between them is entertaining and there's also Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman who are such pros they can do no wrong. 1/10/16",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Mostly great,"First of all, I love me a heist movie. Cons, heists, whatever you call them, I love them. However, the trailer for this movie didn't really sell the premise to me, and I wasn't that interested.Boy, was I wrong. With the exception of the last quarter, the movie is actually surprisingly smart, and entertaining. While there are let downs within the filmmaking (The amount of CGI they use for the magic is baffling), the narrative is smartly weaved throughout.The cast work well together, and as soon as we pass the ""catalyst"" moment, the characters stop being quite so annoying (and... shouty... in Isla Fisher's case), and settle into their roles quite well to the point that they're all very likable. Eisenberg in particular was a standout to me, I was very happy to see him play a more confident character than we've seen of him.As for what didn't work... The ending was stupid. That's all I'm saying about that, because that's all I could work out.I would recommend the movie, but I'd also advise the viewer not to raise their hopes too high. It's a very good and very smart movie, but it slips off into something much more disappointing and sloppy near the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fun and flashy,"Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco are ""The Four Horsemen"", a group of magicians who put on mind-blowing shows in Las Vegas. They're a bit of an odd pairing, since Jess is inexplicably and unbelievably a ladies' man, Woody keeps hitting on Isla even though she doesn't like him, and Dave seems like he's playing dress-up to fit in with the grown-ups. But, they get along for the most part and manage to amuse the movie-going audience. When they rob a bank during their magic show, it puts the FBI and Interpol on their trail. Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent are the agents, and even though she's pretty grungy, he starts falling for her anyway. Add in Morgan Freeman, a man who makes a living out of exposing frauds, and Michael Caine, the owner of the robbed bank, and The Four Horsemen don't have many friends left!If you like quick-witted scripts with lots of twists and turns, this is a great one for you to rent. Yes, I've criticized the casting a bit, but Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin, and Edward Ricourt's script is very entertaining. It's fun and flashy, with surprises you'll never see coming. Plus, every little boy who learned card tricks when he was little can get a front row seat to a truly incredible magic show!

It has a fantastic plot and lots of great lines. Most of the questions I had throughout the movie were answered, or clearly intentionally unanswered to be mysterious.

"Pretty Good, Somewhat Hyped Up","""Now You See Me"" was a pretty good movie, I think it was really hyped up to be something that it wasn't because the previews made you think that there was going to be a huge mega show of an ending. The high points of the movie were based around the actual magic, as a whole the tricks were good, and I think that they did a good job of explaining how they pulled everything off. There was a little bit of comedy that lightened the serious mood, and once again the tricks made the movie worth watching. I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because the movie was cohesive until the end. There was really an incomplete ending with no explanation of what made their common goal so worth it. Overall, I'm iffy on recommending this movie. I wouldn't pay full price to see this movie in stores, but I think it is a good movie to just watch. - Christian J.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Magic in one era, blasphemy in another","Magic in cinema has lost a lot of its, well, magical qualities due to the fact that special effects and visual wizardry can be pulled off by even someone so much as a common man. Considering film was founded on the principles of perception, illusion, and amateur craft, it's a wonder why it's so rare we get a modern picture exploring mentalism in a greater sense. Finally, there's Louis Leterrier's Now You See Me, a film centered around magicians and magic that examines the world in such a style that it should be taken in carefully and with a potent sense of admiration. It's easily one of the more surprising pictures of the year, combining effective mystery with plot-twists to make for a ravishing experience.The plot: four crafty magicians, Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and Merritt Osbourne (Woody Harrelson), are united by an odd-force and a year later are seen as the ""Four Horsemen"" by a sold-out Vegas crowd. For their final act, they decide to summon an assuming audience member to state the name of his bank so that he can be teleported through time to rob it accordingly. The bank is in France and in mere seconds is the man transported, given instructions about what to do when there, and finally, the money begins to rain from the ceiling of the arena. Of course this summons national attention and FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is soon on the case trying to infiltrate the Horseman and discover what the underlying secret is to their tricks.Leterrier's directorial game has always been in the field of slick action productions, such as the first two ""Transporter"" films and the recent remake of Clash of the Titans, which he later apologized for. His talent for directing a picture that relies heavily on visual trickery and giving the audience the idea they are ""getting it"" when they aren't even close is meticulous and surprisingly precise. An interesting footnote is ""Now You See Me"" was shot with an anamorphic lens on film in order to make the effects appear not too hokey but not too realistic as if they were showing them done with certainty and complete accuracy.The trio of writers — Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin (Remember the Titans), and Edward Ricourt — however, encounter one issue and that is the issue of greater emphasis on plot and twists as opposed to character and development. The film features such an ensemble cast that does wonders making the material accessible, interesting, and immersing in the first two acts that, by the third, the events and twists have almost overwhelmed the picture to the point of the actors having to run to catch up with the pace of the film. This isn't a huge issue, but it isn't until the final twist is explained – that does feel a little rushed and sketchy – that you begin to realize you really know nothing about these magicians besides they each house enough cockiness to make up for two stubborn hockey teams that are entering Game 7 in the playoffs.Nonetheless, Now You See Me is a good film, but due to the cinematic mastery of special effects the power of magic and perception inevitably feels tainted. I'm reminded of how cinematic shorts got by in the late 1880′s when all auteurs had were cameras and the power of illusion; not slickness, shock, and trickery all created by a hefty budget. How would pioneer filmmaker Georges Méliès view Now You See Me? He'd probably dismiss it as blasphemy before getting back to work.My video review of Now You See Me, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Rceapdsz4",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Dumb but fun,"Big, shiny and dumb. It's also moderately entertaining. Four great magicians are chosen by a mysterious benefactor to become the Four Horsemen. Their goal: to astonish with spectacular tricks and, Robin Hood-like, rip off the criminally rich. Their first big trick involves robbing a Parisian bank from a Las Vegas stage. This puts detectives Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent on their tails, along with famous magic debunker Morgan Freeman. Very little in this film makes much sense, and I think it makes zero sense after the huge twist it ends with. It moves along so fast it's hard to care too much. Director Leterrier is a very good action director, but this isn't really an action movie. The movie's best sequence, though, is an action sequence and involves Dave Franco, one of the Horsemen, using his magic to dodge and trick the cops who are after him. The Horsemen (besides Franco there are Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson and Isla Fisher) get very little characterization and they probably have less screen time than Ruffalo, Laurent or Freeman. Michael Caine also co-stars. There's a lot of talent here and it's all wasted. Still, not a bad time waster. I saw it because I thought the trailer for the sequel looked even better. I'm not convinced by the first installment, but if reviews are good enough I may partake. I'll probably do so on video at any rate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The story was very well set up and had a lot of surprises and some plot twists, so if your a fan of plot twists I suggest this movie. But there was one thing that wasn't very clear (WARNING- may give away a plot twist or may be a spoiler so caution if not wanted anything spoiled.)So while I was watching everything was fine and I didn't really think of this until I looked back on it and someone pointed it out to me, Dylan the main FBI agent who first had the case was Lionel Shrike's son or whatever, and he wanted to get 'revenge' on some certain people, now I only thought he wanted to get 'revenge' on Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman's character) but my dad pointed out to me that it was more than just that, it was the insurance company, the French bank, the safe company and Morgan Freeman's character. So that was the only thing that was a little unclear.But besides that I loved it! It was funny, suspenseful, questioning, thought provoking, action filled, interesting movie. And I liked how it had some fiction added into it, and the special effects and animation was great, the whole ending I had my mouth open and was saying ""oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.""

That's What Happens When You Try to Be Cool,"'No You See Me' is trying to look cool and smart, but it actually isn't.

Though the film is about magicians the magic vanishes pretty quickly and leaves us ridiculous and implausible heist schemes. Characters, though charming, are rather one dimensional and not as mysterious as one could expect from magicians be. This film tries to convince you how clever it is, but if you take away all the flashing show scenes and sloppy action scenes with all the unnecessary jump cats and camera shakes, you'll get quite a flat movie. Just another film that purely relies on fast paced action sequences than actual storytelling, clever twists or complex characters.

awesome movie with a below average ending !!!,"The screenplay of the movie was very good, it maintained a fairly captivating scenery and a hint of mysticism everywhere.... the four horsemen and the eye are great back drops but the way that the movie is concluded really ruins the whole plot that was building up into a promising epic. the way the eye part is left without any further clues or hints and the way the director thinks that disappearing off a merry go round can answer our questions is really frustrating. the scene between the credits is highly confusing too (although it adds another important aspect- mystery) it is aimless and doesn't give a clue as to the further role of the horsemen, i couldn't even determine if they got played or did they reach their promise land. So, concluding, the ending leaves the user confused and a bit irritated, and unsatisfied. but overall its a must watch (although strictly one time watch) movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Worst movie ever. Well, second worse, considering ""Total Recall"" ""remake"".","Absolutely terrible. No story, nothing but mere effects. They even wanted me, an intelligent, adult person to believe that there was any place for romance there. Or mystics. What the... Worselessssss.

Engaging and mysterious,"This film is quite different from any other I had seen before. It instantly draws you in and the story line at some points is somewhat confusing and yet it is still really gripping and not too difficult to follow.Now You See Me boasts a lot of well known actors and they were all great in their respective roles. A positive thing was that each character was interesting in their own way and it was also amusing to see their relationships develop as most of the main characters only meet as we the viewers meet them too.There were several twists throughout this film, most of which I didn't see coming at all and each new revelation made the film even more exciting. From having seen the trailer this film did not turn out how I expected it would and I was pleasantly surprised.Overall this film was an exciting watch, interesting change from the usual mainstream films and therefore a definite recommendation from me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
'Now You See Me' reveals another way of thinking about the magic of movies,"For a totally preposterous magician caper, ""Now You See Me"" has a surprising meta edge to it. The film talks a big talk about deception with its Morgan Freeman voice-over narration (""the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see""), but in spite of its high levels of ludicrousness, it delivers exactly that. ""Now You See Me"" treats its audience as the spectators of a magic act, luring us in and giving us the razzle-dazzle with a stunning reveal of what's behind the curtain in the end.The two reactions you will have to this film is that you'll either hate being duped or you'll be really impressed that you were. It begins with the exceedingly elaborate script from Boaz Yakin (""Prince of Persia""), Edward Ricourt and Ed Solomon (""Men in Black""). They craft something so totally compelling that no one is bound to turn this film off or walk away before it's over. Plot holes and leaps in logic and belief are stashed aside until the final minutes because the mystery simply envelops you, just as any good magician in his or her act.Four magicians with unique talents, slight of hand master J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), escape artist Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), mentalist Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and trickster Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), have mysteriously been recruited to create a magic act unlike anything ever seen. Fast-forward a year later and they reveal their act in Las Vegas, with a grand finale in which they rob a bank in Paris while on stage. Their little display catches the attention of FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and an Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent) who work together with famed magician debunker Thaddeus Bradley (Freeman) in order to guess their next move.And their moves only get more and more complicated and astounding. The script teases with little bits that make you think you're inching toward an answer only to be caught looking the wrong way. Director Louis Leterrier (""Transporter,"" ""Clash of the Titans"") adds plenty of movement and excitement to the proceedings as well.If you so desire to dig below the surface layers of ""Now You See Me,"" it goes from wildly entertaining and engrossing into downright horrible. No, it's simply not feasible that anything that happened in this movie could happen. Yes, the characters are only as interesting as their different talents and witty remarks, and their motivation to execute this grand plan comes from something we do not know until the very end. It's too slick, too neat, too glossy.""Now You See Me"" will only be as good as the person watching it allows it to be. Bite early and lay back and you're bound to enjoy it; stay skeptical and bank too much on the payoff and you're bound to dismiss it entirely. It's the same with any movie that's building toward a big reveal right from its opening scene. Live by the twist, die by the twist.Personally, I bought in. Fantastic performances from Eisenberg and Harrelson plus the gravitas of Freeman and Michael Caine as the executive who funds their show helped keep up the appearances and cover up the blemishes that really only became apparent to me upon reflection post-credits. I came in open-minded and bought into the entire aesthetic of the movie and enjoyed it presumably a lot more than if I had paid too close attention to the details. And the ending had me fooled, which happens a lot less these days.As easily as one can find the seams ""Now You See Me"" and tear it apart, it does exactly what it set out to do: beguile, trick, deceive and entertain its audience. Regardless of the artistic qualities or merits of a film, if it does what it sets out to do, it's a success.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
mind blowing concept & execution was even more better...,Watching this magical movie 'Now You See Me' I had that felling that I don't care what the review and critics say about this visionary movie but on my knowledge this the best magical movie I had ever experienced in my life...! I'm completely thrilled and enjoyed every single minute of it...! Also I must add that the concept was brilliant & cast was remarkable and specially performance as 'The Four Horsemen' was full of surprisingly delightful...! Thoroughly entertaining & special effects and soundtrack was quietly impulsive. can't wait to see that Abracadabra! has return with some new mind blowing twisted tricks... This is one kind of a movie that will lid your mode up into so high that you wouldn't been expected... if you don't believe me then why don't you give a try...!!!,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Hard to know what to make of it,"Like most of the critics, I had a very mixed reaction to this Fantasy Heist Caper from Transporter director Louis Letterier. The film left me mesmerised of course, but not because of a clever plot or brilliant performances (of which none were really exceptional), but because I felt pranked or rused by what I had just seen. The film has some spectacular moments granted, from car chases and explosions to FANTASTIC visual effects, but in turn almost swaps what could have been a very clever storyline for a thinly plotted film that is expected to hang on star quality and humour which usually fail to hold a film. My advice would be to see it for yourself. It's by no means a masterpiece, but will entertain for a while.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Breathtaking, loved every second!","Before I even walked into the cinema I knew this would be a great film because of the great actors and original story. I've always been a fan of Jesse Eisenberg, and I don't think the movie would of worked if he wasn't cast in the main role, and the same goes for everyone else in this movie. Each and every actor brings their A game from start to finish. Dave Franco and Mark Ruffalo are good actors but neither really made me think, 'Wow, they're good freaking actors!' But after this movie I can say that about both of them.The story is original and fresh with some mesmerizing action sequences and some even better thrills! All of my respect goes to Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt, if this was just a movie about four young bank robbers it wouldn't have blown me away as much as the magical element did, even with these actors.Now much like this movie, the title of this review could be deceitful, there were a few moments where I found myself thinking 'Really? He just turns every light bulb he comes across?' (You'll understand about 15 minutes into the movie). Some of the audience at the magic shows didn't impress me either, but they're minor speed bumps on an otherwise fulfilling, truly beautiful film.I can tell you that this movie will most definitely take your breath away. Some have complained about the four horsemens character development, don't let that throw you, they're probably just angry that they couldn't work out the twist, which by the way, was also a beautiful moment.Overall, this is an amazing movie, with awesome action, great actors and characters, a nice soundtrack and a brilliant script. Woody Harrelson had everyone in the room laughing. But maybe I'm biased. There is nothing I love more than a great heist movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good Acting but a Rerun,"The editing and acting was on point. However, it felt like a cheap remake of The Prestige/The Illusionist meets Oceans 11. I found the entire thing unoriginal with cheap camera tricks showing the magic tricks. The movie sets up the plot so the audience expects something spectacular and smart, but it ends up being a cheap way out. I was engaged throughout the entire thing but was left disappointed at the end. Maybe I had high hopes for a magic trick flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Excellent Summer watch,"It's amazing that all ordinary viewers who have seen this movie by and large love it while the critics have almost as a group given it the Thumbs Down ... is this a sinister plot to can the movie and it's makers or is it that critics really don't get what makes for a great cinematic experience.While I agree that the four Horsemen aren't well fleshed out, they are loads of fun individually and as a group, and together the 2 titans (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine) who add enormous credibility to the proceedings,make for a real cinematic delight.I guess critics don't like to applaud an intelligent,crisp and entertaining caper that provides real entertainment.

Cat and Mouse,"I was painfully disappointed in the storyline, I waited 3 weeks to see this movie because the show-times were so far apart I usually just saw something that was playing sooner; nearly 50% of the movie is chase scenes and trying to corner these elusive young magicians which is cool for an action movie but I was expecting something different.The plot never thickens... just unravels at random intervals, no real magic here to hang your suspension of disbelief on; instead everything is explained away almost as it happens. The movie had a great concept but it went up like ""flash paper"". Man of Steel was a lot better IMO.Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are fun to watch as they are both classic icons in the plot exposure role of cinema, they both do a fine job each his own fate are never completely reasonable to the viewer so much as they may be from the view of the protagonist.Really I just see curve-ball after the movie was in the tin.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Very Entertaining Flick,"I went into this movie with low expectations. For no other reason than I have found that many times movies that have a really ""cutsie"" plot are often no more than that. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The start of the movie really got me hooked, it is well paced and does a pretty good job of developing a brief backstory on the main players. It does drag a little bit in the middle of the movie, and at over 2 hours it was a little on the long side. The end picks up and is fast paced right up through the end. The plot is a little thin but it was tolerable.All in all, for me this was an entertaining movie, the acting wasn't bad, no Oscars here, but I will recommend this movie if your in the mood for something light that doesn't require too much thought.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Caine, Ruffalo and Freeman round out the all star cast in a film that feels like Christopher Nolan, but not quite.Feels a bit like a lost opportunity due to ludicrous plot twists and some flat spots, but the magic scenes are brilliant, and the horsemen perfectly cast.

Simply wonderful! Blowed my mind!,"The film has a novel and promising premise. The gang's cat and mouse game with the FBI, their display of magic tricks, fluid stunt scenes and Mark Ruffalo's banter with co-cop Melanie Laurent keeps you engaged. The film works as a crime-thriller. However, it's unconvincing when it comes to dissecting the magic. As the film progresses, the antics of the law- defying 'famous four' start defying logic as well. The scattered plot runs out of steam eventually. The film goes into a different tangent altogether in order to be unpredictable, leaving you more perplexed than pleased. The filmmaker sends out a similar message to the audience - don't dig into every aspect of the 'tricks' and you will be entertained.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

So unless Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman would be there ,being marvelous as they can be ,I would not grade this film with more than 3- 4.Mark Ruffalo is giving a convincing performance ,and so are the rest of the Magician crew for that matter.So to sum up:Nice 1.5 hours of Las Vegas style entertainment brought to your local Cinema with some quick unexpected turns in the plot",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

As incredible as impossible,"It is a teenager movie that tries to be spectacular and smart and that for that kind of audience hits the target.As for adults instead, in my opinion, this movie trespass a limit where it becomes as much incredible as impossible to be taken seriously. So what is left when it's over is like to have seen a fantasy, at times funny, superhero movie and nothing else. It is absolutely not credible, too many flaws and exaggerations. A shame, because the heist/magic plot could have worked also for an extended audience.If you take it for what it is, you could end up to enjoy it more or less, for the fast-paced action and some entertainment shows, and because it is not badly executed technically speaking, but if you want a deeper and much more serious movie, that turn around magicians and tricks, then watch ""The Prestige"" or ""The Illusionist"", both from 2006.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"The Four Horsemen create magical entertainment, the rest of the film attempts to undo it","Sometimes I think I should give ""Now You See Me"" more credit. It's exactly what it's supposed to be; the tag-line ""The closer you look, the less you see"" couldn't be more accurate, and I'm pretty sure the sole point of Hollywood summer fare is to be entertaining. That it is. The Four Horsemen will take you on such a fun ride that you might not notice how terrible the script is.Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco work exceedingly well together as a rag-tag group of magicians. Their individual talents and personal egos are brought together to create magnificent illusions to entertain and please the common folk. They rob banks and rob people but it's okay because some banks are bad and some people are bad and they give the money back to people who unfairly lost it. They're Robin Hood and his Merry Men and FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is the Sheriff of Nottingham.The tricks were exciting to watch with a particularly appealing style and choreography. Story-wise, the tricks build in significance, visually the tricks build in cinematic wonder. People like that but eventually you'll get concerned that the film doesn't have anything intelligent to say.Dylan Rhodes was a frustrating character. He worked his way up in the FBI, takes his job seriously and snidely communicates with co-workers (whether they should be there or not). He doesn't care about magic – doesn't believe in it but also doesn't have an interest in how the tricks are actually accomplished. Each step closer to the Four Horsemen and he's pushed two steps back. The frustrating part is that we don't want him to catch them but we do want him to get close because whenever they're on the screen, the film is fun again.Obviously there's a twist, it wouldn't be a heist movie without one, but how unfortunate that is. I wasn't the only one hoping there wasn't a twist which was guaranteed to undo all the fun that came before it. It would have been a much better movie if the entire thing was Harrelson, Eisenberg, Fisher and Franco performing magic for the masses without even an attempt at a story. That would have been written better.As is, ""Now You See Me"" throws in a romance subplot for no good reason, destroys meaningless characters for no good reason and a twist that undoes that glorious good the Four Horsemen accomplished. The Four Horsemen did accomplish a lot. Their personal issues never got in the way, the lack of character development wasn't a problem and they obeyed one of the golden rules of performance art: Have fun and your audience will too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A great Movie,"When it comes to summer movies, this is about as good as it gets. We got to the movies to be entertained and lose ourselves for 2 hours for a price of an admission ticket. I can say without flinching that this was totally worth it.It's hard for me to pick a favorite character because I love all of the Horsemen, but when it comes down to it I have to say I like the characters Daniel Atlas and Jack Wilder. Daniel, played by Jesse Eisenberg, often tries to assert himself as the head of the Four Horsemen. He is controlling, very specific and difficult to deal with, but he is also the funniest character which is attributed to all of his demanding qualities. I love every film Jesse Eisenberg is in and I think he is perfect for the role of Daniel Atlas. I also like Jack Wilder, played by Dave Franco, because he is the craftiest of the magicians. He isn't the ""card trick"" or ""read your mind"" type, he's just a good old fashioned pick-pocket for whom no door is ever locked.. He is sort of the ""muscle"" to the operation because he is able to help the horsemen get out of tight situations and he is also very funny.Overall, this movie is a solid flick with some great actors that you shouldn't sleep on.

"Entertaining, but the Ending is Contrived","Four very good Illusionists known as the Four Horsemen rob a bank in France while they are still in the United States, leave no clues and it is up to FBI Agents and Illusionist Exposer, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), to figure out how it was done.The first 90% of the movie is captivating, riveting, engaging - yes, magical - and really quite good. I thought I might have to see it a second time to understand everything. But, there are subtle hints of something that went wrong years ago that became the actual focus of all that we see. In other words the twist at the end within the last 10%, was, IMHO, contrived and this is where the movie falls apart. I found it hard to swallow and when you get to know the characters, you may feel the same way too. To say more would be to give things away.There are questions I would like to ask of the character Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) but to do that here would give away too much. Sorry. Okay, here's the thing: I looked at him as the key to why everything worked the way it did, and my question to him would be: how did you become the Four Horsemen's benefactor? We were under the impression he was their banker. At the end of the movie you will surly have that question too because there is no way he can give a good answer: that was contrived too.CGI played a huge factor and it was spectacular in places, but the car chase on the bridge actually made me dizzy. It was one of those things where they sped up the film to make it like the cars were going 90-mph when they were actually going about 5-mph, if that. See? A little gimmicky. The crash was CGI.The heists or robberies that you will see are probably the most involved ever put on film. Kudos.One interesting scene I saw was on a bridge in Paris, France. The screen alongside the bridge had key-locks all along it. I believe, if you have secrets, you are supposed to attach the lock to the wire fence and throw the key into the river below. Thus your secrets are forever safe. Or, for the amorous: they can lock their love forever. Cool. To see what is up with that bridge, Google: Bridge in France that has key locks attached to wire fencing.All the actors performed well, and it will be up to you whether or not to believe them. Hey, these are professional actors and it's what they do: convincing you of what they say is true. Good luck.Overall, this was still very entertaining, but contrived when you see the ending and because of that we shall never see sequels regarding the Four Illusionist Horsemen.

"""First rule of magic: always be the smartest person in the room.""","Louis Leterrier is a very smart director. Since my first encounter with Leterrier's work (Transporter 2) I was looking forward to his upcoming projects. Clash of the Titans was a well made summer blockbuster with one condition: you have to tun your brain off before watching it. It got a lot of hate but the problem wasn't with the director. Then came his best movie yet and that is the kick-ass The Incredible Hulk. A film with great characters and great action scenes. But after these movies Louis Leterrier had a problem: he was typecast in Hollywood as an action director. When he showed interest in making Now you see me, the studio didn't want to let him direct this movie since they were afraid he wouldn't handle the characters well. No one thought that he could tell stories. But Leterrier proved them wrong once again. Now You See Me is a great very fast paced heist movie where the crew pulling off the heist consists of magicians. There is plenty of action, magic and the camera has no time to stay in one place. That is probably my favorite aspect about this film the camera work. There is no shaky cam in this film despite that being Hollywood's biggest trend in movies. Yet still the camera is never static, it is always moving. Circling around the characters,spinning or zooming in and out.The cast assembled in Now Yoou See Me is truly marvelous. Jesse Eissenebrg who has two on screen personas - the shy stuttering neurotic or the cocky and arrogant smart ass. Here he plays the second one. And well he is pretty good at it. Woody Harrelson is always a fun addition in any movie. Mark Ruffalo who probably has the most screen time is becoming more and more likable in recent films and here he does a great playing the FBI agent who is incapable of catching the Four Horsemen, the group of magicians. Seeing Morgan and Michael Caine is always a pleasure and just seeing these two act is a joy for a every movie fan. Isla Fisher plays one of the Four Horsemen but she serves more as a distraction for the audience so you pay attention to her and not what is happening in the film. Dave Franco once again gets his chance to shine. He has proved he can be very funny in 21 Jump Street and here he shows he can pull off a serous role too.If you are looking for a well made suspensive heist movie with some action or just looking to cool yourself down in the cinema I believe that you can't go wrong with Now You See Me.P.S. Solid cast, original story and a good word of mouth helped to make this film one of this summer's biggest surprises. When something has success in Hollywood it gets a sequel. Even though the film is a wrapped story. Not sure where they want to go with these characters next but I'm cautiously optimistic about the next film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Well, i have never seen a movie with this sort of content.This movie has surpassed my expectations, and then some. The story was perfect, character development was nice, they had a perfect cast to star the main characters as well as do some amazing acting. Mark Ruffalo, Jessie Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, even Morgan Freeman. With the perfect cast they couldn't have messed this up, and they didn't. But i only have one complaint. The fact that there was little to no backstory tot he characters, made me feel less emotionally attached to them.Never the less, its a great movie and its worth a watch Now lets hope ""Now You See Me 2"" is good, if not better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"simply put, find out who wrote the script and avoid the guy forever","I start to suspect that scripts for these films are not even written by real people anymore. They must be using a piece of software that randomly arranges the same 200 lines and spits out a 'new' script. It is rated 7+ on IMDb only because we are brainwashed, conditioned to seek plastic films in which everyone's an actor but no one is a character.Did I watch this with unreasonable expectations? Maybe I did. But no matter what you expect from something that has Morgan Freeman in it, it is not Transformers. While this movie is exactly that. It is Transformers meets NYPD Blue. It wants to advocate some moral belief while it fills your eye wholes with blue Vegas light. You have seen this movie before. Sadly.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Majestic Magic Masterpiece,"Thoroughly enjoyed this fantasy with its many twists, turns and sleight of hand. Morgan Freeman as the James Randi character is excellent - so often he is given a bit part as a switch-and-bait to get bums on seats.

I have watched this many times but I still get excited every time,"Now You See Me one of the best movies about magic or something that always seemed to me that the movie is a Sci-fi one that in the end looked like that!But I mean the magic tricks because I don't see how a man could do them, but who cares, the movie is great!I have to say that the movie took good actors from other great movies, including two of my favorites Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman and Mark Ruffalo!I swear at 1.19.00 I thought Mark Ruffalo was turning into the Hulk ...

It seems like the actual performances they were doing started out good but then just became spectacle with no real point.I was also a bit annoyed that the magic was special effects and not actual stage magic, and some of it was implausible, in particular the mesmerism: They describe a full _superpower_ like The Shadow, not a stage mentalist.But DO watch this one.

An Exciting Rare Use of a Magic Theme in a Movie,"3 June 2013. Magicians don't seem to have played much of a major role in the history of movies, outside the world of fantasy such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) or the Anthony Hopkin's occult Magic (1978) that earned him a best actor Golden Globes nomination. This rare resurgence this year of magic with the beautiful 3-D fantasy film Oz The Great and Powerful (2013) or the less than well received hokey comedy movie The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (2013) along with perhaps never to be released comedy Desperate Acts of Magic (2013) brings along with it this rare crime-thriller movie where magic forms the basis of the storyline of Now You See Me.The screenwriter's seem to have taken a lot from the television series Leverage (2008-2013) which itself won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Cable TV Drama (2013) and oddly enough that show doesn't use magic as its theme but uses creative deception and misdirection like a grifter in all its episodes for rebalancing the scales of justice. The most comparative magic-themed movies would include the more personally involved competition between two rival musicians in this psychological thriller between Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in The Prestige (2006) and the period crime psychological, mystery thriller without the action The Illusionist (2006) which included its own powerfully surprising twist both which focused more on the human drama rather than on the spectacular crime mystery action thriller or even the more poignant and perhaps even more emotionally, more intimately personal and bitingly delightful performance of John Malkovich in The Great Buck Howard (2008).Now You Can See Me suffers somewhat with its omission of a flashback at the beginning of the movie that sets the basis for this story and instead uses a present time narrative to eventually flesh out the back story which is a crucial element of the emotive humanity of the entire movie. Overall this movie is fast paced, with at least three major plot twists along with others and seemingly magical sequences that sometimes are rather predictable and at other times unexpected, but none that exceed that of the television episodes from Leverage or perhaps even the old Mission Impossible television series (1966-1973). This fusion of magic, crime, and psychological gaming becomes a who and how done it audience game on the big screen, even the opening sequence of the guessing the playing card number and suit by the theater-going audience gets them ooh and awe. It's hard to disassemble this movie from many other clever action thrillers because the use of the magic theme is new and exciting like a new Disneyland ride and rarely used, if any on this level, as the actual part of a movie as opposed to actually making the movie. Nevertheless, the movie is refreshing and entertaining, keeping the audience interested and guessing throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Tremendously entertaining and completely absurd,"There is so much to complain about in this movie. The approach to hypnosis is patently absurd, the plot is full of holes, the denouement makes little sense, and in spite of all its twisty twists, much of it is predictable (oh look, the police are stupidly doing the obvious thing!) and clichéd, and character motivation seems beyond the grasp of the writers.I don't care, I love it.This movie is pure showmanship, starting with a card trick that shows exactly how amazing magic tricks can be. The stars are playful and relaxed (Harrelson and Fisher are particularly good), the constant twists are fun, and the movie moves like lightning and plays like opening a series of Christmas presents.But yeah, it's stupid. The stupidest thing is probably Morgan Freeman's character, who exposes magician's secrets. It's an odd premise, in that he acts like he's on a mission (think The Amazing Randi's attacks on psychic fakery), when no one thinks magicians are terrible tricksters who must be exposed. It's just bizarre. And while Freeman is, of course, great, he cannot make his character's actions or attitude make any real sense.So yeah, dumb, stupid, irretrievably ridiculous movie.

Not as good as they say,"To be honest, I couldn't finish 'Now You See Me'. I was too put off by the snooty characters, and the attitude of the film which just seems too pleased with itself. Also, the story wasn't interesting enough to keep my attention.Many reviewers have praised the acting, but I didn't think it was very good at all. The dialogue is forced. Isla Fisher's character is little more than eye candy -in a very short skirt- to ensure viewers.Some have said this film represents a new economic model of movie-making. Based on the number of ""best movie ever"" reviews on this website, it would seem that spamming IMDb with fake reviews is part of that model.This is not a good movie in my opinion, and certainly doesn't warrant a sequel, but we all know they'll make one.

Good movie with a better Plot Twist.,"This is one of my favorite movies due to the fact that I like Magic/Illusions and that I love Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson.

I love the plot twist but you kind of figure it out before the ending of the movie.

"Uninspiring, uninteresting.","The film didn't interest me from start to finish mainly due to the fact the viewer was given no chance to develop empathy for any character. Each character is introduced in sequence but in an unsubtle, tasteless manner invoking cringey feelings from the outset. The opening was 'cheese' of the purest kind. Good actors namely Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine were wasted here. Many of the tricks and illusions, although quite lavish, were not inspiring and appeared quite unrealistic in the context of the film. There was no awe or wonder regarding the performance of illusions due to the fact I never became immersed in the film and always regarded the stunts as staged. In one opening scene I developed such a dislike for a character, in the space of just 2 or 3 sentences, it was my hope the actress would simply drown during her stunt and save everyone the misery of listening a moment longer.

Pretends to be super smart with nothing to back it up,"The opening is solid and promises a fast paced, cleverly laid out plot with unique characters and a long-term payoff: the reveal of a secret character. What follows sure is fast paced but also laughable in terms of character building and cleverness.
Take for instance the final twist, the chararcter reveal: it brags about how insanely clever it is while completely ignoring that it forgot the setup to the payoff. The setup to the main plot point! But it's by no means the only one lacking foreshadowing or at least coherence. Twists and reveals are thematically particularily interesting in a piece on stage magic, but most of the turns come out of complete nowhere, defy any logic and sometimes even invalidate previously, apparently carefully established plot points.
Another symptom of this sickness are the ""magic tricks"", that in a number of cases are just flatout high fantasy literal magic, sometimes poorly explained by throwaway lines or just dumped on the viewer in the hope that the insane frequence of plot turns won't leave any time to ask questions.
The characters also fall victim to missing foresight: the initially very intriguing mystery about the four horsemen and their final motivation actually never gets lifted and leaves them as ultimately mindless plot devices.
As a result, the amount of cringe in the final two scenes that this mess of a plot culminates in is simply awe-inducing.There could have been a world of trickery and deception to be playfully explored in the context of professional magicians, but all the movie does is throw the viewer a ton of impossible to chew bones and require them to swallow those with next to no help. All the while bathing itself in its aura of self-proclaimed genius.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Agents of FBI running after four magic - Four Horsemen - who rob banks using tricks and illusions.,"You should see it!""Now you see me"" is a thriller directed by Louis Leterrier who has already directed blockbusters like ""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""Clash of the Titans"". The cast is formed by well known actors as Jesse Eisenberg, famous for his performance as Mark Zuckerberg in the movie "" The Social Network "", Mark Ruffalo again impressing everyone with his excellent performance after ""Hulk"" and the eternal Matt of "" 13 going on 30"". Among the writers Ed Solomon stands out, more famous for his work in ""Imagine that"" with Eddie Murphy.As a plot that leaves no loose ends ""Now you see me"" tells the story of a group of FBI agents running after four famous magicians who use their tricks and illusionism to rob banks and all the money is given to the viewers of their own shows. However, there is much more beyond this abracadabra, because before the four magicians reach the high position they are in, they were recruited by an entity type called The Eye, which selected them, but never introduced itself. Moreover, they do not know The Eye's purpose, motivation and goals. In the middle of the trajectory the magic four - titled as The Four Horsemen - Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg ), the leader of the group, illusionist and showman ; McKinney (Woody Harrelson ), the mentalist ; Henley ( Isla Fisher ) the escapist; and Wilder (Dave Franco), illusionist, street magician, and pickpocket, are faced with Thaddeus ( Morgan Freeman ), an ex-magician who earns his living revealing the other magicians' tricks. In addition he is willing to help the agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo ) and Alma Dray ( Mélanie Laurent ) reveal illusionists' tricks.Most of the scenes take place in an amazing setting that is Las Vegas, where bright lights, many special effects give the movie an extra shine. Very well built, as already said, the plot leaves nothing without fit. The actors are perfectly engaged and each of their character makes the whole thing seem somehow real.

Good movie if you suspend belief,"7.5 stars, rounding up to 8. My family wanted to go so I took them, not eagerly after reading the Rotten Tomatoes assessment. Darned if I didn't like it. I think the key was, early on, just letting myself go and suspending belief. Some of the illusions just would not seem viable otherwise. What helped was the breakneck pacing. It starts out at 90 miles per hour and does not let up. No chance to reflect or get bored because once you start, BAM!, it's off to something else. The plot, generally, I do not find plausible. I saw the ending criticized elsewhere. Again, suspend belief and it is not a problem. Magic is kind of fun to me, and I think that helped get me through.

Great fun!,"""That was a great concert!""Those were my thoughts when I was walking out of the movie theater. Long story short: it's a heist movie with magic as a background turned into a huge visual attraction, almost glamorizing burglars. It's not something new, you probably saw this a thousand times before with movies like The Prestige or Ocean's Eleven, in fact, this movie not only takes a lot of the concepts from The Prestige by Christopher Nolan and being two steps ahead being the smartest guy in the room in Ocean's Eleven and mix them to work together with great visual and art concepts that would make a director like Baz Luhrmann applaud as loud as he can but also elevates these concepts to the heights, putting into practice everything we saw in the famous Christopher Nolan movie.So, there's nothing really new here, but it's well made, well orchestrated, gives you tons of fun and a thousand twists, I mean, holy moly, this movie has more turns and endings than Return of the King, when you think you had it figured out, it just fools you once again! Anyway, it's a nice spectacle, worth the admission ticket, go watch it! And also has great actors like Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson and others.I've just saw it and I enjoyed the ride, so yeah, it's worth of your attention.

"Very good movie, but don't expect mind-blowing results","'Now You See Me' was an excellently developed movie, showcasing brilliant magic tricks and great humor and snarkiness from the Four Horsemen. Both Harrelson provided the comedy relief and Jesse Eisenberg displayed the cocky arrogance from The Social Network. Isla Fisher debuted in the movie amazingly, but then her character got pushed aside and later, reinstated as fighting for control of the group subtly along Eisenberg. Franco was also very funny and did an amazing fight scene with Ruffalo, using fire, cards, and a high-speed car chase with fantastic explosions. Ruffalo's character was pleasingly befuddled with a humorous chase down in New Orleans which ended when.....oops, spoilers. However, his partner, Laurent's character was earnest and passionate about the subject of magic but was rather pushed to the side and later suspected of having choreographed the whole thing herself. But the movie itself was funny, intelligent, witty, action-packed, and everything you could ask for if you don't want a thriller/psychologically stimulating movie. It's an action magic movie and that's that. There's no philosophical meaning, no deeper layers like in The Prestige. But The Prestige was dark and meaningful, and this movie is more lighthearted, something to laugh and ""wow"" at. The stunts and tricks were amazing and the effects were great. However......... The movie could stand to have had more character development. I felt it was all action, action, action. Freeman's character was frustrating because he spoke like he knew everything, but he knew nothing. Caine's character was actually well placed, used for the purpose of showing the audience what a lying cheat he was. I liked the way the Four Horsemen's tricks were conducted to achieve a higher end. None of the stealing or giving back to the deserving was for their own good. Like a magic Robin Hood mafia. All in all, it was what I wanted it to be. You won't be disappointed unless you're looking for a psychological thriller, in which case, you're in the wrong theater son.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Biggest disappointment of the year so far,"I was expecting so much more from this movie. Good actors aren't always a sign of quality. The beginning of the movie is okay, but we soon notice that it is total nonsense.Magic usually doesn't work in movies, and this one takes it to a new level. When you do magic with cgi-bubbles, you are doing something wrong. The idea in a magic show is to wonder ""I know this isn't what it seems, but I wonder how they do it"". When you see crap like that in movies, you know it is just a guy holding his hands out and a geek on a computer has made the bubble. Ther is no magic in that, just stupidness.I think the director tried to get an ""Ocean's 11"" feeling to the movie. He failed. The music is that generic casino/Las Vegas swagger crap that is supposed to be just right for this movie. It is not, it is annoying.This movie offers a surprise plot-twist. It's not enough to tell (smart) viewers that the most unlikely character is behind all this. They should explain even a little how that person made all that possible.At one point in the movie we get the ""One year later"" routine.

The twist at the end is predictable yet thrilling as the focus is shifted across characters.The drawback is the movie is that the magical tricks are left unexplained. The first and second acts are explained but the final act is not explained which leaves a big question mark. The end of the movie seems to be a set up for a sequel to come. One might be reminded of the movie The Prestige but this movie does not have the credibility behind the magic tricks that is so evident.A little more time devotion to the background of the tricks could have struck a chord with the audience and made it more entertaining.Overall , Now you see me is an engrossing crime thriller which is sure to keep you on the edge of seat. Good 3/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Perfectly suited if you are looking for some solid weekend entertainment!,"I suggest you people to go watch this movie as early as you can because 14th June is round the corner (MoS!) , and this movie is high on background score(Brian Tyler w00t w00t!), a decent plot, tricky direction and of course, smart performers.The cast was so balanced. I have seen such a perfectly chosen ensemble after a really long time. Though Eisenberg should have been given some more screen space. And Isla Fisher is much more prettier than her 'Wedding Crashers' days.The first half is not that slow, but actually not much is shown in the first half in comparison to the second half which manages to keep you at the edge of your seats, mounting to a satisfying climax in the end.Morgan Freeman looked frail for the first time on screen-diluted pupils, weak mouthing of lines. And that made me really sad and worried.People might end up hating the movie because of the simple fact that it lets out secrets as much as it elevates the magic trick in the next sequence, and so on and so on- which is a bold thing to pull off. The mythological connection should be explored more in the sequel if they make one(confused if they will or not) .Overall, Eisenberg-Freeman-Fisher-Caine-Ruffalo & Co. will ensure you don't come out of the theater disappointed. The illusion-shots are superb. And please, don't keep guessing the ending before it comes. Let it grow and flow as designed. That's the key to enjoy a heist movie you know!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Entertaining film but not a cinema gem!,"I was looking forward for this movie for months, and finally yesterday I was able to watch it and I was not disappointed.Let me tell you this just straight up, ""Now you see me"" its no a cinematography achievement by any means. The story might be pretty straightforward, nothing special in the acting department, decent visual effects, but the whole assembly works great, this is a fun an enjoyable movie.This movie is far superior than ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" ( really bad by the way) don't watch that, this is the magic movie of this summerI strongly recommend this flick to any magic enthusiasts out there,",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Look Closer.. and I did.. and Enjoyed this film,"Its not often, that I get completely bamboozled by movie plots, or if I am, its so well done that it doesn't matter. Now You See Me did a fine job. I'll try to keep any info that may ruin the movie out of this review. Starring Jessie Eisenberg (Social Network), Mark Ruffalo (Avengers), Woody Harrelson (Seven Psychopaths), Isla Fisher (The Great Gatsby), Dave Franco (21 Jump Street), and Melanie Laurent (Inglorious Bastards), Now You See Me is about four magicians who all specialize in a different field of magic and are brought together mysteriously and hence forth perform around the country using their talents to carry out heists, pretty much in front of the FBI's noses, specifically Ruffalo's and Laurent's characters'. I was well pleased with the direction of the movie. The acting while pleasing lacked depth and the ""love story"" if you can call it that, was weak at best. The movie kept me engaged the whole time, while I feverishly tried to figure it out but it was difficult because it was so entertaining! :)In the end I wasn't completely oblivious, I figured just a few small things out but the ending was a surprise and right in front of my face. I kept replaying the tag line, ""Look closer, because the closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see,"" in my head. I tried not to look close but I did and I saw less. :) Regardless though, I was thoroughly entertained and after all isn't that the point of a movie about illusion? To keep me guessing and entertained! I'd spend the money and see this one in theaters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"All style, no substance. All smoke and mirrors. All surface, no feeling.","So what is there to say about this movie? What we get is a vague, overarching background plot, a contrived love-story that just kind of pops up for no apparent reason, a few predictable plot twists, a huge plot twist pulled out of thin air and some really overdone CGI magic. For a film boasting such a strong cast it falls surprisingly flat. I suppose someone has a lot of dirt on the main cast, or maybe they didn't read the script before signing on to this Titanic of a movie.First of all, there is no of urgency or excitement what so ever. The four horsemen are certainly closer to being super villains than actual human illusionists. The FBI and Interpol are no more than comic sidekicks, never ever getting close to catching the bank robbers/magicians/demigods. I get the feeling the writers want me to root for Jesse, Woody and the rest of the illusionists but they just come off as being so ridiculously overpowering and vastly superior to the police it's like rooting for a UFC fighter beating up a puppy.The would be heroes are at best people who the movie never tries to make the audience care about, at worst they are smug and utterly unlikable. There is no back story worth mentioning, all we get are some short intro sequences. The main characters meet and then the main plot just kind of fast-forwards off into action without any further explanation. The character development is so insignificant it cannot even be measured. There is no change and nothing is leaned. At the end of the film the characters are exactly the same as when we started. Yes, there are some references to a back story but that never effects the plot besides setting up a few one-liners and in a clumsily thrown together ending twist.I read quite a few reviews saying this movie thinks it is much smarter than it really is and I think that sums it up quite nicely. This movie is like a pompous street magician with a self satisfied grin, quite certain he's got the audience in awe when in reality everyone in the crowd has seen that he's got a card up his sleeve and that his fly is undone.I gave this movie 1/10, if only to balance the notoriously generous IMDb-crowd and lobbyists that for some reason beyond think this movie is worth 7.2/10. If I was drunk while watching and feeling particularly benevolent I might give it a weak 3/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Maybe if you come a little closer, I can show you...","Now you see me was a spectacular film by which I have not seen compared to any other film. They draw you in perfectly and make the film very entertaining, all of the actors are amazing.Mark Ruffalo was very convincing throughout the whole film, portraying his character very well, bring some humor and entertainment to the screen. Isla Fisher brought about great acting while looking dazzling throughout the whole film. Jesse Eisenberg was also very convincing, he really could be a magician for all we know!As for the story, it was very interesting. Many turns and twists throughout. The story developed quickly, not too fast mind you, and caught the attention of audiences easily. The tricks, turns, tears and shock this film brings work together in perfect unison bring a perfect mixture of flavors blended perfectly for such a film.The only downside I have with the film, as pointed out by a friend, is it gets a little bit Sc-Fi towards the end. That being said, this is easily plausible considering the thoughts of magic and illusion, as most magic is, and still bring about a very enticing story. It wraps it all up nicely in a red bow but still may leave you a little bit confused. But is confusion a bad thing? Not always.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Excellent suspense film on magic,"Three dialogues define this movie...'The more you look, the less you see.', 'The closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see.' and my favorite 'The job of the assistant is to divert you from the magician's real trick'.The movie starts well and when the interval came, all of us in the theatre where clueless as to what is happening. Its only in last 10 mins that things fall in place which is the beauty of this movie.As the audience I kept guessing abt how this movie will end and when it comes...I figured out none of us ever had of clue !!And when I came back home, the 3 dialogues struck me and things finally fell in place for me.Its an excellent film and a definitely a must watch. Its falls just short of Nolan's 'The Prestige' which I consider the best film on magic till date.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
What a miss!,"I would love to know the production history of this one. It feels like it was conceived as a Jonathan-creek or The Prestige-like story where the plot is enriched by real behind-the-curtain knowledge of how magic works, then got handed around until someone with no knowledge of or interest in magic got a hold of it and let their right-brain go wild. Instead of a clever insight into how misdirection and trickery could be used for crime, we just get magic that can do anything and therefore is a very convenient and unsatisfying plot mechanic.We step entirely outside of reality and rely on CGI to make props appear, even in a supposed stage show. Fortunately you only have to watch the first 20 minutes or so to know that this is not going to satify magic geeks or people who enjoy realistic characters or a coherent plot.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
This is fun.,"I can sum up Now You See Me in one word: fun. But, obviously, I can't stick with one word to talk about this film!Yes, it was incredibly entertaining. You will remain interested in the overall plot the entire time. Another one of this film's selling points was its uniqueness. This summer, we've gotten a lot of explosions, big names, superheroes in powerful suits, several versions of the impending apocalypse, and an overdose of hype underscoring the madness. And in Now You See Me, there's some action. The roster is pretty much loaded; unless you live under a rock, you will recognize at least two of these actors. But the premise, magicians using tricks to pull off heists, is something you're not going to see every day. Even its title, ""Now You See Me,"" is unusual. It's different. And that's a good thing.The recurring idea, ""The closer you look, the less you'll actually see,"" is truly the theme of the movie on a whole lot of levels. You'll have to watch it to see what I mean, but it explains almost everything, including the feel of the movie itself.I'll admit, character development was comparable to that of a Mission: Impossible film, but this was also a plot-based movie, not a exhibition of the human emotions. That being said, many of the characters were quite entertaining and at times hilarious, especially Harrelson's and Eisenberg's. There wasn't a whole lot of a message or social commentary here (which was actually a relief). Instead, they kept the pace fast, the production quality high, and the corny drama levels at a blessed minimum. Alright, the ""romance"" is pretty cheesy, but it's a sideline story and does not really affect the main plot.There are a couple of bad words, a few suggestive dialogues, and one somewhat inappropriate scene (it's near the beginning), so the PG-13 rating is probably fair, but don't let it scare you. I've definitely seen a lot worse out of this rating category.And finally, the much-debated conclusion. It is certainly surprising but in a good way; I have no further comment but you should decide for yourself what you think about it.Rewatchability: Unless you were totally disgusted by the conclusion, it's likely possible to watch this movie again when it comes out on DVD to explain everything, and to see the tricks again. However, do NOT read spoilers before seeing it at all, because that would take away all of the fun!At the end, they have certainly set the stage (pun not intended) for a sequel. I personally think it's a one and done enterprise, and a follow-up will only ruin the magic (another ""accidental"" pun), but the film's done well enough at the box office that they might give it a shot, if they can get all of the Horsemen back together. Like I said, though, I really hope that they won't.You will not be bored by this movie. You will not fall asleep. It's got a little bit of everything in it. Will it amaze you with its deep meaning? Not really. You can't look too closely at that, because it doesn't really exist. But it will engage you in its intrigue and attitude. Definitely recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

You'll Believe,"Magic has returned to the silver screen, and it comes in the form of the original (NOT based off of a book; when was the last time that happened?) movie Now You See Me. In this new thriller, four former street magicians (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco) are brought together to pull off the heist of a lifetime, all while putting on a performance that no one will ever forget. When a level-headed woman from Interpol (Mélanie Laurent), a frazzled FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo), and a former entertainer turned magic buster (Morgan Freeman) start to hunt them down, the Four Horsemen must pull out all their tricks in order to elude them, and to be able to perform their greatest spectacle of all.Not only is this film extremely entertaining, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. What is amazing about this movie, is that it perfectly reflects the feelings experienced at a true magic show; the feeling of awe, the questioning of how it is done, the expectation of what will happen next, and the thrill of not being denied the enjoyment of a good, quality, show.There are multiple twists in this movie, yet none of them cause the audience to despise the surprises (unlike the recent disappointment of a good number of movie goers when they met Trevor from Iron Man 3). The story line has an impeccable balance of thrill and comedy, where one moment the atmosphere will be tense during an interrogation, and the next the mind reading member of the group (Harrelson) will start giving a therapy session to the two agents about their relationship, although they just met.There have been many complaints about unanswered questions left by the movie, though perhaps that is the point. Who hasn't left a magic show with a question or two buzzing around in their mind? And can we say . . . sequel? Taking a break from wizards and spells (looking at you, Harry) Now You See Me reintroduces the art of the true magician, and their amazing ability to enchant us with their clever tricks and performances. With a spellbinding cast and mesmerizing storyline, Now You See Me will make you believe in magic once again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
What a fun movie,"I don't know what movie those others were watching, but the one I watched was so good I bought it twice and watched it 4 times. It was fun and kept me on the edge of my seat the first time around the other 3 times I had to catch up some hidden facts that I didn't catch the first time around. I loved it. I loved the twists and turns that occurred regularly. You spend the whole movie trying to figure out just how the tricks were done. I had to look up the list of actors to find out just where I'd seen Mark and it listed the ""Avengers"" movie where he was the ""Hulk"". This is what I would call a sleeper movie. The critics call it a mistake to see and they are totally off point (as usual).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Great movie! Deep meaning and metaphor. Unexpected ending,"I never expected the movie to be this good. Absolutely love the movie, deep meaning, plot twist you will never see it coming. It has a massive hidden agenda - a metaphor. Seriously, the movie is a metaphor itself.Many people will complain that it has a terrible plot, illogical, no character development or no deep meaning behind the story. it's all for a reason (if you can see the reason for it anyway).It make a very clear statement from the start (even on the TRAILER) about ""the closer you look, the less you see"". but many of you will still end up looking too close to see the whole picture, missing the very deep meaning that you been asking for. Dumping on the movie for its stupid storyline and plot holes when it's not.Stop trying to look into detail for a logical explanation or say that the movie is meaningless. IT SAID RIGHT THERE IN THE TRAILER : THE CLOSER YOU LOOK, THE LESS YOU SEERECOMMENDED!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Look too closely and you wont see the big picture!,"""Now you See Me"" is an excellent modern day take at an ""Oceans 11"" style, mastermind type movie. It is also unique in that not many films (that I am aware of) feature the criminals as master magicians and tricksters!Each character uses a specific skill set that aids the team in different ways. For example there is an illusionist, a magician, a trickster/pickpocket and a mentalist. Each character has some development and background throughout the movie, however the character with the most depth would be the FBI agent who chases them around the globe to stop their crimes and arrest them!The scenes where the ""magic"" is performed, is absolutely breathtaking. Thanks to the use of high end CGI sequences, the stunts and tricks are added with just that extra touch of glamour and ""wow"" value. Scenic areas are appropriately chosen and show a diverse visual range.The plot, while as simple as it sounds, also has a few tricks up its sleeve and provides an ample level of depth, obviously not as in depth as a movie you might study in high school English class (like inception or the matrix), but nonetheless it is sufficient. I only found there was one or two parts which i was a tad iffy about.All in all, the movie hits the spot and is a breath of fresh air from sci-fi, action and teen-drama type movies that tend to dominate the screens these days (although I am a fan of several of those)!. The movie is definitely recommended and you probably wont be disappointed!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great entertainment,"Is there anyone who doesn't like good magic show? Few years ago I witnessed one of most amazing magic show at Las Vegas in MGM Grand hotel. Sitting in a theatre at the very first row and wondering all that magic and how it's done just few meters away from my eyes. The magician was David Copperfield and show was pure magic and at the end of the show magician shook hand with all the peoples at the first row. I was sold. Maybe that is the one reason I liked this movie very much. It started at Las Vegas in MGM Grand hotel. This movie is great illusion entertainment, almost perfect. This is visually and fantastic movie. Four magician works together perfectly and Brian Tyler's music full fill excitement. Viewer is constantly derived to think what happens next, just to see that you were wrong. That is why the end of the movie is too annoying and frustration. With better ending it would be perfect for five stars, now we have to acquiesce for four star. It is great entertainment anyway.****",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Interesting take on the con-job theme.,"This is an offbeat movie that approaches the level of excellence but does not quite make it. The story is cleverly developed and the acting excellent but in total the project, although entertaining, just misses the mark. The biggest problem with the movie is the ending, which will not be revealed here. Suffice it to say, however, that it could have been treated better. Also, James Franco, although a wonderful actor, seemed to be not the right actor for the part of the FBI agent, which is the principal character in the story. Not that he does not do a good job with the role, but it seems that the story required a different kind of character than the one played by Franco. As for the rest of the cast, they are excellent. Morgan Freeman again delivers a strong performance and Michael Caine is superb. These wonderful actors, both up in years, defy time. One thing this movie shows is that inside information plus some cleverly staged tricks can produce some interesting results, especially when money is involved.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Now You See Me...Fabulous!,"Now You See Me keeps you guessing the entire time. The real story isn't just about the magicians. It is about a much larger journey. There is a twist at the end that very few will expect...no spoilers, promise! Look at the relationships and the characters as opposed to what they are simply doing. The characters are developed much better than the plot...but it's about them. This is a fun and thoughtful film. It keeps you guessing and when you think you know, you don't. There were a lot of questions, and it is a film that you need to watch...and then watch again to go back and pick up on clues that you didn't catch the first time because you weren't looking for them.

"""Now You See Me"" Demands to be Seen and Savored for a Long Time.","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3.7/5 starsUnabashedly entertaining, relentlessly engrossing, and delightfully mesmerizing. ""Now You See Me"" is the kind of heist film that cockily displays the lighter side of entertainment in the crime genre with oodles of style and chutzpah. But the discerning viewer too gets his share of the pie with the ample twists and turns, which keep you riveted and guessing right till the end - a rare feat to accomplish in movies these days. Boasting of an all star cast, each actor brings forth a unique charm and persona to his/her role.The icing on the cake is the jolting twist at the grand finale, which knocks you spellbound and leaves you with a savory taste in its aftermath. You can't help but yearn for a sequel to this intricately wound tale at the earliest.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Better than The Prestige (Dont read if you like long reviews),"Please note* This a short review, if you don't like short review's do no read. Thank you.I know a lot of people are going to dislike this straight away because of the summary title. But I just want to quickly justify the title(This is only my opinion, Im not forcing it) The reason I liked this a lot more is for one thing, this seemed more believable. Being a small time magician myself I know for a fact everything in this film was possible, unlike The prestige where that went too sci-fi for my liking. Although both films had a great cast, this film just outdid it. Every character was played by very talented actor.Now about the film. I loved mark ruffalo in this movie, he was amazing. Ever since Shutter Island he's been impressing the hell out of me with his performances, for me he stole the show the entire film. Followed by Jesse, he was great too, although he plays the same kind of nerdy character, he was just perfect for this role. Another actor who I thought stood out was Dave Franco, I thought he was great and he's character was really believable. And I loved his act of the film, it was very entertaining. All the cast did great but I don't have time to talk about everyone, but I must say, every actor added something special to this film and It was a pleasure to see them all in one film.Now about the filmography. The directing was good, I bit shaky and quick at times but I got used to it. Because the film is so fast paced,which leads me to the editing. The editing was so sharp, every frame just seemed to fit in great and cut with great timing. Again one reason the film had such a good flowing movement to it. Also the opening scene had great cinematography, its not consistent throughout the film of course, because the film becomes fast paced, but the opening scene was great.The score. Oh my goodness, Im I the only one who thought the music in this film got to repetitive and annoying. Im not sure but for me the music was a downside after a while It got too annoying. Also the whole film does seem to become a bit repetitive, its like you've seen one scene and then its onto to the next scene which is almost identical. Also the film could of answered a few more questions but I suppose it did leave it open for a Sequel and I do kind of the think it adds to the film to make you wonder a little after the credits show. Apart from that I cant find anything really wrong with the film. I thought it was a highly entertaining film, that you can go and watch with your younger brother.So Im going to give Now You See Me, 4 Stars. IMDb rating (8/10)Thank you for reading my review and have a great time watching this movie. :) :)Also please forgive any bad punctuation lol, my writing is not the best.(As you can tell)",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Wow,"Watching this magical movie, I found it both intriguing and mind-blowing. The story line to this movie will keep tricking you and make you think one thing, then make you think another, it's amazing. The actors chosen for this movie, isn't your average group, but they fit the part so well as if the role was made for them, the co-operation between all actors/actresses was perfect and I can't see anything wrong with ""Now You See Me"" as a whole. The movie is another movie that you would have never seen, so you can't expect something like you do in re-makes.

"Izzy, wizzy, let's get busy!","A team of Las Vegas illusionists called The Four Horsemen pull off a series of spectacular heists, donating their ill-gotten gains to their needy audiences.I cannot say that I wasn't entertained to some degree by Now You See Me's sheer preposterousness: I find it hard to completely hate unabashed nonsense on such a grand scale. Clearly, the film's greatest trick was getting the green-light in the first place. I'd like to know how they did that!Ridiculous plot twists abound, countless scenes are left unexplained, and characters conveniently behave exactly as the convoluted plot demands. It's all so far-fetched, and yet played with such seriousness, I was sure there would be an incredibly clever and hugely satisfying pay-off that would make it all worthwhile. Sadly, director Louis Leterrier fails to pull the rug from under the viewer's feet with a mind-blowingly brilliant ending.

Good if you want to feel smarter than you are,"This is the most asinine film that Michael Cane has added to his repertoire and quite frankly hurt my brain to watch. It's lack of explanations to plots, poorly developed characters, and even better, the bad acting, just makes it one of those films that you should try and avoid.Seriously save money and time and do not see this, all of the tricks are poorly explained and not clever at all, the ""tie together"" at the end is stupid and makes little sense, and does not lead to some sort of realization as the writers may have hoped. Here I must also tut in dis contempt to the London Philharmonic for contributing to this insult to film and magic.If you want a magician film, go see, ""The Prestige"" Much better, and a great watch. this however is not. Plus it has Christian bale and Hugh Jackman, the acting is much better.The only reason i rated it a 2 is because I wanted to bring the score down from 7.3. I thought it would be okay by seeing a 7.3.

I was a bit unsure whether we've seen the best parts in the trailer already but luckily this wasn't the case.You get sucked in this movie from the minute it starts. Cool introduction to the main characters and from there it all starts at a nice pace.Jessie Eisenberg is playing very well as an arrogant illusionist, Woody Harrelson is great as a cheating mentalist.
