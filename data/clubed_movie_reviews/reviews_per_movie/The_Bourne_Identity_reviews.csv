What a Spy Movie Should Be Like These Days,"James Bond and Ethan Hunt take notice. ""The Bourne Identity"" is my new standard for contemporary spy thrillers.  Gone (or almost gone) are the special effects that James and Ethan rely on all too heavily. Hell, in those franchises the special effects have virtually replaced story and characters. ""The Bourne Identity"" has a very straightforward story to tell, a mystery that slowly unravels. Spycraft is not all about technical gizmos, but requires human brains and human brawn (and a fair amount of gunplay and car chases).Set in various locales in Switzerland and France during the winter much of the visuals for ""The Bourne Identity"" are gray and damp. That's a plus, Monte Carlo and like locales can get boring. Mat Damon is great as Jason Bourne, fished from the Mediterranean mostly dead by gunshot wounds. A total amnesiac, he slowly realizes that he possesses the deadly skills of a well-trained assassin, and that someone is out to kill him. Franka Potente is equally good as the young woman swept up in his life and forced to run with him. Run or be killed.I can't say enough good things about this movie. Doug Limon, thanks, you did a great job.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Hooray for decent, more realistic spy films!","I have grown extremely tired of the typical formula spy film like Bond, or the juvenile stunt exhibition ""Triple X."" There have been a bare handful of spy films that feature relatively realistic spy thrillers, especially recently with a concentration on spectacular movies that have less substance than cotton candy.Besides ""The Bourne Identity,"" ""Ronin"" is the only other recent spy movie I can think of that didn't feature skydiving, bungie jumping, skiing downhill while shooting innumerable bad guys, laser pens, cars with ejection seats, or silicone breasted women with names you'd be vaguely embarrassed to say in front of your mother. Most of the crap that passes for an espionage film has no plot or reason for existing other than to meet a quota of explosions and cleavage in order to draw the summer action film crowd.While ""Bourne"" does not have a particularly deep plot, it is consistent and focused. The focus is entirely upon Bourne and how he is to deal with having no memory of his past, being hunted without knowing why. Some people have complained about being confused by the movie. I for one, do not need to have everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the first place; the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very sketchy information. If you can't handle a little of that, you probably should stick to Disney films or TV's Scooby Doo where everything is explained in the end. We never find out about what is in the case in ""Ronin"" and I can live without some information being filled in about Bourne's past.To those who have moaned about the incompatibility of the book and the movie, seek help. There are probably several things that work in the book that would either be boring and take too much screen time to explain, or would be viewed as cliche to modern screen audiences. As I remember, I liked the book, and I definitely like this movie. I view any movie adaptation as an interpretation of the book rather than a translation from words to pictures anyway.As for realism, most of the action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets are to be seen, no incredibly lovely models fall madly in bed with Bourne, and the hero shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competance. As someone who has trained in martial arts for over 10 years, unrealistic fight scenes are a pet peeve. The fights in ""Bourne"" are fast, nasty, and very realistic while still being entertaining for the layman. (And yes, taking a gun away from some idiot who is standing well within your striking radius without getting shot is definitely doable, though I had serious doubts until we tested it for ourselves with plastic dart guns in the dojo several years ago).While not being perfect, ""The Bourne Identity"" is, simply put, several grades above the typical spy film. Being focused on an individual level rather than involving itself huge political ramifications lends it another layer of respectability rather than detracting from it as some comments have implied since it remains a human problem on a comprehensible scale. The mysteries that are left are bigger mysteries for Bourne than us, and I think should be viewed as intentional omissions rather than loose ends. The implausibilities are kept to a minimum and the realism to as high a level as possible while still being spectacular enough to meet the expectations of the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Underplayed is Good,"I enjoyed this. It had been one of those movies I had heard about but had never gotten around to. There are times when it seems that Matt Damon is such a cold fish (ala The Good Shepherd), that one has trouble getting connected to him. In this film he is really believable as a man who has all the training of a killing machine, but a soft side that bears exploring. The character is put into situations he can't understand but can only react to. He has compassion but little understanding. What an interesting role. If there's a shortcoming, it's that the motivations of the bad folks aren't all that clear. It's still a delight to watch his relationship with his I-only- need-a-ride partner develop. There is a level of subtlety that most films of this type don't have. The car chases are spectacular but, for once, they backed down on the pyrotechnics. I appreciated this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Surprisingly good and entertaining,"Not that there is any bias intended against the spy film genre, far from it. Nor with films that contain a good deal, or a lot, of action. There are some good, very good even, ones out there. There are also however ones that are too derivative, are basically style over substance (a few not even executing the style particularly well) and favour can-see-it-coming ""thrills"" and ""twists"" and bombastic action over telling a good story.What a pleasant surprise that 'The Bourne Identity' turned out to be. Had heard next to nothing but good things about the Bourne films and had been meaning to check them out for a while, while worrying as to whether they'd be my cup of tea or not. 'The Bourne Identity' not only does what it set out to do very well, with lots of fun and intrigue, but it is also a film that has a brain and respects its audience. It clearly knew what it wanted to be and who to aim it at.Sure, the basic story is not exactly original, occasionally there is a little routine-ness. This doesn't really matter all that much though, because 'The Bourne Identity' succeeded in giving the genre a considerable freshness on the whole. It does lose its way a little towards the end, when things do become a little too cliché and some things could have been explained better and felt less confused. While still doing a good job, Clive Owen did deserve more to do than what he got, a come and go character that disappears too quickly and early.However, visually 'The Bourne Identity' is very slick and stylish, special effects very wisely kept at minimum. Am not always a fan of the camera technique used here but here it added to the intensity and didn't feel that excessive or abused, certainly didn't look amateurish either. A reasonably dynamic soundtrack and authentic sound quality helps too, as does astute direction that keeps everything moving along with confidence.'The Bourne Identity' contains a sharp and well written script that provokes thought, with nothing being confused, rambling or cheesy. The story for much of the length is exciting and has a considerable freshness that is really refreshing. The pacing is relentless, while avoiding the traps of being too hectic or being dull, neither of which it ever is. The action is very well choreographed, confidently performed and keeps one on the edge of their seat.Matt Damon carries the title role with ease, and Franka Potente provides gutsy support, their chemistry to me was believable. Chris Cooper is fun, and while a little too briefly utilised Clive Owen and Brian Cox both do very good jobs.In summary, surprisingly good and entertaining and a very good start to the Bourne films. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Very good spy/action/thriller movie,"Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a highly trained, U.S. spy whose wounded body is found floating in an ocean by a fishing boat. With no memory of who he is and what happened to him, he has to piece together how he came to be shot in the back and left for dead; and most importantly, who and what he is. But Damon must do it fast, as time is running out and the ones he worked for are sending assassins to find him. ""The Bourne Identity"" is top-notch spy movie, filled with action, suspense, and a mystery that is slowly explained as the movie goes on. Matt Damon is well suited for the role, and with the help of fancy editing, he comes off as a martial arts expert who can quickly dispatch multiple foes in a few seconds. The movie moves along very fast, making the near two hour running time feel like it's thirty minutes shorter than it is. Fast pacing and a likable hero (Damon) are two big strengths of this movie that fans of spy/thriller/suspense movies should not miss. My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Bourne Identity"" is the scene when Damon evades the police with an original Mini car! Hey, it's not the car, it's the driver that counts.Mannysmemorablemoviemoment",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Classy entertainment,"Maybe its me, but it gives me a familiar feeling when I see a guy in a turtleneck sweater, an overcoat and a rifle.  I know its a cliche, but why would this movie re-invent the medium anyway?I also like car chases through foreign cities, passports and accents.  So with all that intact, I liked 'The Bourne Identity' very much.  It has all the elements of the genre.  You know what you're getting and you get what you want.There is no point in going over the plot.  It gets confusing about 3/4 in but it does not matter that much.  Its fun for two hours and that's it.I have been a huge fan of Franka Potente since becoming mildly obsessed with 'Run Lola Run' and she does not disappoint.  She has some real chemistry with Matt Damon and has a very sweet, inviting way about her.  She is not traditional leading actress material, thank God, and I credit the producers for hiring her.  Even more so when you realize that Julia Stiles has a small part in this movie.  I am sure someone wanted a bigger 'name' to be Matt's female lead and it might have occured to more than one exec to switch Franka and Julia, but obviously I am glad that did not happen.Clive Owen adds another strong performance to his resume.  He has only one big scene, really, but makes the most of it.  Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are known for their sturdy work and they also deliver here.Excellent, summertime entertainment.  8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Tense, thrilling, and purely entertaining with Matt Damon as the action hero","In 1962, Hollywood introduced British spy James Bond who made an iconic name in the action genre, and the legacy of this household action hero continues today through the longest running film franchise In the 1980s, we were introduced to Bruce Willis' John McClane, a New York cop who served justice as he took a dozen of German terrorists at the Nakatomi Plaza one by one, and his astonishing charisma has lead to a spawn of a few sequels. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is what some describe as just a modern day James Bond. But with a powerful portrayal by Damon, he feels more like an original character, a spy agent with a highly trained set of fighting skills in both gun and hand-to- hand combat. In this spy action thrilled directed by Doug Liman, Matt Damon steps into what is arguably his most charismatic role aside from his Oscar-nominated performance in 'Good Will Hunting'. Damon plays the title character Jason Bourne, a CIA agent who wakes up on a boy after being rescued by a group of fisherman. Suffering from amnesia and covered in bullet wounds, he travels to Switzerland where he uses his old bank account to put together the puzzle pieces of his identity. He is soon assisted by German woman Marie (played by Franka Potente) to search for his identity but soon find himself by hunted down by ruthless assassins by Black Ops agent Alexander Conklin (played by Chris Cooper). Bourne must escape from the vicious criminals while searching for answers to what they want him for.Not very many action flicks offer a spectacular mix of tense action and mystery like this action thriller. From the hyper-kinetic action sequences, to it's slick editing, to the highly compelling plot, to the overall likability of the lead character; this film stops at almost nothing to deliver the strong, visceral experience viewers come to root for. In an age where many films of the action genre struggle to find a solid balance of both action and coherent plot development, this one manages to stand out. The plot moves through the title character's search of his identity and the conspiracy that surrounds, and what ensues is a nice array of tension and unpredictable scenes. The fiercest moments show Jason Bourne engaging in brutal martial arts combat against the baddies, complete with stunning choreography and camera-work that, while a bit shaky, successfully express the intensity of the scenes. One of the most intense moments lies in a beautifully shot staircase shootouts scene. The film definitely has a sweet taste in action, and it delivers quite well especially with Matt Damon who's quite energizing vibrant in the lead role. Franka Potente is also very strong as her character who makes a competent supporting character rather than a typical damsel-in-distress. Praise can also be given to Chris Cooper as the main villain. He may not serve as a memorable antagonist, but that's not the point as the lead character's primary goal is not to capture or kill the villain but to search for the reason why he (the antagonist) trying to take him down.The Bourne Identity is tense, thrilling, and purely entertaining experience for action fans everywhere. This film is easily a household name in Matt Damon's career as well as the action genre of the 2000s. For all looking for a great popcorn flick, this one is worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Excellent spy thriller,"The Bourne Identity is the first film in the hit spy trilogy starring Matt Damon as an apparent ex CIA assassin. It comes off as a slick and smart film, avoiding the usual action clichés and having very intelligent ideas that work. The film is high octane stuff mainly thanks to the interesting premise, excellent performances and superb action set pieces.The plot sees fishermen recover a man's body out at sea with two bullet holes in his back. He is suffering from amnesia and doesn't remember who he was, later discovering his name to be Jason Bourne. A laser device planted in his hip shows him his bank account which is full of money and a gun. Bourne then finds himself hunted by the police and, with the help of a woman named Marie, he searches for answers in Paris which lead all the way to the CIA. The story flows extremely well and has a lot of twists that help in making things more interesting. The general story about Bourne is just an interesting one and you can never really tell where the film is going to end up, which makes it all the more gripping.The cast is exceptional. Matt Damon is excellent as Bourne, perfectly portraying him as confused and conflicted but still very clever. He does a great job of handling the action, intense and emotional scenes with astuteness. Franka Potente is equally good as Marie. She comes off as likable and her normality gives her a realistic edge, she makes for a sensitive and courageous companion for Bourne. Chris Cooper does an incredibly solid job as the CIA man who is tracking Bourne's every move. He shows him as a cold calculating figure without removing all of his humanity. Brian Cox is great as always as the intense Abbott, Cox's sheer presence shows intellect and cunning. Julia Stiles is very good as informer Nicky. Clive Owen is very good too as the stoic assassin the 'Professor'.The action scenes are brilliant. The fights scenes are a lot more realistic than most films, which makes them fast, exciting and surprisingly brutal. The fight with the would-be assassin and the climax in particular are excellently shot. The car chase is a highlight, it just feels naturally gritty while still being a thrilling and entertaining set piece. The characters are well fleshed out which is something most action films miss out on. Bourne is an interesting person and as he finds out more so do the audience, he eventually does feel like a real spy and thanks to Damon's intense portrayal he does appear to be fighting for his life. The same goes for the realism as the characters do come across as somewhat vulnerable. The film itself is shot really well, it captures Paris very beautifully and espionage atmosphere is nicely heavy. Its surprising how well paced it is, it seemingly moves quickly but still has time to add hints of melancholy and emotion to the story itself. It is a brilliant style of relying on story and characters with bursts of action and energy, which harken back to older action films. The score by John Powell is great as it is both nicely moody and rather exhilarating when it needs to be.The Bourne Identity is tense, thrilling and emotive in equal doses as its one of the finest spy films around.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
One of the best spy films around,"This story has been done several times in the past, most recently in ""A Long Kiss Goodnight"". It's also true that Doug Liman and the producers created their own Jason Bourne mythology,since this movie is different in many ways to the book. But the truth is Liman takes an old story and puts a new fast paced spin on it.Matt Damon stars as the enigmatic assassin who just wants to figure out who he is. As he travels from city to city he's followed by CIA agents who want to dispose of him to save their own jobs. He's helped along the way by Marie played by the brilliant Franka Potente. Together they come face to face with the people that want them dead.The cast is great and so is the story. This film should be on everyone's top ten list.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Surprisingly Good - Fans of the Book Will Not Be Let Down!,"Matt Damon is Jason Bourne in the 2002 film `The Bourne Identity,' based on the # 1 best selling novel by Robert Ludlum.The plot goes something like thisA man awakens on a small fishing boat outside France. Bullet-riddled and without memory, he finds himself pursued by mysterious assassins, all the while trying to gain back his memory.I recall first reading `The Bourne Identity.' It was a well-written book. Like the book, the movie is also good. Perhaps it is the excellent cinematography of France  it captured the clichéd images I imagined when I read the book. The acting is surprisingly good, as well. Not many people know that `The Bourne Identity' is the second film to be based on Ludlum's novel (see the TV version starring Jaclyn Smith and Richard Chamberlain from 1988), but the newer 2002 version is much better, and definitely worth wasting your money on.Matt Damon pulls off the character of Jason Bourne with ease, while Franka Potente does not disappoint. Chris Cooper has fun with his role, and a small role by Julia Stiles surprises.There is a great car chase in this film. Fans of the Seventies and Eighties-type genres will love this movie. It has the feel of a classy thriller, and never resorts to stupidity instead smarts, or action instead of plot.Of course many things had to be dropped from the book to make this film. That is only expected. But I'm glad they didn't `butcher' this movie up like some other book-to-film movies.Overall, `The Bourne Identity' is not a great movie, but it sure is good, as well as surprising. Very much so, in fact.4/5 stars -John Ulmer",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Excellent,"I was pleasantly surprised with the Bourne Identity.Very rarely do I get to watch a movie that surpasses my expectations.First of all can I say that there are so many films out there that have the same regurgitated ideas and plot lines.Not many of which have any originality.This however is one of the exceptions thankfully and pleasantly.Centred around a man who gets washed ashore and with no memory.( OK so this has been done before !!) but this movie was original.A selection box of mystery, action and great acting by all concerned.Haven't seen much of Mr Damion I have to admit but he was impressive.The photography ( can I use that term without sounding like a theatre studies student ?) was very good.In fact watching this movie was like watching one of those middle of the night foreign movies in a funny sort of way.However this was much more.In a word this film was ORIGINAL.Well directed and well acted. Good to see a film that doesn't have to rely on spectacular special effects and painted backdrops.This film worked because it worked without any of that.( Now I am waffling)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"""Who pays $20,000 for a ride to Paris?""","Jason Bourne based on the symptoms presenting, is having a conflict unconsciously He's instructed to go and kill somebody In the movie, he is given the diagnosis of selective dissociative amnesiaWhat they did is, they had him forget who he was but they allowed him to continue to remember all the training and the things that he learned over timeDamon's character, Jason, has been trained in self-defense, weapons handling, high-speed driving, disguise, and secret writing communications He knows that he's very attentive, and very observantI really enjoyed the scene in the diner when Jason is telling Marie he doesn't know who he is but he knows that he can name the license plates of all six cars outside, and the clothing that people were wearingMarie's character is very helpful to Bourne's character Based on his unconscious clash of feelings and what he was doing, and being a killer he would've made strenuous efforts to create a new identity if he didn't have a penchant for loveAnd it was his development and his journey into finding the power to feel that was a big part of this movieJason and Marie's love is a not a classic loveIt's definitely a relation of two people who walk next to each other, interact and cross only several times but not all the timeJason is definitely taken by her, by her forcefulness and her vigor as she's very much alive where he isn't, where he feels lacking any strong emotion At that point he was still struggling to try to get his memory backWhen you see the sequel or the two parts together, it makes sense because evidently Jason is still haunted He still has nightmares from things he'd endured While on the contrary, Marie probably is more the active force trying to set up a home for themHe's definitely the one who still feels on the run because he still is under constant restraint",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"The ""Boring"" Identity","I figured this was a can't miss movie. Doug Liman is a great director and it seemed like the cast was pretty strong. However, what a standard, paint by the numbers, average at best, spy thriller. Do we really have to wait two hours for the happy ending that we all know is coming in the end? The scenes of Europe were nice, but hardly enough. Added to the problems of this movie is the fact that Matt Damon is just not that strong of actor, he seems to be void of any real charisma. The guy is plastic and unless you are a 14 year old girl, not worthy of your time. In this movie we get to see him kind of interact with a romantic interest, however it is tacked on and less than steamy. Talk about going through the motions. The bad guys have no redeeming qualities, the good guy is a saint, yata yata. What shocked me was why this movie was getting such high marks, it was ""Ronin"" without the action. Once again, mediocrity is praised as good and good is praised as great. Well, this movie was not great or even that good. Sadly lacking.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Don't watch this movie if you think James Bond is someone who you can meet in real life.,"Next to Ronin, this is one of the best action / spy movies that I've ever seen. I heard a lot of good critics, but didn't know what to think about it. I only saw it 2 years after it first appeared and I'm a little disappointed that I didn't go watch it in the cinema.I'm not too keen on movies like James Bond and other stuff in this genre, but this one is a lot better. Normally you see the ""super hero"" using all kinds of weird gadgets, driving extremely fast sports cars and sleeping with ladies who look more like prostitutes than being normal women.Jason Bourne however doesn't have all this things, which makes this movie a lot more realistic. The fights are fast and very realistic but still entertaining. The action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets, no incredibly willing women sharing his bed... Our hero even shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competence. In the meanwhile he has to deal with amnesia, while being hunted without knowing why. In the end this is still a man which you can identify yourself with.I would say: Go watch it when you are a fan of movies like Ronin, don't watch it if you think James Bond is a person who you can bump into on the streets when going out. Personally I would award this movie with an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Matt Damon Rocks! (I CANNOT BELIEVE I AM SAYING THIS),"`The Bourne Identity' is a superb spy film. Gritty, realistic, suspenseful and surprisingly action-packed. `Bourne' is the kind of spy movie a Bond movie should be, but never is, at least in its entirety. Nearly as convoluted as `Spy Game,' (another great spy film) `Bourne' surpasses it, managing to remain both coherent AND interesting throughout. Lushly photographed,terrifically photographed and choreographed, superbly acted and beautifully scored, `Bourne' is a BIG success, in no small part, to Matt Damon.  Damon is incredibly convincing as an emotional automaton, who one minute oozes schoolboy looks and personal humanity, while in the next effortlessly kills or disables scores of adversaries.  During one such dispatching, Damon utilizes the most incredible stunt I've ever seen, and makes us believe he could do it.The only improvement I could see could have been made to `Bourne' would be a little more explanation regarding the `Treadstone' programming.  What little explanation is provided gets lost in the action and suspense.  Otherwise, this movie is darn near perfect.I can hardly wait to see Damon reprise this role. I just wonder what producers Kennedy/Marshall and director Doug Liman could do to match, much less top this.I hope IMDB members who read my review enjoy this movie as much as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
So Where Are The Good Guys,"The movie reminds me of a Hitchcock thriller. Of course, Hitch filmed during a period of much slower tempo, and would likely have emphasized emotional psychology over slam-bang action. Still, it's a heckuva thriller. Bourne's got more lives than a cat, and he'd better. That's because a secret agency of the US gov't has got him in their sights. Seems the poor guy was an assassin for them, but on one assignment got shot, thrown into the sea, and lost his memory. Now he's trying to find out who he is, but in the process is jeopardizing agency plans for something or other. So now they're using all their techno-wizardry to take him out. It's like banks and banks of blinking circuits on his trail. From Bourne's standpoint, it's like he's up against an entire unseen universe. Good thing he's got as many tricks up his sleeve as the agents tracking him.I guess you could say this isn't exactly a promotional for our covert agencies. Their bureaucrats appear ruthless and unforgiving, especially headman Conklin whose neck is on the line. On the other hand, I think we sympathize more with Bourne than like him, given the bloody trail he leaves behind. Still, I like the way the screenplay eases him into the relationship with Marie, making it more credible. What I do have reservations about is that over-long and incredible car chase. Seems to me that careful use of a less can ironically add up to a significant more, a lesson this sequence needs to apply. Anyway, Damon's persuasive despite his boyish looks, while Potente gets to show her chops and in fairly subtle fashion.All in all, the movie's a white-knuckle two hours. It also registers a popular change in how audiences view our gov't's covert agencies, plus the slimy politicians who pitch for them.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Good and Entertaining, but not great","I saw the Bourne Identity last night (6/4/02) at a special advanced screening in San Francisco.  Matt Damon was introduced at the end of the film and took questions from the audience for about a half hour.I've read Ludlum's book and the movie is very loosely based on it. Essentially this is about a man found floating in the sea, near death from gunshot wounds.  As the man wakes, he has no memory and eventually he finds himself on the run with the aid of a woman he barely knows.  Unlike the book, there is no Carlos, Marie is a gypsy not a banker, and the movie is set almost entirely in ParisI thought the movies was less of a spy thriller than a movie about two people on the run.  There were several lighter moments in the film with Damon and Franka Potente on the run.  Potente is really good and very funny. Chris Cooper (a great character actor) doesn't have the greatest lines, but delivers them quite well.  Julia Stiles is also in this movie, but her role is rather small.  Clive Owen is in the movie as well (not driving a BMW though) and while his role is small, he performs well especially as he talks about his life and sacrifices.I thought this film was good entertainment, but not great.Matt Damon said that he studied martial arts and had weapons training for five months.  He did do most of his own stunts.  Some of the fights scenes were great with an almost Matrix-like super-soldier type attitude.  There is a great stunt near the end of the movie as Bourne makes a move to get down the staircase.The film was shot in Paris and the Czech Republic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Fine little action flick,"I can sympathize with reviewers who had read the book and were disappointed by this film and the liberties it apparently took with the story. I've had that happen with books I've enjoyed and it can spoil a film you might otherwise have liked. I never read the book, so I was able to appreciate this film on its own merits - slick, tough, fast-paced and refreshingly devoid of the kind of nonsense that has made the Bond films harder and harder to sit through.I'm especially impressed by the fights, which, as other reviewers have pointed out, are among the most believable martial-arts-based fight scenes ever seen. No big grand gestures or Olympian kicks - just fast, nasty moves designed to inflict maximum damage with minimum effort.The cast is uniformly good - even Damon, who is no fave of mine, comes across believably as a man who's trained to hold it all in, but isn't sure what it all is that he's holding in. Cooper, Cox and Owen shine in their all-too-brief screen time. Potente is attractive in a real person sort of way (sigh of relief for this genre) and possesses an inner strength that makes her character's actions and reactions ring truer than what we'd get from the traditional Hollywood eye-candy girlfriend these films normally feature.From the gritty bowels of the trawler, where Damon awakens to his situation, to the field where he confronts his most deadly assailant, the locations are the antithesis of the travel poster hotspots that Bond so frequently visits. Despite its breakneck pace (handled so well by Liman and so poorly in the sequel by his protégé), the film manages to convey a sense of melancholy that lifts it a bit above the average action thriller. Sorry book fans - it may not be your cup of Ludlum, but it's still a damn fine little action flick.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The movie that put Matt Damon's career back on track,"Matt Damon had a huge splash on the Hollywood scene in 1997 with Good Will Hunting. But his followup movies like The Talented Mr. Ripley, All the Pretty Horses and The Legend of Bagger Vance failed to captivate both audiences and critics alike. It was this movie that not only made Damon an action movie start but a bankable star in general who started to get offered much better projects afterwards.The story is about a highly trained CIA assassin who while on a mission gets amnesia and then subsequently betrayed by his handlers.After Damon the stunts and the action scenes are the reasons this movie worked so well, along with a great supporting cast with Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, Franka Potente and Brian Cox.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The worst book-adaptation i have ever seen (1.5 out of 5),"I cannot believe what has been made out of, arguably, Ludlum's finest! Not a shred has been left of the original, suspense-filled story. It's unbelievable someone adapted a script from the book this badly! Robert must have turned in his grave at the premiere, I'm sure he'd never allowed this atrocity to happen.The film is just not compelling, not 'gripping' anywhere! The audience never gets involved, which is a very sad outcome for such a promising plot. Unfortunately, the plot's been mangled to a fraction of what could have been. Should have been! I mean, even the main antagonist from the book, the absolute bad guy, the other pivotal character next to Bourne, his nemesis, the one who makes Bourne what he is, is blatantly omitted from the movie. Absolutely INCREDIBLE! A pure disgrace if you ask me. It's like deleting Sauron from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, or cutting Darth Vader from Star Wars!!! (believe me, it's that bad). At best, 10% is left of the original story.Apart from some somewhat entertaining action-sequences, that never get your blood boiling because you're never emotionally attached to the main characters, it's like watching a documentary in fast forward. Not that the acting of Damon or ""Lola"" Potente is that bad, it just seems that every other character was brought in from amateur-night, and the script is even worse. The whole production just screams out: rush-job. As I've read the book 6 times, I came in to see this film with great expectations. Alas, the movie shockingly bored the hell out of me. Utter disappointment and a total rip-off.One advice: read the phenomenal book cycle, forget the awful movie. They're in no way related.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Realistic Spy Movie,"Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is a highly trained assassin, found left for dead at sea. He wakes to find he has no memory of who he is and he needs answers fast if he is to survive the attempts to erase his existence.The Bourne Identity is excellently paced and brings a great deal of realism to the spy genre. The fight sequences are fast and believable, the car chases are accurately choreographed and the character of Jason Bourne is vulnerable and easy to identify with.Matt Damon plays the role with apparent ease, he simply slips into the character and brings him to life.

Maybe a Little Overhyped,"I have tried watching this movie about half a dozen times and I always get bored about 30 minutes in. This time I persevered and it was worth it. Matt Damon does a great job as Jason Bourne, the action is consistently good and the concept is interesting.My biggest problem with the movie is Marie. I just don't care for her character at all. Other than that, I'm curious to see where the franchise goes after this. It is a solid action film but a bit overhyped in my opinion.Best Character: Jason

An Excellent Non-Stop Action Movie,"The crew of a fishing vessel find a body floating in the middle of the ocean. They bring it on board and the improvised 'doctor' finds two bullets on the back and a Swiss bank account implanted in the hip of the body. The 'body' indeed is not dead but unconscious: he is Jason Bourne (Matt Dammon), a CIA secret and very well prepared agent with amnesia. During the period of fishing in the sea, he recovers his health. Once on shore, he decides to go to the Swiss bank and then to the American Consulate. There he meets Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka Potente, from 'Run Lola Run' and 'Anatomy') and they two together will pass to the most spectacular actions along the film. The great Matt Dammon and Franka Potente are perfect. This movie is everything that 'Tripple X' and 'Die Another Day' intended to be and did not offer to the viewer: a non-stop and excellent action film. Fortunately this screenplay was not in the hands of Tom Cruise, otherwise he would like to perform the role of Jason Bourne and spoil this film, as usual. It is amazing the filmography of Matt Dammon. This great actor knows how to select good screenplays. I am not familiarized with the filmography of Franka Potente ( I believe most of them has not been released on VHS or DVD in Brazil), but in 'Run Lola Run' and 'Anatomy' I liked her performance very much. One thing that called my attention along this movie was her perfect accent in English (with the exception of the 'sh....' expressions in German). The great Chris Cooper and Julia Stiles perform secondary roles along this outstanding action movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""A Identidade Bourne"" (""The Bourne Identity"")",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Matt Damon is Jason Bourne!,"I first saw the the Bourne Identity on DVD in the mid 2000s and honestly I didn't enjoy it all that much but that was probably because I was only fifteen years old and I didn't really pay much attention to the story so naturally as the sequels were released I had no interest in them and it wasn't until 2020 that I gave the movie a second chance mainly because I was watching a lot of action movies at the time and the Bourne franchise had always been recommended to me as one of the best spy action movies out there and now that I have watched all the Bourne movies I regret not watching them sooner as I really enjoyed them and have now even started reading the books they are based on by Robert Ludlum.The Bourne Identity is about a man who is found and rescued by a passing fishing boat in the middle of the ocean with bullet holes in his back on the brink of death after being saved he wakes up with no memory of who he is or where he came from his only clue is a tiny laser pointer/projector that's found embedded in his hip which projects text of a bank address and a safety deposit box number when the boat reaches shore he is given enough money by the fishing crew who saved his life to make it to the bank and hopefully discover his identity but he soon begins to realise that maybe it's better to forget his past than uncover the truth behind who he is.Matt Damon gives an excellent performance as Jason Bourne really bringing to life Ludlums classic character Damons performance would be one of the most memorable in his career and he would return to play the character again four more times each time being just a memorable and action packed as this one.This is one of the best spy, action movie franchises out there along with other classics in the genre like the Bond movies the action scenes are well done and are done with practical effects that give the movie a more realistic and unique feel with a story that's both interesting and thought provoking keeping you on the edge of your seat.I highly recommend watching this movie if your a fan of stylish action movies that give you an enjoyable story with great characters and awsome fight scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The only things preserved from the book are a few names,"As far as a shoot-um-up with the obligatory car chase goes, this movie did it quite well. And like many of the other ""1984"" (book by George Orwell in which to satisfy the proletariat they had a machine mass-produce formula pulp fiction) type machines churned out films for the proletariat, the title and a few names bare the only resemblance to the Ludlum story. Quite a few of the characters that give this story depth and mystery are left out of the movie completely.Fortunately or unfortunately, it is easy to get wrapped up in technology as assume that high definition (HD) or even 3D is going to take the place of the missing character Carlos and the in-depth search for his real identity.Now let's not compare this quickie in shoot-up land with the well thought out book ""The Bourne Identity"" by Robert Ludlum or the much better portrait of the story portrayed in the Mini-Series ""The Bourne Identity"" (1988) starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith; then we can enjoy what is left.A sailor on a fishing trawler spots a human body in the water. After retrieving it we find it is alive. Helping this stranger back from the near-dead we find a couple of bullet holes and a mysterious capsule under his skin. The capsule displays what the fisherman recognizes immediately as a Swiss bank account. The man can not remember who he is.

The Damon Identity,"""so what's the film about"" ""well its about this guy who is a secret agent and he loses his memory"" ""so how are you going to establish his character and make people identify with him"" ""we'll have matt damon play him"" ""oh good, well we wont worry about making him an actualy character then""and this sums up one of two major problems with this film. one is that it is totally about it being matt damon. jason bourne is not an individual, he is matt damon. now i dont have a probably with damon, i think he can be a fine actor, but there was no discernable writing in regards to his character. i was left feeling more for one of the assasians who is sent after him and was only in the film for 5 minutes than i was for the two main characters. it meant that one got to the end of the film and asked why? followed by who cares. the second problem was that the director seemed to be going for an old fashioned 70s spy film feel, the kind were lots of talking happens and then there is a 5 second fight scene and we then cut back to exotic locales and lots of talking with exotic women and tough men. except the director had no idea of how to achieve this, so the film just dragged on interminably, leaving the viewer wondering when something was actually going to happen. it never did. 1 out of 10 thouroughly average",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Best Non-Bond Bond Film,"The best Bond film that isn't a Bond film. If they gave James Bond amnesia and let him kick all sorts of a** on anyone coming after him, you'd get this edge-of-your-seat thriller. Matt Damon is excellent as the assassin turned memory-lapsed protagonist who is trying to piece together who he is while trying to avoid multiple factions who are working to take him out before he solves the puzzle. There's spy intrigue, politics, lots of action and a fair amount of violence, a dark governmental department overseer, more assassins and a romantic entanglement, all in just under 2 hours.

The way the film starts get you wondering.The crew and cast must have did a lot of research in psychology because they really dig into the psychological of the human mind for a spy film.The cast of Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Brian Cox made the film really interesting. along with other cast members like Julia Stiles Their performances in the film help makes the characters important without a good cast you can't make a film serious and believe me this film is more than serious enough to hold your interestingPlus the action and stunts in the film really get you on the edge of your seat It did for everyone in the theater and still does on DVD which I owned.It's just amazing how well they dig into the psychology of the human mind this film takes a departure from the Bond films nothing wrong with them but Bourne does a lot more than just be an action movie which it is still but it more to it.The Bourne Identity is unlike many spy movies as this one make for a good mix of psychology and action which makes it quite the filmWith a good cast, tense action and a character driven story this is a movie you should check outI give The Bourne Identity an 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A very good spy movie,"There aren't too many spy movies like this, in which the hero is not the James Bond type who's going to save the world from the ultimate super-villain.Matt Damon portrays Jason Bourne (one of his many identities), a regular guy who lost his memory and is about to discover he's a genuine lethal weapon. He fights not to prevent the villain to take over the world, but to regain his memory, to find out his true identity and, in the process, change his previous way of life. All he has to do now is avoid the other agents trained like himself trying to eliminate him.I liked this movie very much. The addition of Franka Potente to it was a really nice plus. And seeing the whole story staged in Europe was a very nice change from L.A. and New York. But the main reason I liked it so much is Matt Damon's performance. He's one the rightful heirs of future Hollywood. He's shown that he can play any character convincingly, even when the role is a Van Damme type of character.The action is good, the suspense is good, the chasings are good, the performances are good.

A Decent Action-Flick But Little to Do with the Novel: Where was Carlos?,"A major part of the plot of the original novel is the little-seen but ever-present assassin Carlos. Carlos is the invisible baddie of the story. During much of the novel, Carlos and Jason Bourne are playing a kind of chess match for assassins, which makes the original novel a cut-above most novels of this type. For reasons not exactly clear to me, the filmmakers cut the entire Carlos side of the novel from this screenplay.The biggest weakness of this movie is that because of the axing of Carlos, the main antagonist of the story is the US operation Treadstone. Yes Treadstone is in the book and at one point the top brass are trying to get Bourne. In the novel, many factions are after Bourne, but in the movie, it's only Treadstone.Also the joining forces of Jason and Marie has a lot more drama than in the movie. Instead, their linking up is a bit conventional but then her decision to stay with Bourne really makes little sense. In the novel Marie has a very real reason to stay with Bourne.Ultimately a decent but not entirely satisfying adaption of Ludlum's brilliant novel into an ""okay"" but not great movie. And the ending is entirely different. A one-watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A 1970's throwback...well done,"For starters, let me say that I have partially read the novel that this movie is based on (published in the 1980's) and found it a sometimes tough, boring slog. The only reason I picked it up to begin with is because I saw the TV Movie in 1988 with Richard Chamberlain. It was the beginning of my understanding that books and movies, by their very natures, are completely different animals. As for this version of ""The Bourne Identity""...well, I wasn't expecting much (though I was intrigued by certain ivory-tower critics who gave this film a second look when it hit DVD and decided that maybe it wasn't so bad). If I was moderately entertained, I'd have called it a success. But I was suprised.For all its occassional hi-tech trappings, this film reminded me, more than anything, of 1975's ""Three Days of the Condor"" with Robert Redford and Max Von Sydow (anyone who liked ""The Bourne Identity"" needs to see it immediately if they haven't already). It's geared to entertaining the over-18 crowd as opposed to the usual adolescent thrill-seekers most modern action films pander to. There's gunplay, but nothing so overblown as ten thousand bullets for one shoot-out (the cat-and-mouse game outside the farmhouse comes to mind). There's martial-arts (a lesser-known style called Kali), but no wire-fu for once. And, lest we forget, there's one of the best car-chase sequences in recent memory through Paris (who'd have thunk that a Yugo could make such a good getaway vehicle?).But these are general elements. Specific details that brought back ""Condor"" memories are as follows:--Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. Like Redford's low-level researcher, he plays a man stuck in a situation that he has no idea how he got into and even less of an idea of who's aiming the bullets at him. But it's not quite one-for-one. Redford didn't have anything to fall back on aside from his experience in the Army and Ma Bell. His ignorance is based on his rank in the CIA hiearchy. Bourne, on the other hand, speaks multiple languages, has formidible fighting skills, and is one of the brightest tacticians I've ever seen on the silver screen. But he has absolutely no clue as to how he is able to do what he does. It's all just instinct and reaction. The frustrating conundrum for him (a fact that is made very clear in the initial sequences when his skills come into play) is that, in spite of these advantages, the unknown past may have already doomed his future.--Franka Potente as Marie Kruetz. Potente's role is more of a bohemian version of Faye Dunaway's character in ""Condor"" than anything else. But again, there are key differences. Redford forced Dunaway to cooperate at gunpoint, only coming over to his side with great reluctance. Kruetz is made of sterner stuff, as one would expect from a lifetime on the road. Bourne uses that other great persuader, money, to get what he needs from Kruetz and actually gives her the option of getting out while the getting is still good. Their eventual sleeping together even feels a bit less forced than the similar setup in ""Condor"" (a particularly novel touch about the inevitable morning after scene is the fact that Bourne is already up, dressed, and has wiped every surface in the room). The relationship is really the heart of the movie. Without it, most of the story is just not there.--Clive Owen as the Professor. While I'm a trifle disappointed that Owen didn't get more to do with this role (unlike most folks, who discovered his obvious talent in ""Croupier"", I first saw him prove his acting chops in the video clips for the old adventure game, ""Privateer 2: The Darkening""), his smoky, grey presence brings to mind Max Von Sydow's cultured assasin in ""Condor""(even the ""Professor"" moniker seems to hint at such a connection). Like Bourne, he's a killing machine, as impersonal and scary as a fully loaded AK-47 to the head (the scene where he pops into pick up his info from Julia Stiles illustrates this beautifully). The only real difference between him and Bourne is the fact that he knows the answers to the questions Bourne has been asking. That he doesn't mind answering them after being bested calls to mind Von Sydow's killing of Redford's quarry and then politely suggesting an extended vacation in Europe when they both walk outside. A baddie who isn't really a baddie...what a concept, huh?Without giving too much away, I thought that the final twist on what put Bourne out in the middle of the Mediterranean to be both logical and even believable, given everything that came before. This would seem to suggest the influence of John Woo (but only in the arena of character development, something particularly stressed in ""The Killer"" and the ""A Better Tomorrow"" films). It's basic plot logic: set up the story in such a way that, when the final suprise twist comes through, it doesn't feel like a deus ex machina so much as a reasonable conclusion.I honestly hope that this film is the start of a trend in the action genre. Just because most action movies are the cinematic equivalent of junk food doesn't mean they have to be. What's wrong with a little fillet mignon?",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

He confronts his enemies in order to find out his situation and is forced to take up violent means to survive . There takes place a twisted plot that seems to be involved the C.I.A cell Treadstone (it is inspired by the real life secret C.I.A cell 'The Enterprise', which organised the Iran-Contra affair) and led by secret agents Ward Abbott (Brian Cox , his character is based on Oliver North) and Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper , his role is based on Robert McFarlane) .This nail-biting flick contains suspense , thrills , frenetic action, shootouts and violent fights in which our hero is pursued around the world in a relentless chase . From start to finish the noisy action and fast movement is unstopped . This is an expansion of the universe from Robert Ludlum's novels, centered on a new hero whose stakes have been triggered by the exciting events . The Ludlum's novel have also spawned a television series and several more books . However , screenwriter Tony Gilroy , at Doug Liman's instruction, did not read the ""Bourne Identity"" novel ; instead, he worked solely from an outline prepared by Liman . In fact , the film has almost nothing to do with the original novel . This is the only film in the Bourne series with any resemblance to the plot of the book it's purportedly based on, and it's a very loose adaptation , all other movies in the series are original screenplays that use only the titles of novels by Robert Ludlum . In the book The Bourne Identity , the main bad guy is a real life criminal genius, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez of Venezuela, better known as Carlos the Jackal . Matt Damon's acting as a hard-rock , two-fisted without identity agent is top-notch . Franka Potente is nice as a young who helps Jason . Both of whom carry out dangerous action scenes . Very good support cast plenty of familiar faces such as Chris Cooper , Clive Owen , Brian Cox , Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje , Gabriel Mann , Walton Goggins , Josh Hamilton , Tim Dutton , Julia Stiles , among others . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Oliver Wood . Rousing musical score fitting to action by John Powell .The motion picture lavishly produced by Frank Marshall was professionally realized by Doug Liman . Other films of this exciting saga are the followings : The first was a 1988 television mini-series titled ¨The Bourne identity¨ by Roger Young in which Jason washes ashore in a small French town , starred by Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith co-stars . This ¨The Bourne Identity¨ (2002) , followed by ¨Bourne supremacy¨ (2004) by Paul Greengrass ; ¨Bourne ultimatum¨ by Paul Greengrass with screenplay by Tony Gilroy .

Very Good Stuff,"Got to see this film today and I have to say that I liked it very much.  It is not the best spy film ever made and the material seemed like I had seen something like it before.  But having said that, the thing I really liked about it was that I cared for the characters and how often can you say that these days (Attack of the Clones,case in point). Matt Damon and Franka Potente were great.  I never liked Matt Damon before, maybe because he is a Red Sox fan and I am from NY, but in this movie he was very good. Even all the supporting players were good, but very under used, like Julia Stiles and Clive Owen. (Clive Owen is great, why this guy can't get some good roles is beyond me.) But the thing that topped it all off for me was the great action shots all over Europe.  That was great.  The movie had the feel of ""The Professional"" but shot in Europe.

Action/Suspense minus the suspense,"I read Robert Ludlum's obit in the Economist and so had to read one of his books. I picked the Bourne Identity. The Economist was right: Ludlum was an awful writer who did brilliant plotting. You stay up to three a.m. to get to the last page.The Bourne Identity uses a sure-fire hook: a man fished out of the sea with a load of bullets in his carcass, minor brain damage, and no memory. There are only a few clues to whom he might be--a numbered Swiss bank account, heavy-duty martial skills, espionage instincts, etc.And he's got nothing. No money, no ID, nothing. And excellent reasons to believe someone stills wants him dead. And he suffers terrible migraines. And flashbacks. Did I mention flashbacks? So right away, you're pulling for him. He re-enters the world, living by his wits.Crucially, you are a long way into the book before the truth starts to emerge. But even then, it is murky. The CIA, the Vietnam war, international terrorism, etc. Clearly, he was involved in something big and nasty.Not so with this movie. Almost immediately, you see the US government connection. Good-bye suspense.And good-bye human interest. In the book, Jason is tortured ad nauseam--as is the reader by Ludlum's prose--by the question of just what kind of person he really is. It's barely there in the movie. The same for character depth. You really don't end up caring much about Jason, Marie, anybody.In the book, Marie is forced to join him, against her will. With time, she becomes his ally, adding her own valuable skills and knowledge to help Jason survive and triumph. In the movie, Marie is merely this lost, clueless ""gypsy"".I don't know anything about the director, but can't help getting the impression that he came up doing rock videos and TV commercials. The camera work is very edgy. It is meant to look hip. And now they let him do a real movie. Bad decision.The action stuff is very good. All the chases and fights.The actors were quite good. Matt Damon is wasted in something like this.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The man who knew too much...except who he was...,"Now this is a movie that follows the 'spy thriller' guidelines to the letter.Nothing is missing. A hero in the middle of a worldwide secret conspiracy? Check. Rivaling secret organizations? Check. Skillful martial arts fighting? Check. Improbable and yet heart-pounding car chases with a cool-looking chased vehicle? Check. Speaking of vehicles, a romantic one for the hero? Check too. Cold European locations? Check. And so forth.If it's a genre that's been hard to reinvent since the 'James Bond' movies, it's still one capable to furnish a few little gems. ""The Bourne Identity"", directed by Doug Liman, obviously follows the ""Bond"" legacy (notice the hero's acronym) but it does so in a way that never fails to entertain even the least likely to be surprised fans. Maybe because it didn't try to surprise.Indeed, instead of going to the 'prestige' road and try to pretend to be smarter than many James Bond film (which 'James Bond' new movies tend to do actually), Liman trusts his material and manages to make a decent and promising thriller, good enough to become the first installment of a successful series. And he lets the script, based on Robert Ludlum's novel, reveals its little tricks, starting with the two novelties in the lead characters.Matt Damon, still looking young enough to pass as Will Hunting, is Jason Bourne, a young man looking for his true identity, and Franka Potente, the ""Run, Lola"" girl is Marie, the outsider who finds himself taken in that adventure more or less against her own will. There's a reason for her script in the story, but as far as the film's concerned, we know it's necessary for the hero to have someone to talk to, and Potente always finds the right tone. She's not excited, she's shocked and nauseous about violence but she's intrigued enough by Bourne to trust him and follow him.I know it's tempting to say that the mystery is the reason why the film is capable to hook us, but Bourne's dissociative amnesia isn't exactly a riddle for the ages and there are enough hints about his secret (fighting skills, language fluency...) to figure out that he's not a coal miner. When at the opening, he's fished by Italian boatmen, riddled with bullets and without any memory, I figured it was because of a mental treatment (à la Ludovico) and he was probably a secret agent whose mind might have been brainwashed one bit too many, but the film comes up with a rather simpler explication for the amnesia, so simple that I actually liked it.It reminded me of that moment where Jason gives a detailed but rather complicated plan to Marie in order to gain information about hotel customers and at the end, all she had to do was asking politely. This is a film that has enough self-awareness to never pretend to play it smarter than its audience and till the end, no spectacular twist comes up trying to wow us, nor any overly long climax. In fact, there's no big reveal, we suspect for a long time who Bourne was, the trick isn't to figure out who he is, but just enjoy the the cat-and-mouse chase with the CIA and a few gunmen.On that level, the film isn't overcrowded but what is there is quality. Brian Cox is the CIA Deputy Agent (I guess he'll have a bigger role in the next films) Chris Cooper is Conklin, the man who wants to get a hand on Bourne after an apparent failure during a black operation named ""Treadtstone"" and their climactic confrontation is one of the film's greatest moments. Now, I have to give accolades to Clive Owen who, with less than ten minutes of screen-time and only a few lines, steals the show as the cold ""Professor"". Seriously, any actor with the right physique could play the emotionless killer but Owen has a brief exchange with Damon where he injects his own emotionality, and proves that after all, they're still humans with emotion and maybe they don't enjoy it that much. Maybe that's the key of the ""Bourne"" film, something I'm beginning to like, people don't enjoy what they do but they have to.Bourne wants to identity until he's having second thoughts about it, but he must escape from his tormentors if he wants to start a new life. Marie doesn't want to follow him and jeopardize her life (or her relatives) but she doesn't feel too hot about leaving him either. Cox' character must answer for a failed job and Cooper's Conklin must get the responsible and punish him accordingly. all about jobs getting done and hierarchical strata. And while James Bond seems to enjoy what he does, Bourne is just going into a direction he's forced in and the real shift occurs when he understands he must be the one calling the cards. And even then, he never acts as if it's fun to have all these skills but he's got them and that's what matters.And that might be what works in the film, it has great special effects, unlikely fighting moves, amusing and thrilling stunts, suspenseful confrontations, and they're all played with the right dose of seriousness and self-awareness, allowing to establish two-and-half dimensional characters for the next installments. In fact, what we get is a well-made thriller, so well I was wondering what would be the harder to believe, the falling from the stairs with enough time to shoot a villain between the eyes or that such a film wouldn't get a sequel",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Grounded, well-paced spy thriller with slow-release plot delivery","A thoroughly believable action movie with a mystery element: who is Jason Bourne? A journey of discovery gives the story structure to which each component is related making it interesting and credible. The action, though sometimes stretching credulity, we discover, is based on a component of the plot which makes it internally consistent. Each of the characters behaves logically with their own internal motivation and understanding of the situation.The violence is there, but it is a story about relationships, betrayal and redemption. The chemistry between Matt Damon (Bourne) and Franka Potenta (Marie) is as palpable as it is understated so the development is tenable. Each member of the cast feels betrayed at some point and none of them feel like a betrayer as they operate honourably from their viewpoint.

A rousing mix of action and intrigue.,"Previously filmed as a TV miniseries in the 1980s, Robert Ludlums' spy thriller ""The Bourne Identity"" gets re-imagined for the movie audiences of the 21st century, and it's a refreshingly more human look at a well worn genre, giving us a hero who's believable at all times; he may become a standard action hero in some scenes, yet has the appeal of an average Joe; Matt Damon delivers a creditable performance in this role. At the start of this story, he's fished out of the Mediterranean Sea with two bullet holes in his back and no memory of who he is. Soon he's forced to take it on the lam, as his CIA superiors back home are determined to put closure on his botched mission. Fortunately he manages to hook up with a young woman, Marie (Franka Potente of ""Run Lola Run"") who is able to provide him with some all important transportation. The action scenes are stylishly staged, but never overwhelm the meaty story which gets a respectful adaptation thanks to screenwriters Tony Gilroy & W. Blake Herron, director Doug Liman, and a talented cast and crew. They just hook you right in with an impressive atmospheric opening and slowly but surely begin to crank up the tension. Fine use is made of various international locations and the widescreen cinematography (by Oliver Wood) is excellent. Damon is fun to watch in the lead; even though his character may be in the dark for the balance of the movie, he always shows himself able to adapt to different situations and to sense when danger is near. He shares a good chemistry with German star Potente, who's very appealing and as sexy as any ""Bond girl"" in the James Bond franchise. Also in the excellent cast are Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Walton Goggins, and Julia Stiles, although Clive Owen is kind of wasted as a professional assassin dubbed The Professor; his is an intriguing character who disappears from the story a little too soon. Many riveting scenes, including one where Bourne is kind of making like Spider-Man during an escape attempt and a lively car chase sequence. Even at 119 minutes, this never feels as long as it is as Damon, Liman, and company keep you watching and engrossed the entire time. All in all, this can stand up very well against any James Bond series entry or other spy film of old; it's got enough vitality and solid story telling to make it pleasant viewing. Executive produced by Ludlum, and followed by ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"". Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
High tension and fast-energy action thriller!,"This is a high tension and fast-energy action thriller, where Matt Damon plays an amnesia-plagued man who was picked up at sea by a passing fishing boat. While he tries to regain his memory, he suddenly finds himself possessing extreme knowledge and quick action skills, as well as alluding a bunch of pursuing assassins.Filmed in Europe, the film picks up steam almost immediately where the man, Jason Bourne, is found floating at sea and then finds himself being pursued by the German police, followed by an exciting cat and mouse chase at the U.S. Embassy. What follows is one suspenseful scene after the other, as Jason struggles to find his identity and as the reason of the plot to assassinate him (with the U.S. Government thrown into the mix) remaining ambiguous throughout much of the film, creating a mind-numbing sense of mystery and intrigue.The action scenes, from the car chases to the gun fights, are thrilling, and the acting is pretty good, especially that of Matt Damon and Franka Potente. Julia Stiles and Clive Owen were a treat to have in the film, but they were underused, and Chris Cooper was villainous, yet a little wooden. In addition, the visual effects were terrific (loved the scenes of the European cities) and the music score was quite catchy.Overall, this movie has an unpredictable story and gives you an edge-of-your-seat excitement, leading to a very entertaining feature.Grade A",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Boring movie,"This is a movie where lines between simple movie and reality might be blurred. There are some movies that are based on fact or hits close enough to home, that it makes people who were actually in those situations cringe. This movie might be one of them.This movie to Matt Damon is like what ""Matrix"" was for Kianuu Reeves. Matt Damon made good movies, but this might be his defining role. Mind controlled super agent finds himself lost in Gernany without memory of who he is or why he's there. The story runs very close to the declassified MK ULTRA program that US government was conducting to create super soldiers. In fact one of the soldiers that came out of this program says he can't watch this movie because it disturbs him too much.The movie is Luke warm interesting, and the believability of Matt Damon as a super soldier is very low. So while this movie may hit close to home for some, it doesn't hit me at all. In fact it was kind of boring, and is not recommended for viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The movie has everything you can expect from an action film,"There are a lot of movies where the C.I.A is it's principal theme, but this one is the best I've ever seen about it so far. I didn't know about this trilogy until 2010. I said ""Whatever, people is talking very well about this one, lets give it a shot"". What can I say? It was not a waste of time! The first time I saw it, couldn't wait for the part 2, I just became a big fan of Matt Damon. The movie has everything, drama, action, good acting and a great history. Damon is the only one who can be a Jason Bourne in my opinion, his character is so smart but not so brilliant like a Jet Li. You will see a realistic movie in all it's senses, even the fights have realism. But remember this is not all about fighting, shooting enemies or killing people like a crazy man, this is a different movie you will enjoy for sure. If you are looking for a man who kills everyone just because he wants to, I recommend you to not watch this movie.

James Bond on a budget,"I remember how I loved The Bourne Identity when it first came out, the plot, the action, I thought everything was great about this film was riveting but then I saw it again and I dozed off for a little bit.The film doesn't really holds up today but weirdly enough the plot and the action is style good. The fight scenes and the stunts are still impressive today but the sound effects are kinda bad, it actually put me off of the fight scenes this time around. How come punches sounded like that in movies back then? And how the hell was I OK with it? It took me out of the story and I struggled to get back in it.As distracting as the sound effects are in the film, The Bourne Identity has a good cast, Matt Damon is amazing in that role, completely believable as this amnesiac dude who knows all of these thing. The story is simple but efficient as are the action scenes. It has a James Bondsy flavor, that is if James Bond was on a budget, which gives a gritty, realistic feel to the movie.The Bourne Identity has its quirks but it's a rather entertaining film.By @Wornoutspines",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"This movie is horrible.  Matt Damon does not fit the role of Jason Bourne.

The scenery was spectacular at all locations while the performance of Matt Damon was really good - he was excellent in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and he followed that up extremely well here.  The supporting cast of all relative unknowns did first-class jobs.  This is a classic case of where it was better to see the Film after having read the Book.

Bourne tastic,I really enjoyed the first outing of Bourne. I think it was a coming of age film for Matt Damon and although it isn't his best performance he did prove the doubters wrong. Personally my favourite of the trilogy as the web unfolds and the plot thickens the pace of this action packed thriller just goes from strength to strength. I enjoyed watching the original TV series and thought the movie did a good oh of transferring it to the big screen. I enjoyed how the character unfolds and his balance of emotion and anger are ignited through his confusion. Enough is covered in this opening movie to give you the taste for wanting more but not leaving you bemused. The supporting cast do a decent enough job of carrying Damon through the scenes and even a heavyweight pitches in (Clive Owen)'to lend a supporting hand. Damon almost reminds me of an insomniac 007'but maybe with less suave about him. All in all a good effort and full marks for keeping me entertained. Damon proving himself and making sure that the likes of good will hunting were not just a fluke! The other two movies fit in perfectly and make the whole 3 parts one it satisfying meal of a movie.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Action is Bourne!,"This movie has become my favorite spy/assassin movie of all time.  The first time I saw it I thought it was very good but not great.  Wrong.  This movie kicks so much a$$ it's ridiculous.  I think you just have to watch it a few times before it sinks in.  The acting was great, car chases were killer, plenty of shooting to keep you entertained, and a cool storyline to follow and keep you in suspense.  Matt Damon is Jason Bourne, rescued by Greek fishermen 30 miles off the coast of France with two bullets imbedded in his back, he has no memory of his life or what happened to him.  He soon discovers when he reaches land that a secret U.S. government agency called Treadstone knows he is alive and is trying to eliminate him.  He must elude his pursuers across Europe and discover his identity with the help of a woman he hardly knows (Franka Potente) before it is too late and they kill him and her.  Based on the best selling novel by the late Robert Ludlum, I have heard that the writers took some liberties when they created the screenplay but since when is that bad thing when you do a good job.  The casting was excellent and the locations fantastic, one of the higher points often touched upon in other reviews.  Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are poster boys for bureaucrats gone bad and Julia Stiles does well in her limited role.  Clive Owen is devilish as The Professor one of the hitmen assigned to kill Jason Bourne.  I never would have considered Matt Damon of all people as a legitimate action star but he sure can surprise you time and time again.  He has definitely eclipsed buddy Ben Affleck in terms of box office draw AND acting.  This one put him on the map as a leading man and sensational new star.  Engrossing from start to finish.  Followed by the sequel The Bourne Supremacy.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"I expected more from this movie, but it was still able to entertain me.","I was attracted to this action film by the hope of seeing something that went a little beyond the simple and common ""run, shoot, kill and jump"" of films like this. The basic premise, a man in search of his own identity, could allow the script to have some mystery that would sweeten this recipe and make the film more interesting. However, after seeing the film, I feel that this is not exactly what I found and the film took little advantage of this idea.The script starts off well, as I said: a man wakes up not knowing who he is, but quickly starts behaving like a ""killing machine"". It's instinctual. It becomes evident to us there that he was, or is, a professional killer hired by someone. Furthermore, it remains to be seen what the details of his story will be, and it is this quest that leads the film, from one pursuit to another until the end. The problem with this movie really starts with a sparse script: the man doesn't know who he is and everyone wants to kill him, so he has to flee almost the entire movie, between gunfire and bombs. It's simple, and it's tiring.Matt Damon achieved, with this film and its sequels, a consecration as an actor that is deserved, albeit uninteresting. He is a good actor, but in this film he was far from his potential and the film, due to its characteristics, does not favor the work of an actor who wants to stand out for the quality of his dramatic interpretation. Still, the film gives him enough to do a satisfying job, and still allows to some supporting actors a certain leeway to show talent. This is the case of Franka Potente, Clive Owen and Chris Cooper. The rest of the cast shows up just because they have to and doesn't stand out.Technically, the film has many positive and well-developed aspects. Being a pure action film, there are high production values and a lot of money invested in great and quality effects. Gunshots, explosions, smashed cars, things that explode, fake blood, the film is a godsend for the visual, special and sound effects team. The work of action stunts is also important and worthwhile. Cinematography takes a back seat, with discreet but competent work, and the soundtrack, by John Powell, plays its part, with an especially good and striking song in the end credits: ""Extreme Ways"", by Moby.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
What's my name again?,"Smart, fresh, exuberant, and creative. There are so many good things to say about ""The Bourne Identity."" Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, an assassin for the Central Intelligence Agency with no knowledge of who he is, due to an assassination attempt gone awry. With a severe case of amnesia, a boat load of nightmares, and a constant headache, Bourne searches to find out who he is and where he came from to piece his life together. Matt Damon, fresh off the box-office flop ""Rounders,"" a film I certainly enjoyed, brings his acting skills to another level, in a role which no one believed he was capable of playing. Franka Potente, a phenomenal German actress and a basic unknown to American cinema, comes off her role in ""Run Lola Run"" to plays the damsel-in-distress and love interest/confidant to Bourne, Marie-Helena Kreutz. The sparks fly and there is definite chemistry between Damon and Potente. Chris Owen, Brian Cox, Chris Cooper, and Julia Styles all play minor yet gigantic roles as CIA top dogs and operatives. If you want to rent an original action movie and you are interested in seeing ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" you should not wait another minute before renting or buying this explosive film. ****1/2 of 5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Better than the average...,"THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a pure and straightforward action thriller with solid writing and acting; no more, no less. It is superior to most films that fall in this genre because it manages to stay away from most of the worn-out action clichés, while focusing more on character/plot development and exposition than the action sequences.Doug Liman and Tony Gilroy have created a fresh action thriller with THE BOURNE IDENTITY; one that will entertain many viewers without feeling stale or overstaying its welcome. The acting is pretty top-notch, with Matt Damon's emotionless and laid-back approach to his character a welcome one in a genre dominated by overacting or poor acting. Chris Cooper and Franka Potente play their supporting roles well, and Potente adds a nice contrast to Damon's Bourne. Clive Owen has a brief cameo that is worth mentioning.So what about the action? Well, there is an obligatory car chase that gets a bit old after the first two or three minutes or so. Frankly, I don't see why these pointless scenes have become a requisite for the genre. This chase adds nothing that viewers haven't seen before, and didn't really have to be that long. The fight sequences are worth watching, and many of them involve some sleek hand-to-hand combat, which are thankfully well-edited and choreographed. But the real selling point is not the action, but the screenplay (as written by Tony Gilroy) which keeps the more intellectual viewers on edge trying to figure out Bourne's identity. The exposition is well-written and doesn't come out of the blue. Again, top marks for writing; something that is usually absent in action thrillers.The editing is crisp and clean, making the movie-going experience worthwhile. I decided to mention this because most action movies have dreadful editing, to the point where the action sequences seem blurry and nauseating. The music in this film is also worth mentioning, as it contains a modern upbeat feel that suits the movie well.A final note about Jason Bourne's past: it is worth noting that screenplays that encourage viewers to root for a character with a shady past/present are usually frowned upon by many 'upstanding citizens'. I bring to mind the recent controversy surrounding the popularity of Showtime's DEXTER series. I was impressed by Gilroy's ability to write the past Bourne as different from the present Bourne due to the amnesia. It should at lest keep these 'concerned' folks quiet.All in all, a great film. That's right. I am no fan of action thrillers but this one is miles ahead of the ordinary. It is intelligent and well-paced, and will give viewers exactly what they expect, and more. Deserves a solid 7/10 and 3 stars (out of 4).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A Man With Many Names,"It's hard to believe The Bourne franchise is over 14 years old. With 4 successful films under its belt to this point, and one more on the way, Jason Bourne has become one of Hollywood's most enduring protagonists. Luckily, after so long and many repeated viewings, The Bourne Identity still holds up.Before Paul Greengrass came on board and gave us a few heart stopping thrill rides, Doug Liman directed the first entry in the series. While there are a few dated stylistic choices by Liman, he did a great job kicking off the series. It was released in 2002, but it definitely has a 90's action-thriller vibe from its look and feel. It's also far less cinematic than its successors and in turn makes for a great cable watch (which is probably why I've seen this film north of 10 times).As I understand, the film's budget spiraled after several re-shoots and push back's, so John Powell had little to work with in terms of a natural score. I feel like that helped him create a more grounded sound and tone to the series, as he has gone on to score 3 more Bourne films. Powell's score, along with the great end credits Moby tag, make for one good listen. The Bourne Identity doesn't nearly have the scope that the Greengrass films do, but it has a surprisingly amount of awareness for an action film. The entire series is more cerebral than it gets credit for.Accompanying Matt Damon as Bourne himself, is an impressive cast that consists of German star Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and Clive Owen. Potente serves a great counter to Damon in that they both play lost souls searching for answers. She also essentially plays the audience, who is going along with Bourne as he ventures deep into his past. Owen, Cooper, and Cox are all great as different levels of C.I.A. agents. Particularly, Clive Owen, who does so much with so little amount of dialogue.I'm of the belief that, besides Legacy, the Bourne films get better as the series goes on. With a charismatic performance from Damon, in a somewhat unlikable role, it's all the more impressive just how successful these films have become. Hopefully that continues moving forward.+Damon's commitment+Supporting cast+Powell's grounded score+Good action, but better characters-Some dated stylistic choices9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
One of my favorites,"This has long been one of my favorite spy movies. I liked it so much in fact that I read the book. I wish I didn't read the book however because the movie has barely anything in common with it. Whoever wrote the script just stole the main characters name and the fact that he had amnesia and went on to write his own story from there. It uses vague references to the book, but that's it. This movie should never have been titled ""The Bourne Identity"". If it wasn't, I'd respect it a lot more. They even went as far as to rename the leading female role. Why bother? I don't understand why Hollywood always has to rip off good stories. Tell it like it was or call it something else.The book is a very good read and has a much more thought out plot.

Not the Bourne Identity,"Absolutely do not waste your time or money seeing this movie!  I assume that everyone who gave this movie a good rating has never read the book.  This movie has very little in common with the masterpiece written by Robert Ludlum.  Hollywood has changed everything from the book.  I couldn't believe it when they introduced Marie as a ""gypsy"" rather than a Economist w/ a Ph.D.  Where is Carlos, the world's greatest terrorist who provides the main story line in the book?  They wrote him completely out of the book! Instead of Carlos' henchmen trying to kill Bourne, the movie has CIA operatives trying to kill him.  They even changed the spelling of Cain to Kane, why? I stood up and literally booed when the credits rolled.  I should have left 10 minutes into the movie, but I guess I just wanted to see how bad they could screw it up.  On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the worst you can screw up a adaptation of a book into a movie, the Bourne Identity gets a 10.

The story is less tense yet more surprising than the book, perhaps as a result of us being allowed to see much less of what's happening inside the characters' heads, especially Bourne's.So, this isn't an update of The Bourne Identity.

"Could have been a masterpiece, but is nothing more than average, believe me.","I saw this movie when it came out and found it an average but enjoyable action movie, nothing special, I didn't understand where some people's enthusiasm came from. But later I was recommended to read Robert Ludlum's book, so I did, years after seeing the movie with Matt Damon. And man, I liked it; the story was complex and exciting, with all these twists and turns. I couldn't stop reading and the whole time I thought; 'didn't I pay attention when watching the movie?? How could I have thought this wasn't anything special?' When I finished the book, I purchased the DVD and watched it immediately when I came home...OK... First of all, no bad comment on Matt Damon, he is the Jason Bourne I had in mind the whole time when reading the book and he does a great job. The action scenes are nice too, nothing wrong there. But what happened to the story? Where is all the stuff that I liked so much about the book? They just shrunk the story to; man wakes up without his memory, finds out he's a professional killer and his former employer wants him dead. Is that all? What the hell happened to Charly, Delta, Cain? Where's Carlos? What about Jason's past, and the real reason he took the Bourne Identity? Did the writers think the people who would go see it, might probably be too stupid to understand the story in it's full complexity, the way it was meant to be? Really, everything that made the original story so incredibly interesting, was left away. Even if it would take 3 hours or more to tell the story of Jason Bourne, I would stay in my chair and watch it to the finish.Before I read the book, I found The Bourne Identity an average action movie. After I read the book, I now find the movie an insult on late Robert Ludlum's work. Thank god there's more where that came from; so far, The Bourne Supremacy is just as exciting as Identity.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
One of the Best in the Spy Thriller Genre,"The Bourne Identity is a historically important film for the popular spy thriller genre. The story is character driven and this is what gives it the edge it needs. The action and fight scenes are not gratuitous, which you see in too many films in this genre and the action is realistic, which adds to the plot rather than subtracting from it.Unlike many of the Bond films, especially the Moore and Brosnan movies, the movie grasps the feel of what audiences yearn for in a spy thriller. It is realistic and gritty without being so complex that it would be difficult for the layperson who never experienced being a secret agent to understand.I must admit that I absolutely love the spy thrillers; they are my favorite genre of film. I would have to rank The Bourne Identity, Ronin, From Russia With Love and Casino Royale the best of the genre. All of these movies really capture the essence of what secret agents should be in film; they are gritty, packed with timely action, and are realistic.What sets Bourne aside from the others is the unique story of a man who finds himself lost with amnesia and running from the people who trained him. He is not on a mission for his government, but instead is running for his own life.Matt Damon's acting is superb and there is a great supporting cast notably Franka Potente and Chris Cooper. The soundtrack is perfect as is the cinematography; both capture the absolute correct mood.Whether you are a fan or not of the spy thriller, you may still like this movie because it is a great story with great characters.

More than just action.,"The casting was good, the story was focused and the action sequences were well shot. There's a bit less shaky cam than in the sequels which followed. The film has a harder edge and a greater feeling of realism than certain other spy films of the past. There's no super car or bizarre cadets, no big chested women with pornographic names. The fight sequences are gritty, short and brutal.The opening of the film features Jason Bourne being pulled from the sea with two bullets in his back and no memory of his past. This starts the film off on what's effectively one extended chase. Bourne must find out the truth before he's killed. The colour palette is deliberately subdued, filmed in the winter and set unapologetically in a very modern day contemporary Zurich and Paris.Matt Damon carries off very well the sense of confusion and vulnerability which makes you root for the character. He's not sipping martinis, shooting people and making jokes about it.The soundtrack at times works superbly with the film injecting energy into it. The editing is also pretty slickly done. The only bit of editing and music I didn't like was when they introduced the Assets, thought it was a bit cheesy, but it was 2002.My only complaint is the fact the movie is played pretty straight and realistic so the last 5 minutes when things turn a bit silly feel out of place, but overall a classy movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A tense thrill-ride with superb action sequences,"THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a tense thrill-ride anchored by Matt Damon's strong central performance as a amnesiac assassin in search of who he is. It also kick-started the Bourne series, which raised the bar for intelligent action films. There's not too much need to go into plot details, except that Jason Bourne is a former CIA-trained assassin who is nearly killed when a job goes south. He wakes up with no memory of what happened before and sets off on a mission to find out who he is and why he is being hunted. One aspect I really liked was the balance between action and drama. The action scenes are quite relentless, but the film also allows a relationship to be developed between Matt Damon's Bourne and Marie (Franka Potente), a woman he meets practically by chance. They each have their own somewhat similar problems, and they work together to try and fix them. Normally these types of movies just focus on the protagonist, but here the audience is also exposed and given insight into the other side: the people who are trying to bring Bourne back in. Although some suspension of disbelief is required, the movie does feel grounded in reality, especially considering the recent glut of leaks regarding the NSA. In my opinion, it was nice to see the inner workings of intelligence agencies, and to top it off, a smattering of government intrigue as well. I thought the plotting was very solid, and the performances across the board were very good. The only weak link I found was Julia Stiles as Nicolette, a Paris-based CIA asset who runs a safe house. I thought her role was slightly underwritten, and her performance wasn't as good as the rest of the cast. Moving on, the technical aspects of the film were all excellent. I thought that the action sequences were well-filmed and easy to follow in a geographical sense. The fights were quite intense and well-choreographed as well. Matt Damon makes for a good action star, and this movie is proof of that. The score was also quite good, and helped maintain tension throughout the nearly two-hour running time. All in all, I thought that this was an excellent action film that can hold its own against similar series, like James Bond (which this clearly was intended as). Highly recommended for fans of action films and thrillers. You won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Before Watching: The Bourne Identity (2002),"""The Bourne Identity"" (2002) is the first installment in the famous Bourne-franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Some attention needs to be paid to the minor characters, especially the different assassins. The more you understand and get from the first half, the more sense the second half will make.The Bourne Identity has a bit of everything - tension, sensuality and surely violence. Neither part, however, is overly prominent (except perhaps the violence in the third act), to the degree where it is detracting from the overall story and characters. The focus stays steady, and the tone doesn't shift very much throughout the runtime. Not a lot else needs to be said - prepare for a thrilling dive into one of the greatest action movies of the 2000s.My overall grade: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
I didn't expect it to be that good...,"At first when I glimpsed at this, I wasn't so sure about seeing Matt Damon in this kind of role.  But when I finally saw the film, I realized I was just paranoid as it's a very good action film that uses the european car chase formula and does it in a respectable fashion.  And there's a fight scene that was cleared for a PG-13 movie when it possibly passes for an R. I see how this even resembles The Italian Job in a sense but I am aware that this came out first - but anyway it's not like it's a bad thing.Matt Damon does surprisingly well in his fight scenes which are shot from many angles to take the burden off of the choreographer.  Matter fact he pulls it off so well that I tend to forget he's not even a martial artist as he had to gone through serious training for this role.  For a PG-13 film, it is relatively graphic at times9/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Not quite as good as I was expecting, but still fun","The Bourne Identity has been hyped by many people as the ultimate spy film, out-Bonding Bond etc. etc. To a certain extent that is true - it was exciting, broadly plausible and full of action. On the other hand, for a start it wasn't exactly a spy film. Bourne starts off not knowing who he is, he is chased around a lot and nearly gets killed a few times and he ends up still not really knowing who he is. He doesn't do any spying, he just realises slowly over the course of the film that he is himself a sort of spy.The plot was barely recognisable from the book, apart from a few names, the chase from Zurich to Paris and the fact that people were trying to kill him. The reason why they were trying to kill him and the people responsible were new and the CIA involvement was never fully explained or developed. Perhaps this was a good thing, as the book is, I think, overly complicated, but they could have kept some sort of link.In terms of plausibility, some of the fighting looked like something out of The Matrix (maybe genuine, but filmed to make it look like it was a bit super-hero) and the part where he jumps down a 4-storey stairwell using a dead body to cushion his fall was frankly laughable.As it is, I still enjoyed it and agree it is a great improvement on most Bond films - as witnessed by the way that Bond was reinvented for Casino Royale. The lack of plot carry-over also means that I can watch The Bourne Supremacy when it's on TV next week without worrying that I am still only 1/2 way through the book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The best contemporary movie set in Paris about an American.,"This is a drama. It is not ""Midnight in Paris."" The scenes could be the background for any American visitor-the Right Bank Hotel (looks like the Ritz- you just pass through, you don't stay there) - the strange phones - crossing Pont Neuf- the Gare du Nord and its statues resembling a cathedral - the backgrounds along the Seine - La Samaritaine department store - L'Hotel des Invalides and Le Tour Eiffel in the background - driving on the quai's, on sidewalks and down a set of steps. This movie is better than the sequels in the Bourne series due to the romantic interest between Jason and Marie and the humanity expressed in the script vs. the action in the sequels. The script has some special lines, such as Jason's ""Just keep on talking, it's relaxing,"" and ""How do I know that?"" and Marie's ""I said I was your personal assistant, I just asked for it"" and ""Nobody does the right thing,"" and the dying agent's line ""We always work alone."" The story raises issues about organizations which tend to eliminate their own members. In the end, truth and justice win out on an individual level, if not a societal level which, it seems, was the author's message.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Very Cool Spy Movie Which Makes You Think!,"The Bourne Identity (2002, Dir. Doug Liman)When a body is recovered at sea still alive, the mystery man seems to have forgotten everything in life, including who he was. Eventually he begins to remember smaller details in life and soon finds out that his name was Jason Bourne. What he doesn't like is that a gun and fake passports also belong to him. Now Bourne, and his new friend, Marie Helena Kreutz travel from country to country in search of his new identity. But, someone else is not happy to see him alive, and is frantically trying to track him down.I've never read the novel so i have no idea how close to it the film comes, so I'm going to review the movie as if there isn't a novel. If you enjoy any movies of the James Bond series, then you should really see this. It a spy movie, but of a different variety. It takes things from a realistic approach and makes you really think. Everything from the way Bourne fights to the car chase in prepared in every little detail, which make it possible in real life. The don't rely on special effects and really make sure the mystery if something which really is thought about. This is the way a lot of spy movies should be created these days.

A screenplay by any other name...is NOT The Bourne Identity.,"Well, six months of waiting for what I believed to be a very promising launchpad-of-a-novel has exploded in a very distraught engineer's face. Robert Ludlum's characters, storyline - even the premise - are nowhere to be found in Doug Liman's big screen adaptation.  All I can surmise is that the screenwriter, Tony Gilroy, wrote a movie completely unrelated to Ludlum's masterpiece, then changed the names and faces of those involved to besmirch the innocent.Gone is David Webb from Bourne's pysche, and all the delicious inner turmoil.  Cain is relegated to a mere name on a passport.  Gone is the brilliant and wonderful Canadian economist Marie *St. Jacques*.  Gone is the dynamic and repentant psychiatrist Mo Panov.  And most notably, gone is the master assassin himself - the inimitable Carlos the Jackal.So what's left?  A mediocre action flick about a bad guy with no memory and no direction.  A screenplay so ambiguous and bland that it could easily be mistaken for a wayward James Bond movie.  Lite.  James Bond Lite.  Only one calorie.I am ashamed for you Mr. Liman, Mr. Gilroy.

Not your average action thriller!!,"The Bourne Identity is a spy thriller which, on the surface, is strikingly similar in premise to the James Bond series. However, as the movie commences and gathers momentum, it becomes strikingly clear that the filmmakers have strived to make this movie a lot more focused on the characters and the plot. Even though there is enough action to satisfy the genre fans, the intelligent way in which the story is presented gives us a unique perspective on the life of the lead character.Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon, is a CIA agent who was sent to perform a certain task in Europe. At the beginning of the movie, Bourne is unable to recall his identity or the purpose of his mission. As the viewers are also unaware of this, it allows us to see the world from his point of view. I believe that this generates a much greater impact than knowing beforehand the identity of Jason Bourne.For the majority of the movie, Jason Bourne struggles to remember anything about his past which is well executed by Matt Damon's acting. The CIA plan to capture him and the whole movie is essentially a battle between Jason Bourne and the CIA.Technically, all aspects of the movie is quite impressive. A car chase sequence, in particular, is pulled off with consummate skill. Due to a run-time of just over two hours, the movie keeps you hooked and the strong writing enables the film to never lose traction.I would highly recommend watching this movie as it is not a mere caricature of some other well-known spy thrillers. Instead, it is a unique story told by a talented director which has all the elements that are necessary for a timeless classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The original and the best Bourne action thriller!,"In my opinion, the Bourne Identity is the best out of the entire trilogy. Jason Bourne is really cute in this movie and he's less ""angry"" or in his ""I need to kill anyone who follows me"" mode. I love this movie to death it is my second favorite Bourne film in the trilogy. The first one will be The Bourne Supremacy. The movie is the second adaptation of the Robert Ludlum novel of the same name (the first being a 1988 television film starring Richard Chamberlain as Bourne). This is a mystery spy thriller, that you keep guessing what happened with Jason and it is so intense. Matt Damon does a powerful performance and incredible job as Jason Bourne. This movie is packed with curiosity, romance and of course action! It is not boring or over long and most the time it feels like the film is more realistic. This is the real Jason Bourne and not the character Matt Damon was portraying today in the fifth installment Jason Bourne (2016)! I hate that movie but I love this one!Plot. A man is picked up by a fishing boat, bullet-riddled and suffering from amnesia, before racing to elude assassins and regain his memory.I did hear about this movie in 2002 or 2003 I always wanted to watch this movie after reading an article in the magazine about this film. 10. years ago when I was in high school I watched this movie on TV and I loved it I turn on my computer and I went to see if there is any sequel and yes it was The Bourne Supremacy and at the time our network did not give the sequel on TV it took me 3 years till I download and watched the whole trilogy. And I love the first two movies to death and I love the character Jason Bourne he is decent. We find out more about Treadstone that, is assassin squad a top-secret black ops program of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).I absolutely love this film to death! Director Doug Liman did amazing job producing and directing this movie and he knew exactly what he has to do to make it right and it worked. Clive Owen as The Professor the CIA hit-man was a fantastic assassin and the villain I loved him.I love the chemistry between Jason and Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente), I love the fight scene between Jason and CIA assassin Castel (Nicky Naudé) in Paris. I love how Jason becomes a fugitive and he doesn't kill trough entire film anyone except the bad guys on the end of the movie.I love the showdown scene with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) using a 12 Gauge Double Barreled Shotgun belonging to Eamon (Tim Duttin) to search for the Professor, after the Professor tracks him and Marie to the farmhouse in the French countryside. Bourne shoots the Professor twice with Eamon's shotgun, mortally wounding him, I love that scene to death.In this movie Julia Styles has a lot to do! In mostly sequels she was useless, but in this movie she was brilliant and the star off the movie! She was helping Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper) CIA, really hunting Bourne, she was powerful joy able and intelligent field logistics coordinator and agent handler. I love her to death in here!Brian Cox as Ward Abbott as Head of Operations was incredible villain and he was the mastermind behind Treadstone operations.Chris Cooper is fantastic as Conklin Field Director of the Treadstone he is the fantastic villain. Franka Potente is sexy and really gorgeous likable. I love her ascent because she is really German like her character Marie is.I never read a book or the novel and I have never hear about the movies or the character before but watching this movie I fall in love with it. This movie become the hit in summer 2002. Who would have thought that Good Will Hunting himself could pull off a kick-ass balls to the walls secret agent character that would essentially change the way we see action movies for the 21st century. Matt Damon does that very thing. The Bourne Identity is filled with old school action and stunts that makes this film dare I say better then Bond ever was. Of course that changed when Casino Royale came out, however it was Jason Bourne that started the new look.Overall: This movie is brilliant and intelligent, I love this film to death! It is my second favorite film in the series, love the car chase scenes with Bourne and Marie siting in it. I have fun watching the movie and I will always watch it over and over again. It is my favorite spy mystery action film.Watch this one a few times, and you'll likely be quite moved each time.

"The name is Bourne, Jason Bourne...","Sick of all those recent spy flicks (I don't need to name them, you know what I'm talking about) where plot and characters are buried by hundreds of visual effects and everything is the same movie after movie after movie? Then try The Bourne Identity, which brings new life to the genre. It's got everything you're after: intelligent story, believable and likable characters, and yes, action too, but it's realistic action, not some Matrix-style kicking.The most intriguing aspect is arguably that the hero is a vulnerable human being. In fact, at the beginning of the movie he is found half-dead in the French sea. Once he recovers, this stranger (Matt Damon) is stunned to realize he can speak five or six languages fluently, but doesn't remember where he learned them, or anything that happened prior to his awakening for that matter. The only clue he has is a bank account number in Switzerland, which reveals his name is Jason Bourne and he 's involved in some kind of classified activity. Unfortunately he doesn't have much time to sort things out, as his superiors (Chris Cooper and Brian Cox) think he has deserted and decide to take him down. With only a German student named Marie (Franka Potente) willing to help him, Bourne must put all the pieces together and find out exactly who he is before it is too late.Director Doug Liman and screenwriter Tony Gilroy have made their own version of The Bourne Identity (Robert Ludlum's novel is almost completely different), but who cares, as long as the movie works? It's one of the best spy stories ever made, and it looks like something that could actually happen (all of Bourne's weapons can be purchased by an average citizen). This is the anti-Bond, a man who actually gets hurt and would rather be left alone, and his vulnerability is grippingly conveyed through Damon's powerful performance. If there is a defect, it has to be the fact that the film's focus is almost entirely on the protagonist, overshadowing a fine supporting cast (especially Cooper and Clive Owen, whose turn as the Professor manages to be much more than a stereotyped ""silent killer"" pantomime).Probably the most interesting action movie of 2002, with an even better sequel continuing in the same direction.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
""" The most dangerous part about chasing a Tiger, is that occasionally you catch one ""","Those of you who have ever read any of the great novels written by Robert Ludlum, know he is a superb writer. Having read the book which is the basis for ""The Bourne Identity "" I found that director Doug Liman did not adhere very closely to the book. Instead he allowed the main character to float to the top of his demise, like a dangerous water Mine and allowed the ticking to get louder as the movie progresses. Our hero is found floating in the waters off the coast of Marseilles, dead to the world. Yet, within weeks, Jason Bourne is out to learn, what is that ringing in his head? What was he doing before he was shot, but most important of all who is he? The film begins with a watery mystery, followed by a trail of bread crumbs which then explodes with a high powered surge of pure Adrenalin. Action scenes follows Bourne wherever he goes and so too, his adversaries who are just as lethal as he is. Excitement awaits movie audiences as our hero encounters both the heavies as well as his fellow Treadstone agents. False identities are as plentiful as the bullets which try to kill him, but for any Ludlum fan, what awaits us at the end of the film, is usually not what we expect, for that we need to read the book. Exceptional acting by the fine cast and a great way to spend an evening with Matt Damon. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
We'll always have Paris,"Doug Liman is a fine director of thrillers, as demonstrated here. This is one of the fastest action films in a while.The story is somewhat muddy with all the turns and twists. Some readers at IMDB have compared it to Spy Games, which pales in comparison to this film. That other film had two actors that are an enigma: Brad Pitt and Robert Redford!The Bourne Identity gives us another wooden actor: Matt Damon, who is the best example of a bad actor with the right connections. He's always in the right place at the right time. Mr. Damon keeps turning up like a bad penny in Hollywood films when there are better actors who are having a hard time paying their bills.Take the case of the character actors of this film: Chris Cooper, Clive Owens and Brian Cox, to name only 3! They don't have anything to do here. It is a shame they are hired to be in the background of a non-actor.I wonder if anyone that saw this film could explain to me how is it that what the main character goes thru' and doesn't even get a scratch to his face. I guess the studio executives expect us to grin and bear it and justify what we see as a fantastic agent who is super-human.In the love sequences there are no chemistry between Ms. Potente and Damon. Run Marie, run from this sucker. Make better adult oriented films in Germany or wherever, but never pair against Mr. Damon again.Sorry Mr. Liman, better luck next time and better actors too.

Just so much bizziness.,"""The Bourne Identity"" is a typical Hollywired megabuck  supertinselized by-the-numbers mechanical overhyped product which tells its tale of an amnesiac superspy guy (Damon) who has to find out who he is while trying to woo a babe and avoid a bunch of assassins and assorted cops, etc. out to get him. This very busy film does nothing to distinguish itself; has no soul or personality and very little heart; is one contrived scene after another; borders on sci-fi with too much unreal techno-junk; and takes itself much too seriously.  If you listen to the music you'll get a sense of import which far exceeds the on-screen nonsense. On the up side, however, the film sports a good cosmopolitan cast, features good locations and technicals, and is slick and polished with enough style to be an entertaining no-brainer for action junkies. (B-)Note - It was nice seeing Stiles keeping her mouth shut, Potente standing still, Cox speaking with an American accent, and Cooper in a lead role in a major flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Bourne identity (solid film making) 8.5 out of 10,"I rewatched this film 20 years later after its release. I have to say. It's just as good as the day i saw it.Pros: This is film making at a great moment in time. Direction, acting, photography, plot, genre and music are all balanced. People forget the greatest films are the ones which have a main genre with some good sub-genres that support it. Here we see an action flick with a touch of mystery, noir, thriller, and romance. This is all well executed.What really shines here is the production team. Everyone gave it 100% effort. People dont understand everyone whose name exists at a films end credits are important. Not just the director, actors, and writers are important. From the editor's, to music composer, lighting guys, camera men, supporting actors, and much more did a solid job here. This is the full movie experience package with minimal flaws. If your a movie fanatic, u will pretty much already this one is a gem. The sequels are not bad but, none of them touch the full production of this film.Cons: I would say the films biggest flaw is that the dialogue could have been more elaborated. There is enough of it, but there could have been more that reflected to the plot. Also there are 1 or 2 noticebal blue-screens in the movie. Even with these flaws, this is still a timeless film.

Refreshingly delicious action flick,"Who knew Matt Damon could be an action hero? He does this quite well in ""Bourne Identity"". (Granted, at times I was distracted by his Boston accent, but even spies can be from Boston, I guess.) Jason Bourne wakes up on a German ship to discover he does not know who he is or what he was doing. The rest of the film is to determine his identity... and this is the film's strong point. While action films are a dime a dozen, action films with a good mystery are harder to come by and this one delivers.Fights, romance (but not too much like James Bond) and intrigue... with a bit of ""Good Will Hunting"" mixed in. What Jason Bourne knows is simply amazing but believable in the context of this film.One fight scene was strange because it didn't really make a lot of sense... I won't give away the details, but you'd think if you're assassinating someone you'd want to be silent, but this guy makes as much noise as humanly possible. You know what I mean if you've seen it.Lastly, I want to touch on the women of the film. Choosing the ""Run Lola Run"" (aka ""Lola Rennt"") star as Damon's co-star was the perfect choice. She's beautiful in an unconventional way, and you know she can fight and run when she needs to (though this is hardly shown in the film). And giving her more American exposure certainly doesn't hurt. Julia Stiles, on the other hand, was a disappointment. I love her in almost everything she does... but I couldn't take her seriously as a government agent. Her theater training made me think she was overdoing her part and she struck me as being too immature to handle clandestine actions. Maybe that's just me... and maybe she gets better in ""Supremacy""... but I'm happy her part was so small.Verdict: ""Bourne Identity"" shines.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Good, though it's not the sort of thing I'd want to watch very often.","I must admit up front that I am a hard sell for films like ""The Bourne Identity"". While it's a very well made film, it's also the sort of genre that I am not drawn towards as I just don't love non-stop action. Many do--so keep this in mind.The film begins very well--and very stylishly. A man is found floating in the Mediterranean--almost dead. A doctor on board the ship examines him and finds VERY bizarre things--two bullet holes in the body as well as a strange device implanted in the man's thigh! Clearly he is no ordinary guy! However, the moribund man awakens--and is clearly a guy not to be trifled with, as he's nearly dead but still a killing machine. But here is the odd part--the machine has no idea who he is, how he got there or where to go next. The film that follows consists of Jason Bourne learning who he is--all the while practically EVERYONE is chasing him and trying to kill him! The film is one chase scene after another--all well done but also a bit tiring for me. Again, you may not feel this way--if you adore non-stop action and suspense, you'll probably like this well-made thriller. As for me, it did not leave me wanting to see any of the sequels--it was good but enough for a lifetime of action/suspense for me.

A run of the mill and forgettable action thriller,"For the first time, I watched Bourne Identity years years ago, it was just another action thriller like watch and be entertained. To me it is so weird and sad that the rating of Identity (7.7) is higher than the rating of Supremacy which is unusual and astonishing with amazing action scenes. Bourne Identity is a well made and engrossing action thriller, but ordinary and forgettable. The only success of the movie is that despite the story is cliché (a spy who loses his memory tries to remember his past and identity while struggling with other spies who try to kill him), the movie does not make you feel this. The relationship between him and the girl seems cliché (always our hero finds a girl or a girl finds him), but in my opinion, it was realistic, so no problem wih it. In terms of action, the movie is not slow paced, but there are two three action scenes including a well (but not cool or fresh) car chase that's why it is forgettable. Therefore, if you want an engrossing thriller, you are not disappointed, but if you expect a solid action movie, or lots of action, it becomes a big disappointment. The most and may be only astonishing thing was Clive Owen (so his character) to me. He adds zest to the movie. And there is one thing at the final part that I haven't forgotten since that year.

They still made good spy movies in 2002,"Watching this film again after, to cheer up after the disappointing ""Jason Bourne"" I was reminded why this franchise was so popular.Damon is convincingly disoriented as Bourne, an assassin barely alive after having been shot and thrown overboard into the freezing Mediterranean sea, trying to reconstruct his life and the events that brought him in mortal danger.The action sequences are violent, unexpected, almost believable and not too frequent; there is a single but spectacular car chase through the streets of Paris, with Bourne driving an ancient red Mini the wrong way up and down narrow streets and there is a human centre with Marie, the German woman dragged into Bourne's life, attracted and repelled by him.Most of the movie takes place in snowy, winter landscapes and the travelogue makes sense: from the unnamed coastal city where Bourne disembarks he travels to Zurich, then to Paris where he used to live, than he drives into the French countryside with Marie and back to Paris. The final scene in sunny Greece could have been the apt ending of a stand-alone movie which was never meant to be.Nothing to do with the dreadful, robotic, rehashed plot of ""Jason Bourne"".

"An Action Thriller, with Intelligence","The Bourne Identity, the reason why the Bond series had to change, and for that Bourne needs to be respected. I was hostile to this film when it first came out, thinking it was going to be no more then the American trying to make their own version of Bond, much like xXx released in the same year: but I so wrong.The Bourne Identity has a simple premise, an American assassin, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), has been shot and has amnesia. He is found by French fishermen and he goes on a quest to discover his identity. His bosses at the CIA believed he had died and thought his mission was a failure. They were are shocked to see he shows up in Zurich and they try to hunt Bourne down. Bourne is shocked to see he has a number of passports, thousands of dollars in cash, and a gun in a Swiss bank security box. He discovery he has a nack for language, fluent in German and French, physically fit and can fight without even thinking. He acts like a spy without him knowing it, also checking for exits and threats. In Switzerland he befriends a gypsy, Marie (Franka Potente), he takes him to Paris where he lived. There the hunt hots up, with local police and CIA top agents after them. They have to hide and work together to solve the mystery.They are a lot of positives in this film. It has an excellent cast, it's Matt Damon's first blockbuster and he is good as the spy who is both cold and emotion and also one high alert. Their is Franka Potente, a very good actress and is a woman caught in the middle of this chase. Chris Cooper is good as the villain, and there are other excellent supporting actors, Brain Cox, Clive Owen, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Julia Stiles. The Bourne Identity is the director's (Doug Liman) first blockbuster and he shows he is a excellent action director. There also some excellent action scene, such as the car chase in the mini with Ready, Steady, Go as the backing song, to the fight scenes to the final fight. Also, he doesn't use shaky cam like Paul Greengrass did in the sequels. It also a part of the trend that X-Men started out, getting an indie director to direct action film and bring strong story to a film. There is a fantastic script by Tony Gilroy and William Blake Herron. They wrote a very intelligence, thoughtful script that makes you thing. There are themes of memory, nature vs. nurture, the all seeing eye of the CIA and their willingness to be ruthless. It is also unusual for a blockbuster because it makes out that the Americans (or at least the CIA) as the bad guys. It has a left-wing political stance which Greengrass continues.It's an excellent film and needs multipal viewings to truly understand it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Brilliant beginnings,"This espionage movie is the first in the series of Jason Bourne films based on the popular coterie of books of the same name. They succeed where the current James Bond films fail. While Daniel Craig's sociopath Bond wallows in self loathing and psychopathy, the emotional sub plot in the Jason Bourne films are direct, focused and sensible.It makes sense for a man that has lost his memory to desperately try and figure out who he is, even without highly trained assassins dogging his every move. Throughout the series, he attempts to make amends for his nefarious espionage past and in doing so, blazes a path toward redemption. Having read two of the originals books this series is based upon, I can say that the Jason Bourne character is actually better fleshed out in the films and no doubt intellectual actor Matt Damon had a lot to do with that. This is an excellent action espionage series of films.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Personally have never been a big Matt Damon fan and might be reason why Legacy (2012) with Renner is my favorite Bourne installment, but he still does great in this one and so does everyone else. My favorite key players were Chris Cooper and Clive Owen, the latter of whom plays such a small role but is so effective.

"Somethin' old, somethin' new.","The Bourne Identity is based on a Robert Ludlum book and manages to represent the essence of the story without being too literal, while also managing that rather more difficult task of being a good screen adaptation.The emphasis here is on the action, the whole `Who am I' question only serves as a plot movement to kick-start some great sequences. It's not going to come as any shock to you that Mr Bourne is a CIA operative, or that he knows exactly how to take care of himself, or anyone unfortunate to get in his way.The action scenes themselves are nothing new, yet they are handled with such skill by the director that you never feel like you've been here before.Another of the films strong points is its performance from the main star, Matt Damon breaks very nicely from type and leaves you feeling that he very well could kill you with just his little finger. A good supporting cast also adds credibility with Franka Potente of Run, Lola Run fame and Chris Cooper who recently won an Oscar for best supporting actor in Adaptation.If you're looking for some good solid spy action than look no further. The Bourne Identity Proves to be a very satisfying fare into familiar territory with good performances, great direction and a particularly good car chase through the streets of Paris.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
An American assassin awakens with amnesia.,"Jason Bourne(Matt Damon)is fished out of the drink with two bullet holes in his back and his mind totally blank. This young assassin is amazed with his ability in martial arts for self-defense and his skills in speaking foreign languages. His amnesia does not allow him to know what has happened in the last two years, but he does know that he has to outrun a large team of assassins in hot pursuit. Equally puzzling is his possession of a bag of multiple passports and money to burn. And what kind of movie would this be without the obligatory feminine charm. Along the way Bourne gets aid from a young woman(Franka Potente)who also is dealing with a messy life.Beautiful European settings and the exceptional sound effects make the gun play, fighting and great car chase extra exciting. Damon does the role justice and helps make the unbelievable believable. Other cast members of note are: Chris Cooper, Gabriel Mann and Julia Stiles. Miss Potente is more viable as the movie progresses. Thrills, chills, intrigue and very loud action makes this one among this summers best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Bourne Identity Theft,"The one big problem with this movie: The scriptwriter never read the book. Evidence, you ask for? Simple: the movie has nothing whatsoever to do with Ludlum's book--which was genius--beyond the name of the main character. Where was Carlos and his insidious, far-reaching organization? Where was Dr. Washburn and Ile de Port Noir? What the hell is Bourne doing sleeping on a park bench? Where the hell did that dictator come from? Marie Greutz? Anyone with a passing knowledge of the book knows Bourne's lady love is Marie St. Jacques, an economist working for the Canadian government. And what the hell did they do to Treadstone and the Monk?This is 'Bourne' in name only, and deserves none of the praise it is inexplicably receiving.

Two hours of excitement without stopping to take a breath.,"Far superior to the 1988 TV mini-series, this current offering improved on the original quite successfully. I personally wish the story would have continued for at least another half-hour if not a full hour more. Matt Damon is much more believable than Richard Chamberlain; and Franka Potente completely outshines Jaclyn Smith.Because of how spy dramas, suspense thrillers have evolved over the past several years, nowadays you're never quite sure whether or not our hero will survive. This allows for a heightened sense of suspense.Doug Liman directed a great thriller which I will watch again and again, and I thank him for the lovely tour of Paris....the cinemaphotography was superb.One minor disappointment was that there was not enough of Clive Owen who is a truly great actor and deserves more screen time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Exceptional,"This is based on the Extended Explosive Edition DVD release. I have not read the novel myself(so I cannot make many comparisons, nor comment on the quality of either as a different version of the same tale), but I know enough about it to realize that a lot of it was abandoned when making this. If you want a retelling that stays closer to the book, watch the 1988 mini-series. With that out of the way, this is a very smart, highly realistic and entertaining spy film, not to mention one of the best of them. Mainstream audiences will be able to follow it and piece it together, and the well-written plot is not overly convoluted. The pacing is marvelous, this is never boring, and it lets you breathe. Acting is strong and convincing, Damon captures the expert knowledge, and the vulnerable nature, of the role, and has us believing in both aspects. The characters are well-written and credible. This is well-told, concise without requiring a second viewing to understand it. The dialog is well-written and delivered impeccably. The hand-to-hand fighting is awesome, the shootouts are cool, and this is frankly exciting throughout. The sequences are fresh and unpredictable. It's fast, intense, engaging, well-choreographed and stylish without being excessively so. There is good suspense in this. It keeps you interested throughout. There are few clichés in this. This has a little strong language, and mild violence. The disc comes with several concise featurettes covering the vital areas, the music video for Moby's Extreme Ways, a Van Helsing theatrical trailer, a few deleted scenes and the ""bookends"", an alternate opening and ending, with introductory interviews. I recommend this to fans of those who were involved in making the movie, CIA flicks and/or story-driven action-thrillers. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Action Movie Of The Year,"When I first heard of this movie I thought it was just another action film. And when I heard it had Matt Damon in the lead, I thought the film producers had gone 'bonkers' to cast Matt Damon as an action hero. Besides, I never liked his acting. But, boy. Did my opinion change after watching this film. Matt Damon isn't only good, he's terrific as the former CIA assassin on the run from his boss. The movie too gives in a solid punch. What makes this movie really click is that it doesn't try to prove it is different from the regular action flicks. In fact, it shows that it is just that. It is its terrific execution which makes it worth watching over and over again. Doug Liman's perfect direction takes this film to great heights. And the action sequences are too be seen to be believed. They're just beautiful. Terrific. And the car chases are really awesome. The only really negative point in this film is Frank Potente as the Gypsy girl who gives Jason Bourne(Matt Damon) a ride to Paris and as you would expect become his love angle. She just isn't upto the mark. Infact, she looks like sleepwalking through the entire film. The strategy of casting a lesser known actress opposite Matt Damon wasn't bad but the director should have thought about casting a lesser known-good actress and not just the former. Opposite the extremely superb Matt Damon she looks like a drag. Another positive point in this movie is its cinematography. The lush locations of Paris and Switzerlnd have been captured beautifully. All in all, this is one action movie you won't want to miss. Terrific from start to finish. This is undoubtedly the action movie of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
All eye-candy with little substance,"Most film adaptations of popular novels thrill the casual viewer, but end up disappointing readers.  The Bourne Identity is no different.  This version, while featuring action sequences galore, fluffs over the plot.  The storyline feels contrived, deliberate, and conventional.

"Decent, but pretty much like any other action thriller","I was really excited to hear one of my favorite books was being made into a film.  I was surprised at the beginning whenn they didn't say ""based on the book."" After watching it, I can see why.  The only thing it has in common with the book are the characters and some of the first 5 minutes.  The plot is completely different.  The book is exciting because Jason Bourne (Damon) is up against the deadliest assasin of all time, Carlos the Jackal, and his origins are a mystery until the very end.  Carlos is nowhere in this film, and the secrets of the organization Bourne is from is revealed in the first 15 mins.Another thing that I haven't seen in over a decade, is a very anti-climatic ending.

Good,"While this movie purports to be an adaptation of Robert Ludlum's classic action novel, it actually borrows some of the main plot points, and nothing more. Which actually is a quite good decision: this new, 2000s-updated version of a story, in which a man, found floating unconsciously in the Mediterranean Sea and suffering from a total amnesia, slowly starts picking up pieces of his forgotten past as a undercover agent, actually works. ""The Bourne Identity"" is a decent action flick, with lots of high-speed chases and hand-to-hand combat scenes; Matt Damon is very believable and natural as the title character, and Franka Potente as his love interest shows why she could be regarded as the modern cinema's overlooked gem. Chris Cooper also shines as the bad guy, although he is unlucky to share many scenes with the late Brian Cox, and Cox always had the ability to steal the scene whenever he appears on screen, and this movie is no exception. A good action flick. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A Fantastic Suspense Filled Movie,"I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in theaters in 2002. Back then it was so fresh, and so good--it was a unique story that kept you on the edge of your seat. Indeed, in 2002 I probably would have given this movie 10/10 stars.That said, watching this movie on Blu Ray recently, I felt like it's still a great film--but one that loses a bit of its charm on a successive viewing. This movie is full of suspense and cliffhanger scenes that make you wonder what's coming next. But it's also a story that once you've seen it once, you more or less know what's going to happen, and so the thrill factor deteriorates significantly, thus making the movie not as fun to watch time and again.Another thing that the movie has going against it is the picture quality that the movie is filmed in. The movie has a clarity that at many times makes it look more like the set of a sitcom than a spy movie. This is especially true for indoor scenes--it may very well have been exceptionally good lighting rather than the type of film itself that was used. Whatever the case, the movie at times looks too polished, and too crisp.Still, overall this is a fantastic movie. Matt Damon plays an amnesiac who slowly but surely uncovers bits and pieces about who he actually is. That knowledge is more obvious more quickly to the audience than it is to Damon's character--but throughout the film we learn more and more about the fascinating back story of this man without a memory, and the story is engaging and full of thrills.All that said, I'm giving this movie 8/10 stars. It's a great movie, but one that there are a few flaws to nitpick.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Effective espionage that avoids clichés,"Thanks to Bourne, Bond was given that update make-over that was needed. Although a loose adaptation of Robert Ludlum novel it's a far superior to closer rework The Bourne Identity (1988) TV movie starring Richard Chamberlain and 'Angel' Jaclyn Smith.Matt Damon's does a surprisingly great job, not just as Jason Bourne the character but against type cast, convincing the viewer that he's a dangerous and physical spy. While the Bourne Identity is action packed with some fantastic fight choreography and car chases it feels realistically grounded as an effective espionage thriller. The captivating screenplay by Tony Gilroy and W. Blake Herron gives the cast time to shine. Franka Potente Brian Cox and Chris Cooper are all on fine form and there's also a small, memorable role by Clive Owen as an assassin.The film has a great look and benefits from the real life European locations, Doug Liman's direction is exceptional utilising a hand held style that has become common place in mainstream films since. The score is exciting and Moby's theme tune is captivating, for such a high concept film Bourne Identity is very convincing,- it avoids clichés, has some twists and exudes atmosphere.The Bourne Identity is must see.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

best movie,"An Italian fishing boat crew working off the coast of Marseille, France finds an unconscious man called Matt Damon adrift in the Mediterranean with two gunshot wounds in his back.The man awakens on board, and very soon he comes to realize he suffers from retrograde amnesia, having only one clue to his identity: the account number to a safe deposit box provided by a tiny laser projector surgically implanted in his hip. He uses the information and travels to Zürich, Switzerland to find the corresponding bank and discovers he is skilled in advanced hand-to-hand combat and fluent in German when he instinctively defends himself from two policemen questioning him for loitering in a closed park at night.The man arrives at the bank and finds the deposit box contains a significant amount of cash in different currencies, a handgun, and several passports with his photo, but with numerous aliases and nationalities. He assumes the identity of the top passport, ""Jason Bourne"", and leaves. A bank employee notifies a CIA Special Activities Division group, ""Operation Treadstone,"" about his visit, and the police arrive on the scene. Bourne manages to escape and flees to the U.S. consulate, where he is accosted by the officials there but once again manages to elude capture. A few blocks away, Bourne approaches Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) and offers her US$20,000 to take him to Paris to the address on his ""Bourne"" passport card.Meanwhile, when back at CIA headquarters, Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper), the head of Treadstone, reveals to his supervisor, Deputy Director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), that Bourne was the covert operative responsible for a failed assassination attempt on exiled African dictator Nykwana Wombosi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Intending to sever all connections between the CIA and Wombosi, Conklin sends three highly-trained ""assets"" (assassins) to eliminate Bourne. Bourne and Marie arrive at the apartment in Paris, where he finds that one of his aliases, ""John Michael Kane,"" was supposedly killed two weeks ago. The first asset, code-named ""Castel"" (Nicky Naude), ambushes them but Bourne subdues him after a brief fight. Marie checks Castel's bag and panics when she discovers a hit list package with photos of CCTV footage of her and Bourne at the embassy the day before. As Bourne tries to calm her down, Castel escapes and jumps out the window to his death before Bourne can learn anything else from him.Conklin enlists Nicolette ""Nicky"" Parsons (Penina Mezei), a logistics technician at the Treadstone Paris safe house, to assist him in tracking Bourne and Marie. Bourne goes to meet Wombosi to obtain more information but the second asset, code-named ""The Professor"" (Clive Owen), kills Wombosi before Bourne arrives. With the news of Wombosi's death, Bourne surmises he was an assassin before the onset of his amnesia. Bourne and Marie flee to the home of her stepbrother in the countryside where Bourne decides that he no longer wants to be who he was before .Back at the CIA headquarters, Conklin tracks Bourne and Marie to the countryside house. The next morning, The Professor tries to snipe Bourne but Bourne creates a diversion and dispatches him in a cropfield, having sneaked out. As he dies, The Professor tells Bourne about their mutual connection to Treadstone. Bourne sends Marie and her stepbrother away for her safety, then uses The Professor's cell phone to arrange a meeting with Conklin to bring him out into the open so he can track him.Bourne tails Conklin back to the Paris safe house where Conklin tells him that he (Bourne) planned the entire operation to kill Wombosi. The revelation triggers Bourne's memory and through successive flashbacks Bourne remembers he used the Kane alias to infiltrate Wombosi's entourage but couldn't bring himself to kill Wombosi because Wombosi's children were present with him. He aborted the mission and tried to flee the boat, but he was shot twice by Wombosi and fell overboard from Wombosi's yacht into the Mediterranean, where the Italian fishermen later found him.Bourne tells Conklin he is quitting Treadstone and warns them not to follow him. After knocking Conklin out, Bourne engages in a shootout with several other Treadstone agents in the building. Bourne is wounded during the gunfight but kills the other agents and escapes the building. After Bourne has escaped, Conklin orders Nicky to close down the safe house, and shortly afterwards is murdered by the third asset, code-named ""Manheim"" (Russell Levy), on orders from Abbott. Some time later, Abbott explains to an oversight committee that he shut down Treadstone because of its ineffective cost benefit ratio and proposes a new program, ""Operation Blackbriar.""Bourne, now free from the CIA, travels to Mykonos, Greece, where he reunites with Marie, who runs a scooter shop, and the two share an embrace.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Solid action thriller with some good surprises.,"Like others, I missed this in the theater. I have to say I'm glad I finally caught it. I had read the book once, in my early teens (1980-85?). Time takes its toll, so I only remembered the broad strokes of the book. Never did see the TV version, so I can't compare them.I really did enjoy the movie as a whole. Damon did a good job with Bourne's confusion and sense of loss. He's no Anthony Hopkins, but he was effective. The action scenes were well done. The guy coming through the glass at Bourne's Paris place really surprised me. Good build up. The scene with Clive Owen gave both characters a little humanity to empathize with.I do have to say the Bourne/Marie romance could have used a little more development, but oh well, it's an action flick, right? And Julia Stiles' character seemed very superfluous. I think they missed an opportunity for a good subplot, but maybe she'll show in the sequel.All in all, I'd say a solid 4 out 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Look, the guy who says this fillm lacks credibility is wrong","If you actually read the book by Robert Ludlum, enjoy it, then take a step back from it consider two things.1) Thia book was written years ago, in 19802)Carlos Ilyich Ramirez, aka Carlos the Jackal - was still at large in 1980.  He is not now, as he was jailed by French Authorities, once again, many years ago.You cannot take a theme that was resolved in real life and superimpose it into fiction and expect your audience to respect the work.  As Carlos was the central theme of all three books(The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum-all excellent by the way), it is both painfully obvious and decididly necessary to change the central theme of the film to reflect the secondary theme of the book, IE what National Secrets could this Rogue Agent/CIA Assasin impart to the wrong people/Government if coersed, bribed or whatever.My opinion is aside from the obvious and necessary meandering from the Carlos angle, the film is a decent and effective attempt at bringing the thrust of Bournes struggle to find who and what he is, whilst avoiding shadowy hitmen at every juncture.You simply cannot take a 500-600 page book written in 1980(as a techno/espionage thriller), leave it entirely intact and have it still appeal to a mass market.I went into this movie with an open mind, as I usually do, and whilst I would have liked to see more depth to Clive Owens and the other assains characters, and more explaination behind the purpose of 'Treadstone 71', I feel this is still a movie to enjoy, so I recommend you give it a shot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

The rest of the performances are the same, just good.As for the action scenes, they're kind of average actually. Throughout the entire movie the fight scenes include a lot of the use of the shaky cam technique. Shaky cam is usually used to cover up how bad a movie's action choreography is and still make the movie intense. The only real problem is that the choreography is good, but it's just poorly presented. That's not to say that the action isn't entertaining, it's just cheated for no real reason.Overall, despite the negativity, I had run with this movie.

"Another great novel, butchered by Hollywood. When will they get it right?","Where do I begin???? Did Mr Ludlum loose his mind before he passed away? How could he allow Hollywood to destroy the beauty of his finest novel, my favorite spy novel of all time? ""Based on a novel by Robert Ludlum"" is an understatement. There is nothing from the novel except the name of the main character Jason Bourne -who is not even the true identity of the main character, but his CIA cover - and the fact that he had amnesia and had a microchip planted in his hip, that's it. Oh, no wait, he also worked for a CIA cell called Treadstone 71. Where is the true assassin, Carlos the Jackal, the reason why Treadstone created the Bourne identity altogether? The script writers obviously have a very naive and distorted understanding of how the CIA works. My dad was a CIA officer and I can assure you that they do not go around killing people all over the world, innocent as well as guilty, just because someone at headquarters ordered them to do that. They also don't sentence one of their field officers to death simply because they lost contact with him. In the novel, David Webb was a washed out CIA officer who underwent plastic surgery to take over the identity of well known assassin called Jason Bourne. He spoke many languages, European and oriental, and was sent to draw out Carlos from his hideout. The beauty of the story is his relationship with the Canadian economist Marie St-Jacques and his quest to find out who he was. In the movie, Jason Bourne had to run away from other CIA assassins, while in the novel, it was Carlos and his men who were after him. the CIA was trying to figure out what happened to him, not kill him. And whose idea was it to cast Matt Damon in the lead role? Jason Bourne is supposed to be in his 40s and not a young looking kid. In the Bourne Supermacy, he actually is a college professor and Marie gets kidnapped (I'm sure the Hollywood version is completely different, have not seen it yet). When Hollywood turned Mission Impossible into a movie, they had the entire team killed, turned the team leader into a traitor, and left Ethan Hunt to be the solo hero. Now they butchered the Bourne identity altogether. Please read the story, or at least watch the TV movie with Richard Chamberlain. It is more faithful to the novel. What a disappointment this was. If a story is good enough to be a bestseller, why change it? Oh and the scene where Matt Damon rides a corpse down 7 floors and then walk away without a scratch... I mean come on. Are you kidding me?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Great Action Movie,This is one of the best action movies around.Unlike the 007 movies you can't seem to pull yourself away from this thriller.After being pulled up out of the ocean and cared for by the fishermen who saved his life.The man wakes up with two bullet holes in his back and with no memory of who he is or where he is.The more he finds out who he is the less he wants to know.Every turn he makes another person is trying to kill him.Without knowing who to trust he must find who wants him dead and why.This movie is worth the 14 bucks you can buy it for at blockbuster.You will not be disappointed in this action/thriller.It will keep you on the edge of your seat and keep you entertained!,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
First Bourne,"The first in the successful Bourne franchise set the bar higher for future entries it has to be said. Matt Damon reinvented himself here as an action hero in the form of the title character, the first sight of whom we get is floating face down in a dark, stormy sea. He's not dead of course and recovers remarkably quickly from being shot so many times in the back, but once he does, he methodically works his way back to filling in his amnesiac memory as he finds out he's a broken-down killing machine who's now a liability to his employers.Along the way, inevitably of course, he joins forces with a girl (there's always a girl) of the feisty and rootless type naturally, who although only taking Bourne on initially as the most expensive taxi-hire in history, naturally develops feelings for him, even as all hell seems to break loose around him. From there to the end the race is on for Bourne to get his memory and identity back before the bad-good guys get him. Considering the number of sequels spawned to date, you can guess our guy doesn't exactly lose, although rather the same can't be said of some of his most ardent pursuers.What immediately set Bourne apart from other spy-action-hero types is that there are no gimmicks about him. The way that he comes across as an ordinary-average sort of guy (until you press his buttons) gets us on his side from the very start, our faith in him to come through as a good-guy in the end vindicated by the humanity he shows in his first would-be- assassination mission. More than that, the fast-cut action sequences are quite superb especially the expertly choreographed fight-scenes. The movie never slackens as it moves as relentlessly forward much like our hero's own mission to find himself.Damon is terrific in the title part and dominates the film. The direction keeps the tension going right to the end, interspersing the dynamic, stylised action sequences with just enough character-setting to fill in the backgrounds, without slowing the film to a halt.Even better was to come in the series but this excellent opener is more than just a ""curtains-up"" on one of recent cinema's best characters, it's an excellent espionage thriller in its own right.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Rewrites the rule book for all action/spy movies as a new hero is Bourne.,"It's hard to believe that back in 2002, The Bourne Identity would rewrite the rule book for action/spy movies and set a new benchmark. There's plenty of thrilling action sequences, and there's also the addition of brains to counterbalance the brawn. Matt Damon, who was an unlikely choice as the spy Jason Bourne, completely redefined the movie spy for the millennium and made himself and his character a household name. Based on the best selling novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum, The Bourne Identity was one of the most successful movies of 2002 which spawned several successful sequels.The movie begins with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, Good Will Hunting) being rescued by Italian fishermen after being found in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea with two gunshots in his back. While being nursed back to full health, Bourne wakes up with no memory of who he is and how he was found, but is fluent in several languages and highly proficient in unarmed combat. finds himself capable of advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages. The only lead Bourne can act on is a tiny laser projector under his hip which gives a number of a safe deposit box in Zurich. After he visits the bank in Zurich, he finds a large sum of money, various passports and a handgun. The visit to the bank alerts black ops CIA director Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper, Adaptation) who is in charge of Operation Treadstone. As Conklin and Deputy Director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox, Manhunter) spearhead the operation to take down Bourne who is believed to have gone rogue, Bourne enlists the help of German woman Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente, Run Lola Run) to initially drive him to Paris with a sum of money but finds herself being caught up in the middle of the secretive plot. While Bourne slowly uncovers how he found himself in his current situation and who he really is, he also uncovers the conspiracy to see through that he is not to be taken alive.Matt Damon won critical acclaim for he previous roles in Good Will Hunting (1997) and Saving Private Ryan (1998). Here in The Bourne Identity, his career kicks into another gear as super spy Jason Bourne who also has cemented a well deserved spot as one of the greatest characters amongst such names as James Bond, Rambo, Terminator and John McClane to name a few. It's hard to believe Matt Damon was an unlikely casting choice, but now Jason Bourne is one of Matt Damon's best roles.The rest of the supporting cast round out the movie well such as Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Clive Owen, Julia Stiles (another unlikely casting choice) and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Keep an eye out for Walton Goggins (The Shield), Gabriel Mann (Revenge), and Josh Hamilton (American Horror Story).Director Doug Liman was also an unlikely choice as director following his work in indie movies such as Swingers (1996) and Go (1999) but here his work has worked wonders.The Bourne Identity spawned several blockbusting sequels however giving credit where its due, The Bourne Identity was the movie that started it all and made its permanent mark. Putting a lot of no brainer action movies to shame, The Bourne Identity is more of a thinking man's action movie with spectacular stunts and more twists and turns than a roller coaster ride. Even after Moby's Extreme Ways plays during the end credits, you still find yourself glued to your seat. The Bourne Identity is still an entertaining action movie from start to finish.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A game changer in the spy movie genre,"Yup, this was super good. Not sure how I missed seeing it before now? Great story, involving an amnesiac assassin who is rescued at sea by an Italian fishing vessel (with a couple bullet holes in his back) and then spends the rest of the movie on the run from his superiors (who have deemed him expendable) while also trying to piece his life together.Who is he? why does he have a Swiss bank account # implanted in his hip? How does he know how to do all the cool spy sh!t he does? Like fight (awesome fight scenes), use weapons, kill, evasive driving techniques. Some of my favourite scenes actually involved Jason being amazed by what he can do.I also loved that this took place in Paris & Zurich and was really filmed there. His love interest turned out to be more than just fluff too. I will definitely be watching this again, just fantastic. 11.13",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Nice Thriller,"The Bourne Identity (2002)*** (out of 4)Nice thriller has a man (Matt Damon) being pulled from the ocean with two gunshot wounds to the back as well as suffering from amnesia. Over the course of time his memory slowly starts to come back but he's dodging countless assassins sent to kill him. Wth the help of a woman (Franka Potente) he tries to figure out his true identity. THE BOURNE IDENTITY didn't completely win me over but there's no question that it's a well crafted thriller that makes perfect use of its star. I think it's easy to see Damon in this role because he can not only handle the action scenes but he can also perfectly work through the more dramatic moments of the story. There are several scenes where the character pretty much cracks from not being able to remember who he is and Damon managed to make these scenes seem very real. Another major plus is that he's just so good in the action scenes. I'm not sure how many people knew Damon would be able to pull this off but the transition to an action star worked. It took me a while to warm up to Potente. She's certainly got a different look and style than you'd normally see in a movie like this and that's one thing I did enjoy. Once the story picked up and her character got more involved I thought the actress managed to come out of her shell. The supporting cast includes a nice turn by Chris Cooper who is also dependable. I think one of the film's biggest pluses was the beautiful location shooting. There's footage from across the world and it really helped add to the story. Add in some nice action scenes and a pretty good, if easy to follow story and you're left with an entertaining, anti-James Bond film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
What a spy thriller should be,"This film is exciting from the start where a man who has lost his memory is pulled from the Mediterranean until the end where he confronts his erstwhile employers.Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, an assassin with amnesia who must piece together who he is from the contents of a safety deposit box in a Swiss bank. Unfortunately for him he is spotted and his CIA bosses assume something is wrong with him and attempt to arrest him when he visits the US consulate. He escapes and pays a German girl (Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris. They realise just how much danger they are in when an assassin attacks them in Bourne's apartment. From then on he must play cat and mouse with the CIA and the French police until he can finally identify and confront his former employers at the end.The acting is solid throughout, both from the two main characters and from secondary characters, especially Clive Owen in a small roll as another assassin sent after Borne. It is also nice to have a leading lady who, while pretty, isn't an exotic, unrealistic beauty like we tend to get in another spy franchise. The action never really lets up, we have plenty of fights and an exciting car chase where Bourne must evade the Paris Police while driving a clapped out old Mini. If you enjoy spy thrillers I'd certainly recommend this as well as the other two films in the trilogy. It is good to see that a really exciting film doesn't need to resort the excessive swearing or violence which would have taken it above the 12 certificate.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
over-rated unrealistic,"In the days before Tom Clancy Robert Ludlum wrote the most popular, if fantastical, even slightly ridiculous, spy novels. But of course, times change and there is no way that a movie can come close to covering the complexities of a good spy novel. The Bourne Identity had to be updated because there is no more Carlos the Jackal, (in fact, there never really was, he was somewhat bad at his job- the press actually created a mountain out of a dung heap). Having read The Bourne Idnetity back in the day I had trouble equating Mat Dillon with the title character but realizing they would make the movie according to today's realities I tried to go in with an open mind. However, the movie was just too ridiculous.(warning a summary and two spoilers)The movie's premise stays true to the book in that an assassin named Jason Bourne is rescued by a fishing boat in the Mediterranaean. Half-dead, Bourne has two bullets in him and is soon in shape (a few days with scant medical supplies in the movie versus the book in which a drunk ex-British doctor sews him up and gives some good advice while rehabilitating him.) Next we see Bourne, though he doesn't know he's Bourne because he has amnesia, going to the Swiss city of Zurich because he has a small laser pointer containing the bank's address and an account number surgically implanted in his hip.From there it is a whirl wind adventure through Europe as Bourne struggles to recall anything from his memory regarding his identity. All this man seems to be cut out for is killing. Along the way he picks up a wandering German chick who happens to agree to drive a mad man to Paris.Then he kills a lot of guys.People have tagged this movie ""relaisitc"". that is both absurd and frightening. Bourne here is so bullet proof he seems like a kung fu movie hero from Saturday afternoons or a James Bond from the seventies. ALthough Damon does not seem to have the mileage to pull off the character- it is Bourne's inability to do any wrong that is too much to swallow. For example, in an old,lone french house in a tiny valley, surrounded by forested hills, the children's dog does not answer a morning call so Bourne, realizing he is being hunted (not so unrealistic) finds a shotgun, does not look outside and study the surroundings, then walks out and shots a heating oil tank and uses the ensuing smoke screen to run into cover towards the waiting assassin. Excpet for the fact, of course, how could he know where the killer was? Another even more implausible scenario was when he was at the top of stairwell being fired at by man coming up the stairwell, Bourne used a corpse as cover as they plummet five or six stories between the stringers of steps. Not only does Bourne shoot the assassin on the way down (at what, 64 feet per second) but he lands on his stomach on the corpse, as if that would break his fall (safety tip: when you try this at home you need to fall on your back, otherwise the force of the blow travels to your spine and blows it to pieces).The gaps in reality are big enough to accommodate Al Gore's carbon footprint, if you want to see Chris Cooper and Matt Damon in a realistic movie, watch Syrianna. Or see Munich, that movie will show you how crazy the espionage game is. The Bourne Identity may be fun, but it's mental junk-food.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Split in two over this one... pretty good spy film... yet it almost put me to sleep...,"I really lean both ways when it comes to this one. One part of me says, ""Wow, this is a great movie with a cool plot!"" and the other side says, ""I'd rather be sleeping in my bed than sleeping through this movie.""First, the good: It's realistic. It's got cool locations and the action is 100% real (as in no CGI).Then, the not so good: There's really not too much dialogue, and consequently not too much sympathy or empathy that goes to the characters. I have about the same amount of sympathy for a pedestrian on the street as I do for Jason Bourne in this movie. And instead of adding more dialogue or character development, they fill the movie with long, unnecessary shots of the locations and scenery. They show the characters doing pointless busy work all the time that really doesn't need to be shown on film! Probably because they couldn't think of anything else to fill the gaps!And plus, it could've been over in a half hour. It's a simple story. And they kept it simple. And by doing so, they made it very boring. I'd say this is, without a doubt, the slowest action movie I've ever seen. But the ending DOES make you want to come back and see the sequels.So, there you have it. My final advice is, if you haven't seen it, see it. It'll be a classic in the world of action movies someday... it's just a little slow. Don't watch it with high expectations, though. Like I said, it's slow. Should be called ""The Bored Identity.""With love,Simba Jackson",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A highly disappointing movie.,"I found this version of the Bourne Identity markedly inferior to the 1988 TV version with Richard Chamberlain. The latest Bourne did not follow the book very closely and often left the viewer(me) wondering how anyone could at all perceive the logic of the plot.And I found Matt Damon totally unconvincing as Jason Bourne, who is supposed to be a man of sophistication and maturity. Compare the much more accurate 1988 Bourne and Chamberlain, an actor far more suitable to the role.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Good & Bad Of ''The Bourne Identity',"This is a solid suspense-spy film with an agent-on-the-run scenario. People who like a paranoid theme, where everyone is after you (I plead guilty) will love this.THE GOOD - The amount of violence in here was just about right, not too much and not too little. I also enjoyed the Paris scenery, both the street-level shots and the aerial photography. Ovrall, the cinematography is very good in this film. It's an involving story that once you're hooked, you stay that way. The two hours go by pretty quickly. The cast is interesting. I was familiar with Franke Potente after seeing her in ""Run Lola Run."" Potente has a different, and intriguing look to her. The action scenes in here are very good, including an excellent car chase.THE BAD - I get tired of American filmmakers trashing their own government all the time, in here its them trying to kill one of their own agents. Also, there are too many usages of the Lord's name in vain, mainly said by Chris Cooper's character. It also took a bit to accept Matt Damon as some physically-rough spy since his image was not that prior to this film.OVERALL - A good movie that is part of my collection. I liked the sequel even better, although part of the reason was that I was now familiar with the main characters after watching this film. Anyway, I highly recommend both movies for fans of suspense, crime, intrigue, good locales, etc.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
One of the best spy thrillers in years.,"*** out of ****Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, a man who's found afloat in the sea with several bullets in his back.  He's salvaged by a fishing boat and awakens to discover he has no memory of his previous life.  After he recuperates, he heads to shore to find his true identity.  With the assistance of a pretty German woman (Franka Potente), Bourne goes on the run with covert assassins trying to kill him and top government agents trying to cover their tracks.The Bourne Identity is an interesting summer thriller.  It's certainly not an all-out action blockbuster, as the previews might lead you to believe, but there are some terrific action sequences.  What truly makes the film work is Damon himself, whose first bid as an action star is completely convincing and engaging.  The movie nicely keeps us in the dark about his past, we know just as much as he does and eagerly anticipate every discovery he makes.From a certain point-of-view, Franka Potente isn't useful except as a love interest, and on that level, her presence works.  Not only is she a fine actress, but she and Damon share a palpable chemistry.  Hopefully, she'll return in the sequel, and this series won't go the Bond/M:I route with a new love interest in every installment.  Take note, Hollywood, steadiness and consistent relationships are always appreciated.The Bourne Identity's premise is similar to The Long Kiss Goodnight's, but unlike that movie, takes its story seriously and aspires to work as both a thriller and a character-oriented drama, which it does.  Once Bourne's past is revealed (not that it isn't that hard to figure out), the film loses a bit of momentum, but does wrap things up believably and in a suprisingly somewhat quiet fashion (compared to say, Bond, Triple X, or M:I).For action fans, there's enough here to keep them satisfied, with the standout setpieces being an excellent martial arts fight set in an eerily empty apartment and an exhilarating car chase through the streets of Paris. I've seen at least two other films with auto chases set in Paris (Ronin, The Transporter) and this one's my favorite, even though it's also the shortest and features the least attractive car (a mini as compared to an Audi in Ronin and a BMW in The Transporter).There are a few disappointments here and there, particularly Bourne's showdown with The Professor (Clive Owen), which concludes rather abruptly considering the huge build-up.  Julia Stiles is also in the film, and her presence is rather distracting (I can't look at her without thinking, ""Hey, it's Julia Stiles!"") in a role that could have been played by just about anyone.  But in the end, The Bourne Identity succeeds because it rarely goes over-the-top (no megalomaniacal billionaires here), maintains an even tone, and establishes likeable characters and good storytelling.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"A movie that is both really good, and really bad","Okay, this was a good spy movie, of the traditional kind, but still up to date. And the sequel is even better, and a bit more true to the books. And if I never read the books, I would give them a vote of 6 for the first one, and 7 for the second.The books. Therein lay my problem with the Bourne movies. Almost nothing from the books have made it into the movies. And what little there is, they have messed around with until it is almost unrecognizable. It is a great shame, and a travesty to the genius works of Robert Ludlum. If he were alive today, he would have been steaming mad!I wish for once they would make a movie that did justice to the Bourne books. That would have been the father of all action dramas!But if you never read the books, these movies are well worth watching. This is surprisingly enough, much thanks to really good acting from Matt Damon. I have never really liked Damon as an actor. He never seem to be able to connect with his character. But in the Bourne movies, he for the first time really impresses me. Especially in the second movie, where he simply IS Jason Bourne.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A refreshingly different angle to an old premise,"I was pleasantly surprised that a big budget Hollywood action film was character driven. The casting of Mat Damon was was inspired, he brings a vulnerability to a character who could have been played in a stereotypical way from a lesser actor . Not only did he bring a subtle angst to his portrayal, he showed an amazing ability to portray the physical requirements of Jason Bourne's character.The script had minimal flaws which in lesser films can detract from the ability of the viewer to engage in escapism. The director kept the action flowing and didn't dumb down scenes with obvious set-ups which can bring an audience back to reality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

"Furiously dynamic, and if a little thin on substance, buttery with effect","The Bourne Identity (2002)It's a slightly ludicrous plot and not a very complex one, but it's so well done, so fast and well acted, it just takes off and never stops and works great. You couldn't ask for a better action adventure espionage film without depth. Not only is Matt Damon well cast and doing his best, but his lesser known female unwitting but not at all witless companion is terrific, too. And that's Franke Potente (forever known best for ""Run Lola Run"").The fighting (in slightly fast motion to give a comic book feel to it all, even more than a martial arts style) and the CIA backroom stuff (where they have to kill their own agent to protect their image on Capitol Hill) is all good enough for any movie. But for me, the thing that lifts this just a bit higher is the relationship between the Damon and Potente characters. The actors play it all very cool, show normal fear and confusion, and really demonstrate a deep trust in each other. By the ending, you are so happy for them, you might be sad to hear there are two sequels.Director Doug Liman seems to come out of nowhere for such a complex and well directed film, though his two earlier features, ""Swinger"" and ""Go,"" are both very strong. It's interesting that both the sequels received similarly rave reviews among the mainstream press, and both were directed by someone else (Paul Greengrass), which might point to the strength of the underlying story and cast. On the other hand, Liman set the tone and style of the following two films, and there is something superior about having done it first. This is a good film, and a great film of its type.The photography (and effects) are talked about here, and director of photography Oliver Wood shoots all three films, which shouldn't be overlooked, since these are such visceral, visual experiences.

Sober and humble : impeccable.,"I've seen this movie on the shelves for a while. I was planning to watch it one day, you know, when circumstances would bring it on my path. No, it's true, I didn't care much about it, for obvious reasons: First, this movie didn't seemed very popular, and nobody ever told me anything about it. But second, Matt Damon in the lead role left me somehow perplex, probably due to his lack of charisma.Whatsoever, now, in early 2007, I took the time to enjoy this, finally, excellent production! On the whole, the movie shines by its precise realization; its well balanced way to tell the story, to establish character's relations and successions of events. Amazingly, especially for this kind of movie(thriller/action/stealth) almost nothing is exaggerated, or, at least, unrealistic and over-saturated to the extreme like the usual ""made in USA"" productions. The pace is just right, and leave us exactly the right time to taste and enjoy every details without relieving the needed tension. So, on the directing side, this jewel is just wonderful! The cast is another strong point. It gave me another look to its main actor, Matt Damon, by showing his physical ability, and by using his kind of average charisma, as I said, to enhance the natural behavior of his character. Chris Cooper, to my opinion, is always welcome, maybe not his most memorable performance ever, but still excellent. Enigmatic, Clive Owen was a good surprise to me. Few dialog for him, but he astonishingly fits as an invisible sniper hit-man, I wouldn't ever have thought so! The haircuts and clothes were, maybe discrete, but perfectly chosen. Franka Potente was enjoyable too, it's the first time I've seen her on screen though.Sadly, I've watched a 4:3 (full screen) version of the film, so I can't fairly comment the photography, but it seems to follow the whole thing, being homogeneous and just right. The sound was especially well mixed, and didn't seemed to use typical audio FX samples for details like gunshots, silenced gunshots or engines, and it feels even more realistic that way. Lovely use of the surround sound even in calm or quiet moments.Clean and brief, but effective fighting scenes are something we can't miss. The (only) car pursuit was delicious, sharp, dynamic and spectacular, but still sober and realistic! Hard to believe isn't it?! The European settings were perfect and refreshing overall, even funny (for the pursuit).Obviously, this movie was a great surprise, and, to my opinion, stands above most ""bigger"" productions of the same genre.

"Espionage thriller has a murky, far-fetched plot...","As spy thrillers go, this one has handsome location scenery, car chases, narrow escapes and enough implausible fistfights and killings to keep any plot spinning until the happy ending fadeout. It's all done in a brisk, stylish, no-nonsense manner and played believably by Matt Damon (his escape from the top floor of a building would make Spiderman proud), Franka Potente as ""the girl"", and Chris Cooper who tends to overplay the role of a CIA man obsessed with capturing and killing the amnesiac-ridden hero. Matt Damon's fans will be impressed by his judo and action stunts that appear to be his own, not a double's. His overall performance, however, is a bit on the bland side and lacking in the urgency his character should be displaying.The plot is never given anything but a sketchy viewpoint so that the viewer is just as baffled all the way through as the hero is. This can become a bit unsettling as we go into the second hour of the movie still not knowing why his life is in such constant danger from the CIA operatives trying to kill him.

Jason Bourne...is dead,"Doug Liamn's The Bourne Identity, from a novel by Robert Ludlum, is intriguing, has plenty of tense/energetic scenes, and also, slower paced ones made to create a keen semi-spy effect- has originality too, which you wouldn't expect from a thriller from the Hollywood gene pool of late.Damon is Bourne, or was Bourne, before he was found floating in the ocean and picked up by a fishing boat where he has a couple of bullets in his back and, more importantly, a Swiss bank account in his hip.  This is useful, since the man has Amnesia, can't remember who he is, but can remember all of the old tactics from his past in instinct fashion.  This then sets him off on his mission to Paris, along with gypsy Potente, and the CIA, following his moves.You might sport familiar material, but Liman counter-acts with a structure, scene for scene, that keeps constant exhiliration.  Add to that, Damon gives off persistance of character that pays off all the way to the last scene.

Good not amazing,"Overall The Bourne Identity is a good movie, but it isn't fantastic. The ending feels anti-climatic and the ending also doesn't do well at explaining Bourn's past. Also the action scenes feel spread out, which makes me feel like if this movie was just shortened by even ten minutes it would truly be a non-stop thrill. However The Bourn Identity is entertaining. It's action scenes are exciting even if the last one is anti-climatic. And that's what it should be. However it doesn't go above and beyond like I was hoping for.If you don't enjoy the action genre than I would stay away from The Bourn Identity. However If you do enjoy it or you are the type of person who watches all types of movies than I would give this a go.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

The Bourne Identity,The Bourne Identity is a very good and interesting movie about the character Jason Bourne. Out of all the movies in the series this one is the character study. Bourne has forgotten everything about his past and spends his time trying to figure out who he is and it is all very interesting. Matt Damon is great as Bourne and the action is quite good. The story is great and all the supporting characters are good. This was the perfect start to this franchise.8.5/10,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A Very Good Movie,"It's been 7 years since its original release. I regret for not watching this on cinema since this movie is very good and worth to spend some bucks for (but I was only 14 when it was released :P). The photography was nice, the story line is unpredictable.I haven't read the novel yet. But I believe this movie was really well- made from the novel. I'll read the novel later. I'll continue on watching the second movie as I believe that will be exactly as cool as this one.I highly recommend this movie.

Fascinating (but different from the book),"To describe in just one word, it is : ""FASCINATING"". there is not a moment in the movie when you will idle out. I had no idea that Matt Damon was such a talented and famous actor. After watching this movie, I quickly ran to nearby stores and rented the next 2 installments of the banner.It is much more pleasing to watch than any other action or spy film I have watched.

Poor man's James Bond,"When I decided to watch the Bourne Identity, I had two major expectations from this movie:1) to explore the philosophical depth of a man's identity crisis (amnesia)2) to be an action-packed spy thriller that keeps you on the edge of the seatEven if it stood up on only one of my expectations I would have loved the movie. But it didn't.The movie tries to discuss the metaphysical significance of identity, but it was barely able to scratch the surface. It was a great opportunity for the creators to present the viewers with a meaningful movie.After realising that it has nothing much to offer on the philosophical side I expected it to at least have some thrilling action sequences, car chases etc.Except for a few fight scenes, most action sequences are boring and forgettable.Bourne Identity is at best, a fairly mediocre movie that lacks depth in the storytelling.

Jason Bourne definitely makes a good first impression.,"The Bourne Identity may be based on a 1980 novel, but when it was released in 2002, this movie felt like it came out of nowhere. This was an action film unlike any others at the time. It offers a more grounded look at espionage, which resonated with audiences, and even influenced the James Bond franchise's future installments. It's an intentionally slow and thoughtful spy thriller, with realistic and memorable action sequences.

An ending that spoiled most of the fun,"... I had with this movie. Now I won't get into any kind of ""spy"" discussion in the sense, that this is how Bond should be like or how 21st century spy movies should be made. Because seriously, if every other movie would be alike, that wouldn't be cool/good, now would it? Diversity is a good thing!Now this movie can hold up to any espionage/spy thriller that is out there. Matt Damon does fit the Bill here and it all (especially the story)moves along quite good! That is until the end ... this was so incoherent with the rest, which was innovative, in contrast to this cliché ridden section, that it felt to me like a cheat.

A nice clean beginning,"Bourne Identity has got to be one of the most excitingly gripping movies I've ever seen. Though I've never been a top fan of extremely plain action movies, this one has got to be an exception. Bourne Identity as played by a rising brilliant actor Matt Damon, who played Jason Bourne, an extremely trained assassin, whose affiliation is a clandestine even among CIA offices. The story begins with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon of course) whom he abandoned a mission due to unexpected psychological disturbances in his brain, however his desertion lead to his life's danger, as his target manage to kill him instead, but he narrowly escaped. As the story progresses, we learn how Jason came into being and went to search for pieces of his past. Those who manage Treadstone (a secret operative section of CIA where Jason Bourne belongs) manage to track him down for two slightly unsure reasons: one to hold him custody and bring him into questioning about his failure to complete his recent mission, or second to eliminate him because of the threat he brought, which was tantamount to their suspicion of Bourne betraying them for he recently abandoned a mission.I must admit that this movie is one decent project, and I never expect Matt Damon to excel very well and appear to perfectly fit the character of Jason Bourne. Superb certainly, for his uncanny character makes the story successful and effectively eye-catching for action-connoisseur viewers. This indeed deserve a neat sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

One of 2002's best films.,"The Bourne Identity is a neat thriller, that isn't always 100% realistic, but it's well-made with an interesting storyline and a underrated performance from Matt Damon.

It asks many questions and the mystery of the storyline keeps you invested in what's going on on screen.

Wish I could forget who I am after watching this....,I am a Matt Damon fan here in his home state of Massachusetts. I just bought a Hitachi DVD player and have purchased Rounders and Oceans 11 which I enjoyed. I got Bourne Identity as a gift but was very much let down by it. Female lead (the German chick) seems like a nice person based on interviews in Bonus coverage but she was a definite mis-cast for this role. In all the DVD Bonus coverages I have seen the Directors always say how important casting is. This is where Bourne fell apart. A bombshell with some charisma opposite Damon would have made this much better. In this film the German girl sports a hideous tatoo on her back and you actually hope she keeps her clothes ON. Also I couldn't understand a word the African guy was saying. Like I said I wish I could forget watching this but at least it was better than watching Celtics play Raptors. 6 out of 10....Don't BUY!!!,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
An excellent thriller is back !,"This is perhaps one of the best crime-thrillers , itself a remake of a mini-series in the early 80s with at that time one of the most popular actors R. Chamberlain and J. Smith , both ,again , based upon the eponymous novel by R.Ludlum . In the movie , we can spot similarities with Bond movies and the other like The Heat , Collateral , except that Bourne has perhaps introduced the genre of almost completely real storyline and fast-paced , non-stop action set in European capitals ( here Paris ) ; the main idea is to discover the identity of Bourne , who is in the beginning found floating in the sea . What follows is breath  taking action , claustrophobic chases , elements that are coming together slowly like in a jigsaw , and the final , nightmarish realization of one's life and mission ( 'You are nothing but a 30 million $ government property ! ' ) . Acting by everyone is top-notch ( From Mr. M . Damon , to Mr C. Cooper to , in my modest opinion , Mme F. Potente , who is , perhaps , one of the most underrated acting talents in the world cinema  recommend Elementary Particles , not to mention her girl-next-door magnetism . The movie was a big surprise hit , understandably followed by two sequels of a lower , but still acceptable , quality ( Why did his heartthrob have to die , no !! ) . Briefly , the movie brought back the good old story-telling , where shocks happen all of a sudden , and before you know it , here comes another surprise !

Matt Damon's European tour,"There's a nice idea at the heart of 'The Bourne Identity'; Matt Damon's amnesiac discovers a clue as to his identity, only to discover he has not one but many - he's apparently an undercover agent - so which one is the real him? Unfortunately, the film is not very interested in the true psychology of amnesia; Bourne is far too composed to be convincing for someone who has forgotten everything, and bizarrely, he is able to judge what he learns about himself as aberrant and strange (i.e. he remembers what he was not, and is thus able to compare what he discovers about himself (but has not remembered) to this, which makes little sense). The film has some other annoying features: the C.I.A. is represented as pure evil but also as near-omnipotent; the film is full of exaggerated fight and chase scenes that are less gripping than more realistic ones would be (for however action-packed, you can't help but feel you are watching a cartoon); and Julia Stiles keeps popping up for no reason whatsoever, as if the producers wanted her in the movie even though there is no role for her to play. But on the plus side, the production values are high, a selection of European locations make effective backdrops, the tension is maintained throughout and Franka Potente makes a sexy leading female. And some sequences, like the opening dissection of a wetsuit, are immaculately assembled. Ultimately, this is popcorn cinema, shallow and lightweight; but nicely done all the same.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Locations made this movie,"**Again last paragraph for serious review**From France, to Switzerland and the Czech Republic. ""The Bourne Identity"", does a wonderful job of using the scenery in creating dynamic, eye popping action. This is definitely one end of the spectrum in action movies. The other end of the spectrum would be around negative 65 and with that number would be the new release of the hit action movie ""Unknown"".This is mainly because Unknown is in Berlin and as eventful an action movie as watching an American women's basketball game. However, Bourne is a masterpiece in which I enjoyed the entire movie. Where as in Unknown I enjoyed booing the last scenes and applauding the end credits.Well its about time to fix my roof, because of those damn kiwi birds keep crapping and clogging my gutters, so lets get to the endpoint of my movie summary.

I would have rated this an 8 except for my big objection that I'll disclose at the end of this review.The storyline is rather credible given the current real world overreaching toward political opponents by the US Justice Department. The acting is excellent as are the action scenes exciting. Of course the action stretches reality but that's to be expected in this sort of movie. The banter between the two main characters is well performed and enjoyable as is the badness of the bad guys.Okay, my chief objection is the many blasphemies interspersed throughout.

"Review of ""The Bourne Identity""","""The Bourne Identity"" is a 2002 film directed by Doug Limon and starring Matt Damon. The film follows the story of Jason Bourne (Damon), an amnesiac desperately attempting to discover more about his true identity while simultaneously embedding himself in a convoluted conspiracy involving the CIA. Now, when I had first heard ""The Bourne Identity""'s fairly original and intriguing premise, I was already expecting this movie to be great. Did it disappoint? No. No, it did not. This is one of those movie's that just cannot fail - it has a rock solid story crafted by one of the most intelligent authors of our time, a brilliant screenplay written by one of Hollywood's most sought after screenwriters, and an intensely entertaining lead performance. ""The Bourne Identity"" and it's sequels are often credited with setting the par for most spy thrillers of the past decade - Does it deserve that credit? I believe so, for I have seen a multitude of films with similar concepts that have come out since ""The Bourne Identity""'s release. However, most, if not all, of the movies that have tried to replicate what The ""Bourne"" movie's have done, cannot reach the level of intrigue that each of the ""Bourne"" movies have reached - and they promptly fall flat in comparison. That being said, everything about this film, beit it's fighting sequences, it's car chase, or it's intense cinematography has made an impact on the spy thriller genre, and the modern film industry, as a whole. All in all, I felt that ""The Bourne Identity"" was an intensely entertaining thriller with a large amount of intelligence clearly woven it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
An Amazing start to an Amazing series!,"I wasn't very familiar with the Jason Bourne novels, and so I pretty stayed far away from the Bourne movies. However, when one of my friends saw The Bourne Ultimatum, he highly suggested it to me. So one day, a TV channel played The Bourne Identity (1st in the series). I watched it, and it was loads of excitement and fun. Story: Jason Bourne is the CIA's assassin, and on a mission, he gets shot and, when he is woken, doesn't remember a thing. But as he starts to befriend a young woman (Marie), things get serious. Really serious, especially when the CIA want his death. This is Jason Bourne's fight: for his life- and his identity.Overall, nice special effects, interesting story and characters who you easily get attracted to. I actually find that the Bourne Identity could actually be an amazing start to an amazing series. The end of the film kept the suspense for the rest of the series (I will not tell the ending in order to not show any spoilers). It is a great film that actually intrigues me into reading the novels starring the one, the only, Jason Bourne. I shall soon go buy the DVD's and wait before The Bourne Ultimatum comes out on DVD because it doesn't play any more at the nearest theater.

The Bourne Identity (2002) by Doug Liman,"Exploring the stories where the main characters try to regain their lost memories, after something have happened to them, are some of the most thrilling stories to be told; especially in the literature, comic books, plays, movies, television series and video games, where the main characters express their point of views their feeling of being lost, to be desperate to search in what they are looking for. Some of these stories will end with their death, after they have found the answers they have been looking for; while others will end with the main characters who are still alive, as they move forward with their choices without trying to commit any mistakes. The filmmaker Doug Liman seems thrilled to explore this theme, by adapting the book The Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum; as Doug Liman has been a big fan of the book by Robert Ludlum, to express his wish to direct a movie based on the book. After a long time of development, in 2002 came out The Bourne Identity by Doug Liman with Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Chris Cooper and Brian Cox. The movie's plot: After the mysterious man called Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is picked up by a fishing boat, he tries to regain his memory about his past and who he is; while he is searching questions to be answered, he realizes a group of assassins are after him. To find the truth of himself, Jason Bourne is getting helped by Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente), who will have a relationship with him. For the way the movie mixes the drama and the mystery, it surprises the audience in some of the most unexpected moments of the story, filled with unexpectedly surprising plot twists. The production designer Dan Weil has created the settings to connect the mystery, which have been elaborated with specific elements needed for the story to let the audience feel the emotions of the characters internally and externally; especially when the spaces of the settings, can be enormous and other settings can be small, to see how the main characters will get through the labyrinth they are facing. The costume designer Pierre-Yves Gayraud has created the costumes, to be specifically fitted for the main characters in the shape and the colors; especially for the way the main characters try to be not spotted everywhere they go, at the same time they are facing some of the greatest dangers in the road. The cinematographer Oliver Wood has used the camera in the dynamic way, to maintain the thrill as well as the mystery of the story; by capturing some of the most essential shots in every single camera movements and in every angle shots, helped by the specific lightings and shadows, which make the sequences thrilling and mysterious. The editor Saar Klein has created the narration's rhythm filled with nonstop surprising moments, to see how the main characters will move forward; especially when things will get complicated, to compromise the steps the main characters are taking. The score by John Powell has been elaborated with musical notes, which fuses the thrill and the mystery of the story, to become unexpectedly dynamic; by then changing the notes of the score with dramatic tracks, to see how the main characters are getting close with each other. Matt Damon did an excellent performance as Jason Bourne, a mysterious man who lost his memory and he is looking for answers; Jason Bourne will face several dangerous moments, where he finds new solutions to be prepared for, even when things will get complicated. Franka Potente did a well done performance as Marie Kreutz, a woman full of will who will do anything to help Jason Bourne to find answers; while she faces several dangers with him, they will lately have a relationship with each other. Chris Cooper did an excellent performance as Alexander Conklin, the head of CIA black ops program called Treadstone, who will try in all the way to stop Jason Bourne. Brian Cox did an excellent performance as Ward Abbott, the deputy director of CIA, who is actually the one to ask Alexander Conklin to stop Jason Bourne, after a failed mission has been accomplished. The Bourne Identity is one of the most thrilling movies ever made, filled with unexpected plot twists.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
An action-packed espionage thriller!,"REVIEWBOT Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is a man of mystery; he is found floating adrift in the ocean at the start of the movie with no memories and no identity. All he has to go on are two bullet wounds in his back and an implanted device which displays a Swiss bank account number. I have something not unlike this, so needless to say I was already intrigued. He soon discovers he has a knack for beating people up and escaping tricky situations as different CIA agents are trying to kill him. Along his way he hitches a ride with a young German woman, Marie (Franka Potente) who gets caught up in the chase and helps Bourne try to rediscover his unknown past.The Bourne Identity is a sleek film with an array of interesting locations throughout Europe to keep you entertained. The action sequences are fast paced, with plenty of interesting fight scenes and car chases without reliance on hefty special effects. It has often been compared with James Bond, however I find this irrelevant. Bourne is a grittier action hero, and not dissimilar to a robot which I find pleasing Matt Damon portrays the character well; a man obviously trained to kill, but with a sense of vulnerability. Franka Potente as the quirky Marie has good chemistry with Damon and also puts in a good performance.Overall this is an action packed movie, and a worthy contender for your DVD collection!

"My name is Bourne, Jason Bourne","The Bourne Identity is the first movie of a very successful trilogy. The movie begins with a body floating in water off the coast of France, pulled into a boat. Soon we learn he is not an ordinary person. There is something mysterious about him. He is suffering from memory loss and doesn't remember anything about his own identity. On top of that, there are dark characters lurking at every corner that are chasing after him. As the story unfolds, we get to find out more about him but there is still a good amount of unknown facts that maintain the suspense and mystery. This is a very well-made movie with a very well written screenplay, amazing action scenes (the car chase scene is just amazing) that will keep you at the edge of your seat until the end. Jason Bourne, like James Bond, is a spy and this is a spy movie but in many ways there are major differences which make The Bourne Identity quiet special. Most James Bond movies are one-dimensional in the sense that James Bond is the good guy and everybody he is eliminating are the bad guys. Jason Bourne, on the other hand, is multi-dimensional because he is constantly re-defining himself (and that goes throughout the entire trilogy) and the movie is not really drawing a clear picture if he is the bad guy or the good guy. This ambiguity is possible due to his amnesiac condition. For all we know, he may have been a bad guy before his accident but now he is defining himself with his current actions. This ambiguity creates a mystery around him. And the mystery is thickened through the identity of the people who are trying to eliminate him, mainly Conklin (Chris Cooper) who is running the Treadstone project (more about Treadstone in later movies). The conflict between Jason Bourne and Conklin, and Bourne's turning against the people who gave him the assignment adds a whole another dimension to the movie which is not seen in James Bond movies. I must say that The Bourne Identity is probably the best movie of its kind. It doesn't fall into known clichés, unrealistic action scenes, explosions, hero doesn't display any super powers, no special effects, no silly plot twists and turns or plot holes, all of which we are accustomed to see in average Hollywood production. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

A revolution for the espionage thriller.,"It really takes the espionage thriller to a new, and much superior level. Instead of ridiculously over the top action with whatever the highest form of special effects are available at the time, Bourne is very low-key with natural and realistic action, and no visual effects. That's one of the main reasons why I love it so much. It feels authentic. Sure the backplot is a little far-fetched, but the way everything plays out from it is so natural and realistic that I'm just blown away. Damon is brilliant, as usual, and plays the most convincing amnesiac I've ever seen on film (eat it Memento fanboys). Franka Potente is gorgeous and also very natural. Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are easily two of the best and possibly the two most commanding actors working right now, and putting them together on screen was just an explosion waiting to happen. The casting of this film was brilliant. The car chase is possibly the greatest of all time (only Supremacy's can top it) and I always admire the use of Paul Oakenfold's ""Ready, Steady, Go"" in a film, although Collateral did use it better. My only big complaint about the film is the complete change in the story from the novel, although I do understand why it was done. They had to translate the Cold War era of the novel to modern times, and it loses a lot of it's details in the process but they replaced them nice and neatly. They keep the central plot the same, just change around a bulk of the details. If you hadn't read the novels, you wouldn't notice the flaw at all and think that it was very properly handled.

superficial spy flick,"What exactly is it that determines the moral code by which a person lives? And can the very same person be a cold-blooded murderer in one incarnation, then become a virtual humanitarian when all memory of that previous life somehow gets wiped away?  These provocative questions are raised, though never adequately explored, in `The Bourne Identity,' a fairly standard man-on-the-run spy thriller based on the best selling novel by Robert Ludlum.  Written by Tony Gilroy and directed by Doug Liman, `The Bourne Identity' tells the story of Jason Bourne, a CIA hit man who has been suffering from amnesia ever since his bullet-riddled body was plucked floating out of the Mediterranean Sea.  Initially unaware of his secret agent status, Jason - together with Marie, a young woman he picks up in Switzerland and hires to drive him to Paris - tries to piece together the clues to his identity and purpose.  Essentially we are back in old Hitchcock territory, where the story's hero is being chased by all sorts of nefarious figures even though he himself has not a clue as to who these people are or why it is they are so anxious to put an end to him.`The Bourne Identity' might have been a more interesting film had it attempted to explore some of the more subtle implications of its morality play situation.  Instead, the filmmakers concentrate almost exclusively on the superficial aspects of its spy thriller premise.  There are brief flashes where Jason ponders the deeper issues of a troubled conscience, but they are quickly thrown over for the usual cat-and-mouse accoutrements of this odd-man-out scenario.  And, frankly, despite the novelty of the Paris setting and some impressive stunt and action scenes scattered along the way, nothing in the film really much engages the audience's sympathy or interest. Matt Damon does a solid job conveying the underlying sweetness of Bourne's character, but nothing in his demeanor or behavior can convince us that he is a government-generated killing machine.  What's missing from this story is any attempt to show how this character, whom we have come to view as comassionate and loving, could ever have done the things he is said to have done. That analysis would have lent the film that extra bit of depth it so sorely lacks in its current form.The film is at its most interesting when it shows how Bourne, because he is himself a product of CIA training, can use the very tools his mentors gave him to stay one step ahead of his pursuers and even outwit the professionals at their own game.The film features a relatively impressive car chase through the streets of Paris (though it pales in comparison to the ones in `Ronin').  But I can't believe that filmmakers are STILL using that old standby  the one where some workers just happen to be transporting a piece of glass across the street just so the careening cars can come crashing through it.  I thought that one had been put to rest, finally and irrevocably, 30 years ago in `What's Up, Doc?'",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
ENJOYABLE and DIVERTING,"I haven't read the book, but the movie stands up well on its own, and is much better than that PC potboiler ""Sum of All Fears"".The plot was intriguing and kept me interested throughout. Damon and Potente are well matched and do a fine job. She is a German actress who seems to have managed to speak well unaccented American English. The mystery of who the Damon character really is, and how he discovers his special talents, was effective. The fight scenes and supporting cast all were good.I didn't buy two scenes: Damon's Human Fly act outside the U.S. Embassy, and the Ride the Corpse Down Five Stories (and walk away??) act. The last one was a bit much to take straining credulity.But all in all it was a fun movie and I'm glad I saw it. Seven out of ten. Maybe seven and a half!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Brilliant action movie with an actual plot,"Jason Bourne Identity is not like the action films you are used to. It's different and has an impressive plot.The film starts with a man floating in the ocean, seemingly dead. After being rescued by a boat, the ship doctor brings Jason Bourne back to life by removing bullets from his body. Bourne – whose identity is lost and doesn't remember anything – begins a journey trying to discover who he is and uncovers some mysteries along the way.As I mentioned before, this movie isn't one of the clichés that involves lots of bungee-jumping, explosions, women, and no plot.The Jason Bourne series is also a book adaptation – which I haven't read yet – such as James Bond and Sherlock Holmes.Although I like the movie in general, I wasn't convinced with the fighting scenes. They didn't give me ""the feeling"". Jason Bourne is an agile fighter, flawless in combat. However, at the back of my mind, the fighting scenes seemed unrealistic and unconvincing.Overall the movie has got a decent plot, brilliant actors and neat cinematography. You will probably like this movie if you are looking for a more realistic action movie to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Nothing like the original TV movie...,"Funny that in the DVD bonus they never mention that this movie is a remake of a TV movie starring Richard Chamberlain (1988) which was a far better film. I personally don't think that you make a good action film just shaking the camera around like crazy, MTV style. There was more in the original movie and in the book that they left out in this ""easier"" version; so much they left out that this movie doesn't really have legs on its own. I reccomend the vision of the ""old"" film instead of this. Franca Potente doesn't really make a good acting in this one just like the other female role in the original film who is a very cold and empty character. Most of the characters in this new version don't have personality, they just stand there in the movie... MOst annoying is the boring soundtrack and the special bonus video by Moby. What does that have to do with the film? Another one of those useless video for a completely out of tone soundtrack.

Top Notch Spy Film,"Out of all the spy films I've seen, the Bourne Identity is the best. A movie filled with great acting, filming, and a story that keeps you guessing as you try and figure out who Jason Bourne is.

This is where a Bourne is born,"Much has been said about this 1st series of Bourne trilogy, where I am also now a participant. The Bourne Identity is the story of an ex-CIA assassin turned amnesiac who failed in his mission and shot up with two bullets. When he was treated by a doctor in the ship, he recovered from his unconsciousness but with a problem of amnesia as he completely forgot his own every identity. Then here is the beginning of his travel from one city to another for recovering his identity. He starts from Zurich then Paris. Really this should be ranked among the top 50 suspense-thriller movies of the present Decade of Behavior (from 2000-2010), due to its non-stop serious plot, actions and character roles. I personally did not notice any similarities with James Bond's movies as both are made in their own ways, except that both these are spy thriller. But many differences are there like this Bourne is much based on reality and innocence, while Bond possesses many special powers and orders from the head. He meets many new girls in new places. Surprisingly both their names are with J and B (James Bond and Jason Bourne). Matt Damon's portrayal as Jason Bourne is simply superb, and he perfectly matched with Robert Ludlum's evergreen character. His childish cute look with serious expressions pulled the audiences into better prospects.It was in 1996, when I noticed one of my school teachers borrowed a book of the Bourne series from a public library. I was innocent then about novels and stories except comics. Who could imagine that one day I would be one of this Bourne's fans? The movie has no much nonsense romance and love scenes, which were also only in need to clarify Bourne's identity. Yeah, Franka Potente must be appreciated for her newly presence in American Hollywood community and perhaps this made the movie more acceptable to the audiences. She looks matured and normal in her role, and ignites the proceeding of the story. Julia Stiles as a CIA operative agent in Paris also satisfies with her side and significant role. Casting on the lead actors was an excellent work of Doug Liman. I found the most turning on dialogue was from Conklin when he says to Bourne-""I send you because you don't exist"". This sentence thrills on the importance and the quality of a spy assassin Jason Bourne. Along these, Clive Owen's short but interesting presence also need to be mentioned. He clearly proved that he is fit for James Bond.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
I don't wanna know who I am any more,"The Bourne Identity is a gripping action-thriller film that was released in 2002, directed by Doug Liman and based on Robert Ludlum's novel of the same name. The film stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a man suffering from amnesia who tries to uncover his true identity while being pursued by unknown assailants.The film begins with Bourne being rescued from the Mediterranean Sea by a fishing boat, but he has no memory of who he is or how he ended up in the water. As he tries to piece together his past, Bourne discovers that he possesses exceptional skills in hand-to-hand combat, evasion, and marksmanship, which suggest a covert operative background. With the help of Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente), a woman he meets in France, Bourne sets out on a dangerous journey across Europe to uncover the truth about his identity and the mysterious organization that is trying to eliminate him.Matt Damon delivers a captivating performance as Jason Bourne, effectively portraying a man who is both skilled and vulnerable as he navigates through the perilous situations he encounters. Franka Potente also shines as Marie, providing a strong and capable counterpart to Bourne's character. Their on-screen chemistry adds depth to the film and enhances the emotional stakes of the story.The action sequences in The Bourne Identity are intense and well-executed, with thrilling car chases, hand-to-hand combat, and shootouts that keep audiences on the edge of their seats. The film's pacing is fast-paced, and the plot is filled with twists and turns that keep viewers guessing until the very end.The cinematography in The Bourne Identity is visually stunning, with breathtaking locations across Europe serving as a backdrop for the high-stakes chase. The film effectively uses shaky camera work and quick editing to create a sense of urgency and tension, immersing the audience in Bourne's adrenaline-fueled journey.One of the strengths of The Bourne Identity is its well-crafted screenplay, which combines action, intrigue, and mystery into a cohesive and engaging story. The film raises thought-provoking questions about identity, memory, and the ethics of government intelligence agencies, adding depth and complexity to its otherwise fast-paced action plot.The supporting cast, including Chris Cooper as a CIA official and Clive Owen as an enigmatic assassin, delivers solid performances and adds depth to the story. The film's score, composed by John Powell, also deserves praise for its pulsating and atmospheric music that enhances the tension and drama of the film.In conclusion, The Bourne Identity is a gripping and adrenaline-fueled action-thriller that delivers on multiple levels. With its compelling performances, intense action sequences, and well-crafted story, it remains a standout film in the genre. If you're a fan of fast-paced, high-stakes thrillers with a touch of mystery, The Bourne Identity is a film worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A benchmark for action cinema,"It's not often a movie comes along that could be argued creates its own sub-genre and then is imitated repeatedly, even decades later, but The Bourse Identity is arguably that movie.There used to be action movies (with muscled heroes and over the top explosions) and thrillers (often cerebral and of a crime drama setting). The Bourne Identity brings these elements together in a new way and with a new type of protagonist that we can root for. Jason Bourne battles to figure out the shadowy puppet masters within the government who are controlling his life, and we are not really certain if he is 'good' or 'bad' or something in between. Cleverly, the settings are across numerous countries (another much imitated style), and the action scenes are immersive and fast and shot in a loose and gritty style. You believe you are in amongst it.21 years on it still stands up as a quality film and you can see why it made the movie going public as well as people within the industry take notice. It created numerous imitations plus sequels and spin-offs but, ultimately, The Bourne Identity is still the benchmark.Negatives? It is starting to look a little dated now with the tech and some of the effects. And the scene in the last 15 minutes in the stairwell... I think stretches believability to its limits. Otherwise, this is the gold standard for action thrillers and highly recommended if you have not already seen it.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Worth watching for its scenes of action,"""The Bourne Identity"" is like a more serious James Bond movie. Although its premise is certainly not realistic, it does seem to take place in the real world. The movie also doesn't really have a villain. It uses the enigmatic and amoral world of statecraft as its backdrop. During one great chase scene, the ones being chased are driving a decrepit old Mini, not a sports car with gadgetry like Bond would have.The thing is that this more serious approach leaves you short-changed in regards to the plot. I never really understood why its protagonist had been tasked with killing Triple A. It's one of those movies that hints at a bigger plot going on behind the action, but the action is obviously the movie's main selling point. The hyperkinetic fight scenes are entertaining, and there are some fleeting moments that might cause the pulse to quicken, but what plot there is only serves to string these scenes together.Unfortunately, though, a comparison to the cardboard cut-out villains of 007 leaves you realising that the so-called villains here come up short; they're not cardboard cut-out, they're barely sketched. Clive Owen could have been a great bad guy, but he's barely in the movie. The same goes for Triple A.""The Bourne Identity"" is, therefore, only really worth watching for its fight scenes and chases, which are impressive.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A fantastic action movie,"This is based on a book series by Robert Ludlum and it was apparently a TV mini series in the 80s as well. I didn't know that going in which didn't really matter to me, I think not reading the book first is better when you want to enjoy the movie or show because you end up just comparing instead of enjoying.The action is non stop in this movie and the questions start right away mostly what the heck is going on and why is that guy doing that and who is that guy.The main character is trying to solve a mystery basically, and you find out information as he finds it out so it feels like your kind of part of the team so to speak which just helps to add to the tension in the movie.This is a part of a series of movies but it could be a stand alone, it concludes fairly cleanly in the sense it doesn't leave you hanging on a resolution.

"The Bourne Identity, my favorite film of all time.","As you can tell I am a huge fan of The Bourne series because of the fact that Matt Damon is my favorite actor and that I own the movies on DVD and Blu Ray, now on with the review. Allot of people thought at first that this was going to be a rip off of James Bond but they were sadly mistaken. It turned out to be one of the greatest films of 2002. It was rated #8 out of the Top 10 films of 2002. This was a great movie, to say the least every opportunity was taken which made it very successful. I say that this film made Matt Damon's career, not to say he didn't have great movies before that, but this movie was his best in my eyes. Him playing the character Jason Bourne made his career.The story was brilliant too because it had not been used so far in any other movie that I know of. I am not going to spoil the movie but I will just give a little summary. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is highly trained spy who loses his memory, but just because his memory is lost doesn't mean the agency that hired him forgot about him. So he is put through many obstacles because his agency tries to terminate him because of a failed mission. This movie is filled with action and adventure, it also had a great cast. Besides Matt Damon they had Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles.My favorite scene in the entire film would have to be The Mini Cooper chase. I thought it was well edited and well directed by Doug Liman. The action was perfect in this scene, when I was younger I would constantly watch that scene, I would fast forward all the way to that scene and just watch that scene. It completely obvious how many stars I give this film and that would be 10 out of 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

The follow-ups (Supremacy and Ultimatum) had too many changes that went too far and would not beat this one.

"A nifty, grounded thriller","Few could have expected the affect Doug Liman's adaptation of Robert Ludlum's novel The Bourne Identity would have on action cinema, and on the career of star Matt Damon, when it was released back in 2002. This well-crafted, relatively low-key action thriller takes the done-to-death spy-with-amnesia story and runs with it, avoiding the lure of throwing in Michael Bay-esque explosions and wisely keeping things grounded, as shady government types in dull black suits stare at computer monitors and make demands to their younger cronies that they have the information they require 'yesterday'.In the Mediterranean Sea, a fishing vessel picks up a man near death with two bullet holes in his back. The on-board doctor tends to his wounds and pulls a small device from his hip, which reveals a Swiss bank account number when activated. The man has no memory of who he is, and so heads to Zurich to recover a safe deposit box that contains multiple identities, a wad of cash in different currencies, and a gun. He opts to go by the name on his American passport, Jason Bourne, but soon finds himself chased by a shadowy agency called Treadstone, seemingly led by the ruthless Conklin (Chris Cooper). Evading capture at the American embassy, he pays pretty German lady Marie (Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris in the hope of discovering who he is and who is after him.Jason Bourne can now be spoken in the same breath as James Bond, and in fact makes the British super-spy seem ridiculous in comparison, especially the Pierce Brosnan incarnation. Bourne is infinitely more interesting because he is conflicted, tortured by a past of mass- murder and seeking to make amends for his actions. While the action scenes thrill in a refreshingly unspectacular way, it's Bourne's tender relationship with Marie that generate the most sparks. Potente is lovely in the role, and her naturalism and chemistry with Damon is the film's biggest positive, and there are smart turns from Cooper and Brian Cox as the grumpy old agency men and Clive Owen as a dead-eyed fellow assassin. While it may pale in comparison to the bar-raising Paul Greengrass sequels, Identity is still a nifty thriller with characters to actually care about.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Bourne Identity — Tremendous spy action but all in a very human scale,"The Bourne Identity made a splash when it came out and quickly became a reference. The action tries to stay realistic while giving a powerful adrenaline ride to the audience. What makes this spy flick interesting is that the main character is hyper-precise, an unstoppable machine, the settings are unglamorous, and the protagonists and their motivation simple to understand.That being said, the story itself is not simple, it's very captivating, and the main idea extremely interesting. The characters have a certain depth to them, and even though their psychological profile is not complex, it is well done. The camera work is incredible. The theme song is good. The action and editing are tight, and the details all work out logically.Matt Damon definitely plays one of his best role and gets you right into Bourne's skin. Franka Potente is just right as his lead female, You want to slap Chris Cooper's character, almost from the very start. Julia Stiles has a small role but at the time, it was a mature one for her. And Brian Cox wraps it up quite nicely, while the rest of the crew doesn't disappoint a single time.Now, the few little points I found that did work for me. The night sea shots look like a set. Terrible. Fortunately, you only see a few. The dictator is a bit over the top. And finally, the car would never have made it down those steps in driving condition, but that's a common movie mistake. The cars in chases continue to run whatever happens to them. Bottom line, those are all minor problems that you see only after watching the film many times.This is one of the great action flicks.

Strong minded intense mystery,"Jason Bourne (Damon) is suffering from amnesia. He finds a bullet in his back with a bank code and sets on a journey to find his identity.When you see a body lying in the middle of the sea, completely motionless you know you're in for something special. This opening shot uses a great mix of colour and direction, with a sweet silence to create a sombre mood that will instantly engross you.Matt Damon (The Departed) is Jason Bourne, the man lying in the middle of the sea. As a boat picks Bourne up we feel his memory loss and what follows is a flowing narrative filled with an intensity and interest.Damon's depiction of Robert Ludlum's character is wonderful. Silent and professional, everything that was intended.There have been many debates over Bourne and Bond. The British franchise is light hearted, has gadgets and has an overwhelming use of action encoded. Bourne however is more serious, professional and realistic. This first instalment of the series for example has realism down to the ground. There are consequences to actions, there isn't much action and there are no clichés. Not to mention this 2002 hit climaxes with so many unanswered questions you will be ripping The Bourne Supremacy out of its case without a second thought. Recent Bonds Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace have been compared to the Bourne series as they are darker and more serious, but these 3 films are much more sophisticated than Bond will ever be.This is by far more realistic than any Bond. Though the Bond films are funnier and have cool gadgets, the Bourne's have more realism, carefully choosing the action sequences and giving a highly intriguing portrayal of the American government and CIA.The narrative is consistent and justifies the genre beautifully. The film dives into genres of mystery, crime, thriller and drama, giving a wide perspective of realism of its own.The whole concept of finding his true identity invites viewers into the narrative and will leave you shocked come the chilling end. The dealings with the police fall into the crime area, and the dramatic turn of events involving beautifully directed memory flashbacks give this film a high dramatic turn.The music score is wonderful. Playing softly in the background it gives the film a strong intensity feeling and Moby's Extreme Ways finishes the film off beautifully",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
whos better? Bourne V Bond,"Jason Bourne: I can tell you the license numbers of all six cars outside. I can tell you the waitress is left-handed.

Now why would I know that? How can I know that and not know who I am?This is a great spy movie it sheik and stylish. However, bond it is not (thank god). There are no stupid gadgets and no point less puns, they are repacked with style and thought Bourne is an intelligent spy who use his brains instead of jumping into a situation headfirst. For example looking at a map before a car chase how many times have you seen bond do that huh.The fact that this film is set entirely in Europe makes it individual and gives it a little something extra, which is always good. The great cast grip your attention add Damon is a brilliant he shows Bourne strengths and weakness and give him a human quality. Over all the film is great and defiantly worth watching.

"What's missing in modern action films? Moral, Conscience, Character.","I think 2002 was a year for great action films. Spider-Man, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and of course, The Bourne Identity.It's one of the few action films in the last decade or so to really make you think. It's got twists. It's got turns. It's got Matt Damon. What it doesn't have is a shaky camera.Now, bare with me. I'm saying that in a more scornful tone than you might imagine. A lot of people don't like Supremacy or Ultimatum because of the shaky camera work. I, however, like to down Identity for NOT having shaky camera work. Why? There are several reasons.First, The Bourne series is one that should make you think while having your heart pounding to near-explosion at the same time. It should push both of your most valuable organs to boiling-point. Without a camera that moves around as if you were struggling to run just like the characters, I doubt your heart will race very far.Second, Bourne is like an animal. He moves on instinct alone, because that's all he was left with. Now, I don't know about you, but the normal camera work in Identity makes the film and the character seem too... tame. Too solitary, despite the violence. A camera can change more than most people realize in a film.Thirdly, the shaky cam is definitive of the Bourne series, at least in the last two. Every action series has something another doesn't. And what the Bourne series has is A) an excellent storyline, B) realistic character development, C) believable government action, and D) shaky camera work.So in that, I find that Identity is just too tame to really capture the true Bourne. In other words, the Identity is lost until it is found in Supremacy. It feels just like 'The Italian Job' with the 'tame' camera. Maybe it's because Bourne is still a white-knight good guy in this one. He wants to be tame.Otherwise, The Bourne Identity is the fantastic beginning to an excellent and enthralling trilogy. It's got the best romance story in any of them, and quite possibly the most believable characters in any action film. I'm glad the helm was passed to Paul Greengrass from Doug Liman, who went on to do decent work with 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' and 'Jumper'.It's fantastic, and that ending song, 'Extreme ways' by Moby is just too damn catchy to miss.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

We watch a James Bond movie and know he will come out on top, but that is less frustrating, because (1) over many films we have grown familiar with his list of skills, and (2) we aren't expected to take it seriously anyways.

The Bourne Identity A Solid Spy Movie,"The Bourne Identity is a solid spy movie with exceptional performances by the cast especially Matt Damon as the lead Jason Bourne a former government trained assassin recovering from amnesia who tries to unlock the secrets behind his mysterious past.

Matt Damon is terrific as Bourne and he proves himself to be a talented actor especially in the action/fight sequences. The rest of the cast including Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, and Clive Owen in a small role as one of the assassins after Bourne are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The action sequences are intense and somewhat realistic others not so much but that's okay. The chases between mostly Bourne and people are him are also well executed. There is some suspense and a little romance for the women which balances well between the action. Despite some flaws overall The Bourne Identity was much better than expected.

So thrilling,"When we talk about spy movies, we always think first about James Bond or Mission Impossible. We think gadgets, supermodel lovers, lavish glamour and the top edged super car each one of us would love to get an hand onto.But the Bourne saga is so much different. We don't have any of these. We just have a man, Jason Bourne, struck by amnesia after being found in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, shot and unconscious. A man who tries to find out who he is and how he got there. A man who is also trying to escape from a bunch of mysterious assassins relentlessly tracking him down to kill him and Marie, the woman who's helping him despite her in his quest, showing his unsuspected unarmed combat skills to survive.And we have a lot of action too, efficient and very enjoyable to see. Each of the combat scenes is really thrilling and so is that car chase throughout Paris. It's so well executed and you don't need anything more to keep us entertained.The story itself is thrilling as we follow Jason and Marie throughout their journey from Zurich to Paris, watching them getting really close to each other while trying to stay alive facing those CIA assassins. Of course there is no doubt that Jason is a CIA assassin himself but that's not what causes the thrill. Watching them trying to survive is what makes us so attached and completely in.The leading couple, Matt Damon and Franka Potente, are truly awesome in their respective parts. Matt is mysterious and cold. He's not much more different from the killers he takes down but he's opening himself with Franka who plays that ordinary woman coping with his own problem but whose life changes forever when she accepts to bring Bourne to Paris with her Austin Mini and help him in his quest. We are so far from the supermodel and the super car for sure.But that's something we should look for: realism. Those gadgets and the glamour is cool but so superficial. Jason and Marie are much more like us besides the lethal and instinctive skills of Jason of course. We're feeling so much more attached to them and this is one of the movie's strengths. Maybe that's what pushed the James Bond creators to rethink their copy and deliver us Casino Royale.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Masterpiece,"Looking back now, ""The Bourne Identity"" is an alluring string of pearls i can watch once a year w/o getting bored, which is no mean feat for a flick.In 2002, i joyfully assumed that any sequel would keep the level of excellency, but ""Bourne"" II and III are pitiful hells of devaluing ""Puke-Evoking Rapid Cuts Only Sedated Oafs May Acclaim"", which abbreviates PERCOSOMA: a popular but rather quirky cinematic infestation with the potential to ruin any otherwise watchable film. The trivia of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" proudly states, that ""The average length of a shot is 1.9 seconds."". Overdose of Percosoma. But ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" even tops it by the numbers.Anyway, I seriously wonder why this new-millennium classic is not among the IMDb top 100. With ""Memento"" rightfully ranking 29, and the last and IMHO worst of the trilogy, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" on 154 (by today's date), this chart certainly suffers from it's own peculiar sort of mental flaw.All this must be Langley again, trying to alter the public's view on the Bourne case :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"much better than the book, trust me","I just read another reader review stating that 'the Bourne Identity' was an inferior movie to 'Spy Game', and also heavily influenced by the Brad Pitt/Robert Redford Schlock-fest.But believe me, that reviewer was about as wrong as it is humanly possible to be. The Bourne Identity is fun, exciting, and totally enjoyable. I really liked the relationship between Marie and Jason, and the fight scenes were cool. That other review reckoned that the Bourne Identity borrowed heavily from The Matrix, again this is a crock. In fact, this is one of the first action movies in a long while not to do so. The action in this movie was believable, as was Marie's response to such extreme violence. This I found to be very refreshing, there's too many movies where innocent people have little or no response to witnessing insane acts of violence.Anyway, I read the Ludlum book after seeing the movie, and I honestly prefer the movie. Jason and Marie's relationship is more believable, and whereas the movie is taught and exciting, the book becomes boring and predictable.I used to prefer Ben Affleck to Matt, but this movie has led me to change teams. Matt rocks, and he also loves Australian Beer. What a charger!",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Excellent action movie...,"1st watched 12/18/2008 (Dir-Doug Liman): Excellent action movie about a man named Jason Bourne(or at least that's one of his names) who is found at the beginning of the movie floating in the ocean, who is alive but has been shot. He doesn't remember who he is, why he got shot or anything else about his past. He finds a chip embedded inside him with a Swiss bank account number on it and he ventures to try and find out who he is. He also has the unique ability to defend himself and is almost computer-like with his self defense mechanisms and he doesn't know why this is either. We find out later that he is being tracked by the CIA and they are trying to get rid of him. This is the basic storyline of the movie, but despite the simplicity of the plot Matt Damon is excellent in the role and is very believable in this character. His cohort and female love interest played by Franka Polente(a German actress), is also very appealing as the drifter who attaches to the wandering anti-hero, carrying some of her own baggage as well. There is a bevy of other capable actors and actresses who co-star and also help the movie. I won't give away any more of the plot for those who want to watch the movie, but that's really about it! Have fun watching it like I did and enjoy this simple but well played story! Watching this definitely makes me look forward to the next installment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
This Is The Type Of Care All Movies Should Be Dealt With Nowadays,"I have read the book, and I enjoyed it very much, it was a great book worth reading for everyone who is a fan of spy books, and like this the movie is good for fans of spy movies, as this is one of the best, it was great to see the great storyline unfold and they do it with so much care that it really serves the book one hefty tribute.The movie starts off well written and the action scenes are very well done. You can see at parts just how good ofa movie it is, with every scene the directing can be seen trying to reach a little further and makes the movies fight scenes, worth while every time.Don't get me wrong, this is not the ultimate movie, but it is definitely one of the best action films for sure, and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" was extremely good as well. Third was OK but lacked the charisma this one had.Overall, action and spy fans will love this version of the classic spy book, and they will also love the sequels that come after it, I cant wait to see the 4th one come to the big screen (The Bourne Leagcy)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

"Gripping, action-packed, surprisingly deep identity crisis spy thriller","The first installment in the ""Bourne"" movie franchise is a fast-paced, thrilling action film that keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat. The suspense of the shots filmed in dark lighting is intensified by the dramatic soundtrack, and of course there is comic relief when necessary, with bursts of wit that succeed in lightening the atmosphere. Mat Damon delivers a great performance as a desperate man who has seemingly identity crisis. This crisis transfuses unexpected depth to the film, especially during the tense conversations, and the even tenser monologues of the protagonist. I didn't expect a deeper exploration of the identity crisis in this certain movie, because it's an actioner, and that doesn't take away a lot from this movie. It also shows the audience the truth for secret agents' lives and the sometimes harsh attitude of the secret organisations that employ them. The direction contributes to the anticipation and climax of clutch scenes. The finale is both emotionally rewarding and keeps you in suspense of what comes next. It's not a torturously formulaic film, to the audience's satisfaction. Recommended to everyone who wants to watch an above average and entertaining action thriller.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Solid action thriller,"It feels like a lot of movies that come along and start new trends tend to be throwbacks. Action movies by 2002 had become Matrix clones and other high concept over-produced spectacles with little grasp of character, and along comes The Bourne Identity with its 70s paranoid thriller aesthetic combined with early 21st century technology that a few movies had touched on before in the recent years like Spy Games and Enemy of the State. Those might have been mild successes, but The Bourne Identity hit commercially in a way that led to mimicry for more than a decade. It tapped into a zeitgeist.Directed by Doug Liman who had a couple of indie darling films with energy got his shot at Hollywood with this adaptation of Robert Ludlum's spy novel which took the basic concept and made his own story out of it. Jason Bourne starts the movie floating in the sea off Marseille without memory, and within minutes I think the movie makes a mistake. We get our moments with Bourne as he struggles to ground himself without knowing who he is, where he came from, or how he can tie knots and speak several languages, but then we very quickly get the answers to all of these questions by looking in on Conklin at CIA headquarters in Langley as he explains the problems with Bourne's last mission to his boss. Suddenly, the mystery of the movie gets sapped out of the action and we watch as Bourne slowly catches up with the audience. I suppose there's a balance between trying to build tension by hiding information from the audience they get from the trailers and just giving into that reality, but I prefer it when movies act like their marketing isn't a factor. I mean, imagine the shock of the scene where Bourne gets attacked in his Paris apartment and the movie had given no indication that Treadstone had sent three assassins after him. It would be the explosion that suddenly opens up the narrative after about thirty minutes of tension building, and then we go to Langley. It weakens the first act is what I'm saying.So, Jason follows a series of clues that gets him to a safety deposit box in Zurich that tells Langley where he is. He picks up a young German woman, Marie, to drive him to Paris where he thinks his apartment is and to avoid the use of any transportation that might put him in sight of any surveillance. Meanwhile Conklin is using every aspect of his surveillance apparatus to get a track on Bourne. As Bourne figures out more and more of his past in tiny little pieces, Conklin gets closer. It's when one of his code names, John Michael Kane, appears in the newspaper after a deposed and exiled African warlord, Wombosi, announces his visit to a Paris morgue where the body of his supposed attempted assassin is that Bourne finally makes the connection about who he was in the past. It's about here where the story feels like it's fully on the right footing. Jason has caught up with what the audience knows, and he's making choices about how he wants to form his future knowing that. He takes the reasonably attractive young woman as his way out, and she's happy to be that for him.That the CIA won't just let him go dominates the final act as Jason sends Marie away to let him deal with the problem on his own.Now, the reason this movie hit wasn't really because of the narrative, its characters, or its themes, but its action, and that action is quality stuff. It leaned into the shaky cam aesthetic that had been slowly building and made it popular. It's solid stuff, implying frantic action with close ups while keeping the camera back far enough to keep the action clear in intermittent wide shots. The real highlight though is the car chase through Paris. Jason takes his little red car down sidewalks, stairs, and the wrong way through traffic as he evades the encroaching police. It's solidly filmed, edited well, and set to a propulsive song by Paul Oakenfold. It's grounded, exciting filmmaking that feels like a complete throwback to a different time.I don't entirely know how to feel about the plot's final machinations, though. Jason gets himself to a small apartment in Paris where he confronts Conklin with Nicki, the logistics agent in Paris, and it feels really small. There's fighting as Bourne leaves, but the actual confrontation with the man who's been pulling the strings feels tiny visually, and that feels like an issue because Conklin and Jason don't really have any relationship up to this point. So, it's a narrowing of focus on a relationship that hasn't really existed up to that point. At the same time, that sort of narrowing feels appropriate in general. His fight with the CIA manifesting as a direct confrontation of words (not physical strength or guns) with the head of Treadstone, the program Jason was a part of. There are parts of this that I both like and feel wary about at the same time. It's odd for me, but I think that's just a me thing.The Bourne Identity is a good little movie that could spawn sequels but feels complete enough on its own. It's got that right kind of mix in the ending where Jason has completed a journey but enough has been set up within the film that any sequel could take a new direction somehow. We'll see, I guess.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Bourne Identity is a superb and solid action thriller that took everyone by surprise,"I imagine a lot of people forget the more humble, stealthy experience that is the beginning of the Bourne story.When a man is found afloat in the ocean he finds he has no memory of who he is. When a shadowy covert operation begins to send assassins after him and watch his every move, terrible truths are revealed as he is on the run.Having enjoyed films like The Fugitive, The Bourne Identity was a natural progression for me, it is probably a massively underrated film especially since its own series got so bombastic. Identity is such a moody, quiet and real experience. Damon plays a very subtle character in Jason Bourne; a man who has no identity to define himself with, but has hard truths to find answers for. The film is not exposition heavy, even when it frequently bounces from our hero to the men hunting him, it maintains a strong sense of tension and mystery without ruining it with blatancy or over explaining everything. Something action movies do far too often. Directed by Doug Liman (not Paul Greengrass, who would continue the series) and scored by John Powell, the film is drenched in a great atmosphere of tension and puzzle solving.The characters too are compellingly human, everyone is performing extremely well here, Brian Cox, Chris Cooper and Franka Potente, Clive Owen is even briefly in this well cast film. No one feels out of place, unnecessary or poorly written.The action sequences are great too. From what I remember of Greengrass' follow-up Supremacy there was a lot of shaky cam, and I was surprised at the lack of shaky cam in this movie. Sequences are very well shot, giving kinetic weight yet not loosing the audience in the process (and this was after Gladiator, when everyone wanted to do shaky-cam!) There's an awesome car chase too involving Bourne escaping in an old Mini Cooper, very memorable stuff.All in all The Bourne Identity is a superb and solid action thriller that took everyone by surprise, propelling one of the biggest action/espionage franchises since Bond forward.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

One of the Best Spy-Thrillers Out,"What makes an action movie good? Is it the special effects? The explosions? The exotic women? The fancy gadgets?The Bourne series puts these questions to the test. There are almost no special effects in this movie. There are no explosions in this movie. There are no particularly 'sexy' women in this movie. There are no gadgets in the movie. On the contrary, the computers used by the CIA look like computers that were around in 2004. But I would like to put it out there that ""The Bourne Identity"" is one of the best spy-thrillers ever released.The Bourne series is really a blatant winning movie. It's gripping, it's confusing just to the perfect level where the audience has to keep watching to understand the plot. At the end of the movie, we want to know who this man we've come to know as Jason Bourne is.I think we as an audience should challenge ourselves to challenge Hollywood to make more movies like this. Movies that don't rely on that ""WOAH!"" factor. Movies that can make it, and be great movies, without sex, gore and violence.For you action junkies out there, don't let this review fool you.

Simply Amazing,"This movie, shot mainly in Switzerland and France, was one of the few movies I've seen that lives up to it's billing from it's days as a book.  I am more impressed with Matt Damon each time I see him in a new movie.  I think that he brings Jason Bourne to life very effectively.  The movie flows quite nicely, was well edited and well shot.  I'm sure it was difficult filming in Switzerland in the winter, and quite difficult filming in Paris as well. The director makes it look flawless.  Franka Potente, who I believe is a real hidden gem as an actress, proves once again that she has global appeal and that her effective performance in the movie ""Blow"" was no fluke.  What I really enjoyed about The Bourne Identity was the action sequences.  For some reason, most Hollywood movies over-do these parts of the film to compensate for a weak story.  The Bourne Identity doesn't rely on them at all, as the story would probably flow just fine without them, however they are well acted, well choreographed, yet not the focus of the film.

The Bourne Identity 2002,"This is one of these films that I always catch up with later post the hype, but totally enjoyable. The European locations totally work for me, and the public in general, 'Ludlum' knew that Europe provides the most cultural and evocative of settings. The slightly less credible Amnesiac was apparently born of the writers Vietnam experiences, so perhaps is more of a reference to PTSD,but he does not linger on it. Above all else Ludlum was an entertainer, and this shows in the plot development, sneaky CIA type organisations, departments of dirty tricks, and enigmatic assassins, which are plentiful. Along with excellent car chases and sophisticated weaponry. This is part of a very well made spy trilogy, and must be applauded; especially when you consider these films as a good substitute for the presently awful 'Daniel Craig' Bond Fayre.

Recommended for Viewers who Enjoy Good Action and Suspense,"This movie begins with some fishermen in the Meditterean Sea recovering a body they see floating in the water. When they pull the unconscious man (Matt Damon) aboard the boat they realize that he is alive and has two bullet holes in his back. After treating his wounds the man awakens but doesn't know who he is or any events from his past. Fortunately, one particular piece of evidence found upon him has an account number for a bank in Zurich which the man immediately proceeds to check out when he finally gets to shore. Upon opening the bank deposit box the man discovers several passports under different names, a large stack of money in various currencies and a gun. He takes everything but the gun and decides to use the name of ""Jason Bourne"" from the American passport. He then proceeds to the American embassy in Zurich and discovers that for some reason he is wanted by almost all of the law enforcement agencies in Europe and the United States. He also discovers that he is especially adept with guns and hand-to-hand combat. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that the overall story was acquired from a book (of the same title) which was written by Robert Ludlum and used in a previous mini-series in 1988 with Richard Chamberlain in the main role.

The only way the movie was made is Robert Ludlum is dead.,"It's sad when a perfectly good novel is used only for the barest of plots and character names.  It seems that Tony Gilroy made this adaptation without even reading the book.  Mr. Gilroy went for the ""modern"" take on the movie and threw out the ENTIRE premise for there being a Jason Bourne.  Carlos the Jackal was the perfect foil for Bourne/Webb.  By eliminating him, Gilroy, had to come up with a very contrived assassin ring that has been done to death - thereby eliminating any possiblity of sequels such as The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum.

Great thriller,"One of the best thrillers ever made, it has the reflective quality of Le Carre's earlier post-war spy flicks like The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and the TV dramas with George Smiley but with plenty of shoot-em-ups and car chases. The down-beat mini trashing the massed cops of Paris is so much more impressive than Bond with all his gadgetry pulling the same stunt. Great set-pieces but the best of all is the body surfing down the stair-well. Unbelievable. Matt Damon has a brooding presence which fits in well with the storyline and Franka Potente makes a sexy and believable sidekick and I'm glad they got together in the end, leaving a suitably open ending for the sequel.

"The film relives the good times of espionage films, building its own language, with intelligent characters and plots that are much more than they appear to be at first glance","With two films from the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise already successfully launched, responsible for presenting to a younger audience a spy thriller with a lot of good quality action, Universal Studios had the mission of adapting the first film of a new series, based on freely in the homonymous book by the American author Robert Ludlum. For this, the script was in charge of Tony Gilroy and William Blake Herron who write a script in which the action is only a backdrop for the development of the plot.After being on the verge of death for being shot, a stranger (Matt Damon) wakes up without a memory on a Mediterranean Sea coast. He manages to recover, with the help of a retired doctor, but his only clue to his identity is a chip that was implanted in his hip, where the account number of a bank in Zurich, Switzerland was engraved. In the vault of this Swiss bank he finds out that his name is Jason Bourne and that he lives in Paris, but he also finds some fake passports (with his photograph, but each with a different name), a gun and a large sum of money. However, he is soon pursued, without understanding why, and demonstrates several skills in self-defense and fighting, in addition to knowing several languages. He offers $ 20,000 to Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka Potente), who is struggling financially, to take him to Paris. After reluctance she agrees, because she needs the money. But they could not imagine what the future held.The Bourne Identity is a typical American film. After the rescue it is discovered that even with two shots in the back and floating in the sea, who knows how long, the protagonist is alive. If these possibilities were not remote enough, the vessel's captain is an Italian in his 50s who speaks English and has a hand so steady that he can operate our friend even with the boat rocking. The script also features the girl who ends up getting involved with the good guy, in addition to the thug, of course. But to tell you the truth, none of that matters much. However, things in ""The Bourne Identity"" will not be delivered easily. The slow start plot, soft soundtrack, very few dialogues and followed by scenes practically indecipherable to an unclinical eye, make it clear that the script intends to focus on suspense. Only gradually are we introduced to the main character and his personality. In a scene from the beginning, Matt Damon catches a beautifully arranged monologue with a mirror. He asks himself ""who is"", practically putting himself in the viewer's place. The interesting thing is not only that, but also the fact that he asks these questions in languages other than English, in this case German and French. Such detail already leaves a clue that, despite being an American film, this little will happen in such territory. Indeed, he is international, which gives an extra charm to the production.Director Doug Liman, at the time, did not have a very extensive resume and, of the three features he had directed, none were really action films. However, the filmmaker manages to print all the unique characteristics of the character and his dramas in this first film, establishing his mental confusion and the difficulty of finding his ethical code and motivation to live. Matt Damon, despite several interesting previous roles, none fit the rather peculiar ""action hero"" profile. Not even the actor's physique was closely related to the demands of the protagonist who would come to embody. Through his interpretation, the character transcends the cliché and offers nuances rarely seen in productions of the genre. Without going too deep, his motivations are very clear to the viewer, who believes in the drama and starts to hope for his success, even without knowing for sure what he, in fact, hides.The most intriguing aspect of the script is the philosophy that runs through it. Who is Jason Bourne? A killing machine under the command of the CIA or an ordinary human being, with aspirations to find love and have a family? Can Bourne (we, in fact) reject who he is or revert to his version prior to certain traumatic events? These questions, which are effectively and satisfactorily addressed in the film, can generate fruitful endless discussions. And those same questions give Bourne a depth that we are not used to seeing in this type of film. We deal with a disturbed, conflicted character in the extreme, not knowing if he really wants to find out who he is, despite the chain of events that surround him being inevitable.
Liman does an excellent job, but complicates it in a few hours. If we stick to the angles that Liman uses, we should certainly give the director credit for a very safe direction. At certain times, he gives priority to long shots in certain scenes. An example is when Marie finds Bourne on a computer. The camera is focused on the machine when we hear some voices that we identify as being from the actors and, instead of having a cut to focus on the faces of both, the scene proceeds only with the manipulation of the angle. This artifice gives an impression of continuity and loads the scene with realism. Another adjustment regarding the filming is in the fight scenes. Liman uses and abuses of closed angles and free camera at the moment when Bourne fights with his opponent. Such angles give a respectful speed to the event. We still highlight the scene of persecution through the streets of Paris and the final climax as the highlights of the production.On the other hand, what makes Liman's direction extreme is the exaggerated scenes. Okay, it's a fiction film, with very well-trained agents and a series of elements that make the exaggeration completely reasonable. The point is that this exaggeration was being used well. What happened, however, was that at a certain key moment the exaggeration was increased exponentially and, even more, in a completely unnecessary way for the script. This over-exaggeration is proven in a scene that Bourne throws himself through several and several floors in a free fall and just doesn't break all when he reaches the ground because he is holding a body. As if that was enough to feel his fall.The plot has sparse special effects, with a lot of emphasis on practical effects and the story and characters were in the foreground. It is as if Bourne represented - and, indeed, represented - a return to the shape of the spy film that even the 007 franchise had lost at the time. The gadgets, well-cut clothes and fancy fabrics come out, and the physical skills, common clothes and well-developed fabrics come in, with no appeal for attempts at ""world domination"". The progression of the discoveries that Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) makes is an integral part of the structure of the film. Everything is happening logically, without unnecessary imaginative leaps. It is quite true that, with the presence of Conklin (Chris Cooper) and Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) at the very beginning of the plot, we know what to expect from the investigated Bourne, but this process of self-discovery, which he does with the unsuspecting Marie, enticed at the very beginning of her flight around the world, is very well conducted by Liman in a clear narrative that does not depend on detailed verbal explanations.The Bourne Identity is exactly like thousands of other productions of the genre. What does it add then? Style, good interpretations and technical competence. At no time is it pretentious enough to be considered a milestone, something unique and untouchable. No, your goal is just to tell an interesting, fun and well-finished story. The work relives the good times of espionage films, a genre that must be highly respected, as it brought unforgettable franchises to the cinematographic world, such as the immortal franchise of agent James Bond, 007, building its own language, with intelligent characters and plots that are much more than they appear to be at first glance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
It is nothing like the book...,"I was disappointed in the deviations from the book.  About five or six things were similar:  the name of the bank, Bourne's name, Marie's first name, Paris, Zurich, amnesia.  That's pretty much it.  No mention of a head wound, his past (Medusa)or CARLOS!!!  Decent for entertainment purposes, but nothing that I would buy for my personal collection.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Unnecessary and stupid,"One of the dumber espionage films I've seen in my life. Not only does it NOT have any resemblance to Ludlum's book, it doesn't even deserve to lick the boots of the Robert Chamberlain miniseries, and when you're worst than a Chamberlain miniseries, you're REALLY bad! The film is one big chase where Bourne is pursued by dumb French cops (gee, isn't that an oxymoron?) and the Evil American Government (notice the capitalization) that goes around murdering civilians like they breathe air. There is no subtlety whatsoever and I'm at a loss why they name this movie after Ludlum's book. Talk about tarnishing a great book!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A great movie,"Doug Limans bourne identity is a great suspense flick, i like these kind of movies along the lines of James Bond scenarios. Damon is perfect in the lead as Jason Bourne an assassin who loses his memory and questions who he is. Franka Potente was good in the female lead he meets and befriends. Chris Cooper, Clive Owen and Brian Cox were all great in supporting roles. THis film is directed well by Liman who directed great films up until Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

A Killer of a Thriller Identified,"The Bourne Identity is an action-packed adaptation of renowned author Robert Ludlum's international bestseller of the same name. And it sure as hell isn't your average leave-your-brains behind thriller (which is sadly what many of the James Bond films had become). The plot is the primary focus of this film, which the mind-numbing action scenes, gloss and glamour taking only secondary precedence. The film begins with the unconscious body of a man (Matt Damon), with two bullets in his back, being hauled out of the Mediterranean Sea on a stormy night by the crew members of a fishing boat. When the unknown man regains consciousness, he realizes he has no memory of who he is or how he ended up in this predicament. The only clues to his past are a Swiss bank account number embedded in his hip and an in-depth knowledge of various European languages. The man embarks on a journey to discover his true identity. But the more he leanrs, the more questions arise. Who is Jason Bourne? How did he become a living breathing fighting machine? Why is he being hunted at every turn by the authorities and a mysterious group of assassins? Jason must use every skill he has acquired in an unremembered life to survive, answer these questions, and uncover the secrets behind the 'Bourne Identity'. The film is in no way an accurate adaptation of the Ludlum novel, eliminating much of the novel's complex multi-layered plot and backstory. Nevertheless, it remains fairly true to the spirit of the novel as far as the protagonist, his motives and character are concerned. The Bourne Identity is a character based drama. Unlike the book, its a story of people adapting to near-impossible circumstances, rather than about uncovering conspiracies and schemes. Damon's brilliant performance as Bourne is supplemented by an excellent supporting cast of Franke Potente as Marie Kreutz, the film's female lead; Chris Cooper as Conklin, a CIA black ops strategist; Brian Cox as Ward Abbott, a high-ranking CIA official and Clive Owen, in a minor but fairly significant role as the silent killer known as the Professor. All in all, a truly unforgettable film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Awesome! Possible spoliers.,"The spy genre seems top be a little out of steam these days. The only good spy film I've seen in a long time was Spy Game, saved by the two leads, the terrific technical aspects, and the human side it brought to the story. It's like watching the same movie over and over again, commmon endings, bad performances, predictable twists. I have no idea why people liken The Bourne Identity to these garbage films. Okay, so it was a disappointmetn to the book, but what movie isn't? The performances in this movie are very good, save Potente's accent changing, especially in the smaller parts like Chris Cooper's and Clive Owen's, who had little material to work with. First, I thought when the showed the Wombosi tape and the meeting, that this movie would take the common path and focus too much on other issues besides the main plot (Matt Damon). But that quickly changed, and I was presented wiht a very well shot, slightly cliched, but excellent spy thriller. The fight scenes were awesome, the car chase almost as good as Ronin's...but Ronin sucked besides that so who cares.....and my favourite scene of the movie, and tied for favourite of the year so far (with the final duel in Monte Cristo) is when Damon and Owen are in the woods having their spy showdown....I've always wanted to make a movie just so I could have a scene shot like that...but Liman got to it first. Oh yeah, Doug Liman....Swinger's was awesome too, nice switch. See it! This is top grade action thriller, a wonderful spy movie, and just a plain awesome movie....I don't know what anyone's problem wiht it is.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
I was disappointed,"I watched this movie for Franka Potente and I was rather disappointed with her performance. I thought she was quite bland. I never cared much for Matt Damon, but I thought Chris Cooper was very good. A decent time waster, but no more. I certainly hope that the sequel is better (and I also hope that Franka Potente appears in it and gives a better performance). 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
How does nobody even remember this film!!!!,"Everyone might think that Mission Impossible, John Wick, and James Bond might be the top of the spy movies, that's just a lie.Idiots like me just get confused by what this movie was about, I re-watched again. I fully understand what Bourne Identity's main plot was, it's about a guy who suffers amnesia, he doesn't know how it happens, he doesn't know he's a part of the C. I. A., and what just happened.The pacing was underrated, it was top notch. I just think the fight scenes make the pacing look really good at times. Cinematography was even underrated, it felt like I wanted to bring all my sodas, chips, and drinks.I'm surprised that nobody ever talked about this film, not even full metal jacket, and not even the big short. I searched up Bourne in youtube, tiktok, and twitter. Just to find clips, cringe videos, and criticism.Hopefully, one year the Bourne trilogy will revive back.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The first in the series is a solid thriller,"Typically I'm not much of a fan of the thriller genre but having just seen the Bourne trilogy I'm fairly impressed with what I've seen. This first installment, directed by Doug Liman, introduces the character of amnesiac Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and sets him on his perilous quest to discover his true identity.The cast is a good one with Matt Damon doing well in a much more action-oriented role than any he had previously undertaken. On Bourne's tail are Chris Cooper & Brian Cox, both dependable actors. Franka Potente, as Bourne's romantic interest, isn't bad but I could have done without the romantic element altogether.The story is a pretty compelling one once you get past the hackneyed case of amnesia. Particularly interesting is how the story here turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg, as seen in the two sequels. I will admit that I wasn't exactly thrilled with the ending here, though.The direction by Liman is workmanlike and is more concerned with constantly propelling the action rather than creating visuals that are interesting in and of themselves. The music fits well into the scheme of things, contributing to the mood but rarely calling attention to itself.This is a good thriller, sure to meet the approval of those who enjoy such films. I think that the two sequels were marginally better but this film is definitely an above average beginning to the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
All Action,"A mysterious man (Matt Damon) is saved from the sea having lost his memory. As he searches for clues, he becomes a target of a secret CIA operation.Based on Robert Ludlum's novel, Doug Liman brings to life the mysterious super agent. Matt Damon reinvents himself as an action star as the silent but deadly kind. Franka Potente is the beautiful Marie who befriends Jason Bourne. Sure it's like James Bond or any number of action hero. We're not having any jokes, no sarcasm. This is straight up, high octane, adrenaline junkie action. It's no wonder how this ignited its own franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A Letdown,I felt this movie was a bit of a letdown. I'm glad it followed the book and I was hyped up when it came out but I didn't get what I expected. The villains (if you want to call them that) do nothing but fill time. I enjoyed Matt Damon stepping away from Comedy movies (Ocean's Eleven) to play a roll he really looks like but this wasn't very good. I think this current 7.3 rating is just being nice. Glad Ludlum was on the writing team when he died. The good parts were his relationship with Marie and the beginning. This movie kept hyping up a huge showdown at the end of the movie for Bourne but I was letdown as to how short the final action sequence was. They could have done a better job on the ending. Overall if your a huge Bourne Fan this is for you. However like me (A Bourne Fan) I wanted a little more action to it.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The action not worth watching especially if you've read the book,"There is always a chasm between a book and its screen version. Some rare creators manage to overcome this gap and make equally good movie, although not necessarily mirroring word after word. But in the case of BI I agree with Krokor's from Australia doubts on whether the screenwriter actually read the novel of the same name or just heard of it. So, watching this movie (luckily, for free, otherwise i'd have regretted the spent money) i tried to forget what is it made after. The problem is that it didn't help to improve the impression either. The movie has too many blunders, the scenes which you just don't believe (it's not sci-fi, after all). I understand the eternal problem of the lack of time, but the explanation of the plot behind the Organisation totally lacked clarity, not to say the question with those secret pills.All i liked about this movie was the car chase - rather good promotion of the car. Though probably the character of Franka Potente should have looked a bit more upset about the injured Parisians in the car crashes, if she is so sensitive about loving the killer. But surely that question never was a problem for most of the screenwriters of the actions (anyone watched a car chase from ""Beware of the car""? that one is a good, although funny and unreal exception).So i can't recommend watching this stuff, especially if you've read the book and like it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A New and Engrossing Hero is Bourne,"Jason Bourne is not James Bond. The name bears a remarkable similarity, as does the world the super-agent inhabits, but the parallels end there. Bond investigates and spies for his government; he possesses alluring charm, perfect confidence, detailed knowledge of his enemies, premeditated plans, and an ability to murder anybody without warning. James Bond seeks violence; violence seeks Bourne. Bourne has no desire to take others' lives, but wherever he hides, the bloodshed finds him. When it does, he has no choice but to use his lethal skills. ""I don't even know who I'm running from,"" he laments. He must devise his next moves quickly. He is not charismatic and he has no swagger. The two JB's are completely different, but the brains and brawn behind ""The Bourne Identity"" prove both styles can succeed.A fishing vessel off the coast of France rescues Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), unconscious and floating face up. He has been shot twice and has a laser pointer imbedded in his hip. When he awakes, his biographical memory is gone. The pointer provides the only clue to his identity--an account number to a bank deposit box in Zurich. He uses extremely advanced martial arts to escape intense situations, and what amazing skills they are. He strikes with a superhuman combination of strength, precision and awareness. He seems to have eyes in the back of his head. His environmental perception reaches extraordinary levels, but he cannot understand why, nor the reason somebody tries to kill him in Paris.A mysterious branch of the CIA does know. Its leader, Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper), fears the implications of Bourne being alive and causing commotion. From his basement war-room, he directs a team assigned to track Bourne and put him ""in a body bag."" After Marie (Franka Potente) drives Jason to Paris, Conklin adds her to the hit list for his specialized assassins (Clive Owen, Nicky Naude).Few action movies work well without a powerful villain. Physically, Chris Cooper is the perfect choice for Conklin. His perfectly slicked hair, bass voice, and face, which looks like the façade to a vault of experience, make the perfect image of a forceful leader. Cooper communicates a lot of information with his mannerisms, mostly while issuing orders with fire in his speech.The great part is that we don't just see him give the orders. We hear them explained, we hear responses from team members, we see the field agents receive their messages and prepare for action. Liman keeps us in the room when he hear his underlings report what they have discovered and how. We see him update his superior (Brian Cox) and discuss with him the next course of action. These scenes add a special flavor to the film.The action appears at an unusual pace, mostly during the first hour. The best are the fistfight in Paris and a car chase that soon follows. Liman follows the top rule for filming action. Do not try to manufacture tension with rapid fire cuts or fancy camera work; let the quality of the production speak for itself. Just find a quality angle to let it speak. It is sad that Paul Greengrass broke it for the two sequels. Only Alex Proyas has permission to that.What is on screen is indeed high quality. It also reveals another difference between Bond and Bourne. Evasion is always his first option. While being chased inside a building, Bourne throws away the gun he takes, the third time in the movie he does that. Even in the climax, he only kills the guards because he has no choice but fighting them. Acting wise, Damon plays Bourne straightforward, nothing fancy here. Damon is understated, the correct approach for a character of that personality, yet he remembers that even a hunted man can smile.Potente is an attractive woman, but that is not the point here. Marie's function is companionship and transportation for Bourne. She is more than a sex partner. In fact, Bourne chooses to sleep on the floor when they share a room. Potente also remains toned down. Brian Cox and Gabriel Mann (playing Conklin's top assistant) both bring what their roles need. Cox has his best moment when he tells Conklin ""You never made a mistake before!"" Most impressive among the supporting cast is Clive Owen, who speaks volumes with his silence.""From Russia with Love"" is probably the only Bond movie structured like ""The Bourne Identity."" Both are heavily plot and subterfuge focused. The payoff is far better in the former, but ""Bourne"" excels more in its slow areas. By keeping a close eye on the details, Liman assures that no moment is boring. There are no Bond-like gadgets since Bourne has no Q to make them. He uses standard equipment in innovative ways. That is only one of the reasons why ""The Bourne Identity"" wins in all categories.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Fabulous,"This is a fabulous movie, an example of what Hollywood can do - now and then - to keep us interested. There is no point me summarising the plot as it's a well known movie and the review does not need that.This is an action thriller, of an understated variety. The character development is natural and the plot points unfold in an uncontrived fashion; this engenders a much more riveting engagement that the OTT 'XXX' approach. When action sequences occur they are filmed in a stark and 'realistic' manner and they are all the more exciting for this.Focussing on a few key characters enables us to build a relationship with those people, a relationship that really does make us care for them and their outcomes. They are not mere stooges in a non-stop cavalcade of explosions and an ante-upping pissing contest between special FX bods.The location shooting is superb, using the weather to great effect and really fostering a feel for those cities and their inhabitants.I am a latecomer to this series but am very much looking forward to viewing the other two films.Ben",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Jason Bourne Is A Character To Care For,"I give The Bourne Identity a strong 8 out of 10. Its pretty good.I have not read the books, Im not a big book reader anyway.The movie has enough to keep you interested. It has a good character, that is Jason Bourne. Matt Damon plays him well, he is very believable as Jason Bourne. You can really care for the main character. He has no idea who he is, what his name is or anything. Until he starts to beat people up, he thinks there is something very suspicious about himself, he was an assassin. That's cool. He was a killing machine, that know's a lot about how to work with guns, he knows some good fighting moves, but he wants to know how he knows how to do all these things, and who he was, and who he worked for. The movie is something you can really identify with. And I really liked all the stuff between Franka Potente and Matt Damon, pretty good chemistry, and the movie is a good journey and adventure, you keep learning the more it goes.A lot of the action scenes were pretty cool. Im not much for the car chase, but I like all the other action scenes. The fight with the assassin in the hotel room, the scene on the stairwell at the end of the movie, the scene between Clive Owen and Matt Damon, I like the Embassy scene when Matt Damon climbs down the wall. And the fights and stuff are pretty brutal. And Jason Bourne uses anything for his disposal. I like how a lot of bad guys are after Bourne.There is a lot to keep you interested and entertained, there may be a few weaknesses, maybe some of it kind of takes up time I guess.

I want Bourne in a body bag by sundown!,"The Bourne Identity is directed by Doug Liman and adapted to screenplay by Tony Gilroy and William Blake Herron from the Robert Ludlum novel of the same name. It stars Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Brian Cox and Julia Stiles. Music is scored by John Powell and cinematography by Oliver Wood.A man is rescued from drowning by a fishing trawler, he doesn't know who he is and he has bullets embedded in his torso. He must recover his past soon because he has enemies, and they are closing in on him.Prior to viewing for the first time it helps to arm your self with the knowledge that the source novel is an intelligent suspense thriller, not a balls to the wall action filled door stopper. Viewing The Bourne Identity now you can see it's very much about introducing the character, laying the foundations for what will become a series of films. Director Liman is in no hurry to tell his story either, I'm still bemused about the reviews that came out upon the film's release that proclaimed it as a high energy action movie and that it is briskly paced! It's a good film, one which doesn't lack for visual smartness, contains a couple of ""classic"" sequences and introduced us to a new action character, but really the narrative is very routine and lacks zip. While the ending is an anti climax and rather threadbare in terms of solutions and reward for having sat through nearly two hours of movie.Not the brave new dawn of action spy thrillers you may have heard it is, but the cast engage well, the script is mature and there's just enough carrot dangled to entice you further into the sequel filled nosebag. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Irredeemability of The Sweetly Retarded Matt Damon,"I laughed so hard at the ridiculous fight scenes that I had to shut the film off for a while. Totally unbelievable characters and film. Absolute suspension of intelligence and belief are required to watch the ""Bourne Identity"". The only positive feature of this flick is the genuine attempt of Matt Damon to be a serious actor. You really feel sorry for him, he is so obviously out of his depth. Damon is no spy. American Intelligence is a true oxymoron as Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are portrayed as two faced bumblers. Clive Owen should have been the main character instead of the struggling Damon, Owen and his craft are wasted and he has all of 3 or 4 lines in the film. It was nice to see Simon Adebisi from ""Oz"" in a film, even a lame one such as this. The fight scenes are mere cartoons and hilarious, and their pathetic execution are the highlights of this film. The one scene where a wild haired blonde guy with swimming goggles flies through the window firing a machine gun is the best. The fight continues in super fast and slow mode and once beaten and killed, the bad guy rises up like Nosferatu. It was a direct rip off of Jim Carey's fantasy fight scene in ""Dumb and Dumber"".

I found that the sequence of punches was so fast, that it was amazing to watch because it looked so realistic.  Which it should. The fighting style was new as well, one which I'd never seen before.  As Marie entered the picture, it took on a more spirited and colorful dimension as her character contrasted that of Bourne.  Even though Julia Stiles has a minor role, she does nothing to disgrace her reputation as a capable actress.  The roles were well-selected and the movie was a great success, in my opinion.

The victim of the spy will spy you,"I'm not a keen fan of spy movies, in fact, I have never seen one in my life, But when I watched The Bourne Identity, my style of movie completely changed in the space of less than 6 months, I used to like action movies such as Speed and Saving Private Ryan, which were arguably the best action films of the nineties. But this is now the 20th century, the time when films should have taken a few steps forward towards high entertainment. Thankfully, The Bourne Identity shows the best example of a futuristic action spy thriller with Matt Damon playing Jason Bourne, a 30 million dollar weapon as an assassin who suffers from amnesia, gets shot and loses his memory. The film takes us on a worldwide journey to find out exactly who he is. Being tracked down by surprising characters, Bourne finds clues as he makes the most of this roller-coaster ride using his energy to battle against his hunters in kung-fu style fights, exhilarating car chases, and of course the weapon he uses not so often, a brain.

I understand and accept that books don't always translate well into movies. That's okay just don't go changing the whole story either. This movie begins right (same as the book) but the thing that I really hate is that it takes characters who are sympathetic in the book and turns them into irrational evil doers.

The multiple countries visited almost get us into that traveling-agency-add feeling (terrible flaw in so many movies), but, fortunately, we mainly stick to Paris, which is a good thing. It would be a shame if we hadn't been given the Mini-chase, really nice work, just to say the action doesn't come short here (most reviewers here before me seemed to agree on that).In the genre, a great job with a little extra, what more can we ask for ?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"""Loose"" is the keyword","The promos for ""The Bourne Identity"" mention that it is ""loosely"" based on Robert Ludlum's book bearing that same title.  ""Loose"" is exactly the term for this film.For starters, there is absolutely very little connection between the greatness of the book and the littleness of the screenplay.  Indeed, this book-screenplay combo might well form the perfect example for illustrating the phrase ""digging a mountain to discover a mouse"".My major grouse relates to the characterisation of the protagonist.  In the book, it is one long, intense, and involving journey of self-discovery, one that the reader not only vicariously enjoys, but also relates to her own life.  The screenplay contains zilch of this aspect.Therefore, there is little sense in grading this screenplay.  The very concept is flawed.  It is pure F at the very outset.  Of course, if you were to view the film minus this background of the book, it seems an okayish thriller, but that's not the point.  Over here is a masterpiece that could've made an exceedingly good screenplay.  Instead, its gone to the dogs.The most awful thing about this whole business is that the book's author Robert Ludlum himself is the Executive Producer, hence, must've personally approved the screenplay.  I am afraid he's getting on in years, perhaps he ought to go in for MRI scanning to check for cerebral strokes.  No person in full control of his creative faculties could've allowed such a degeneration of book content, especially when it is his own.  If he rushed into the job because of financial considerations, then its a case of penny wise and pound foolish, for a neat job of this screenplay would've surely assured good business for the sequels.To sum up, losing one's hold on the creative faculty isn't a good thing at all.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The beginning of Jason Bourne,"Now, it's time to take a look at the movie that basically launched the directorial career of Doug Liman and marked the beginning of the Jason Bourne Franchise. It's also worth noting that this was a first time watch for me, now I've seen this movie in pieces and my mom was a fan of these movies. Now that I've watched this movie, I understand why this movie, for the time being, was revolutionary for the action movie genre.Positives for The Bourne Identity (2002):
The movie's premise is what makes this movie stand out and the way Doug Liman executes it is brilliant. You have a main character who starts off with amnesia and yet showsnoff an excellent set of combat skills and throughout the movie slowly starts to remember who they are and what they do. Then, you have the casting of Matt Damon as Jason Bourne and this is one of those castings where at first people were very skeptical and then after the movie they are proven wrong and Matt Damon is yet another prime example of this. Without someone like Matt Damon, this movie won't work because he does a fantastic job at playing this character who has so many questions about who he is and why people want him dead. Also, the cast is very good where you also have Brian Cox, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaja, Walton Goggins and Julia Stiles. And finally I enjoy the action sequences in this movie and the way how they are shot.Mixed for The Bourne Identity (2002):
There are two issues that whikenthey don't bother me y will definitely bother othr people. The movie's plot is one that has been overdone to death nowadays and I can see some people not getting into the movie's plot or care about the characters. And of course, the action sequences and the way they're edited together can also annoy auidence, although I've seen movies where they take this style of editing action sequences and go way overboard with it to the point where it looks really terrible (Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2017))!Overall, The Bourne Identity (2002) is a fantastic movie that was truly change the way how action movies were made and it's the movie that helped establish Matt Damon and Doug Liman as bigger names in Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Outstanding Plot & Story (yes there's a difference), characters, action, choreography, writing, cinematography & score.Acting is more than adequate. Just an absolutely masterful piece of work. Movie flows perfectly as characters fully develop with endearing flaws and genuine depth.

Beautiful Modern Spy Thriller,"This movie is technically extremely competent. Fine leading acting. Five casting. Fine production. Fine score. Fine audio & SFX.It's like a vintage wine which ages so incredibly-well. It takes style from the French new wave films & James Bond with a touch of aggressive Yakuza flair & blends it into a beautiful concept based on a book.The production crew is international as it is based in France but also shot in and around Prague and Greece as well. It is a true international spy thriller offering a fresh take on the genre when for a change the lead protagonist has absolutely no idea he is a covert hitman deep in international operation. He starts the film with amnesia caused by shock.It's beautifully screenplayed from the concept of Robert Ludlum, riip, who created the book which this movie is based on.Matt Damon comes-of-age as a mature actor with extreme pedigree as Jason Bourne & pulls it all off. He does the method-acting of De Niro & really engrosses the role from losing substantial weight to training in boxing every day for the role.It is truly inspirational stuff & a film i can watch again and again. The stunts are fabulous & very well co-ordinated. It is an extremely polished movie and deserves very high praise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Cliched but still entertaining,"I never read the book but I thought this film was very fun, entertaining and very good throughout. The action was crisp and it moved very well from one locale to the next.The plot may be a reject from every other b-movie actioner around but its still good. And whilst Bourne isn't a secret agent (of sorts), he is an assassin out to kill some African Delegate threatening to expose CIA missions in the Congo or something.I think Matt Damon plays Bourne very well. His Aikido/Jujitsu is very fresh, fast and he gives the impression he's doing it on instict rather than showing he knows the moves.Yes it did drag a bit, and yes every cliche out of hollywood comes out of this (for example: he's an assassin who cares - pl-eeze).  But I think it's pretty good for a cheap seat at a cheap cinema. I wouldn't go top dollar for this movie I don't think its worth it.Julia Stiles is also in this, but doesn't really do anything of interest. The most intreging character was Clive Owen's ""Professor"". Saying almost nothing but showing off his brooding James Bond/Tim Dalton with Glasses look.Its entertaining until the very end where Damon decides to go all out as Chow Yun Fat wannabe...but whereas Fat would slide down the bannister, Damon jumps off the side and flies down to the bottom. That one sequence is just plain stupid and funny at the same time when its not meant to be.Overall: 6/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Fell a little flat,"I went to this movie with high hopes.  I'm a fan of the book and thought Matt Damon was the perfect person to portray the screen version of Jason Bourne.  On this, I felt that I was completely justified and the action sequences were great!  I knew the movie would deviate from the book and I was okay with that until the very end of the movie.  I left unsatisfied because there was a huge hole left!  My husband, who has never read the book, also enjoyed the movie, but left unfulfilled due to the hole left in the movie.

As great as the book,"I was recently asked to attend a screening of The Bourne Identity and I said ""Sure, why not."" I mean, I've read the book a lot and I enjoyed the heck out of it and the other ones. So when I came out of the screening, I was REAL happy I saw it. My review starts here:The Bourne Identity follows the story by Robert Ludlum and the plot follows: Meet Jason Bourne. He has amnesia and the only thing he can remember is waking up on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. A few evidences of what has happened to him that he does not remember, like a bank account of millions of dollars. But the things that he doesn't know, is the things that may lead him without a future. The rest of the movie is an action-packed movie with great acting and great directing.Matt Damon gives a very credible performance as Jason Bourne and I enjoyed him all the way throughout the movie. Franka Potenta does good as what she has to do but her accent seems to change a lot. Chris Cooper is really cool in this one and I liked him a lot here. Co-starring in this are a few big named stars like Julia Stiles and Brian Cox. Doug Liman directed himself a true gem of a movie here.  He definitely proved that he is a great director. The movie was not filmed in a trilogy but the books are in one. I really can't wait for the sequels to come.Overall the movie is excellent on many levels and this could very well be ablockbuster of the summer. I recommend this to those who have read the book and just everyone. Rating BIG 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

The first ever great spy movie,"James Bond movies: The most overrated movies ever? Every Bond film is ridiculous, boring, childish, idiotically propagandistic (they still try to squeeze 'evil' Russians into the scripts) and unintentionally funny.Doug Liman did something that I believe no one expected to see. He reinvented the genre, by making a movie that feels 100% real (no Vin Diesel here).He achieved realism by escaping Hollywood as he shoot the entire movie in Europe. He also chose to use an intelligent looking actor, Matt Damon for the leading role. The script never gets cheesy or boring or unreal and I believe that Matt Damon being a great screen writer helps in this direction.Franka Potente is also very good, as well as the rest of the great cast.The action sequences look fresh and powerful, while they stay away from cliches. The entire movie is shot in a way that gives the impression that everything was shot on location, almost like a late 70s movie. Doug Liman really did a great job.I believe that 'The Bourne Identity' is something that will be remembered in the years to come and it is most probably the best spy movie ever.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A Contemporary Spy Thriller Masterpiece,"""The Bourne Identity,"" directed by Doug Liman, sets a new standard for modern spy thrillers, standing out with its engaging storyline, realistic action sequences, and compelling performances. In an era where many spy films rely heavily on special effects and outlandish gadgets, ""The Bourne Identity"" focuses on human intelligence and physical prowess, offering a refreshing and grounded take on the genre.Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, an amnesiac who is fished out of the Mediterranean Sea with no memory of who he is but an array of deadly skills that suggest a dangerous past. Damon's portrayal is nothing short of fantastic, bringing a mix of vulnerability, determination, and lethal efficiency to the character. His performance anchors the film, making Bourne a relatable and engaging protagonist.Franka Potente delivers a strong performance as Marie, a woman who gets unwittingly swept into Bourne's life and his quest to uncover his identity. The chemistry between Damon and Potente adds depth to the story, making their journey together both thrilling and emotionally resonant. Potente's portrayal of Marie is grounded and authentic, providing a perfect counterbalance to Bourne's intense and uncertain world.The film's narrative is a masterclass in suspense and intrigue. It slowly unravels the mystery of Bourne's identity, keeping the audience engaged and invested in his journey. The pacing is excellent, balancing moments of high-octane action with quieter, more introspective scenes that explore Bourne's struggle with his lost memory and emerging skills.The action sequences in ""The Bourne Identity"" are a standout feature, emphasizing realism and practicality over flashy effects. The fight scenes are brutal and efficient, showcasing Bourne's training and adaptability. The car chases, particularly through the narrow streets of Paris, are thrilling and meticulously executed, adding to the film's tense atmosphere.The film's setting across various European locales, including the wintry landscapes of Switzerland and France, provides a stark and refreshing backdrop. The cinematography captures these settings beautifully, enhancing the film's gritty and immersive feel.One of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to weave a straightforward yet compelling story without relying on over-the-top gimmicks. The plot focuses on Bourne's personal journey and the human elements of espionage, making it a more intimate and relatable spy thriller. The movie avoids the clichés often seen in the genre, instead offering a narrative that feels both fresh and grounded.Doug Liman's direction is superb, seamlessly blending action, drama, and suspense. He brings a sharp focus to the story, ensuring that every scene serves a purpose in advancing the plot or deepening the characters. The supporting cast, including Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, and Brian Cox, deliver solid performances, adding to the film's overall quality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Perfect action/spy thriller,"First time I'd watched this film in about a decade, and it has been too long. Twenty years old and still is as good to watch as anything.It follows a man Bourne (brilliantly played by Matt Damon) who is a man with a certain set of skills, who has forgotten who he is but is on the run from people who want him dead.The setting in Europe is stunning, the escape and on the run elements are great, the action scenes are revolutionary and it has one of the great film car chase scenes.This film was so influential that it was the basis for Bond and spawned a whole lot of sequels, TV shows etc. I'll watch all of them again, but I know that none will probably reach this film. One of the greatest action/spy films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Worth your time,"Finally a spy movie that does it right. Matt Damon really pulls it off playing Jason Bourne a operative working for the US government, who is found floating in the sea off Marseille, with a couple bullets in his back. He has amnesia, but he discovers he has many skills and knowledge of how to do many things that seem to be instinctual, but he can't remember who he is or where is from. He is nursed back to health by the captain of the boat, and that is where the real fun begins. Damon plays this role very well, and the girl who gives him a ride to Paris and eventually becomes much more than a chauffer, Franka Potente. With looks reminiscent of a more mature Claire Danes, and a sexy German accent. Every time she says Shiest! I fall in love again. Chris Cooper plays Damon's boss who is now trying to take him out, Chris you may remember as the Former Marine neighbor in American Beauty, he plays his role very well, and his final scene is both ironic and funny. Chris is very believable and a very powerful actor. Brian Cox plays the CIA Chief who seems to not know what is going on.. but there is more to him than meets the eye. Julia Styles is wasted talent in this movie as the operative who runs a safe house in Paris.Overall this is a good return to the old James Bond type movie without all the witty comments, gratuitous sex and gadgets. Bourne is a great spy movie, hopefully they will make the other two books into the series into movies too, with Damon I hope cause he did an excellent job. Haven't seen a movie this good in a while. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Does Anybody Bother to Read the Book???,"This is one of the worst movies of 2002. First of all it doesn't evenresemble the book by Robert Ludlum. They made this up as theywent along. It was all special effects and not much else. First and foremost, Matt Damon looked way too young for the part.He is supposed to be a master spy and he looked like he justgraduated college....ZERO credibility. Then the girls part was a doctor of economics , she was all wettoo. Then they brought in a trio of assassins to get rid of Bourne. Whata waste of talent in Clive Owen who is one of the best new actorsaround. Anyone who saw ""Second Sight"" will attest to his talent .How cute, they made the ""Professor"" (his character ) drive a BMW.After all those commercials he (Owen) did as ""The Driver"" this wasa ""cutesy touch"". Next , what ever happened to the character of Carlos? who was animportant part of the story (in the book).If you want to see a better version of this book rent the  TV moviemade in the 80's with Richard Chamberlin. He at least had thematurity and credibility to play Jason Bourne and Jaclyn Smith wasat least believable as the doctor who becomes first his victim andlater his ally.She plays  Dr.Marie St.Jacques, a Canadian economist whose lifeintertwines with that of the spy on the run.The TV versions also had better location shots. The new versionwas so dank and cold and wet all the time it made me want tohave a box of Kleenex ready in case I got a cold.I can only say that everyone in this film was motivated by one thing,to quote a great line from Sean Connery's character in themovie""The Great Train Robbery"". When asked why he committedthe crime he replies....""I did it for the money""....MY sentiments exactly.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
American directors cannot shoot fight scenes!,"With this movie it proves that most American directors do not know how to shoot a fight scene correctly.  Doug Liman is trying to make Matt Damon look like Jet Li, but to no avail.  The camera is undoubtedly sped up to make the fight scenes look more realistic, but that's not even the worst part.  The worst part is the awful framing of the fight scenes.  What is with all of the POV shots that American directors love to do in fight scenes.  I know that they are trying to put me (the audience) into the fight, but I don't want to be in the fight.  I want to watch the fight as it unfolds. Another director that does this in all of his movies is Michael Bay (The Rock, Pearl Harbor).  The only American directors that have gotten it right are the Wachowski brothers (The Matrix).  Once again proving that there is no action like Asian action.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Don't Forget Charlie Baltimore,"My first viewing of this movie was ruined by a coworker. As we were watching ""Bourne Identity"" he was pumping it up so much and analyzing every move Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) made to the degree I didn't like it. Now, about 15 years removed from that day, I had the chance to watch it alone and uninterrupted, and it is as good as my coworker claimed.I concluded years ago that you don't mess with any extraordinarily calm looking guy who's name starts with J: John Wick, Jack Ryan, John Rambo, etc. And you especially should be careful of guys with initials of J.B.: James Bond, Jack Bauer, and Jason Bourne. Bourne is an elite black ops assassin who happened to forget who he was. His route to finding out his identity was painful for a lot of people and deadly for others. He used what little info he had to piece things together while dragging Marie (Franka Potente) into his nightmare. It was OK though because she couldn't have had a better guardian.""Bourne Identity"" was exciting, clever, and suspenseful. And although ""Bourne Identity"" deserves a heap of praise I don't want anyone to forget Charlie Baltimore. Don't know who that is? Well, SHE was an assassin who also lost her memory and got it back in a major badass way in the movie ""Long Kiss Goodnight.""

It had lots of elements that I have seen before in similar movies in the same genre and it didn't really bring anything new. The whole amnesia bit was interesting and set it apart from other spy thrillers but it wasn't particularly original as a whole.

"If you haven't seen it, do so tonight!","This movie has an intensely-gripping story with excellent action sequences and a solid and intelligent plot line. The genius cinematography sets the mood for the movie: cold and dark at first, which to me represents Bourne's state of mind when we are introduced to him; at the end we see him in a beautiful sunny Mediterranean Sea setting which signifies that he has gained some illumination into who he is.The character development is superb and the action is almost believable compared with the razzle-dazzle of typical Hollywood productions these days. The storyline is strong enough that a ton of special effects are unnecessary- the way a movie should be in my humble opinion.Best of all, we can actually like Matt Damon for a change because he effectively portrays a character we can empathize with. The character is an action hero without any of the clichés we typically associate with action heroes - no moronic 1-liners and no cheesy muscle poses.The Bourne character has a workman-like approach to dangerous situations and seems as relieved as we are to get through a tough scrape. Damon obviously puts a lot of work into making the hand-to-hand combat sequences believable and reportedly does most of his own stunts for this film.The soundtrack is first-rate and perfectly compliments the cinematography to help create the mood of the movie.

Brains and brawn,"This film version of Robert Ludlum's 1980 spy thriller is equal parts brains and brawn. Matt Damon, as John Bourne, a CIA black ops spy who suffers from amnesia and spends the film piecing together the last two weeks of his life, uses his intellect as much as his fists. This is a smart movie, made even better by some wise choices for director and star. Doug Liman, director of Swingers and Go brings a refreshing excitement to this tired old genre, and manages to deliver some unexpected thrills. Franka Potente (best known for Run Lola Run) as Maria, a young woman who unwittingly finds herself involved in international intrigue, hands in a star making performance. As a viewer her character is the only one in the film that we can relate to; she's an ordinary person put in extraordinary circumstances. Look for Clive Owen in a cameo as The Professor, a hired killer sent to assassinate Bourne. In his three or four lines of dialogue he talks about the moral quandaries of his line of work. It's a beautifully acted moment, and a nice twist on the usual killer-for-hire character.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Matt Damon cut his teeth well in the action hero role and I think we'll be seeing more of him in this respect.  The plot was thin, to say the least and it almost turned into a road movie more than anything else. At the start when the premise was being set-up there was enough to keep me interested but the middle section seemed to run out of steam. The last bit didn't really feel like a ending at all, but went with the film. I feel that the film tried to be too many genres at once; at some points emotional, at others an action film and sometimes a thriller type affair. The pastiche doesn't work however and given a two hours rewind in time and this knowledge, I wouldn't go and see the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"A good story, action and a plausible ending","Action-packed movie from start to finish. Matt Damon excellently portrays the confusion in the mind of Bourne. The fight scenes are brilliant and although the hero is capable of extraordinary physical feats, he avoids the macho or terminator-like attitude we are accustomed to.

Some breathtaking pursuits in the streets of Paris that can be compared to those in ""Ronin"" and do not last too long.

Excellent Depiction of Jason Bourne,"There have been previous attempts to bring Bourne to the screen, most notably the awful made for TV movie with Richard Chamberlin and Jaclyn Smith.But this movie is one of my favorites that I can watch over and over again.Mat Damon really carries this off and captures Robert Ludlums Jason Bourne. OK in the book he is older and this movie is a different story to the book. Nut in fact, I would say that this movie is better than the book.There are things omitted, probably to keep the movie from going on too long, It moves at a good pace and keeps you interested throughout.All supporting actors are good, Franka Potente is very good and holds her own as Marie, Brian Cox is excellent as always and interesting to see both Clive Owen and Julia Stiles in relatively minor roles but carrying their parts off really well.The director Doug Liman must surely get credit for bringing to the screen this complex and interesting character.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Add some action and you got a very good movie.Writing this review after having seen the follow up, Bourne Supremacy, I immediately realised this first movie was so much better.The whole premise about Jason Bourne not knowing who he is and him finding out slowly throughout the movie is just a thrill to watch, you feel like the life of Jason Bourne is your own.Also there are some notable plot-twist or unexpected sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat. Some good character building and romance as last and you got a legendary movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
One of my favorites,"I have a whole stack of 2006 films to watch, but this came on again and I could not resist revisiting it even though I know what is going to happen. I remember reading this series when the books came out, and the movies remind me of that pleasure. Mat Damon is just fantastic in the role of Jason Bourne. Franka Potente is just so hot in a quiet way. I can't wait for a new film with her to come out. Chris cooper (Breach, Capote, Silver City) is also outstanding in this film.The car chase through the streets of Paris was fantastic! Only the Transporter can out drive Bourne. The action is non stop and intense. A super film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
One of the best films of 2002,"Bourne Identity is definitely Robert Ludlum's best novel. But can it translate well into a good film? After watching films like Sphere (based on the Michael Crighton novel by the same name) and Queen of the Damned (based on the Anne Rice novel) and after enduring all the films loosely based on Dean R. Koontz's great novels, I can say I wasn't expecting much out of Bourne Identity.Fortunately Bourne Identity proves that not all films taken out of grandiose novels turn out to be mediocre entertainment.  In the novel, the terrorist Carlos is the enemy.  Needless to say that had to be changed-Carlos is in jail now.  If you read the book, you will realize that a lot of chapters were simply skipped.  There was no option.  If the movie had had every chapter from the novel put into the film, it would have lasted more than four hours-just like the miniseries by the same name that came out in 1988. Despite all the changes made to the movie, despite all the deviations from the original story (some of them rather risky), Bourne Identity is a great film.Matt Damon is definitely a great actor.  And his good acting doesn't fail to disappoint here.  And Franka Potente makes a great sidekick. She is far from being the typical Hollywood good actress.  And this role was definitely for her.  In one movie scene, you will see Matt Damon cutting her hair.  Then she dyes it.  This woman colored her hair blond once.  Then she shaved it all.  Now she is letting a man with amnesia give her a haircut.  She just can't stop doing things to her hair. Not that it bothers me. Nothing about this actress is annoying. She was impressing in Run Lola Run, and she continues to be. Same thing can be said about Matt Damon. He was great in The Talented Mr. Ripley, and he was perfect for the role of Jason Bourne, an agent suffering from amnesia who must find out who and what he is, and the more he learns about himself, the more in danger he gets.Bourne Identity is far from being the typical spy film. Here there are no amazing, hard to believe gadgets that seem to come out of James Bond films. Here there are no amazing explosions that seem more like advertisement for good pyrotechnic companies than parts of any film. It is just a good suspense story equipped with believable action.This is a movie every fan of the genre should see.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Bourne Identity,"I'm going to keep this short. First off, Matt Damon fits into Bourne like a glove. The partnership between him and Franka Potente is excellent. In fact, the casting is spot on. There are many brilliant set pieces such as the Car chase and Bourne's escape from the embassy.The Story is great and thankfully ends in enthralling fashion. The film speeds by like a bullet train. One may complain about the action scenes and the constant shaking of the camera but some won't mind or even notice it.Yeah, good film overall and with two more to be seen, this film won't fail to hook you into the future of Bourne",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A top-notch action/spy flick!,"This action/espionage thriller is based on master spy writer Robert Ludlum's work and it is a top rate effort. Director Doug Liman gives us a good balance of explosive, taut action scenes, that are not overly long as is common in action movies, and engaging story that is carefully revealed, as it is given to us. The cast is strong, from Matt Damon's wonderfully natural acting style to Chris Cooper's no-nonsense espionage boss. Look for Clive Owen in an small early role.Damon is Jason Bourne, but he doesn't even know that much when he is scooped out of the Mediterranean by a passing fishing boat. At this point, Damon's character has two bullet holes in his back and no memory of who he is or how he came to his current situation. Confused and lost, he soon finds himself on the wrong side of the French police and quickly discovers that he has deadly skills and is soon being mysteriously pursued by more than the French police. A secret arm of the U.S. Government, lead by Conklin (Cooper) is after Bourne and his newly met running mate, Marie (Potente). The action heats up as Bourne slowly discovers how he is and why he is being pursued.This is a great action movie, particularly those who like the European spy vs spy genre. This has since turned into a franchise for Bourne and if y0ou have somehow missed the first in the series, then you should add it to your 'to see' list.(This review was first posted on realmoviereview.com)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
'Bourne' to greatness.,"My Take: Slick and stylish adaptation of the classic Ludlum bestseller.Robert Ludlum's THE BOURNE IDENTITY, adapted here in this 2002 big screen romp, is an old-fashioned thriller, but a heck of a good one. It's an old-fashioned espionage chase thriller, owing a lot to Matt Damon's excellent performance in the title role, and the superior direction and pacing. Like all good mystery thrillers, this one keeps us gripped, guessing and interested from the first frame to the last. I was hooked.The film centers on Jason Bourne, a man who finds himself in the middle of the ocean, with two bullets lodged into his back. he doesn't know who he is, and what happened to him. After being rescued by a fishing boat, he is dropped to France where he tries to find out who he is. He finds out he's a government assassin, a professional at the job, who the government no longer trusts. Now, he's a target of the government he used to work for. To escape, he aids help of Marie (Franka Potente), who also becomes a target of the same agency.There are a number of great chase scenes that follow. There's the Paris chase scene where a Mini Copper is chased by the police. The film is mostly in low-key, but it keeps the energy level really high. There's action here and there, but some really good thrills as well, and a tight plot that keeps us interested and hooked. The performances are great, as is the script. Overall, a terrific thriller.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Power of Observation keeps Jason Bourne ahead of his predators...,"The Bourne Identity & The Bourne Supremacy As a strategy consultant, & whenever I go to the movies (or watch movies at home), I often take the opportunity to seek out possibilities of using them to teach life (survival) skills to participants in my seminars & workshops.The two Bourne movies, namely Bourne Identity & Bourne Supremacy, are two great examples.Both movies are loosely based on Robert Ludlum's work, which included The Rheinmann Exchange, The Osterman Weekend & the Holcroft Covenant. They have also been made into great movies.In the first movie, with the opening scene: An unconscious young man is pulled out off the Mediterranean coast by a fishing boat one stormy night. Thinking that the young man is dead, a curious fisherman with a scalpel finds two bullets in his back & a microchip in his hip. The chip reveals a Swiss bank account. But our wet hero isn't dead but realises that he has amnesia. He then rushes to Zurich. In the bank vault, he discovers his name, Jason Bourne (played by Mark Damon). In addition, he finds a baffling pile of different passports, all with his picture, and a large chunk of cash. In the US Embassy, he bumps into Marie (played by Franka Potente), along with the fact that someone wants to kill him. Armed with a bag of money and superb martial arts skills, & with Marie by his side, he scours Paris for clues about his identity and past life...& finds himself in the middle of two assassination plots (one assassin was played by Clive Owen, as 'The Professor') masterminded by rouge elements of the CIA.In the second movie, with the opening scene, continuing from the first movie: Jason Bourne is recovering in Goa, India with Marie. He spots a mysterious dark-glassed man with the wrong clothes while jogging. He escapes with Marie but she is shot in the ensuing chase. The next scene shows CIA operatives under deputy director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) conducting a sting operation to fish out a mole in CIA but something goes wrong. Her subsequent investigation leads to the highly-classified Treadstone project, which apparently involves Jason Bourne. She even finds evidence that Bourne is behind what happened to her botched operation. So Bourne sets out to clear his name. The remaining part of the movie shows Bourne outsmarting CIA operatives - & the assassin (played menacingly by Karl Urban as Kirill) - & tracking down the rogue elements in the CIA with shady connections to the Russian mob, who have jointly framed him in the first place.In the two movies, Jason Bourne demonstrates his uncanny ability to observe & pay attention to what's around him - note: notice the exceptions in the details of the environment - which allows him to constantly stay ahead of his predators & at the same time, stay agile (mentally & physically) to anticipate dangers & get out of precarious situations.For example...remember the scene in the second movie...after he had jogged at the beach, he observed a dark-glassed man whose clothing & behaviour somehow did not match the environment...His ability to stay calm, size up dangerous situations & come up with super-quick, innovative solutions to escape from capture is well demonstrated in both movies.For example...remember the scene in the first movie, where he jumped down several storeys with a dead body as cushion while blasting his gun at his assassins running up the staircase...the scene in the second movie, where he improvised a weapon out of rolled newspapers & an explosive escape using a magazine stuffed into a burning toaster in a quickly engineered gas-filled room...Wow! that was great! Naturally, I am also fascinated by the many unique fighting sequences (particularly the one within a tight environment in the second movie), car chases, cat & mouse games, etc. in both movies.Additionally, what I like about both movies is the total absence of super-duper gadgets commonly found in such spy-thriller movies. Jason Bourne used only his sheer human ingenuity & creativity to outsmart his enemies.To end my review, I must add that I have enjoyed watching both movies, experientially as well as educationally.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
3 stars (out of 4),"A man (Matt Damon) is found floating in the ocean, miles from shore, by the men of a fishing boat. He is presumed dead, but, quite surprisingly, he is alive. Before he regains consciousness, the ship's doctor sees two bullet wounds on his back, and removes the bullets. He also finds another scar that hides a small object which projects some numbers and letters.After the man regains consciousness, he says that he doesn't remember who he is, how he was shot, or how he ended up floating in the ocean. He recovers physically, but still has no idea who he is.After he goes ashore in southern France, he uses the clue of the numbers and letters that were embedded in his body to start to learn more about who he is, including that his name might be Jason Bourne. He meets Marie (Franka Potente), who helps him, which is good since it seems that many people would like to see him dead.Meanwhile, we see CIA agent Conklin (Chris Cooper), who is trying to clean up after an assassination that was planned but never happened, by an agent who has disappeared.The plot is more involved than this, to the point where I wasn't 100% sure that I followed everything. There are some things that don't make sense and others that seem a bit unlikely, but it makes *enough* sense to avoid distracting you from the action scenes, which are the reason this movie exists, and which work *very* well. That you don't know exactly what's going on, especially earlier in the film, keeps the tension effectively high. And the acting and the special effects, like the story, are good enough to avoid distracting you.Unlike ""XXX,"" this film is definitely recommended if you're looking for an entertaining action film.Seen on 8/23/2002.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Great action movie!,"The Bourne Identity is one of the few great modern action movies.It stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a man with amnesia and does not even know his own name.

"Depth and intrigue within the action/thriller genre, but most of all very exciting!","Having never read any of the books by Robert Ludlum the Bourne series was entirely new to me. Identity is the first of three films (The Bourne Supremacy has also been released just last year, with a third coming next year), and shows that there is life within the action/thriller genre.James Bond and subsequent spy related films have become very predictable, but The Bourne Identity is not. Starting off with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), salvaged off the French shores by fishermen, the film gives the audience a disorientated feel as our own hero comes to grips with his amnesia.This is one of the key points to the film, like Bourne the audience is learning about his history following clues and getting mixed up with government conspiracy. It is from this plateaux that the film is able to deliver great action, photography, direction, acting (Matt Damon is excellent) and a car chase worthy of any of the 70s cop films.Notable members of the cast include Chris Cooper (for me is one of America's most outstanding actors), Brian Cox and Clive Owen.Overall an exciting film to watch for both film lovers, and analysts.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Quite the little action romp,"SOILER ALERT There was one bit of this film that made me jump, enough though I knew what was about to happen. This, for me, is the sign of a good film. Nothing truly original, but well put together and quite absorbing in places. If only Matt Damon had turned bad at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Surprisingly Entertaining!,"I passed on this film in the theater, but have since seen it several times on cable.  It is very well-paced and there are no unnecessary scenes. Unlike many of the other people who said there was no chemistry between Damon and Potente, I think the two of them worked because they were able to keep the focus on the plot.The Paris setting is great and they used it to full advantage. It wasn't merely the ""careening down narrow city streets"" stuff; it included some truly French settings such as Bourne's apartment building, which was fabulous (watch, it will turn out that this was filmed in Pittsburgh).It was nice to see Clive Owen in a small but pivotal role as an assassin tracking Bourne.  I was at a bit of a loss about Julia Stiles' role as an operative in Paris.  She looked like she would be more at home playing high school field hockey.  Her casting seemed thrown in to have more eye candy in the film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Superb entertainment. A masterpiece.,"One of my all-time favourite movies, and a role Damon looks like he was born to play (pun intended!) This has you on the edge of your seat from the beginning, keeps your mind racing and your heart beating. It's refreshing, thrilling, gripping. It's beautifully shot and directed. Damon and Potente are superb together. There is nothing I can criticize about this movie - even the sudden blast of Extreme Ways by Moby at the end makes the hairs on the back of your neck tingle.This is one of those movies that, as soon as the end credits roll (but after the song ends) you just want to watch it again. It doesn't matter that you know the plot, it's like a pint of your favourite beer or a chocolate fudge ice-cream, combined with your favourite fair-ground ride and catchiest song (not at the same time else you'd be sick.) Very more-ish. Very entertaining. Faultless. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
LIke the book?,"I read Robert Ludlum's book, ""The Bourne Identity"" at the recommendation of my father. I had never been a huge fan of spy/espionage type stories but he assured me I would enjoy the read. And enjoy I did. I absolutely loved the book and was so taken with the mystery behind Jason Bourne. When I heard that the novel was to be a movie, I waited with high hopes, knowing what an amazing story would be put to screen.Unfortunately though, I was not so blown away. While I realize it is hard to fit a book of 250 pages plus into a 1 1/2 hr film, I felt that there were so many important things that were left out of the film. The film got turned into just another action movie with cool fight scenes and guns. While I do admit the fight scenes were choreographed well, this wasn't really an action story. So much of the story is about Jason Bourne struggling to know who he is and what he is. It is a mindtrip keeping a reader turning the pages to know what is going to happen next. The film gave the viewer this sense of uncertainty and mystery, but not the way the book does. Something was lost. In the film, the time lapses were too short and the answers are given too quickly. Rather than leaving Jason and the audience guessing and guessing, the suspension got lost in a shoot-out. Nor does the audience really connect with Jason as a character and what he is going through. In the book, the reader really gets inside Jason's head and we are as lost as he is. We discover things as he discovers them. I feel that the film could have done a better job of connecting the audience to the character.Over all, not a bad film, but if you enjoy this sort of story, please read the book and the ones that follow, the series is purely enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Better than Bond ... ""Bourne,  Jason Bourne.""","After recently viewing and re-viewing, I find The Bourne Identity to be one of the finest examples of the action/thriller genre. There are many scenes where no dialog occurs and the visual imagery is allowed to tell the story. (first, aboard ship, having bullets and capsule removed; escape from US embassy; safe deposit box discovery; apt in Paris; showdown at country house ...) I think this AND the next in the series, The Bourne Supremacy, are better Bond films, then any Bond film. The action, romance and intrigue are all there, just without the smarmy grin of silliness. Just exceptional film making in the genre that often doesn't take the time to do it well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Well worth your time!,"This is one of the better action/thrillers I've seen in a long time. It's detailed and balanced and don't get to advanced and hard to follow. The Bourne Identity is a decent and enjoyable movie! One man with no recollection of who he is, is found floating in the Mediterranian with bullets in his back by some fishermen. When he comes back to shore it turns out he is wanted, but he don't have a clue why.What I really liked about this movie is that you follow the character Jason Bourne very close. You hardly vet to know more then he knows and so you kind of experience the same confusion he has. Now, while some movies that follows characters this way may get too confusing this don't. Spy/thriller/action movies may have a tendency to get very high-tech with lots of techno-babble and gadgets that can do just about anything. This movie has a great lack of these elements something I find quite nice. It gives you one less thing to focus on and it's not necessary neither as the story is well written and the movie keeps you glued. There is no need for stuff like this to cover a bad story.The cast is great. Matt Damon does a great job as Jason Bourne and Franka Potente is a good Marie. They are both good characters and you get to know them just as much as you need to relate too them. I think it's a good idea to use European actors to act Europeans and not use American as is seen a little too often. It gives more credibility to the movie. I can say the same for the use of actual locations. Like it! The effects are good. There really aren't many special effects and that's good. Cause this movie don't need any. It however got some pretty nice stunts and driving scenes that fits like a glove! The stunts are well executed and well coordinated. It simply looks good. Many action movies often contains a lot of blood. You'll find blood, but not in the same amounts as in many other films like this. There are also relatively little shooting, never the less this movie is filled with action.The movie is nice scored, however, you don't pay attention to the music. In the hottest action scenes there are low or no music and in most scenes with music the music is just way back in the background. It's not bad so why they've done this I don't know, but it works. It's like the music only affects the subconscious and does so well.All in all this makes up a pretty nice action/thriller that is well worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Pretty Ridiculous,"What happened to ""Carlos"" in this new version? I guess he was out of date for the Y chromosome generation, huh? In this film, Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne like he was some kind of James Bond-like *superman* who get nary a scratch while fighting his many opponents. He even gets to beat up policeman and U.S. Embassy staff like there's no tomorrow while trying to find out who he is. He's like an unstoppable robot who's martial arts skills put Wesley Snipes in BLADE to shame. I suppose this, as well as the MTV-style editing and quick cuts will appeal to the teen and twenty-something head-banger idiots who think this is hot stuff, but I found it utterly implausible and ridiculous. An insult to my intelligence.At least Richard Chamberlain was more believable as a man who was caught up in events beyond his control. Even in the 1988 miniseries, Chamberlain handles a gun very awkwardly and doesn't fight very well so as far as I'm concerned, he makes a more believable Jason Bourne than Damon does. Plus that was more faithful to the Ludlum book than this pile of crap.Grade: F",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Bourne to kill,"The Bourne Identity is a spy film that was loosely based on Robert Ludlum's novel of the same title. It stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, an amnesiac attempting to discover his true identity amidst a clandestine conspiracy within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). It also stars Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Brian Cox and Julia Stiles. This film is the first in the Bourne film series, being followed by The Bourne Supremacy,and The Bourne Ultimatum. The fourth movie, The Bourne Legacy, is scheduled for release in July 2012. The film was directed by Doug Liman and adapted for the screen by Tony Gilroy and William Blake Herron.The Bourne Identity starts as Jason Bourne,a barely alive amnesiac with a pair of bullet wounds in his back, pulled from the Mediterranean by Italian fishermen. Bourne's only clue to his own identity is a bank account number etched on a capsule implanted in his body. He quickly finds the Zurich bank where money, a gun, and a few identification documents await, but after he's pursued by security goons at the American consulate, Bourne realizes he can trust no one and offers a German gypsy named Marie ten thousand dollars for a ride to Paris. Encountering more professional killers bent on his destruction, Bourne discovers that he possesses a surprising degree of skill in combat, martial arts, and linguistics -- handy talents that clearly indicate his past includes work as a spy and assassin, but for whom? With Marie's reluctant help, Bourne edges closer to the truth, something CIA officials want concealed at all costs.The Bourne Identity is not just an ordinary spy thriller. It is first- rate with grit and lots of intrigue. It is a movie that that showcases stunning visuals, great acting and a story that will keep you engaged and absorbed from start to finish. Matt Damon tries his best and delivers in his performance as Jason Bourne.Overall,The Bourne Identity is an action film whose primary focus is on on character and interesting story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Slam-bang sheisse smart,"I had wanted to see this one for a while due to some good reviews and of course the combination of Doug Liman directing Franka Potente in a spy movie.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting to be all that impressed with Damon.  However, he ends up doing a marvelous job of portraying a seemingly average Joe in a no-memory predicament (think Leonard Shelby) who seems to have the instincts of James Bond and Bruce Lee together (the embassy sequence is especially savvy.)  The action sequences here feel realistic also, (with the possible exception of that final stunt), and the showdown between Clive Owen and Damon is very tight and unusually quiet for a Hollywood thriller. Actually, the setting, direction, editing, music, frequent use of subtitles, and the use of Franka Potente (brilliant pairing, but why do they go from making out to him sleeping on the floor?) as Damon's love interest make this whole thing feel very much like a European spy thriller.  I felt like I was watching a Luc Besson film, but Besson hasn't done anything this good in years.  The ending does a very good job of pulling together the loose ends, and I heard they had a hard time figuring out what to do.  Kudos for making it work.Our reel had some problems (It's been playing every night since June 14, so I forgive the projectionist!) and so a few plot points were missed.  What was Alliance Securities, and how did they find it?  How was Kane connected to the boat?  How did Bourne know that pressing R on his phone would link him to the Hotel Regina?  How did Wombosi or Bourne know to go to that morgue to search for the body, and whose body WAS in the bag, if not his?  I might just go see it again, so it makes more sense.So far, Hollywood this summer has provided some really inventive films. Insomnia, Star Wars Episode II, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Bourne Identity, Reign of Fire, Road to Perdition, Austin Powers 3, even Minority Report with its cliched ending provided some cool moments.  Keep it up guys!  It seems we're going through a bit of a rebirth!",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
secret agent with ID crisis because of amnesia,"`The Bourne Identity' is about a government agent gone wrong after he was thrown off of a boat and began to suffer from amnesia. It's kind of like a James Bond movie only there is no back up and everyone's against him. The film is set mostly in Paris, where the address in a safe deposit box from Zurich is. Through out I had trouble spotting a scene that didn't have a gun involved at some point or there wasn't some poor guy have the s**t kicked out of him as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) questioned him in order to get some idea of who he was and why he was thrown in to the ocean and shot in the back. As he gets his address, nine passports and ton of cash from the safe deposit box he meets a woman called Marie Krentz (Franka Potente) who also is on run as Damon pays her $10,000  for a ride to Paris, Where he gives her another ten grand. The film over all was very entertaining but didn't have the most original story. Despite the odd  bit of boredom I liked the movie and probably would recommend it to people who enjoy watching  people running around with guns and I will give it three and a half stars out of five because, after all it was entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"""Oh My God That's Jason Bourne""","What an amazing movie, I thought I'd jump straight in with the review with applauding how utterly breathtaking this movie was. As far as spy thrillers are concerned this holds number one on ALL lists concerning the genre, Jason Bourne is one of those movies that I would always watch if I saw it on, had the dads, I just love this series I've even read the books.This film has superb acting, a phenomenal story that you can continue with 4 more movies, move over 007. Out of all the Bourne movies this is detinately my favourite, A MUST SEE if you ask me.Matt Damon was born to play this role, I know most people say stuff like this as they are used to the actor and can't imagine anyone else playing the character, I truly believe that how comfortable he is in the role he was truly born to play Jason Bourne.Bourne will always hold a special place in my heart, cant say a bad word about any of it.

a true depiction of modern espionage,"This is by far the best spy film ever made! It is very realistic with their display of realistic trade-craft, and real ""gadgets"". I enjoy the Bond films but I fell they are nothing in comparison to the Bourne identity or the Bourne movies that followed. I definitely found it to be a much anticipated change from the modern cliché's often put out by the Bond films.I greatly enjoyed the fight scenes throughout the movie for their short and snappy appearance which is much more like a real fight. All of Bourne's gadgets are real and can be bought by anyone so I think it makes it all the better. In the Bond films he relied greatly on gadgets and gizmo's and the films where all around very fictionalized and pale in comparison to the Bourne movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
An all round terrible film,"I truly believe that this is the worst mid- to high-budget film I've ever seen. I don't want to insult the author of the books, for the sequel was quite enjoyable, but this film was indescribably bad - in fact, I feel that in all future DVD releases of the trilogy it should be ruthlessly cut down into a 10 minute introduction to the second installation.Where to start? The plot. There is no plot. Other than the tired old premise of someone important losing their memory and turning against their former companions, which isn't really properly explored. The ending leaves much to be desired, such as an ending other than one you might write at 3 AM to meet a deadline.Since the film was produced for an American audience, it would be unfair and stupid to complain that all of the French people were speaking English. I'm willing to accept that we're watching a magic translation of some kind, but not when they dip in and out of French, making it clear that they are supposed to be speaking largely English. Why were all the American agents large Englishmen with Yorkshire accents? Why were all the assassins incompetent, firing 6 shots when 1 would have been enough to kill the target? This film had no moral message. The main character, it is painfully obvious from the start, is a trained killer. His enemies are trained killers. The romance felt like it had been written by Edward Bellamy. Nothing was satisfactorily resolved (in fact, in the second film there are several references to scenes I assume were edited out of the first).The Bourne Identity? More like the Burned Indelibly.

The car chase sequence is one of the best from 2002. If you haven't seen this check it out it's good entertainement.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Bond's been re-Bourne !,"Difficult to know were to start - so will simply say this is one of the top 10 movies of the last decade. The Bourne movies have taken an exciting new road - we now have James Bond without the clichéd gorgeous girls, ridiculous gadgets and tiresome one liners. Now, steady, despite what I've said I really like Bond, you know what your going to get and they're flashy, fun flics - never miss them. But if those movies ever grew up you'd hope they'd turn out like The Bourne Identity. Bourne is tougher, more real, the action sequences are brilliant and tough as nails. There plot is solid, information is drip fed at the right rate and you can never say for sure how things will turn out - which is absolutely essential and separates the simply good movies from the great. There are a small number of well developed characters and again, it's nice to see that you can do what's been done with Bourne without a couple of huge Hollywood names battering the movies path to financial success. Oh, and the soundtrack is fantastic. Opening scene is class too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"A ""Must See"" Movie!","This movie is nothing short of fantastic. It moves fast, the characters are intelligent and believable, and it keeps you guessing (if you haven't read the books).Damon is excellent and believable in the role (to the extent that a role about a super government agent is believable). The pacing is excellent. Indeed, it is so fast that the viewer starts to feel the sense of being thrown in a whirlwind where they, like the characters in the movie, don't really know when or where it is going to end. The reason why the movie moves so quickly is because the lead characters are constantly confronted with obstacles that they barely get by, before they are thrown another obstacle (courtesy of the CIA). Perhaps the James Bond folks should take a few notes to improve their franchise.The action is great. The fight scenes are fun and unique. They are unique in that you get the sense of Bourne's lethal abilities, without having to watch a traditional kung fu fight. The director achieves this by showing the fight slow motion, but occasionally sped up greatly, to give the general effect of very violent fights. The fight in Paris was one of the best, most original fight scenes I've seen in some time. (It is only unfortunate it wasn't followed up in the next movie).Franka Potente is also excellent in her limited role as the civilian caught up in this international intrigue. Although she is pretty much limited to the straight woman for all the wildly dangerous things that are happening to her and Damon, she gives her best to the role. This woman can really act, so if you like her in Bourne, check her out in Run Lola Run and the Princess and the Warrior (the subtitles are worth it). Chris Cooper had fun with his role as well.All in all, the movie is like a pleasant roller coaster ride, it moves quickly, has its twists and turns, and leaves you breathless and wanting more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A fine action thriller,"When a group of fisherman discover a body off the south coast of France, they initially assume him to be dead, but when this man (who wakes up with a severe case of amnesia) starts to get his bearings he soon learns that he has a big target on his back and must fight to stay alive....I watched this film a number of years ago and thought that it was good, but having watched it again I've notched that rating up a bit and think that this film is very good on a second viewing...So the initial aspects of the film where Damon is trying to work out who he is are handled well and with a degree of believability (and there is also a sense of desperation when he feels that he can't beat the system at the start of the film).After this, he befriends Marie (whom agrees to drive him to Paris) but this is not the end of our amnesiacs problems not by a long chalk...Once it gets going the Bourne Identity becomes a first-rate chase picture with superb acting and the tension is palpable from minute 1. Director Doug Liman keeps things suspenseful and involves the viewer at every turn.Have I any criticisms? Yes the camera work at times was a bit shoddy (though I seem to remember it being worse in the sequel).All in all, this is a brilliant start to the franchise and is well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Magnificent,"Much like another person's comments, I heard good things about it when it was on the cinema but didn't go and see it. That was a mistake.By far, this is a magnificent spy-thriller. Matt Damon can be slightly hit and miss on occasion, but was perfectly cast as was the German chic who played Marie (his companion). She was terrific.The story has a good level of detail and complexity without getting too bogged down in itself - a common problem for many recent US films in this genre.There was more realism in this film as well. The hero was not invincible. He was injured at several points and his battle scars didn't magically disappear two minutes later. On a more subtle level: I noticed that the weather was terrible the whole way through. It was overcast, snowing, wet, you name it: just about anything other than sunny. For some reason, I liked that a lot. It gave a good atmosphere and realism to the film and gave us a break from all other actions films shot in europe under perfect, sunny weather. Small point, big difference. Also, I liked the fact that they didn't go overboard with product placement, unless Mini approached them to promote a car they made in the late 70s.The lack of gadgetry was fine by me. Leave that to Bond. Bourne is more realistic and doesn't need the ability to fire a missile out of his wrist watch to get himself out of a fix. In fact, you'll notice throughout the film that if he acquires someone else's gun, he gets rid of it relatively quickly. Again, more realistic.The supporting cast were great without being too over stated. Chris Cooper probably overacted his part to some degree, but that was not a major sticking point.All in all, a very well made spy film with a good balance between action and plot.For those who like a bit of cinema trivia, the car chase scene in Paris was shot several months after the film was finished. The producer and director were not happy with the car chase scene in the original cut, so they went back to Paris with key cast members and filmed it again. See if you can spot whether changes, hair length changes and so on during that scene!Followed by a sequel that didn't quite reach the same heights, but was good nonetheless and I'm looking forward to ultimatum.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
7.8/10,"A gripping spy thriller with a fresh take, The Bourne Identity blends action, mystery, and character depth. The identity-driven plot adds intrigue to the otherwise familiar espionage formula, making Jason Bourne's journey more than just a chase: it's a search for self. While the narrative has its predictable beats, the film remains engaging, thanks to its sharp pacing and tight direction. Beautiful lovely Matt Damon embodies Bourne with a quiet intensity, balancing vulnerability and lethal efficiency, while Franka Potente adds warmth and realism, grounding the film's emotional core. Their dynamic feels natural, avoiding the typical forced romance of action films. The romance advances too quick, but in the fast-paced action thriller aspects drown out that idea almost completely. The film's European setting, shot in Paris, Prague, and beyond, enhances its moody, grey aesthetic, reinforcing Bourne's isolation. The vibes match the plot, which I find satisfying. The action sequences are raw and precise, favouring practical stunt work over excessive spectacle, making the fights and chases feel visceral. A solid thriller with a unique angle on the spy genre, perhaps not groundbreaking, but undeniably entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Delivers like only cinema can.,"There are those who say that the book is always better than the movie. These people have clearly never seen ""The Bourne Identity"", which is based on the book of the same name about a CIA agent who washes up in the Mediterranean Sea with two bullet holes in his back and no memory of who he is.What strikes one first about the film is the action.Two scenes stand out.First, there is a scene in Switzerland, where our hero, Jason Bourne (played with honest intensity by Matt Damon), climbs sideways across a snow-covered wall of the US Embassy. The stunt is amazing yet believable, and is an experience that can only be found in a movie. Sorry authors, but no collection of words, how ever elegant or intelligently constructed, can possibly convey the same tension and white knuckled excitement that this scene has.Secondly, there is a now famous car chase through Paris, which is, frankly, awesome beyond words.Aside from the action, the film excels with smart and breathlessly smooth plot development, which should be studied in film and script writing classes.Lastly, perhaps the film's strongest element next to it's action scenes is the acting. Chris Cooper is electrifying as always here, playing a sinister CIA desk stooge, who orchestrates the hunt for Bourne while answering to a gruff Brian Cox.And special attention should be paid to Franke Potente as Marie, a nomadic German girl who gets recruited by Bourne to drive him to Paris. The world was first exposed to her in the German indie film ""Lola rennt"", and here she is a refreshing presence amide all the spy intrigue. She plays Marie with a down-to-Earth honesty that works as an excellent balance to Damon's action anti-hero. Their chemistry is fresh and very real. These performances cannot be found in books.All things considered, ""The Bourne Identity"" is one of the 10 best action films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"A pretty good movie, if you've never read the book.","Saying this movie was based on Robert Ludlum's book gives Mr. Ludlum way too much credit for this story.  The first 30 seconds of the film roughly follows the book, and then the book goes off on a completely different story.In all honesty, I think that Bourne is the only character in this movie who is also in the book.  Others such as the doctor who works on him and the girl who ends up accompanying him are sort of in the book, but they have been changed almost beyond all recognition.  Even Bourne himself has been changed drastically.  I'm amazed that they spent the money for the rights to this book and then rendered it unrecognizable by stripping out 99% of the plot and just keeping a name or two.  The book was originally released in the mid-70's, so its not like they were paying for name recognition (such as a Tom Clancy novel).All that aside, the movie isn't too bad.  It's directed and acted fairly well in spite of a rather formulaic script.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

If you've read the book, don't bother to see this movie.2. If you haven't read the book, go read it, then see #1.My own thoughts: they couldn't follow the book too closely, as the villain was Carlos the Jackal, a real-life terrorist from the Cold War era who was dealt with long ago and has been worn out in other movies (The Jackal starring Bruce Willis and The Assignment with Donald Sutherland and Aidan Quinn).Nonetheless, they basically traded off the book's title to attract the book's fans to what was otherwise a mediocre action film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

A smash hit!  No Identity crisis.,"""If you keep pursuing me, I will bring this fight to your door!!"" I remember that line from the character Jason Bourne, like it was yesterday. This was a tense and taught thriller, with a solid connecting hit!! Wow! From the professional music score that rivets you into your seat and then the clash of action that comes down around you from gun fire to self-defensive technique, that is exacting and bone breaking! Jason, is a trained professional, in everything he does. He is skilled in re-con, he is a tactician, he is a warrior that is trained and molded to win. To make good, wherever he is, and whatever the assignment may be. Until the little child that he saw on the yacht, that one night that he was sent to take out Wombosic he screwed up, and it nearly cost him his life! Now, with Marie traveling with him, things are about to change...again.But now it's changed and he is on the move with a team tracking his moves. Lead by Ward Abbott( Brian Cox) he is starting to feel someone on his path, just behind him, yet he is able to maneuver out of the way, and give himself enough time to set-up camp and wait for their arrival. The best example, being, 'The Professor' he took, him down in the wide open space of a field, with a lot of cover grass. Then, that chase scene, with Jason driving into oncoming traffic, was edgy and a perfect get away! It's his war and he will bring it all out, to them. Matt Damon is on it, all the way.I recommend for people who love a fantastic and enthralling action plot in a film, with a superb cast. (*****)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
perfect weapon,"This film is very European.  It seems that when Europeans do films, the films have more of a darker side to them.  You can tell by the grainy film quality, casting of characters, and locations.  The CIA director was what one would expect a person in this position to be like.  I do not think it was believable that they would have assassins, but if they did would they be that well trained.  Overall, the film was great; the cast was picked out perfectly.

"A Good Film, But Not Up To The Novel","I thought this was a well done film, and it reminded me of having read the novel about 15 years ago, as well as what a good writer Ludlum could be (he could also be pretty bad, as in The Chancellor Manuscript), but the film was nowhere near as intricate and interesting as the novel.  To be fair, there is no way a two hour movie can capture a book of over 500 pages that never lets up on the action.  Franka Potente was superb, as was Clive Owen.  What I can't believe is the number of people gushing over Matt Damon, who is (a) unbelievable as an assassin because he is so wimpy, and (b) an incredibly BAD actor.  As a critic once said about the young Katherine Hepburn, Damon ""runs the gamut of emotions from A to B.""  He is the one glaring hole in the cast, and it is too bad that among the three chief cast members, he is the American.  He may be able to write or produce, but all the praise for his acting is just another case of ""The Emperor's New Clothes,"" much like his equally talentless pal, Ben Affleck.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
hmmm....,"Well, aside from all of the death defying chases on foot and in cars, this movie to be perfectly honest was rather bland. It didn't really hold my attention long enough to keep me from doing other things while watching it.My short attention span aside, I think Franka Potente did a good job acting as sort of a drifter who gets unexpectedly caught up with Damon, a trained assasin with amnesia, and I especially liked the fast cuts during all of the fight scenes which represented his mastery of hand to hand combat. But all in all, I couldn't help comparing it to the likes of so many other movies that share the same plot lines.So if you love trying to decipher confusing plots, and like Matt Damon and Franka Potente, then you would enjoy this movie. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Standard Formula -->Disappointing,"I went and saw The Bourne Identity on a hunch.  The possibility that this action flick would offer something different from the ho-hum and drum of Hollywood to this point.  I must admit the possibilities presented by the plot are numerous, but the script just failed to take advantage of them. Of course, we all knew how it was going to end up, before we even took our seats.  Matt Damon was obviously going to be the amazing hero that we know and love him to be.  Unfortunately, it was no Legend of Bagger Vance comeback, but we knew what we were getting ourselves into. My highest expectations lay in the realm of what would make this particular action film unique.  I didn't find much.  I had to moan out loud when the Bond-esque, and wholly gratuitous romance began.  Granted, I have a soft spot for our sexy Lol(it)a, but I just didn't want this film to be a standard repitition of movies past. The ending was the biggest disappointment.

Said to be the most faithful to the Robert Ludlum novel,"(2002) The Bourne Identity

The director of this version Doug Limen was fired when he wanted more money than the fixed amount that was given to him because of the various locations it uses in the novel etc... the studio didn't know how the audience would react and felt that it was already overbudgeted plus the filming was behind schedule so the studio canned him and hired another person who was willing to cut corners by the name of Paul Greengrass to direct 2 and 3!

A good state to the classic meat & butter espionage thriller,"The crew of a fishing vessel find a body floating in the middle of the ocean. They bring it on board and the improvised 'doctor' finds two bullets on the back and a Swiss bank account implanted in the hip of the body. The 'body' indeed is not dead but unconscious: he is Jason Bourne (Matt Dammon), a CIA secret and very well prepared agent with amnesia. During the period of fishing in the sea, he recovers his health. Once on shore, he decides to go to the Swiss bank and then to the American Consulate. There he meets Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka Potente, from 'Run Lola Run' and 'Anatomy') and they two together will pass to the most spectacular actions along the film. The great Matt Dammon and Franka Potente are perfect.I Bourne is trained. Is he ever. He speaks several languages, is a formidable martial artist, has highly trained powers of observation and memory, knows all the spy tricks and is a formidable driver. We see that during a sensational chase scene through the streets of Paris, much of it through narrow alleys, down flights of steps, and against trafficWhile ""Bourne"" does not have a particularly deep plot, it is consistent and focused. The focus is entirely upon Bourne and how he is to deal with having no memory of his past, being hunted without knowing why. Some people have complained about being confused by the movie. I for one, do not need to have everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the first place; the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very sketchy information.Douglas Liman, the film's executive producer, directs it. He directs the traffic well, gets a nice wintry look from his locations, absorbs us with the movie's spy craft and uses Damon's ability to be focused and sincere. His direction seems to slow down the piously choreographed chase scenes & martial fights to focus on heavy exposition between Damon & Potente's characters as they unveil they myriad of mysteries regarding Bourne's fishing out of Mediterranean waters & his very identity; before expert action film director Paul Green Grass took over in the second film & speed the film up with his shaky hand held camera & fast editing & mixing style. Liman does not playing out the film as a stage play in which we are acquainted with the characters' mystery & conspiracy strung ids & limited superegos.The fights are just impressive, which, as other reviewers have pointed out, are among the most believable martial arts based fight scenes ever seen. No big grand gestures or Olympian kicks just fast, nasty moves designed to inflict maximum damage with minimum effort.This movie is better than the sequels in the Bourne series due to the romantic interest between Jason and Marie and the humanity expressed in the script versus the action in the sequels. The script has some special lines, such as Jason's ""Just keep on talking, it's relaxing,"" and ""How do I know that?"" and Marie's ""I said I was your personal assistant, I just asked for it"" and ""Nobody does the right thing,"" and the dying agent's line ""We always work alone."" The story raises issues about organizations which tend to eliminate their own members. In the end, truth and justice win out on an individual level, if not a societal level which, it seems, was the author's message.Nonetheless, a great opener to a trilogy that Green Grass would enhance by letting the script dissolve in the film with the pace & mood of a classic, nearly Hitchcock, espionage thriller. The entire story is a set up for the martial arts and chases. Because they are done well, because the movie is well crafted and acted, we give it a pass. The Bourne Identity is excellently paced and brings a great deal of realism to the spy genre. The fight sequences are fast and believable, the car chases are accurately choreographed and the character of Jason Bourne is vulnerable and easy to identify with.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"A game of ""Hide the Cliche""","Another entry in the spy fairyland movies,  where the CIA is seen as the Wizard of OZ these days.  I cannot believe there is yet another completely implausible James Bondish feature like this,  where ""Sum of All Fears"" bathes the viewer with a little bit more realistic approach to the spy world.  We cannot savour the adrenaline rush of the action - if we don't believe the peril of it's stars.  Damon is just too darn good,  and the rest of the bad guys are just too darn dumb.  The only fresh approach to the formula is the Bladerunner-esque portrayal of the superhumans that are the assassins.  My biggest beef though is the TV ads boasting ""a car chase better than the French Connection"" - or something like that.  Much better work was done with the similarly French based ""Ronin"",  and Willaim Friedkin already did the driving-against-one-way-traffic stunt in ""To Live and Die in L.A."" way back in 1985.A good job by the director in getting the paranoia under your skin, and a smart job by both Damon and Potente in trying not to fall into the cliche traps too often.I give this a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

I got a feel of actually being in Paris for a few fleeting moments. BUT I just kept wondering why are they trying to kill him? He didn't do his job, ok, and they didn't want him to go back and try to kill the African leader again, so they wanted him dead? IF so, why did they kill the African leader anyway? Ok, did they want his head for the African leader so he wouldn't write his tell-all book? The African leader didn't ask for that, he just asked for money and wanted to rule his country again. AND why did the girl stay with Bourne???? There seemed to be no motivation there. After they both knew he was a killer why in the heck would she want to stay with him (they didn't convince us enough that she loved him)? Why would he want to put her in that much danger.

"The most dated of the trilogy, but still fantastic","Before Paul Greengrass showed the world how to correctly use shaky cam, Doug Liman was introducing the world to Jason Bourne in equally stylish, albeit more dated fashion.Unlike the next two movies, this one doesn't feel as timeless (the technology and editing style is very early 2000's), but it is the one Bourne film that focuses more on the humanity of Bourne, his relationship with Marie being its main focus.This was a great start for a great trilogy.
And two other movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"A ""suspense"" movie that gives everything away right from the start","I'm not hard to surprise when it comes to movies.  I didn't guess the ending of the SIXTH SENSE, I had no idea who Keyser Soze was, and I didn't predict the twist in PRIMAL FEAR.  But with the BOURNE IDENTITY, it was perfectly obvious exactly who Jason Bourne worked for in the first five minutes, and in the first ten minutes it was clear what his job was.  I simply can't understand how people could call it suspenseful, much less confusing. Frankly, I don't think Director Doug Liman meant to keep anything about Bourne secret from the audience.  And that is stupid, because whatever potential the movie had to generate tension and suspense depended on us being as clueless as Jason Bourne as to who he was.Compare this movie to THE MATRIX.  THE MATRIX is a pretty second-rate movie too, but it's good for its first half, for one reason: we know no more than Neo does.  He doesn't know who Morpheus and Trinity are, or what they're up to, and neither do we.  The brief glimpse we got of Trinity just deepened the mystery.  In THE BOURNE IDENTITY, there is no mystery for us to penetrate; we're just waiting for Bourne to catch up to where we already are, which is simply an exercise in tedium.  This is aggravated by the fact that Bourne is pretty slow on the uptake.  By the time he got out of the Zurich bank, he should have realized that there were only two possibilities for what he was: intelligence agent and professional criminal.  The audience, of course, doesn't even have that much uncertainty, since we are shown Bourne's employers early on.Very little thought went into this movie.  For instance, when Bourne discovers his pile of passports, each with a different identity attached, he should have had no way of determining which one was actually him, since he had no memory.  But he just guesses right, miraculously.  The Swiss police are shown as being unaware that a U.S. Embassy (not present in Zurich anyway) is sovereign U.S. territory.  The Marines guarding the embassy are shown as being unarmed until they get into the arsenal; I've never been to the Swiss embassy, but in Nicaragua the Marines carried their M-16 rifles in the very door of the embassy, and even in the consulates.The best I can say about Franka Potente is that she managed at times to distract me from the fact that she adds nothing to the story.  This movie should have been entirely Bourne's show, and she's there just to provide a love interest and to be a springboard for dialogue, because Liman is too lazy to provide exposition with just Bourne himself.  Julia Stiles is window dressing; the director obviously hasn't the foggiest idea what to do with his female actors.Anyway, THE BOURNE IDENTITY isn't a complete disaster. It gets markedly better in the second half; it's no more credible than before, but at least the stupidities, like Bourne's escape scene, have a payoff in thrills.  The acting is good by everybody.  Take a note of the small touches: when Agbaje enters the morgue, his nostrils quiver as the smell hits him, and when Stiles hands over the information to the assassin, you can detect her fear of him even though he is on her side.  And it has a superior car chase scene.  The acting by everybody is good.Overall, the movie is tolerable, but the premise could have delivered a much better film.Rating: ** out of ****.Recommendation:  Action fans should catch it on TV.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
What a pity...,"What a pity... To waste such a good literary premise by completely uprooting the original and turning the movie into a collage of video spots of various action scenes that make no sense whatsoever and in many cases are totally unrealistic (especially the ending scene). Furthermore, and most importantly, Matt Damon is one of the worst casting choices that I have seen in decades. He has less to do with Jason Bourne than Mickey Mouse or Goofy do. He stars in this film playing a seasoned CIA murderer looking like a confused high school kid on prom night! Finally, as a consequence of not following the book at all, the movie ends up without a storyline to follow, the characters are shallow, empty and therefore the viewer cannot identify and ends up not caring as to what happens to them. Action in itself is not enough to justify the making of a film, certainly not a successful one. Unfortunately, it seems that in Hollywood nowadays, they think it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

The Bourne Identity - A Gripping Thriller with a Few Hiccups,"The Bourne Identity has long been my favorite entry in the franchise. I've always loved action thrillers built around amnesia-it's a brilliant concept to have a character with an impressive set of skills but no memory of how they acquired them. Matt Damon, known more for his dramatic roles at the time, brings surprising depth to Jason Bourne, making his journey of self-discovery compelling.One of the things I appreciate most about this film is Doug Liman's approach to action. Unlike Paul Greengrass's later films in the series, which rely heavily on shaky cam and rapid close-ups, Liman keeps the fight sequences clear and well-choreographed. The action is crisp, making every hit land with impact.I also love that Bourne spends most of the film partnered with another character. This dynamic allows us to see his humanity emerge as he begins to understand the kind of person he was-and realizes he doesn't like it. The story takes time to explore this emotional arc, making Bourne feel more layered than a typical action hero.Of course, the movie isn't just about introspection; it delivers some fantastic action sequences. One standout for me is the tense cat-and-mouse game with Clive Owen's sniper character. Watching Bourne strategically set up distractions while trying to outmaneuver his opponent across an open field is incredibly engaging.That said, there are a couple of things that hold The Bourne Identity back in the context of the franchise. First, it doesn't feel like a traditional spy movie-it's more of a road trip thriller. Because Bourne is constantly on the move, he spends much of the film reacting to threats rather than proactively taking control. As a result, we don't get to see the full extent of his spy abilities in action.The second issue is the ending. It feels somewhat abrupt and awkward, as if the filmmakers weren't entirely sure how to wrap things up. While it doesn't ruin the movie, it does leave a slightly unsatisfying aftertaste.Despite these minor flaws, The Bourne Identity remains a fantastic action thriller. It's packed with great performances, memorable sequences, and a unique emotional depth that sets it apart from many other films in the genre. While later entries in the franchise refined the formula, this one still holds up as a gripping, well-executed ride.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
You gotta love her!,"""The Bourne Identity"" is a mixture: it is an old fashioned hard-nosed spy thriller plus some martial arts and hightech equipment à la ""Enemy of the State"".

Fast-paced and brilliant,The movie starts off dramatically. You are with the protagonist as his story unfolds. He does not remember who he is.

Entertaining without the fluff.,"Bourne Identity is a movie that seemingly should be placed in the category of the summer international espionage movie  a la XXX, Jack Ryan, and the grandfather of them all, Bond.The Bourne Identity is bringing something else  basically, it's trying to hybrid character development and plot movement with the action genre. I don't know if it can be called a character piece or a plot piece  it's about a spy with amnesia. But what it does do is make smart choices, old film choices, and the characters become fully-embodied  it's a film that stares at you rather than winks at you.It's pulled off because Liman (director) & Gilroy (writer) make some ultra-smart choices: limited use of gun play, using a very artistic and efficient fighting style called Kali, and the downplay of any action scene with reality elements (people do get injured, things that are blown up are still on fire a scene later, nobody takes 6 in the chest and keeps on ticking) and the quite surprising performance by Matt Damon. He plays this character straight and controlled and the character is all the better for it. If anything, the performance boiled down to what he didn't do, and his discipline really makes the character.The same can be said for Marie (who book fans will remember as the Canadian economist) played by Franka Potente. Potente has an uncanny ability for making characters whose very nature seem preposterous seem very real. Most evidently done in 'the Princess & the Warrior'. She's a largely ignored talent, which I would imagine comes from the fact that she prefers quiet, downplayed performances (method performances) over the 'look at me' quality that most other women in her field choose.You're not going to see this movie to see how spies deal with amnesia and how that relates to humanity as a whole, you're not really going to learn anything about yourself in the movie. But you won't be disappointed  it's a movie that recalls the golden years of actual location shoots, no effects, quality acting and chemistry, where movement of the camera meant something and where you don't smack your hand against your head with every cliché action man line.It's one of the first films in recent years that hasn't made entertaining and stupid synonymous.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Good movie, but hardly 'The Bourne Identity'","I enjoyed the movie for what it is: an action movie that happens to have the same title as a robert Ludlum book, and for which names of certain characters of the book were reused in the movie.  That is about the extent of any link between the book and the movie.Overall, as someone who has read the Bourne trilogy years ago, and liked it, I expected something closer to the TV film made in the 90s.  It actually corresponded to the book in a reasonable way.  This movie, although it uses the title 'The Bourne Identity' tells a whole different story, with characters that are so substantially different, that it really doesn't have much to do with Ludlum's creation, other than some basic ideas.If you want to see a rather nice action movie (or have not read the book), you'll probably like this movie.  If you read the book, and expect to see something that follows the basic storyline, you might want to skip the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Rebourne!,"A floating body is found at sea off the coast of France with two bullets stuck in his back. By freak chance it turns out that this is not a corpse, but a severely wounded man, who can not seem to remember anything from his past. Armed with only a Swiss bank account the delinquent goes out to reclaim his identity - that of the highly skilled assassin Jason Bourne! It was this welcome return of Ludlum's Jason Bourne that had most to do with a resurgence of spy movies, but it also served as a guidebook for future (and much superior movies) in the genre such as ""The International"" or ""Casino Royale"". With the unlikely hero carrying the face of Matt Damon it was a break out hit, which I decided to recollect in full during the festive season.As such ""The Bourne Identity"" is a relatively crisp and refreshing action movie, which hardly ever gets a tune wrong. The thriller ride is gripping and to the most part attempts to be as realistic as possible in the slightly over-the-top secret agent world he inhabits. Despite most fights or chase sequences being extremely flashy, spectacular and even innovative (at least eight years ago) most of them seem to be as solidly stuck in real physics and physiology as possible - with a couple of relatively irrelevant exceptions. Also the scripting was extremely tight for a spy movie and hardly misses a beat with suggesting possible scenarios for our hero.One or two action sequences stand out in the movie, even if not necessarily the ones with are the most spectacular. Nothing as memorable as the shoot-out in ""The International"", but the relatively straight-forward showdown between Jason Bourne and Clive Owen's character The Professor is especially noteworthy.On the minus side the stereotypical African overlord is a real downer and the movie really gets a slight overdose of stereotyping, which take away from the general pleasure of watching the movie.Nonetheless by far the best of the Bourne Trilogy and despite the jumps in standards it has aged very well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Fast-Paced Hollywood Thriller,"""The Bourne Identity"" was a quite good TV mini-series with Richard Chamberlain that didn't really need re-making. But with all the strife I read about that went into this re-make, it's actually a pretty serviceable Hollywood thriller.Franka Potente, so good in Tom Tykwer's German movies where she got to do a lot more, has some chemistry with Matt Damon, though Clive Owen, who has a tiny part here, would have done more complexity with the role than Damon does.But, heck, if the point of having a new hunk in the role is to get women's fannies in the multiplex seats, more romance would have been nice; evidently Damon thought that interrupted the flow of the story so demanded it be taken out.Well, the story does in fact make more sense than most such Hollywood thrillers.

"The Bourne Identity returns the spy genre to hard-hitting realism with face-paced hand-to-hand combat, clever espionage, and a great lead.","In the early 2000s, when James Bond was surfing on laser-melted glaciers and fighting diamond-crusted henchmen and Ethan Hunt was dual-weird diving through a flock of doves, The Bourne Identity charted a new path. Doug Liman took Good Will Hunting's Matt Damon, whose biggest action role to this point had been watching Tom Hanks die to save him in Saving Private Ryan and turn him into a hardcore action hero. But unlike Bond and Mission Impossible, Bourne was a grounded and gritty spy that used skill and ingenuity to overcome the duplicitous intelligence agencies that wanted him dead. The action is more realistic and brutal, with the punches landing harder and pens stabbing deep. The Bourne Identity reinvented the spy genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A Realistic Spy Thriller,"I've seen this movie in bits and pieces on TV when I was in my school days but I've never seen the whole movie in a sit until today, and I gotta say this is one of the realistic spy movies I've ever seen and it brings the nostalgic feelings of how I used to watch and imitate all those espionage movies. Imma watch all those Bourne movies now, I'm intrigued as I pushed it off as another cliche spy movie.The story is about the introduction of the enigma Jason Bourne and the organization Treadstone and how they're conflicted inside the US government.
Bourne was found by some fisherman in the middle of a sea and he has no memory of whom he is and what is he, he goes on a journey to find out about him whereas the US government is blamed for an assassination.

We thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as we have action films with Mel Gibson, Arnold S, Harrison Ford and Matt did as good a job as they have. He could be the next 007! The action was almost nonstop, but with a good believable story line. Am excited about the next chapter in this series. Chris Cooper played a believable bad guy, just spooky enough to give you the creeps! The scenery was beautiful in Europe. The best sequence was the driving one in the little red car going down the steps, evading the police. It seems to me that Matt Damon has grown as an actor or maybe because he is a little older, too. The woman in the movie who played his love interest was very good, too. Hope that she is in the next one.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
I Just can't get enough! I just can't get enough!,"3 step review.1.U liked other Bourne movies? U WILL like this Bourne debut. This is a no brainer. Best bourne EVER!2. The story: Rogue intelligence assasin is on the run. Will he live? Will he die? 90 min action chase.3. Doug Liman. Tony Gilroy. Remember those names? Doug Liman is in my opinion the ultimate best director of ALL the bourne movies. I love the other Bourne versions as well, but Doug Liman made the mold. He created the original. The core. And he did so with masters skills I havent seen the equivalent of yet. Doug Liman not only directed, he also produced this debut. That means he had almost total controll over HOW he wanted to shape it. And that can be noticed in the attention to detail. Everything from editing, to photography, to soundtrack is ONE. It is a perfectly mixed blend of just the right ingredients to make Bourne one of the biggest action heroes in modern cinema. It is a rush. An adrenaline kick. And Doug Liman is to be thanked for that.Tony Gilroy is the screenplay writer of this classic action packed thriller, although it is based on a novel by Robert Ludlum. And however underestimated writers can become in action movies I herald the power of Tony Gilroy's words in Bourne's debut. Most of all I like the friction between the characters. Everyone is under pressure, under intense pressure. Not only Matt Damon but everybody connected to this assasin on the run story is likely to get wasted in a storm of bullets. Supporting roles are excellent, at a level unheard of in most blockbusters. That is typical of all the Bourne movies in which acting is paramount! The story and the words that make these characters believable are what Tony Gilroy is to be thanked for. And when I can believe in the characters on the screen, then I know I can enjoy a movie time and again.You are about to see the very best in modern action movie history: the Bourne debut.

The Bourn Identity Action done right!,"The Bourne Identity is a fantastic action thriller with good drama elements.

The action is well shot and with long enough takes at the right moments so that you can follow whats happening while still feeling urgent and frenetic, which a lot of action movies cant' seem to figure out. The cuts in this movie's action scenes feel like they enhance the action instead of feeling cheep and confusing. And though I wouldn't call it realistic it is never to over the top. The characters are still vulnerable Bourn is extremely good at what he does, but he is not superman. The characters are really likeable to, and their actions actually makes sense, the second part is true for both the good guys and the villain. Its one of those movies where you can follow everyones train of thoughts to the decisions they make and they don't seem stupid. Likeable characters is essential for the suspense which makes the thriller element work very well to. All of these elements working together and with great pacing and a really good soundtrack especially the paris car chase scene song, ready steady go and good believable performances from everybody involved.

"Fantastic Action, But The Story Is Hardly Original","I'm not particularly a fan of the whole action-movie genre, but I have to say that, in ""The Bourne Identity"", you have to love the action. It really does make the movie. The fight scenes are incredible, and the chase scene as Bourne (Matt Damon) leads the Paris police on a car chase through the city is amazing. The action alone makes this worth watching.The story on the other hand is somewhat intriguing as we untangle some of the mystery revolving around Bourne's identity, but the basic premise (which isn't hidden at all in the movie) has a ring of familiarity to it. Bourne is some sort of super-CIA operative who's lost his memory and has no idea of who he was or what he did for a living, but he sure does have some amazing abilities that he hasn't forgotten. As we're told during the movie, he's a $30 million weapon that's malfunctioning. That didn't strike me as particularly original, although it was unclear (to me at least) whether his abilities came from genetic engineering, some type of implant or just incredible training.Damon's performance was quite good, and I thought Franka Potente came across well as Marie, the woman who helps Bourne and begins to fall for him at the same time, even while becoming increasingly uncomfortable as more is revealed about his past. It's enjoyable and exciting, even if it has a bit of a well-worn premise, and it caught my interest enough to make me want to see the sequels. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Disappointing _ Don't fight the plot it's too Weak!,"There were some well shot scenes and Matt Damon's dead-pan portrayal of the main character fits in nicely.

Casting was good. Brian Cox never gives a bad performance and Clive Owen's turn about in character once caught is a nice touch. I think you need to feel for the characters a little, but I couldn't bring myself to feel one way or another about them. All in all a bit of a let down.

Timeless Classic Movie,"I was born in 1999, so I didn't get to watch this movie until around 2015 when the NEW Bourne movie was announced. I consider the first movie to be the best of the five that were made. It was consistently entertaining, and throughout the movie, I was constantly feeling a certain thrill and sense of curiousity wondering what would happen next. I have watched the movie over five times, and as the title indicates, it really is a timeless film. This was the very first movie that got me into action movies, and it is a work of art. The only reason I am giving the movie a 9/10 is because the hand to hand combat scenes were not that good for me. It felt more like sound effects with an overuse of cutscenes, most likely because the actors don't actually have martial arts experience which makes it kind of unclear what is going on in the fights. I think fight scenes such as the ones in Jackie Chan movies would have made the movie perfect.

It becomes too much a game for them.I found one fight scene in the movie extremely tedious after an intriguing start with verbal dueling. To my surprise, even fast forwarding, it went on forever. Similarly, for an interminable boring car chase through the streets of Moscow.The movie would greatly benefit from pruning back, or re-filming the fights and chase sequences. They are without imagination and go on far too long.The only fight scene that really worked was the first one in the movie, over in a few seconds between Bourne and the obnoxious young CIA agent.

"is a beautiful, modern, amazingly smart movie!","In anticipation of the release of the third film about Jason Bourne, the novels about which were written by the talented writer Robert Ludlum, who died in 2001 after watching The Bourne Identity (he didn't die from watching, of course, he really liked the film, by the way), I decided to fill my gap and watch all released films about this 'relative' of James Bond.The first thing that shocked me was the unrealistic realism of what was happening, Jason Bourne is a super agent, but not a superman, he is vulnerable, and in the situation in which he found himself, he is three times more vulnerable. The script is good, all the nuances and characters of the characters are perfectly spelled out. The fight scenes and gunfights are shot flawlessly, Franka Potente and Matt Damon played beautifully, and the background actors did not lose their faces. Dynamic music (led by the main theme - Moby's 'Extreme Ways') adorns this already flawless tape.By the way, it was the release of the ultra-realistic 'The Bourne Identity' that prompted the management of the filming of films about J. Bond to change his appearance - all his fancy gadgets disappeared in 'Casino Royale', he, like Bourne, became more vulnerable, more humane.Well, in the end we have a great film, a film in which action is needed not just to entertain the viewer or to justify the money invested in it, the action in it is subordinate to the plot and the main idea - we are always responsible for everything that we have done in the past. Damon's hero experiences a lot of emotions, starting to live anew, learning more and more new facts about himself.Definitely the highest score, 10 out of 10.'The Bourne Identity' is a beautiful, modern, amazingly smart movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Matt played this top one killer, showing his outstanding skills as well as his compassion, fear, frustration, sadness and so on. Unlike 007, Jason Bourne was more real to the audience. Unfortunately, the car chase was too familiar to me and didn't bring enough excitement. I regret that I didn't come to this movie 20 years ago. Otherwise, I would got crazy about it back then.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Great, but...","Like so many, I love these movies. However, they all have one big flaw (if this was real live).

Perfect Summer Film,"I'll admit I went to see this movie because I like Clive Owen. His role, although he plays it superbly, is very small. However, I came out a Matt Damon fan! This movie has it all: action, suspense, mystery, sexuality, scenery, intrigue. Yes, you have to suspend your reality. But isn't that what makes seeing a movie fun? I've never read the Ludlum novels, and I normally don't go see action movies. But this one was deeper, darker, somehow. The special effects don't knock you over the head, rather, they fit in perfectly with the movie's pace. Go see this: you won't be disappointed.

Good but the TV version is better,"Modern day life contemporises this Ludlum tale written way back in the 80's. The car chase sequence in Paris is the highlight of the film reminiscent of The Italian Job and Ronin. Matt Damon goes through his part almost lifelessly compared with Richard Chamberlain in the TV version. Same goes for Franka Potente (Run Lola Run) who is the female interest, compared to Jaclyn Smith in the TV version again. The TV movie was a better translation of the book.Suggest, get your hands on the TV movie first and then watch Damon's Bourne. You will know what i mean.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
It's one of the best in its genre; suspenseful and exhilarating.,"The only real issue with this fast-paced, exciting and involving mystery-action-thriller (one that truly uses all three genres as core tenants of its narrative) is its occasionally 'cartoony' sound-design. This is most prevalent in its fight sequences (mainly in its stand-out 'pen' fistfight) and severely reduces the impact of these otherwise engrossing and believable - not to mention realistic - set-pieces. However, it's a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things, considering that this is easily one of the tightest and most intriguing action-thrillers of its generation. Along with its two sequels, it kicked off a whole new kind of movie in the way that only a true classic could, and it's a joy to watch from beginning to end. It really is masterfully constructed to be as suspenseful, engaging and exhilarating as possible while remaining remarkably restrained, too. It's also distinct from its follow-ups in that it never really shakes the camera, though it is edited quite quickly during the high-velocity moments - which include a phenomenal car chase - even if the cutting speed never reaches that of its successors. This leads to a consistently legible and uniquely styled piece that legitimately stands out as one of the best in its genre. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Robert Ludlum Book as a Major Studios Subject,"Robert Ludlum is one of my favorite spy stories writer. Many of his books deal with the issues of memory, and describe common people accidentally caught in spy intrigues webs. 'The Bourne Identity' is the case of such a lost memory case - with the main hero suffering of amnesia and learning fast that his true identity may be one he prefers to keep forgotten.Unfortunately, the complexity of the Ludlum action is badly brought to screen in this film. We never get a good explanation of what really was behind the complex and seemingly all powerful spy organization that tries to eliminate our hero. The action is paced, there are many good atmosphere scenes, a plausible romantic thread, but the logic is missing, and many viewers may be in the situation of not really being able to describe what the film was about, after having seen it.Still, good entertainment - 7/10 on my personal scale.

"Good Action Flick, Nothing like the book.","In anticipation for this movie I read the book ""The Bourne Identity"" by Robert Ludlum.  The book was highly entertaining and well written.Unfortunately, other than the title and the main character, the movie bears no resemblance to the storyline of the book.  Being a Canadian, I was hoping that they would at least leave in the very intelligent and beautiful Canadian Economic Ambassador, Marie.  It seems that all they kept was the name.The story moved well, the pacing was good, and the action sequences (most of the movie) fit into the storyline and were, except for some of the hand-to-hand combat scenes, believable.This is good summer action movie to see on a summers night or a rainy day.

Dull!,"Perhaps having a few beers before seeing this was a good idea after all!It was supposed to be an engrossing thriller [if the book is anything to go by -- which outshines the film by the way] but it was actually dull and uninteresting, and my thoughts about Damon being a mediocre actor haven't changed from seeing it.The relationship between him and his co-star was scarcely believable and not very realistic, and I was bored way too soon into the film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Great action movie,This film is a nice addition to the action genre. It had a more sombre tone than other action films of the time which tended to be a bit cheesy and macho.

Almost got a 10!,"First let me say, this was a good watch. The story, suspense and action was all good. However, I could see the choreography in the fight scenes, in others words, the fights didn't look real - they actually looked as though they were practicing the fights in the film. This probably would have been okay for a comedy spy film. I also noticed how the camera seem to bumble around at times, as to hide the lack of realism in the fight scenes.

Closest thing one gets to modern-day ninjas,"I just saw these films and look forward to a sequel. These Bourne movies rock. The best action since Raiders of the Lost Ark. As opposed to the recent James Bond movies the Bourne movies actually makes sense.The CIA is portrayed as a violent, corrupt brainwashing cult, and Bourne as an archetypal, warrior-hero trying to fight his way out. Meantime he is being attacked by cia-ninja assassins and he himself is one of them. These people are the only ones who fight back. Normal people don't. The CIA-treadstone, as they are called, assassins are obviously trained very well in martial arts. Highly recommended. The first one is even better than the second, I think. Bourne is more cool in the second but the story in the first one is even more astonishing. 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Cliched Entertainment,"The Bourne Identity has things going for it as far as direction goes, acting, and even some action sequences, but the problem with the film in a closer inspection is that it has all really been done before.  You've got the assassin on the run from his former employees and he tags along with a woman whom he just met.Only twist here is that the assassin (Matt Damon) has amnesia and cannot remember who he is.  That's the most original thing about the movie, and it gets its entertainment from there, but the movie has the incredible cliches that come with a movie that does not have the amnesia twist in the story line.  When it gets to the end, the movie seriously goes on auto-pilot ""Airplane!"" style.I liked the performances.  It's always nice to see Chris Cooper play the antagonist, and Franke Potente is cool as always, but what is with Julia Stiles?  I didn't even know she was in this movie, and I can see why.  She doesn't do anything.  She answers and transfers some calls.  That's it.Matt Damon proves to be a good action hero here, but something a little more original would do better justice.  Even director Doug Limon proves he can handle the genre well, but this hardly does for action films what ""Swingers"" did for relationship comedy.Do I recommend ""The Bourne Identity""?  On its entertainment factor, yes.  I wasn't bored while watching it, so it's a good cheap seat movie, or if you've seen everything else.  Other than that, go see the brilliant ""Changing Lanes"" again.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
I wonder if Julia Stiles' character was killed offscreen,"As the rogue CIA plot is collapsing in career-ending disarray, the idiot responsible for the whole mess arrives on site to do damage control.  He checks in with Julia Stiles to make sure she's destroyed the evidence.  We never see her again on camera.  The next time we see him, he's hurriedly leaving the building (for an appointment with his executioner, as it turns out).My thought--  I wonder if, after making sure the Stiles has destroyed the evidence, he didn't just shoot her.  After all, her memory was evidence too.I suspect Stiles' murder was filmed but left on the editing room floor. After all, we already hated the guy, so we didn't need more crimes laid on him.  And Stiles' character, though part of the anti-Bourne conspiracy, was pretty much an innocent pawn.  In fact, I kept expecting her to realize what her coworkers were really up to and then either confront her boss (which would then insured her getting killed) or bolt and go to warn Bourne.My theory--  preview audiences didn't like her death so she gets to presumably live.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Thank you for setting it straight,"Like the previous reviewer, I am currently studying psychology, and I would like to thank him for setting the record straight. Not only does amnesia exist, but it is very plausible in the situation presented in this film. Briefly, a review. It's on USA network behind me right now, and I have to say, I can't bring myself to turn it off. It is a great spy thriller/action-adventure, with a noir-ish feel that adds to the realism if Bourne's plight. Like Dr. Kimble in the fugitive, Bourne must evade the powers that be whilst finding the truth to his past, a basic plot outline that never seems to fail. The action is good, the story is quality, and I can't think of any reason not to recommend this film.

Possible the worst book adaption of all time - but not a bad little thriller if taken on it's own terms.,"I don't think I have ever felt more conflicted about a movie than I did about this one. Tony Gilroy's script absolutely mutilates the source material, Robert Ludlum's gripping, intricately woven novel. The simplified, dumbed-down version of the story seen here is down right painful to those who know the real story. The change to the central premise of Jason Bourne's identity is roughly equivalent to remaking ""Citizen Kane"" and saying ""Rosebud is . . . a flower . . . or something"" (okay, the book isn't as good as ""Citizen kane"", but it's the best analogy I can think of).That said, had I seen this film without ever having read the book (or seen the Emmy nominated mini series, which may be a little hokey put retains far more of the intelligence of the plot), I have no doubt I would have quite liked this film. It's a good little thriller. Matt Damon, one of the most talented of the current crop of overexposed young actors, surprises again by making a credible action hero, as does director Doug Liman (who would have thought the ""Swingers"" guy could do action/suspence?).If you aren't familiar with the real story, see this movie first, and you'll enjoy it. If you have seen this movie but not read the book, read it and you'll understand what we Ludlum fans are complaining about.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Solid.,"The one thing I could say about this movie that would sum up exactly why I think this movie ranks with ""The Ipcress File"" and ""Three Days of the Condor"" as a stellar example of the spy genre: It was made for grown-ups.Granted, it's got some great action scenes. It's got a subtle but definably techno soundtrack. And it stars two young faces ready for the top story on ""Entertainment Tonight"". But it also has a brain. It has an economy of style that has rarely been seen in a mainstream thriller since the 70's. And it has a director that does not treat his audience like five-year-olds, reading them a story to shut them up so that he can get back to the other adults.This isn't an epic. You are not going to be shocked by logic-bending twists and turns. You are going to see a sophisticated story, well told, excitingly staged, and convincingly realized by its' cast. There are no cavernous sets - this takes place in the real world, or at least an excellent reproduction of it. The CIA office is not a pristine, sterilized environment where higher-ups glare at a Jumbotron with the world map on it and slam their fists on multi-million dollar control panels. They work out of a cramped office with two-year-old computers, paper maps, and wood-grain panelling on the walls. They do mot have the time nor the inclination to renovate.Doug Liman does the entire production an incredible service by treating his characters like real people. Their reactions make sense. Their dialogue comes out naturally. There is chemistry between the leads, because it is allowed to happen, and is not forced. Franka Potente and Matt Damon both bring an incredible presence to this movie - you want to see what they'll do next, even if you may be able to predict it - you still want to see them do it. Chris Cooper and Clive Owen (in a disappointingly small role) also keep their ends up.And the action. Oh, man. These scenes are brilliantly shot and tightly edited - Doug Liman throws you right into the middle of deft hand-to-hand combat, Parisian car chases, and beautifully choreographed gunplay. These scenes alone are enough to recommend this movie.I'm in my mid-twenties - I am very used to having movies targeted to my demographic. Most of the time, filmmakers are willing to do anything to get asses in seats - pounding, up-to-the minute rock soundtrack, transparent comic relief, T&A. It's not that I'm offended by these things - they have been known to turn out decent movies using this criteria. But it's nice, every once in a while, to have a movie that doesn't meet me halfway. It makes me feel like they trust me.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Entirely watchable and enjoyable film,"I am a fan of spy thrillers and mystery genre in general.  However, I am always wary of Hollywood cliche movies that leave you unsatisfied if not aggravated.  This film is a refreshing and enjoyable exception.  The cast is picked masterfully and plays great together.  Strong performances from Matt Damon and Franka Potente leave you breathless.  What I was on a look out for is a shallow dialogue, thinking the movie will focus primarily on action scenes and chase sequences.  I was pleasantly surprised by the delicate balance of both.  You do have moments where you wonder if the script could have been improved a little bit, because of the improbability of events (I am talking about the obvious stupidity of certain agents that chase Jason and gaps and holes in CIA surveillance in general).  You have numerous questions and concerns as to could that really have happened, but once you get over that little obstacle, be prepared to be entertained.

A Pleasant Surprise.,"I have a mode of judging movies before they open in theaters.  If a movie enjoys a massively huge media-blitz weeks before the premiere, that movie either is ridiculously stupid or can't survive on its quality.  Take, for example, the failed ""Solaris.""  I remember seeing commercials on television five and six weeks before the movie premiered.  And the movie tanked.My point is that Universal did a similar media blitz for ""The Bourne Identity,"" and I immediately dismissed it as another box-office flop waiting to happen.  But from chatter with friends, the movie seemed to be better than I was led to believe.I decided to wait until the DVD came out, since most theaters in Seattle lack DTS audio.With it's fresh take on a familiar story line (very similar to ""The Long Kiss Goodnight,"" among others), this movie combines a witty script and camera choreography that left me leaning toward my screen.  Credit must be handed to Matt Damon, who plays Jason Bourne, a man who wakes up not knowing where or who he is.  But when facing trouble, his instinct releases military training superceding that of even special ops commandos.The DTS audio, providing clear and crisp audio for even the background effects, the vibrant music, mixed perfectly with amazing action sequences, edited with amazing precision, caused me to be thoroughly impressed with the quality of this movie.I still hold to my method of judging which movies I'll watch in my local crummy theatre, but sometimes there's a pleasant surprise mixed in with the rest.  9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

The Bourne Identity,As I am a huge fan of Robert Ludlum I looked forward to seeing this film and what a disappointment it was. Maybe as such a fan I should have been prepared and the review should have stated that it is only loosely based on the Ludlum novel of the same name. If I hadn't have read the book I would have been completely mystified by a lot of it. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is simply not believable and the character of Marie unrecognisable from the books.

"Intelligent, Thought Provoking Spy Thriller","The Bourne Identity (2002)Review: Now this is a movie! This is easily one of the best spy thrillers ever.

After some searching, he has no luck till he suddenly destroys two people in about three seconds. Now it gets interesting. From there on lies the story.The Bourne Identity features some amazing lightning fast action sequences. I never thought that Matt Damon of all people would be an action star, but there he is nearly perfect. The fight scenes in the movie are tight, vicious, and just plain awesome. Also, despite some violence, they never go over the top. What I mean is there is not much blood here. Things do not get downright bloody. That is good. The action alone delivers.There is also a fantastic car chase scene that just plain rules. Turn it up and hang on! This is white knuckle action at it's best! One of the best car chase scenes ever.The acting is strong. Damon is really good as Bourne. One of his finest roles. A really strong kudos is to Chris Cooper. He is just very entertaining here.

Total Recall,"Pursued by unknown enemies, a worried amnesiac tries to remember who he is and why he has such sharp reflexes in this action thriller yarn. As the protagonists discovers a stash of fake passports, each with his photograph, and as police agencies seem to track his every move, the film has a decent dose of mysteriousness. The action sequences are well filmed and memorable too, with a scene in which lead actor Matt Damon scales a large wall and a sequence in which he has to allude an assassin (played by Clive Owen) in some cornfields standing out in particular. Clocking in at around two hours though, the film sometimes feels bloated with a lot of a cutaway sequences in which military types debate what to do about Damon; while these add exposition, they also subtract from the immediacy of the action. A heavily foreshadowed romance between Damon and Franka Potente, who gives him a ride, further distracts from the central plot and Damon's personal identity crisis is hardly all that juicy. The film is all about Damon embracing his old identity as opposed to something like 'Total Recall', which is about attempting to deflect from what one once was. That said, the eventual revelation of how Damon lost his memory comes with much bite with a haunting, near-silent scene on a luxury yacht at night. Damon's increasing anxiety at not being able to get answers comes across well too with some very good scenes in which he dials up various numbers asking for his names on his various passports in the desperate hope of some clue.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Bourne to be A Lively Hit!,"Audiences & critics have identified Director Doug Liman's new film `The Bourne Identity' as a very well-crafted flick. However, there have been others who have renamed it `The Bored Identity.' I could see why some have said the latter since the film does drag at times.

Poor Mr. Bourne is a superspy who suffers from amnesia on the streets of paris. He teams up with the beautiful Franka Potente and now we have a identity case of 2 innocent fugitives on the run, who are now being chased by everybody and their `bourne' relatives & forefathers. Damon does a credible job as Bourne who is `good well hunted' throughout most of the film. Franka Potente is illuminating as the innocent girl-on-the-run.

"Bloodless, no sparks","Finally caught up with the ""Bourne Identity"" tonight - a movie I had somehow missed,  despite hitting the cinema like once or twice a week, year in, year out - and had definitely wanted to see in the first place, to boot...Well in the end, it turned out, I had not missed all that much. The movie does fine in the sheer ""craft"" department, being edited well, suitably convincing in appearances, scenery, gadgets and secondary cast.Yet it is also as un-innovative as they come, has less surprising plot-twists than your average Disney cartoon and a hero (Matt Damon), which one finds it hard to sympathize with at all. There is not all that much action (it takes like 30 minutes before the audience gets any sizable fight/chase ), and when it takes place, it looks harmless, artificial and strangely unsanguine. For some reason there is very little blood at all in the movie, even when some guy is shot with a shotgun, twice and is then shown in several close-up shots.... No real kicks for the viewer here - while I am not a gore hound, I found it taking the urgency out of the fights. Regretably, the bad guys are of the ""utterly uninteresting"" sort as well - soulless one-dimensional killers, arrogant and conceited secret-service bureaucrats and some shadowy political backers. Nothing new, nothing memorable - everything is conventional, fool-proof and has - one begins to feel with regret - been seen a thousand times before - especially the Paris scenes. Why, oh why, does every Europe-based thriller/spy movie coming out of Hollywood these days have to take place in Paris ? Dear directors, please take the hint - this  makes for an inevitable comparison between masterworks or scenes at least done very well with mediocre and soulless ones  - which may be yours !!!! This severely hurts ""The Bourne Identity"" - there already are several much better memorable car chases through Paris (e.g. Ronin, Kiss of the Dragon etc. ) and there have been more breath-taking furious fights in Paris houses and staircases, too ! The Pont Noeuf or 19th century French townhouses are not new, innovative, location, and neither are the ""Quais"" on the banks of the Seine, with Notre Dame in the background. Been there, seen that... a thousand times !The fight scenes, and Matt Damon's sparring especially, are unremarkable - an utterly  _bad_ thing for the main protagonist in an action movie - if we cannot root for him (or at least marvel at his prowess ), who else should catch our interest ? Why even tell his story ? His acting is defintely not going to draw us in - he walks about like some wounded puppy, only to turn into a rabid Rottweiler in the fight scenes... and back again, like a light switch thrown. Really deep acting, there. Makes it hard to sympathize with him - especially, as to the audience, it is quite  obvious what he _is_ right from the start, while Mr. Bourne seems to need ages to realize, what sort of life and profession he has forgotten due to the old, trusty plot-saving device of ""amnesia"". Yawn ! This, and the movie's dominant moody blueish light (but this, too, has been done much more effectively before ) makes for a very cool, frigid and emotionally detached athmosphere - not bad in a spy thriller, but a weakness, if you already have to struggle for the audience's interest, due to a witless plot. Let's not forget the rather weak soundtrack, which, if used properly, might have lent some urgency or drama to the story. Again, a failure. Also, ""Bourne"" is as free of humour, as it is bloodless - total. Really chilling !  So chilling in fact, that any attempts at character-forming acting by Matt Damon and Franka Potente must find it impossible to involve the audience - because the audience cannot help but not to care for Mr. Bourne. Mrs Potente, btw, is hopelessly overqualified for her role's acting requirements - which makes Matt Damon's ""light-switch"" acting seem even more wooden and threadbare.As a resumee - uninspired fights and chases, weak and obvious plot, uninteresting one-dimensional characters, no humour, but at least, well done handiwork on the camera and in editing.....Well, lets hope there is no sequel to squander money on.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Great entertainment,"I have always liked Matt Damon films and so when i heard the Bourne Identity was coming out i knew it would be a good one. Thank goodness he didn't disappoint. From the outset i watched with a trepidation normally reserved for a well executed horror story. I think it had that appeal because Damon is so convincing as an actor, essentially putting me in his situation as i watch. All the casts performances were believable in how they reacted to unique situations. I find myself criticizing a film mostly because a character definitely wouldn't react in the cliqued way they normally do. So to see Bourne and Marie both as confused as each other whilst in a terrifying chase across Europe, coupled with the complete lack of bond-esqe double entendres was a thoroughly refreshing change. I particularly liked the way the film makers substituted special effects for raw tactical based conflict. I'd even recommend my mum see this film. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"""The Bourne Identity"" is a gripping spy thriller that follows the journey of Jason Bourne, a man suffering from amnesia who discovers he is a highly trained assassin. Directed","""The Bourne Identity"" is a gripping spy thriller that follows the journey of Jason Bourne, a man suffering from amnesia who discovers he is a highly trained assassin. Directed by Doug Liman and based on the novel by Robert Ludlum, the film stars Matt Damon as Bourne, alongside Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, and Brian Cox.The story begins with Bourne being rescued at sea with no memory of his past and a mysterious Swiss bank account number implanted in his hip. As he tries to piece together his identity, he discovers his lethal skills and becomes the target of various intelligence agencies, including the CIA. With the help of Marie, a woman he meets along the way, Bourne embarks on a thrilling journey across Europe to uncover his true identity and evade his pursuers.What sets ""The Bourne Identity"" apart is its intense action sequences, grounded in realism and expertly choreographed. From car chases through the streets of Paris to hand-to-hand combat in cramped apartments, the film keeps audiences on the edge of their seats throughout. Matt Damon delivers a standout performance as Bourne, portraying both vulnerability and ruthless efficiency with equal conviction.In addition to its action-packed plot, the film explores themes of identity, memory, and the moral ambiguity of espionage. Bourne's struggle to reconcile his actions as a trained killer with his innate sense of morality adds depth to the character and elevates the film beyond a typical action thriller.Overall, ""The Bourne Identity"" is a masterfully crafted thriller that combines pulse-pounding action with intelligent storytelling. It sets the stage for a successful franchise and remains a standout entry in the genre, earning praise for its compelling characters, tight pacing, and exhilarating action sequences.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Cracking thriller that loses it's way.,"The first hour of the Bourne Identity is as good as a thriller gets. Superb action, a great story and good acting and for the whole that is what the film is like but for me the ending is a bit to Hollywood for my liking and considering the story is good the end seems a major let down. Matt Damon is suprisingly good as in this lead role because you dont usually associate him as the beat em up James Bond type character but he pulls this off well.The car chase is one of the best you will see and a British Mini at that!Also the action scenes are superb and keep you on the edge of your seat it's just a shame the ending does not match up with the rest of the film. 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Good entertainment,"This thriller, based on the book by Robert Ludlam and the TV Movie starring Richard Chamberlain, features Matt Damon as an amnesiac who cant figure out why everyone wants to kill him or why he is so good at killing others. The story is involving and moves along at a nice clip. The supporting cast, featuring Chris Cooper (as a CIA Agent) and Franka Potente (as the love interest) is  good, though Julia Stiles (usualy an effective young actress) weirdly turns up in a minor role. Damon is good for the most part, though he is never entirely believable in this role.. still that doesnt stop the film from being very entertaining and action packed.

"Entertaining, yet a bit (too) puzzling to enjoy all the way","Years ago I saw the 80s TV-adaptation of Ludlum's great book which I read by chance some years after. I liked the film (as far as I remember), I loved the book and now I'm sort of slightly disappointed.Right, Bourne 2002 is a solid action movie with a catching car hunt through Paris, nice fighting scenes and some actors I always enjoy to see on screen (Franka and Matt make a matching couple, just look at their profiles...). But - and that's rather a BUT - during the whole film, I was kind of puzzled.First puzzler: The Zurich shots were definitely not made in Zurich. I think I know this town quite well, but where the heck should this have been filmed? It looks kinda like it, but it sure is not. Whereas in the 80's version you could tell it was! (OK, being Swiss I may be a little too sensitive about that...) - Second puzzler: How did Jason Bourne make it to Switzerland in the first place - on a train, without any document of identification? They DO control at the swiss border, you know... - Third puzzler: What about Bourne's (and the professor's) headache? Why mention it anyway, if there's no real point to it in the whole storyline? - Forth puzzler: What is ""Treadstone"" about anyway? And don't expect me to read the book again to answer that! If I spend money for a DVD I might as well expect some conclusion here.I might add some more, but my comment already sounds far more negative than I intended it to be in the first place. So let's bring this to a nice Hollywood-like ending (as in the movie...): Sit back, relax, enjoy the show and ignore the inconsistencies and loose ends. Under these aspects, I give it a 7/10 - but I still like the 80's version better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Escape in a Mini,"Remember when Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were making films together? It doesn't take much of a memory since they're still at it. Wasn't it just a couple of weeks ago that ""The Sum of All Fears"" came out? CIA thriller, reluctant spies, dead bodies abound... Although I didn't catch that one, 'The Bourne Identity' fulfilled my minimum daily requirements of espionage, intrigue and physicality. And for a dad with two teenagers, I have a very high threshold.There are allot of spaces to be filled in this movie so linear thinkers beware. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) will be your '30 million dollar killing machine without a clear memory of his past or his life's mission. But he has skills and reflexes to make any killing machine proud and money stashed away to give him time to find out. If his pursuers let him alone, that is.Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) straddles the line between strong and independent woman and perplexed partner and adventurer. Although this film has many strong characters, Ms. Potente is clearly the highlight. Watch for several connections between her current character and her former role as Lola in 'Run Lola Run.'Bourne has a weakness that renders him ineffective as an agent, and though his boss isn't clear on the specifics, he knows he's got to 'get him in a body bag by sundown.' Bourne isn't going down without a fight and he seems up for anything they're going to throw at him. And that not only goes for secret government agencies but also the more dangerous Hollywood studiosHow much do you think BMW paid to get an old Mini Cooper placed as the getaway vehicle?

She is great because she has a natural feel to her. Someone like Julia Roberts would have been totally wrong and would have ruined it.

Spoiled Movie,"Certainly, Bourne Identity had a slightly-interesting premise.  However, the execution was botched and rendered the film less appealing than it could have been.The photography was universally bland and boring, except for the action scenes.  During the action scenes, the photography was downright bad.  The camera edits were confusing and changed perspective so frequently that the ""important"" scenes came off as unfinished and choppy; it was also quite evident that Matt Damon didn't really know much about what he was doing, as evinced by the camera shifting angles at key points of contact.In addition to the blasé cinematography, the film had all the key elements of cheesiness that are so prevalent in modern cinema.  Cars STILL do not explode when shot with a shotgun; when will Hollywood take Physics 101 and learn this?  There were a plethora of completely unbelievable scenes that were clearly only for the purpose of eye candy and were designed specifically for the teenage machismo crowd.The subplot (notice the singular) was hobbled-together and contrived, as if it were placed at the last minute.  Several events were just TOO convenient.. . but, then again, this is Hollywood of which I speak.I don't know why this film has such a high rating.

The Bourne Identity: 7/10,"Spy thrillers can be either good or bad. When they're just mass produced (see also: The Recruit), they becoming boring, no matter how hard they try. The Bourne Identity is certainly not the elite in spy movies, that's a fact, but it at least seems more sophisticated than others. Loosely (thankfully) based on Robert Ludlum's ridiculously absurd novel, it's what you'd expect from a summer action movie, but it has a little more into it. Not enough to make it a classic, but enough to make it worth your two hours.Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) washes ashore with no memory of who he was or how he got there. He realizes that he was a spy for the CIA, but now for some reason the American government is trying to hunt him down. He teams up with Marie (Franka Potente) and tries to figure out who he is, why he's running, and how to defeat his pursuers.Ludlum's novel was too long, too confusing, had too many characters, and was just plain silly. Thank God the American public is stupid, so the book would be dumbed down for the movie version. There's little development on any character except Bourne (especially not on anyone in the CIA-was that Julia Stiles?), the plot could use some working on, and at times it seemed a little hard to believe. But there's action to spare, and it's all pretty exciting. Damon isn't really the make of an action hero, which works with his character, since he's just supposed to blend in. I just hope this doesn't go to his head and he starts thinking he should be the next Arnie.The obligatory car chase scene was pretty cool, although there was much product placement (BMW and Minis). It's all pretty standard, but it's not subpar. The rest of the action scenes were pretty intense and exciting, with the screen being used to its full potential. On that note, let me give kudos to director Doug Liman. His choice of shots worked very well, and it was obvious to see what he was trying to achieve in each shot. Why he didn't sign on to direct the sequel, I don't know. But The Bourne Identity is good enough in its own right-what people want out of an action movie, plus the addition of a pretty good character, Jason Bourne.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

It's a slick action thriller that will satisfy the craving for dumb stunts, car chases and fistfights, but which also has a brain in its head. You'll have to suspend a whole bunch of disbelief, and there were a couple of instances that went so far as to make that quite a challenge indeed. Like many films of its ilk, this one doesn't know what in the world to do with female characters, so our main one screams and acts helpless, while the only other one (played by Julia Stiles) plays really no part at all in the proceedings. I only suspect that her importance increases later, as I see that Stiles is in the later movies as well. The men, meanwhile, do what men in these movies do, which is survive blows and falls that no mortal could actually survive, and bark out macho orders while strutting around with their hands on their hips.I recently took a trip to Paris and Barcelona, so I very much enjoyed the location filming in Paris, and got quite excited when even some shots of Barcelona made it into the film during one montage.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

If we get a car chase through the streets of Paris with enough decent dialogue for us to become involved, we'll never complain.

superb and well-done action movie,"Of course, movies about spies being hunted down are not all that uncommon, but ""The Bourne Identity"" and its two sequels, are some of the best ones that have appeared on the screen in years. ""Identity"" is the first, and in my opinion, the second-best out of them all. It has the most originality to it, makes the character of Jason Bourne seem the most clever and even the more vulnerable than he does in the two following films, and is overall, a nifty action movie.Matt Damon was the perfect choice for playing Jason Bourne, a former assassin from a series of novels that failed in a mission, was injured, presumed dead, and later turned out alive only with amnesia. He soon finds out here's a target for assassination and must try and find the people he originally worked for, find out who he is, and why they are trying to kill him now. Damon is a very versatile actor and is very efficient at the role.Franka Potente's character, while not a major development or powerful character, was a necessary character to keep the story rolling. The fact is, the movie would have been more boring and less compelling if Boune was completely by himself at first. Potente's character is developed enough just to make the point of her being there, not so that the audience will become attached to her. And I think that was the general idea when they were piecing together the screenplay.Action sequences in ""The Bourne Identity"" were very clever and ingenious. Like the following two films, Bourne is realized as being like Rambo. He is able to use a variety of tools for his own defense. He can use a gun as well as his own fists, and if he needs a weapon, as he demonstrates in one scene, he can grab a pen and use it as effectively as if it were a knife. Of course, some of his kills were a bit unbelievable and humanly impossible, but then again, it's an action movie. Lots of them are like that and the audience is just to sit back and enjoy it. And the cool thing is that Bourne is, like Rambo, not just a random crazy killer, as we can assume he was before he got amnesia. He tries to spare his attackers whenever he can and only kills when it becomes clear to him, and the audience, that there is obviously no choice left to him.But what I like most of all about ""The Bourne Identity"", as well as ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is that it ends with several points unclear, making it obvious to the audience that there will be more to come. In each film, many questions are asked, some are answered, most are left unsolved. And in each entry, more are asked, more are answered, and even more are left. It's a representation of how Jason Bourne is thinking as he's put into these situations. And the audience effectively follows him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Lovely as a shiny new silencer,"One thing, after watching this three times in the theatre (You might think I'm a fanatic; I just like to really know what I'm reviewing before I review it) one thing stands out in my mind...Watch this movie! I mean it. Real good, sometimes cliched entertainment, the sort that's titled Heart Pounding and edgeofyourseat, fun, it gets you involved with the characters in a way in which, I gotta say, the book never did. Acting is excellent, cinematography is original, really fantastic, gave the film a stylistic twist on the jump cutting of your usual thriller. Now, remember, If this great little movie is cliched, it's because it comes from a book written when spy-thriller cliche wasn't much of a problem. This was the original; the 70's invented the spy novel, and that's where the movie comes from. So not only is The Bourne Identity sleek, told with flair and creativity, it's also got an excuse for it's old -hat plot; that's something most movies don't have, an excuse. The music's great, too, if a little retro-seventies French pop. I've been what you might call a rabid fan of Powell and Gregson Williams for a while, and this stuff by Powell is really good. My mother and I keep comparing this movie to Spy Game, one of my favorites, and I have to say, it really gives Spy Game a run for it's money! It aspires to being less cerebral than that lovely film, but the Bourne ID has enough brains of it's own. It never lost my interest even the third time I went to see it; it drives right along at a glorious pace, propelling you through France with delightful, if not dizzying speed. Treasure a spy movie that actually gets you involved in deciphering the character's personalities, James Bond this is not, and doesn't suffer from the comparison. I probably could find some negative comments to make about it, but I don't want to take the time right now. Just see it. P.S. The car chase you've heard is good, and the best part of the movie really is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Highly enjoyable fast paced thriller.,"The Bourne Identity is an action spy thriller.  It opens with our main protagonist, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) awaking in the ocean with 2 bullets in his back and with no memory of his life.  We follow his journey as he attempts to figure out who he is, and why everyone appears to be trying to kill him.Bourne fights The Bourne Identity is an action spy thriller.  It opens his way out of sticky situations, gets involved in car chases (apparently done by the team that did the famous Ronin chases), and fights his way out of even stickier situations, all the while slowly piecing the puzzle together.Matt Damon, as we've come to expect, turns in a great performance as Bourne, who is a CIA agent, that seems very well trained in the martial arts. Franka Potente, of Run Lola Run Fame, plays the female interest brilliantly, adding much believability and warmth to the role.Doug Liman has done a terrific job directing this film, making it a very fast paced, suspenseful thriller.My Rating: ****1/2",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"!!!!Matt Damon, Action Star!!!!","I've been waiting for this movie, since I heard of it's production.  I've felt Matt Damon has wasted his talents since his unforgettable performance in ""Good Will Hunting"".  After seeing Mr. Affleck in ""Sum of All Fears"", I did not know what to expect from Matt Damon.  Well my friends, you will believe that Matt Damon is Jason Bourne.  I have read the triology a few times, and the movie does itself against it, there are a few acceptable modifications, that you seem to forget, since you're on the edge of your seat anticipating the next car chase or fight scene.  This movie is 2 hours long, and the best money, I've spent on a movie in a long time.  You have the action, you have a compassionate love story.  There is unbelievable suspense.  You will admire some of the characters, and hate others, but you will always find yourself supporting Matt Damon as Jason Bourne.  You must see this Movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Loved the apples & this movie.,"Goodwill Hunting 2: Hunting Season Ever wonder what would have happened to Will Hunting had he taken that job with the CIA? He would have been turned into the ultimate spy weapon! Matt Damon has really made a niche for himself playing talented genius liars. All the suspense of the Talented Mr. Ripley with 20% less of the homosexual overtones.In all seriousness, this was an entertaining film with wit and solid action. I largely ignored this film for a great deal of time and only watched it after a friend's recommendation on DVD. I'm glad I took the time. This film has great European settings, intelligent pacing, tightly filmed solutions to what seems to be an endless amount of escapes that Jason Bourne needs to makes. The character due to his memory loss has an interesting fourth dimension in his personality than your run of the mill Bond knock-off super-spy. Franka Potente is an odd (but beautiful) fit into the role of Marie in character motivations that laugh in the face of logical thinking. She makes it work, nice save Franka. Chris Cooper is a shallow underdeveloped yet oddly hateable movie villain. While this movie is a B+ list actor's blue heaven, extremely confusing to me was the reasoning behind casting Julia Styles...  Can't win them all!Tons of questions were left open at the end of the film, I suppose under the assumption that a sequel would be made. (The Bourne Supremacy) Too much or maybe oddly not enough time was spent developing 1. The motives of the CIA's immediate need to kill him 2. The only real problem I have with this film is the extremely implausible awkward relationship between Bourne and Marie. I'm going to just let the small stuff go and enjoy the film, if you worry too much about why he doesn't at least put a hat on or ditch the red bag, grow up.Yeah, time is short so they just cut right to the chase, literally. Hey, that's fine with me, the film works on many levels, plenty of ""Oh hell no!"" moments, it made me want to read the book for the details and it definitely made me interested in the sequel. If it's as good as this film, I'd say a wonderful franchise has been Bourne.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Bourne saga is born 7/10,"Jason Bourne is one of the best agent characters on screen. (way better than James Bond). the script written by Tony Gilroy and W. Blake Herron is realistic, original and super creative. Doug Liman has done a great work with the directing. The character of Jason Bourne is pretty complex, he has an interesting story and by the time the movie ends there isn't much explanation about his past. Matt Damon portrays one of his most iconic characters in his career, and one of his most successful ones as well. A perfect spy movie that has became a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A unique action movie,"The Bourne Idenity was a very good and new kind of action movie. It is a very good mystery that was based on a good book. This movie is full of very well shot action scenes and is full of twists all the way to the end. Matt Damon does a great performance as a spy/secret agent. This movie is a different take on espionage action movies. This movie does not deserve the negative reviews that it got. People say that it is too confusing. Yeah, newsflash. Its called ""mystery""! Oooh! (Emphasize) People may not like this movie. But I do. This was a good movie. I like it. I don't know what else there is to say. People should see this movie. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
pretty good,"Action movie without incredible explosions accompanying every car chase, or whatever. Nicely done. I hope to see more of this type of movie. The reason it didn't get a higher mark was probably because I didn't think it was anything absolutely exceptional.

Bourne to be a hit!!!,"For Matt damons first thriller/action he has set a good example of his rise in the business.The bourne identity is one of the best, realistic, more witty movies i have had the privilege of seeing this year, set in great locations, with moscow, Switzerland, and paris, and having one of the best on screen supporting actress with Franka Potente from ""blow"" it really set the movie of to blossom into one of the years best movies in my books.From Doug Lilman, the director of ""go and swingers"" its a change of style for himself, with the character wonderfully portraight buetiful setting and one of the coolest car chase scenes i have ever scene, he should be awarded for his efforts and can not wait for his next movie to be released.Do not worry folks ben affleck does not star in this movie, just like to set your minds at ease.They say that XXX is the new style of james bond, but i would have to go with the bourne identity, with cunning skills used throughout the movie, giving the bourne identity a unique style.If there would be any let downs about the movie, it would most likely be the ending, very short and to the point, but dont let that put you off, i would definetely check this one out for yourselfs.i will give it a 9/10And hats off to the cast and crew. Great job!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A great idea that doesn't know what to do with it,"This has all the potential of a great film. It is a great idea with a good, interesting cast, not jam packed with big names.The film starts well enough and looks beautiful. The filming of parts of Europe looks great and makes this a far more interesting film than your average.BUT it loses the plot part way through the film. It has this great idea, starts the film in an interesting way but then doesn't really know how to progress the story and then finish it.I walked out of the cinema feeling that I had seen a film which could have been really great but instead I was left feeling short changed. The great ending I expected just never surfaced.Such a shame.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Top notch indie film crew storms the Hollywood action flick citadel,"This is one of the best action films made in the last ten years.  It is the result of a charming and unlikely convergence of capable indie film players. Doug Liman (""Swingers,"" ""Go"") decided that for his third film he wanted to tackle ""The Bourne Identity""  With Liman at the Helm, Matt Damon signed onto a movie that he otherwise would not have been interested in.  The two of them convinced the studio to cast Franka Potente (well known German actress from ""Run Lola Run) as the female lead even though she was not widely known to American audiences.  Add Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, and Clive Owen, all respectable actors but not glamorous hollywood stars, and you've got talent everywhere you look in a genre that is usually defined by cookie-cutter plots, fluff acting, and over-the-top direction (think: Mission Impossible 2).  Most of the film is shot on location in Paris, and Damon even does all of his own stunts.All of this really shows.  This is a mentally engaging film that doesn't spoonfeed you an imbecilic plot.  It is character driven, focusing on Damon and Potente's reactions to an intrigue in which they are increasingly entangled, while the intrigue itself is secondary but solidly put together. It features one of the better car chases in film in recent years (which features an old ""Mini,"" as opposed to the boring BMW commercial in ""The Italian Job"").  No slow motion or shaky cam, just quick, well shot action sequences.  Also, the screenwriters did a great job updating the plot from the novel, which was published in 1980 (the same is not true of ""The Sum of All Fears,"" another movie released in 2002 but based on a novel from the mid 80s).  The Bourne Identity is entertaining from start to finish. 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Super-Spy Genre Reborn,"Like it or not this is the reinvention of the Super Spy Movie. It came before the new James Bond Series and probably had more than a passing influence. This is not Great Art or even great Movie making. It is, however, that thing that is the minimum of expectations in the most Popular of Popular Culture, Entertaining and rewarding.Amnesia in the Hero is always an interesting ploy as We discover along with the Character new and Cool things. Super Soldier (Spy) is another Fictional Stalwart that just always seems to work despite the whiskers and the been there done that Factor.So we have a High-Budget, Slick, Actioner with some modern sensibilities (read frantic editing and shaky Camera) and an affable young Movie Star brought out to kick start a New Wave of Popcorn purchases and Home Theatre inclusions. If the Movie has a weakness it is the off again on again Female side-kick that becomes a bit irritating fluctuating from strong willed helper to befuddled, reluctant participant. This all seems tacky and tacked-on for obvious reasons.The newest thing here is perhaps the most intriguing. That being the NSA surveillance and CIA goose-stepping that is very disturbing. With the technology at hand to invade Privacy with a keystroke, it should leave Viewers just a bit queasy. Even more so Today than in 2002. In this regard the Movie was more than a little prophetic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
An enjoyable romp,"The action is so constant and so well-done and the two leads so likable that you don't really notice that the story isn't really going anywhere.  I enjoyed every minute.  A review I read said that it was a pleasant change of place to have a male lead in an action movie who wasn't slick, clever and totally sexy, and a female lead along the same lines.  I definitely agree. There's one whale of a car chase scene thrown in for good measure, too!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
1st Class Action/Mystery/Suspenseful Thriller,"I saw this at a pre-screening this evening with quite an audience. This movie moves Matt Damon up to the big league. He gave a great performance that had the entire theater jumping from surprise ""events"" and applauding many scenes before the movie even ended. And rather than repeat many names already mentioned in other comments I would like to say everyone did a great job with their parts. And what a great choice of Franka Potente as his lady ""on the run"" with him. (Remember her great movie ""Run Lola Run?) One of the things I liked best was the incredible sound track and score as well as excellent photography to match the events. Everyone in my group loved the movie and many of us can hardly wait to get the DVD version for our home theaters. This will be a must own movie for my collection. 9 out of 10. Go see this one for sure!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Very good action fodder: I got exactly what I expected.,"There are two kinds of ""good movies"": ones that expand moviedom by carving a new niche or genre, and ones that are quality additions to existing niches and genres.""Bourne Identity"" is the second kind of movie.Some viewers here have complained that this movie is a rehashing of existing formulaic spy plots, and that it's predictable.  Well: I counter those comments by accusing these viewers of being fools to expect otherwise from a spy thriller movie.In the same niche as ""Ronin"" and ""Mission Impossible I"", the Bourne Identity promises good kick-butt action and adrenalized narrative.  The Bourne Identity also delivers exactly that.  There are no attempts at cultivating a complicated character narrative, nor are there Spielberg-esque attempts at social or political commentary.  This movie is about 115 minutes of fun spy action.HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS MOVIE:  the hand-to-hand combat scenes were tremendously choreographed; the rock-climbing scene on the side of the building is a memorable demonstration of good climber form; car chases were delightful, and flavored nicely with European scenery; Franka Potente is a well-chosen female supporting character, and she avoids falling into an archetypal girly-girl role; the movie is paced well, and visually narrated well.LOW POINTS OF THIS MOVIE: almost no comic relief... just when a good chuckle would relieve some tension, the tension just keeps building; a couple of scenes were muddled with the obscured camera angles.OVERALL: if you like spy stuff, and you enjoyed Ronin, Spy Games, MI1 and MI2, then this is more action fodder for you.  Action fans will definitely get their money's worth at half-price, and die-hard action fans will get their money's worth at full price.3.5 Stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Well made jaunt, well worth seeing,","Nice drama with good acting. The story is a little far fetched at some points but I like to ""escape"" now & again so I forgive. The Mini Minor makes a welcome comeback to car chasing. (Jason Bourne seems not to worry that the owner warns the car pulls slightly to the right...then he pulls it every way a Mini was not meant to be driven).I think it could have been 20 minutes shorter but never mind. This is a cliff-hanger well worth watching. I rate it 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Decent action movie,"For what it was, the Bourne Identity was a good movie.  Action movies in general have many flaws.  This one does too.  But, if an action movie is as well made as this one is, then we (or at least I) generally overlook them. I am not a really big fan of Damon, but he was good in this flick.  The twist at the end was TOTALLY surprising to me.  Overall, it was a good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Great Action/Thriller Flick,"The Bourne Identity is an excellent Action/Thriller that keeps you watching even when it slows down in pace. It is similar to Bond movies but with one major difference - it's got a very good plot & story to it.Matt Damon is perfect in the role of Jason Bourne, and Franka Potente as Marie - his somewhat unfortunate ""partner in crime"" - is good without ever becoming annoying. This is definitely a movie you need to pay attention to, because in parts the story moves along almost as fast as the action and if you don't keep up then it can be easy to get lost on what's happening. That is in no way a bad thing, though, as it gives you that ""want to see what happens next"" feeling. The movie does slow down in some parts, but even when that happens the movie's plot-line still ticks along nicely without it ever getting boring.A movie very much recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Refreshing, thrilling, and one hell of an entertainment","Ludlum would be proud. I expected a gun blazing no thought hardcore fast paced action zone, and I was wrong. This is not new grounds. Big shot with martial arts and weapons training loses his memory, and the people on both sides rush after him in a 'dead or alive' frenzy. Nobody to trust, nowhere to run, nothing to help bring back the past... seen it dozens of times, memorable ones being the hit flick 'The Long Kiss Goodnight', and Jackie Chan's version in 'Who am I?'.But there is something refreshingly new about this movie. The acting's great, direction is cool, and vfx is not unnecessarily flaunted. All I can think of saying is that I thoroughly enjoyed it. And the storyline is brilliant. What more could you ask for? The movie IS fast paced, but kind of slower than I expected. I'm not complaining, mind you! I loved the movie. It's just that I expected more. But there is a fantastic surge of excitement throughout the movie. I definitely recommend it, both for the casual movie goer, and for Ludlum fans, even if the plot is very different from that in the book. The characters were handled smoothly. A sense of realism surrounds the entire movie, except for a part in the central theme, which I cannot discuss without revealing the climax. Not that it contains much of a suspense.Jason Bourne is one character I'll remember for a while. The way he is represented... tormented bullet ridden castaway with one hell of an identity crisis, tortured at every step of revelation. He finds things about himself that he just can't live with, and even reaches a point where he doesn't want to know any more. The plot proceeds so casually and wonderfully, that you can't help but confess,""Well, yeah, I suppose that is the only step he can take."" It's like you know that in the situation given, the only logical and reasonable step to take would be the one shown in the movie.I give it two thumbs up.

Good action Movie,"I found the film a good action movie. Like the character in the film I recovered from amnesia. Mine was why I stopped reading the book. There were too many action fights in the book. Although they are good in a film, it made the book too boring for me. Also the implausibility of remembering everything except your name. I am sure many Enron and Worldcom former executives will have or have the problem now. Matt Damon and all the bad guys were very good in the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Brian Cox, who hires him?",Great film but this review is just to trash the utter lumpen brain fart that is Brian Cox. He's never been good. Just because he's old you think he must know how to act. He's just a bad Scot actor with a bad accent and he's bad in everything he's in. Boring guy. No charisma. Acts like he owns the place when you see him in the Corinthian in 1998 fawning over your bird. Sleazy guy.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Forgettable,"A wounded man is pulled out of the sea by fishermen who help him recuperate, but he suffers from amnesia and doesn't know why people are trying to kill him. The first in a series of films based on Ludlum novels is slick but silly. The pickles that Bourne gets out of are more ludicrous than a James Bond film. The silly stunts would be fun if, like Bond, the film didn't take itself so seriously, but this a humorless affair. Damon is rather one-dimensional as the hero. The quirky camera work that worked well for director Liman in ""Go,"" his enjoyable 1999 comedy, is not suited to this drab endeavor. What's more, it rambles on too long.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Entertaining Well Crafted Thriller,"I saw this movie today.... it was somebody else's choice. How lucky I was. It is thoroughly entertaining and elegant. There is no room for pretentiousness. The relatively fast pace never loses momentum without relying on video-clip type editing which I usually find so annoying. The script is well written, reserved and stripped down to essentials without lapsing into Mamet-styled affectations. Paris looks beautiful in any season.... but one rarely gets to see it so beautiful in winter. It's great to see La Defense on film after so many years of it being there. The acting is superb: the movie is cast from strength. Matt Damon proves to be a very convincing action hero.... certainly stronger than Keanu Reeves or Tom Cruise. His reserve gives the character strength and the right degree of remoteness. His natural charm is held in check. This man is a killer for hire, which in itself assumes a certain insularity in dealing with the world. Everybody else is fine. The score is particularly interesting... relies a lot on clever use of percussion..... my theater had great surround-sound.... it makes a difference.... it reminded me of Stewart Copeland.The movie conjures an atmosphere of cold objectivity which fits the story perfectly. It gives it a special flavor and makes it the quality entertainment film it is. It's a classy flick. See it in the theatre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The best fight & action scenes to come along in a very long time!,"If you like an excellent plot, great action scenes, & more than adequate character actors, this movie is for you.

"Smart, fast paced thriller w/ a splash of romance",I really loved this flick.  I have always thought Matt Damon was talented (hello mr. ripley)but in this film he really shows the measure of his talent - both emotionally and physically.  To sum up this in 2 words: WICKED AWESOME!  It is a must see for men and women alike.  Franka was so great she is so subtle but so right on the money with her performance.  I am a true Matt Damon fan now.  It really kept me on the edge of my seat - and the touch of romance hit the spot.   I haven't seen a movie in a long time that wasn't a waste of $8 bucks but this movie is worth seeing a 2nd time for sure.  I can always tell a movie is great by the aftertaste (for lack of a better word).  I left the theater with a feeling of awe & amazement. Leaving a movie now-a-days feeling anything at all is amazing in and of itself but this movie leaves me with feelings that reinforce my desire to be an actor.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
