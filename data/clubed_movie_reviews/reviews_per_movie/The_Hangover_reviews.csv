Great chemistry,"Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) wake up in Las Vegas hotel room with no memory of what happened the night before during their bachelor party. The problem is they lost the bachelor Doug (Justin Bartha).There's a tiger, a bunch of pictures, and a baby. All that is fun flashing lights, but it's the chemistry of the three that makes this movie. Zach Galifianakis' breakout performance is hilarious. But it means nothing if Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms wasn't there. Bradley is a great leading man, and Ed is able to balance out Zach.Director Todd Phillips really had the group humming. He has built up a nice resume of funny comedies. Also Ken Jeong literally jumps out onto the world.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Genuinely funnier than any comedy in recent memory,"Most great comedies are based on fundamental truths -- we find a deal of humour in the illumination of our own human tragedy. Office Space is funny, for example, because we've all worked that type of job, put up with that type of boss, and suffered that type of monotonous everyday boredom.Todd Phillips' new movie, The Hangover, is as aptly titled as anything else released this year: it's about a Vegas bachelor party gone horribly awry, in which the groom inexplicably disappears, no one can remember a damned thing, and Mike Tyson wants his tiger back.Yes, we've all had those nights, though perhaps not to such extremes (that's where the exaggeration of comedy serves us). The Hangover is funny because it takes this cultural ritual -- an American tradition; something almost all of us can relate to -- and finds genuine humour in the pain of its aftermath.I concede that bachelor party movies are not in short supply; the genre (if it is, indeed, a genre) should have probably both begun and ended with the Tom Hanks flick almost three decades ago. But The Hangover wisely studies the day after rather than the day itself; this is funnier because the plot works backwards, without tacky flashbacks, and much of the evening in question is left to our imagination.While it would be misleading to claim this is a brilliant film (in either regard – as comedy or character study), it's an assured picture that finds its footing immediately and achieves a surprising level of sustenance throughout its running time. And frankly, let's be honest, this is a breath of fresh air: it's one of the best R-rated comedies of the decade, and certainly the most uproarious since Superbad was released two years ago. Most R-rated comedies produced today are defiant; the R-rating has become a hindrance to film studios' sensibilities – everything is PG-13, saving the shameless Unrated schpeel for the DVD cut. The occasional theatrically-released R-rated comedy, as such, is infrequently modest; the ads stress the rating to remind us what we've been missing. For every legitimate offer, such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall, we're treated to movies like College that attempt to lure us into theaters based on the promise of raunchy decadence. The problem is that it's all so coldly calculated; these films are not funny because a majority of the time they are simply lazy and dishonest.The simplest reason for The Hangover's success in being genuinely funny is the fact that it achieves a rare balance of character and vulgarity. We laugh at the characters' misfortunes because we like them, we empathize with them, and they are distinctly actualized. Are they stereotypical? To a certain degree, sure: we have the repressed pussy-whipped guy who obeys his girlfriend's every command (Ed Helms); the weird John Belushi-esquire figure who speaks in non sequiturs and naïve absurdities (Zach Galifianakis); and the womanizer whose confidence renders him automatic leader of the group (Bradley Cooper). It's a testament to the strengths of these actors that they make their characters endearing and believable, even in the face of total lunacy.Helms has been an underrated highlight of the American Office for the past several years, never quite earning the praise he deserves. His character on the show is played with pitch-perfect perversity: he's not overtly creepy (like the program's other weirdo, Creed), but rather subtly unnerving. Helms invests a great deal of nuance into what is ostensibly a throwaway, supporting goofball; this movie, if nothing else, will justly reveal his talents.Cooper uses his looks to his advantage: it's funny to watch handsome people exploit their securities. Cooper essentially turns your typical Leading Man figure into a bumbling idiot, self-absorbed and clueless. It's effective, he's got great chemistry with the other guys, and it's fun to watch such an immoral and ruthless character take center stage in a mainstream comedy.Galifianakis, a cult comedian who I've admired for years, has been struggling quite a while. Not many people other than myself and Sean Penn saw his 2001 comedy Out Cold, probably because it wasn't all that great; but he was easily the most amusing aspect of the picture. He once described himself as being gifted by the opposite of the Midas touch, with more than a few canceled TV shows to his credit (including Comedy Central's unheralded Dog Bites Man), but it seems his persistence has finally paid off: he has discovered, at last, a movie of strong enough quality to reflect his talents. Galifianakis has a fair share of the film's funniest dialogue; as far as fat funny guys go, many of them (such as Chris Farley) made the ill-fated mistake of playing dumb in a sharp fashion: hurtful quips and silly one-liners, all self-aware. Galifianakis plays his character straight and the laughs are subsequently heartier; when he embraces his brother-in-law while nude, the act seems innocently awkward rather than deliberately awkward, and that's what makes it so funny. He's described in The Hangover, by another character, as a child with a beard. Imagine how funny it is when he names a Caucasian baby Carlos, without any shred of condescension or knowing humour.The Hangover is surely destined to become the sleeper comedy hit of 2009, and, more likely, a cult flick in the years to come. It's more deserving of such acknowledgment than many recent successes, and while we may live in an era saturated with unnecessary sequels, I actually left The Hangover hoping to see these guys again. And that's a rare feeling these days.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A very funny movie,"With the exception of one character (more later in this review), I found this movie filled with male, sophomoric humor. Having said that most of the females in the audience also enjoyed it; kind of an equal opportunity movie to offend all sexes equally.Unlike most trailers that show all the humor in a 60 second clip, this movie will throw so many funny situations at you so quickly that you will be giggling non-stop for the first hour.Then, the introduction of the Mr. Chow part - essential for the plot, but played WAY over the top by Ken Jeong - became distracting. Up to that point, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha, and Zach Galifianakis carried the movie briskly and with real chemistry. Zach Galifianakis, in particular, was brilliant. Who is this guy???! The last 30 minutes were not as good as the first hour and I found the ending somewhat forced.HOWEVER, everyone I talked with after the movie will be seeing it again. This is one movie that is as funny as advertised.Of course, I will get flamed by those who find this kind of humor too low brow for their tastes. Hey, just know what you're getting into when you see this.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Hangover,"I remember seeing the trailer for ""The Hangover"" a few months before it's cinematic release and I remember thinking it looked funny, and also that they probably stacked the trailer with all the best parts of the film.Turns out I was wrong. Way wrong. Todd Phillips is a genius. He has helmed possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen. Literally every scene is funny. There were many occasions I was hurting from laughing so hard. Me and everyone else in the cinema the three times I saw it.Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Justin Bartha and Zach Galifianakis (who steals every scene he is in) are brilliant as The Wolf Pack Stu, Phil, Doug and Alan. Ken Jeong is instantly memorable as Mr Chow and who doesn't love Heather Graham? Mike Tyson's cameo is amazing. Rob Riggle's bit part is also fantastic.A wickedly funny script by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore tells the story of a Las Vegas Bucks Night From Hell.Just brilliant stuff. Just as funny now as it was fourteen years ago.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very Funny,"I just saw the first screening of the movie, and it is very worth the money you will pay for it. I was skeptical about it at first, thinking that the previews would have only the funny parts, but they are just the tip of the iceberg... Everyone hit a home run in this movie. Even Mike Tyson generated a few laughs for everyone. If you need a pick me up from a bad day, just watch this and you will definitely feel better about everything that may be going wrong in your life. I will DEFINITELY be buying this to watch over and over again once it comes out on DVD, probably even see it in theaters again. I hope you find this review helpful because this movie is definitely a must see in my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. PERIOD.,"I walked into this movie a little hesitant, and man did I feel like a complete tool for doubting Todd Phillips once again.I was hesitant for quite a few reasons. One being that I was a little unimpressed with the trailer, but trust me, after you see this movie you will realize that most of the movie couldn't have possibly made it into the trailer. Another reason was the writers.... their previous works being The Ghosts of Girlfriend's Pasts and Four Christmases and Rebound. I don't know what they did between those and this but damn did they step their game up.Now, the movie is hilarious. I have become so used to the thought of the Judd Apatow gang being the only ones to make truly funny films, but I realized very quickly into this movie that I was dead wrong. I think this movie was by far ten times funnier than Pineapple Express, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Step Brothers, etc. And I find each of those flicks truly, hilariously, funny.I remember watching Superbad the first time and thinking that that was the funniest movie ever made, when it comes to films with legitimate plots and characters, etc. And maybe Superbad and The Hangover are pretty close, but who knows....So PLEASE see this film. The audience I saw it with was laughing hysterically every five minutes at least. There is enough one-liners to quote all summer, and enough subtle jokes to laugh about later on that you didn't catch the first time.OH and by the way, if you love Old School, you will LOVE the ending. That's all I can say.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very Bad Things,"When a movie is funny, even though you have seen some of it's funniest moments in the trailer, you know you have a winner. Hangover, which does have some similarities to the movie ""Very Bad Things"", but does not sport the same dark humor, is a comedy that works for many reasons and was therefor successful.The actors: Be it Bradley Cooper, who deservedly gets the main (active) role here, was a hoot when he was on Alias (JJ Abrams TV Show). Here he can display his comedic potential more than in ""He's not that into you"". Zach Galifianakis is a bit odd and might scare a few people off, but he is a perfect fit (no pun intended). Ken Jeong, whom I've seen in several comedies in the last few months and many other comedians (and a cameo here and there) really make a wonderful ensemble (if you can avoid it, don't watch the trailer, before you see the movie, one cameo in particular is just so much better, if you don't know what's gonna hit you ... again no pun intended).The story is pretty simple and you have to stretch your disbelief a bit, but it's all for the sake of really good comedy. And the ending is just perfect too. Everything fits and even though I don't know what they really would do in a sequel (there are rumors), I'd love to see one! :o)",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Heterosexuals in Sin City,"Yes, okay, it's very funny at times down right hilarious. What sets this comedy apart from others of its ilk, is a well structured script and a pace that doesn't allow any form of thinking. The chemistry between the four leads is also a plus. There is a surprising, maybe unconscious, touch of innocence in the midst of this night of debauchery that makes it palatable even charming. Bradley Cooper is coming into his own and I'm absolutely certain that he was born to play Emperor Caligula in a future Ridley Scott flick. The women, as in most films about a bunch of heterosexuals doing childish things, are treated appallingly. They are the enemy that they have to protect themselves from or just escape, run, run as fast and as far as you can. Try to find the hooker with a heart of gold, and if she looks like Heathter Graham, that much better and forget about settling down. ""The Hangover"" has already become the surprise hit of the summer 2009. I say, well done, it could have been worse",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest film so far this year.,"I reckon it will be noted as the funniest film this year as I think it would be hard to top. It is certainly the best comedy I've seen for a couple of years. The cast were excellent with a truly great dynamic of main characters played by very talented comedic actors. The performance that sticks out is Zach Galifianakis' character 'Alan'. Zach has brought a fresh character to the screen and with the quality of this films script the combination of the two are what brings this to the point of a comedy masterpiece. As a film fan who is partial to only rating thrillers and dramas with a sense of respect, this film reminds me of how comedy can be the masterclass of cinema and the reason why we enjoy it so much. My Dad is not a fan of comedy as such and normally sees going to watch films of this type as a chore but to see him laugh as much as my brother and myself at 65 years of age shows how its humor can break not just an age gap but more importantly a persons taste in film. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this movie and do not wish to say anything about the story. The best thing to do is to go and see this film for yourself and you'll realize what i'm talking about.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Succeeds Where Old School Fails,"After much anticipation, The Hangover has finally hit theaters. Todd Phillips returns raunchier than ever with a surprisingly consistent comedy loaded with bizarre situations ensued by lots of laughter. From a live tiger in the bathroom to an abandoned baby in the closet, this movie has everything. Seriously, everything (confirmed by the credit sequence).Phillips does not shy away from his formula. The movie centers around four immature adults dumbfounded by the seemingly unexplainable result of a wild Vegas night catalyzed by the foursome's out of control bachelor party. Set the day before one of the principle character's wedding, the film is primarily seen through eyes of Doug (the groom-to-be), Alan (the lovable moron), Stu (the hopeless one), and Phil (the stud, and in many ways the leader of the pack). The director of Old School does not shy away from shock humor but embraces it, while gradually building confidence and self discovery within the characters.Overall, the film triumphs through curiosity and chemistry. Just like the main characters, we are eager to find out what happens, or what DID happen. At the same time, the strong relationship developed by the characters makes the viewer realize how much he/she cares about what ultimately happens to them. Chemistry is the secret to a good comedy; it is about time somebody shows this understanding.I don't want to reveal too much, but let me tell you this: everything does get explained in the end (except for the chicken aimlessly walking around in the hotel room, but I mean, it's a chicken). All of the actors succeeded in their roles admirably, and I wouldn't be surprised to see these guys in more lead roles. Ed Helms hasn't made me laugh this hard since The Daily Show. Seriously guys. Go watch this movie, you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Outperformed the already high expectations!,"I have to start by saying that my friends and I have been talking about this movie and watching the trailers for weeks, so our expectations were really high.With that being said, this movie didn't just live up to the expectations, it was one of the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Ed Helms are all very good. Galifianakis steals the show at times. It is hilarious from the beginning. Mike Tyson brings a few laughs and Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) is a great twist. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie, it is worth every penny. Just got out of the midnight showing and I'm going back tomorrow night.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Everything from start to finish offers a wonderful blend of humor, so I think everyone will find something they like in this movie.

I will probably look at it many more times in the future and that says a lot about the movie. I recommend it to anyone who has not seen it and if it's been a long time since you saw it, watch it again! It's worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Entertaining as much for its puzzle-piece story then for its raunch,"Sometimes the title of a film can sell itself, or at the very least pique a viewer's interest. Director Todd Phillip's new comedy The Hangover does this and more by introducing an infinitely relatable premise and infusing it with a clever story to keeps the gimmick supported for the duration. While providing the requisite raunch, stupidity and laughs, The Hangover is bolstered more by its puzzle piece narrative then by straight up humour. The mark of a good comedy is one that can keep your interest in between the laughs; be it by human drama, character development or in this case, a meandering riddle.What do we really know about a hangover? We know we have one, and we know we drank too much. Often everything before, after and in-between can be a blur at best, and for three friends, Phil, Stu and Alan they certainly got the worst. Travelling to Las Vegas for a night of sin, gin and wins to celebrate their friend Doug's (Justin Bartha) bachelor party they awaken the next morning to find their hotel room a tad dishevelled, a tiger in their bathroom, their memories wiped clean and their groom to be MIA. Playing the three worried bros respectively are Bradley Cooper as the bored-with-his-life school teacher, Ed Helms as the neurotic dentist and Zach Galifanakis as the awkward weirdo and soon to be brother in law of Doug. So unfolds the mystery; trying to find their missing friend before the wedding by piecing together the clues of their epic night out.For me the standout of the group was certainly Ed Helms. He plays the role straight, he is likable and he is funny. His characters arc is the most complete and entertaining and he certainly grounds his wilder counterparts nicely. The other players are certainly funny, yet the characters of Phil and Alan are not fully likable. Cooper's Phil is a bit of a prick and Alan is flat out creepy. That aside the actors put forward such commendable efforts all is soon forgotten and the quick pace and continual humour keeps things fast, fun and frantic.As promised by the trailers, we get a cameo from the Mike Tyson who is funnier for being himself then for his actual performance, darting in an out with a great supporting performance is heather Graham as an escort and Mike Epps makes good use of his time as quote 'Black Doug'. More hilarious yet is a closing cover for rapper 50 Cents' Candy Shop which is as inspired as it is hilarious. The Hangover is certainly one of those comedies that is re-watchable, and likely to improve with repeat viewings. However it is probably a good thing actual hangovers are not this much fun; I'd rather die of laughter then alcohol poisoning.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Great Cast, Great Fun","Hangover, The (2009)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Four buddies head off to Vegas for a bachelor party but the next morning they wake up not knowing what happened the night before and discovering one is missing. They must then try to retrace their steps and locate the missing buddy. I'm always a bit hesitant to fall into the mass market when it comes to something popular because a lot of times I end up watching the film and it turns out to be a major disappointment but that's not the case with this gem because it lived up to its reputation and in my opinion passed them. I'm not going to call this the greatest film of the year but I might add it's the most original. You'd think a comedy about getting messed up in Vegas would be ""been there, done that"" but this takes a familiar set up and does something original with it. Instead of showing us the crazy party night, we don't see a second of it and instead we're thrown into a mystery and the laughs come from trying to figure out that mystery. For my money the screenplay is nearly flawless as it does a great job at building up our thoughts on what happened but the film then takes us to places that you certainly won't see coming. The majority of the laughs come from things that you normally wouldn't expect like a masterful scene involving a trunk. Even the jokes that you do expect (strippers) is done extremely well and with hilarious results. I won't ruin many of the jokes because of the ""mystery"" behind them is what makes them work so well but there were several scenes where tears were running down my face from laughing so hard. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis give terrific performances and their chemistry and comic timing with one another helps push the film even further. The three make for an excellent team and watching this film makes it look like the trio had been working together for years because they come off so well together. Heather Graham isn't too bad in her role and the great Jeffrey Tambor even gets a nice laugh. You really have to respect a movie that takes a familiar plot and mixes it up to the point of it being completely original and most importantly, downright hilarious. I hate labeling films when they're so fresh but I would be shocked if this movie isn't looked at in ten years the same way we look at ""dirty"" comedies like NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE and PORKY'S today.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Mildly Amusing,"For his bachelor party, a man goes to Vegas with his buddies. Hilarity ensues...sort of. The film tries very hard to to be funny but fails to deliver many laughs. It is entertaining and provides enough amusement to keep it from dragging. The script consists of a series of vignettes that don't all come together the way they do in the best comedies. The sophistication level of the comedy is pretty low, a step above ""The Three Stooges,"" and there is a sense of deja-vu to it all. There is a Vegas segment in the 1999 comedy ""Go"" that is more amusing that anything here. The main source of laughs here is the doofus brother-in-law played by Galifianakis.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Unchecked Id,"Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper fall so perfectly into the circumstances of a night out without the wife/girlfriend—a bachelor party, no less—that we're all happy we're safe in the audience clucking our tongues but secretly envying every single moment (one that includes the ever watchable Heather Graham). These boys fall and fall hard, and trying to pick up the pieces of a night they strangely can't remember brought more laughs than the last time I laughed this consistently (that was ""There's Something About Mary"").The cast never forgets that they are actors here and not on an episode of ""Jackass"" as Apatow's comedies often feel. There's tight control on the dialog and we never descend into simple slapstick. Oh, there's broad humor, but we're watching terrific actors in very broad situations. The trailer is a perfect sample of what you're going to get, although it may veer into raunch perhaps a little more than the trailer hints. But it's never just sensationalism, because I can—regrettably, I confess—relate to waking up in a room with a chicken and not knowing exactly from whence it came.Galifiankis has the most unique character (well, besides a naked Chinese fellow, but you can discover that one for yourself) and he's wonderful to watch. Not everything he does comes off 100%, but when he scores, it's so far out from our own comfort zone, that when the jaws of the other characters drop, we're right there with them. Rachel Harris deserves special mention as the girlfriend who demonstrates why marriage can be so fearful.This is as tidy a script as ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" and just as beautifully shot. The cinematography could be pulled from any of the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce ads, and it only adds to our confidence that whatever is coming around the next corner, we don't have to worry that it will wreck all that's gone before. The makers of this little gem are as much in control as the characters are out of control, and it was joy to finally get a great farce that we're very sorry to see end. I see that ""Hangover, 2"" is in development, and I hope lighting strikes twice.(The standard for wedding singer has been set. Anyone want to top this?)",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Has its moments.,"To be honest, after the way this movie has been built up, I couldn't help but feel some disappointment as it wasn't as flat out, falling down funny as I was hoping for. That's not to say that there aren't very lively moments, and some genuine laughs to be had, but this isn't really that great. Still, its tremendous success is impossible to deny; obviously it was a crowd pleaser. What it does benefit from is a set of enthusiastic performances by its star trio: Bradley Cooper as Phil, Ed Helms as Stu, and Zach Galifianakis as Alan, as three guys helping the about-to-be-married Doug (Justin Bartha) have the last great wild time of his life in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, what happens is, on the day after, they have no memory of the Hell they raised. All they've got are the end results: a tiger in the bathroom, an adorable infant on the premises, a hotel room in ruins, a missing tooth, Stu's apparent marriage to a stripper named Jade (Heather Graham, looking as foxy as ever), a stolen police car...and, most importantly, the disappearance of the groom. So they're obliged to solve the whole mystery of the night before, with often wacky results. Just to give you an idea, boxing icon Mike Tyson, playing himself, turns up, showing his appreciation for Phil Collins's ""In the Air Tonight"". Some sequences work better than others - among other things, the three guys find themselves roped into participating in a tasing demonstration, and are pursued by a vengeful character named Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). Todd Phillips, who gave us such other comedies as ""Road Trip"" and ""Old School"", is director of these nutty shenanigans, and the gags keep coming right through the end credits, as we finally get to see, through snapshots, bits and pieces of the kinds of things that the guys got up to. Overall, this is certainly lively stuff, with enough chuckles to make for fine viewing, and making the city of Las Vegas a character in its own right, but for this viewer couldn't quite measure up to its reputation.

Hilarious,This film is without doubt the funniest film I have seen in my 28 years of existence. I have found most comedies over the last couple of years to be extremely overrated (especially Seth Rogen movies) and I did start to worry that I didn't have a sense of humour but this film proves that I was right and all the other comedies that have been made recently were wrong. The casting is absolutely spot on and I couldn't fault a single performance. Highly recommended and I believe for the first time in my life I shall be willing to endure another hangover!

Funny but not as hilarious as some would have you believe,"I got to The Hangover after everyone else had already seen it, told me how brilliant it was, told me their favourite ""bit"" and told me to get around to going to see it. Having been burnt many times before though, I did not let this praise make me have any grand expectations and I came to it just hoping that it would be funny. And it was. I had some good laughs and plenty of chuckles throughout the film – enough to enjoy it right through from the setup to the pictures over the end credits. Whether I would be able to enjoy it for a second viewing though I'm not so sure.The reason for this is that many of the laughs came from the sudden nature of the comedy – whether it be a sudden physical act or the unexpected nature of a line. It is a slightly childish type of comedy with lots of people getting hurt in funny ways and this only has so much of an appeal to me. Like the Oriental gambler says, ""it's funny because he's fat"" and that does rather sum up why some of the film is funny. This is not to take away from some of the very funny lines and scenarios that the film comes up with, but I still did think that the majority of my laughs would be dissipated if I had known what was coming (as I would with a second viewing). The flow of the story works a little bit against it as well. In some regards it has a good ""mystery"" structure to it but then again the central concept means that in too many scenes we have to listen to a character explain that they have no memory etc etc. Fortunately it is mostly funny enough to cover up this clunky repeated problem.The cast really help the comedy by their delivery. Although he is not really that well known in the UK (The Office US not being a big show here) Helms was the standout for me. In a character with elements of his Andy in there, I found him very funny and with a great sense of timing. Galifianakis is pretty good as well, although he has a simpler character in many ways. Cooper is not quite as good with the comedy but he is a good presence in the film and plays off the others (particularly Helms) well. The various comic characters in support include mostly funny turns from Graham, Jeong, Riggle and of course Mike Tyson.In summary, The Hangover will be loved by the majority of the target audience but is fast-paced and funny enough to please the casual viewer. It may not stand up to repeat viewings due to the nature of some of the laughs but it good fun without too much reliance on crudity or basic pratfalls.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Top 250?! you got be kidding!,I didn't plan on seeing the movie in theaters but after everybody telling me the movie was the funniest movie they had seen in years and even IMDb having it in the top 250 I thought I would give a try.I saw the trailer for the Hangover months ago and my immediate impression was not full of high expectations. Everybody who has been completely hammered before knows that even on their worst night of drinking you usually don't wake up with a baby in the closet and a tiger in the bathroom. The comedy just seemed a bit far stretched and forced.I did laugh pretty hard for the first 10 minutes but after the beginning the humor dwindled. Halfway through the movie my friend leaned over and commented on how ridiculous the storyline was and I couldn't agree more.The annoying thing about the movie was that the humor was not intelligent (except for Zack Galifianakis). If your a fan of Zack G. then you know his stand-up is brilliant and hilarious but the movie as a whole will let you down. Though i will say Zach G. made the movie worth watching.I was hoping to see a movie that topped Wedding Crashers or Pineapple Express but the movie didn't even come close. The movie was not horrible but top 250 come on!? thats insulting.If your a big fan of intelligent comedies I wouldn't waste your time at the theater and wait for it to come out on DVD. This movie is a classic case of mainstream comedy that will top the box offices but just doesn't deliver.,6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great ridiculous stupid comedy,"A lot of excellent jokes throughout. Raunchy crude fun time, well deserving of the Oscar win that it received. I originally saw it in theaters and used to own on it Blu Ray a while back.It's a great hit, especially for fans of party flicks/dumb comedies like myself. There are a few things that rub me the wrong way, however, like the police brutality scene, the stuff involving a baby, & the constant meanness towards Alan otherwise I love this movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Genuinely funny...,"This 2009 comedy is actually a rather enjoyable one and better yet is the fact that it is a movie that can be watched numerous times, as it keeps being funny. But of course, with an impressive comedy cast as it has, then it is a sure given that it would be enjoyable.The story in ""The Hangover"", briefly summarized is about a group of friends who travel to Las Vegas in order to have a bachelor party for their friend Doug who is about to be married. And as the saying goes, 'what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas', comes to a test, the men are in for time in Las Vegas that they will never forget... If only they can remember it.What works for ""The Hangover"" aside from the storyline and the countless hilarious moments and scenes, is the impressive cast list, which includes names such as Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis. These three guys are hilarious together on the screen, and they brought so much to the screen with their individual roles and characters. I think that having Ken Jeong in the movie was just great, because he is hilarious and really spiced up the movie tremendously.The movie is nicely paced and never really slows down once it hits the high gear. So strap yourself in and get ready for a hilarious ride through Las Vegas.I was more than genuinely entertained by ""The Hangover"", and I was laughing a lot throughout the course of the entire movie. I have watched it three times already and the movie continues to be entertaining and as funny as the first time you've seen it.If you enjoy comedies, then ""The Hangover"" is a good choice, because it really is funny. And if you haven't seen it already, I can warmly recommend that you take about 100 minutes to sit down and watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very Funny movie especially for male audience,"Humorous movie in every aspect.I watched the movie at a preview screening at UBC, so the audience were all college students. Everyone I talked to so far had loved this movie.The tale of how three friends tries to find the lost groom before his wedding after their crazy night in Las Vegas. The movie gets funny from the Las Vegas part right till the end. There is hilarious stuff in every other scene. Not to be missed, one of the best comedy of 2009.The entrance of Chinese goon is Hilarious, will have you in splits. They have touched on all types of jokes especially the minor mention of the different sex (gay, interracial, beastiality) The only movie that I can think of that is relatively similar is Harold & Kumar. I recommend everyone to watch it (not for kids), you wont regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sweet!,"The movie talks about a bachelor party gone wrong when the groom goes missing in the middle of Las Vegas.The characters are different and you can relate to each one. You have the responsible yet loose Doug, the adventurous Phil, the 'adult' Stu, and the sick-o Alan.The movie has its moments, it's funny at times but gets a little lame when it's the same joke over and over again. The ending was kind of shocking since it was sudden and out of the blue the way they found Doug.However, it was fun. I enjoyed it and I will certainly be watching it again since it doesn't get old. You should watch it too if you haven't, and if you did, watch it again. Why not anyway?",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com,"If there's a film that will be sold on word of mouth alone this summer, it's The Hangover. With a funny but unspectacular trailer, a plot (guys go to Vegas for bachelor party and crazy things happens) that seems overly familiar, and stars who are relative unknowns there's nothing to suggest anything hugely promising. But those who have seen it can surely testify that it's a 24-carat piece of comedy gold, for once you can believe the marketing moguls...we have been graced by the sleeper comedy hit of the summer. On closer inspection it shouldn't actually have been that surprising, Todd Phillips occupies the director's chair and his previous output includes such hits as Road Trip, Old School and Starsky and Hutch. 'The Hangover' though easily surpasses those by merit of providing regular and consistent laughs amidst backdrop of a frenetic and unrelenting morning after.The problems most comedies face are that they have to put all their best laughs in the trailer, so by the time the film comes around the funniest parts lose their impact and the rest of the film is disappointing in comparison. This is a problem The Hangover sidesteps masterfully. Yes we know they wake up with no memory of what went before; there's a baby, a tiger, a chicken, a missing tooth, someone's married a hooker and (in an unsurprisingly bizarre cameo) Mike Tyson turns up...but these moments, albeit hilarious, aren't what make the film tick. The heart of the film is in the chemistry between the three leads; Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) are likable and identifiable enough for an audience to go along with events that could quite easily in another context seem ridiculous. Alan in particular is a character that could really grind your gears if he turned up in certain films, as part of the affable trio however he grows on you immensely.This success may partly be credited to casting unfamiliar faces but the actors themselves deserve huge credit. Cooper may already be slightly familiar to some and is undoubtedly a star in the making (having been cast this week as Faceman in the new A Team flick), Helms is best known for his stint in the US version of the office, Galifianakis though has come completely out of the blue and it wouldn't be at all a surprise to see him follow a career path similar to Seth Rogen's post Knocked Up. The missing groom Doug (Justin Bartha) also deserves an honourable mention for slotting effortlessly into the group when around, it's a shame the plot requires him to go missing for the most part. There's also perfectly pitched cameos for Heather Graham, Jeffrey Tambor, Ken Jeong and best of all Rachael Harris who is magnificently vile as the hapless Stu's wife.Phillips has no qualms puts his characters through the wringer, there's one shocking revelation after another as the people, animals and events they encountered the night before come back to bite them on the ass during the search for Doug. As the audience know as little as the characters do the reactions ring true, they suspend disbelief as colossally silly events are only matched in magnitude by the sound of laughs in the theatre. The Hangover never quite lets up - the laughs even continue way into the credits - so it should come as no surprise that a sequel is already being planned. Having come up with something so fresh here the producers will have to be careful not to suffer from a hangover themselves the second time around.Verdict: Brilliant chemistry and a few plot tweaks make The Hangover better than you could possibly be expecting going in. It's funny from start to finish and is guaranteed to have you leaving the cinema with a smile on your face.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Early Favorite for 2009's Best Comedy,"I saw this move last night, for the 2nd time, and can say, without question, this is the funniest movie of the year, or possibly any other year. Where to begin? Give credit to the writers first and foremost, because this was LOL funny from start to finish and the storyline and dialog kept the comedy pace going throughout. There weren't any slow spots.The acting was pitch perfect, from the main characters to those with secondary roles, including brief cameo appearances. Zach Galifianakis, in a breakthrough role, was great as the goofy brother-in-law to be, Ed Helms was outstanding as the Dentist buddy, Brad Cooper also great as the hipster friend, brief appearances by Rob Riggle as the cop, Matt Walsh as the Doctor at the Hospital, Jeff Tambor as the father-in-law, Mike Tyson as himself, and the Wedding Singer (Dan Finnerty) in one of the funniest bits in the movie (he sings 50 Cent's ""Candyshop""), and numerous others actors, really contributed to the film.The film also finished strong, with a great ending that tied everything up nicely, with the closing minutes the high point of the film.A great movie, an instant classic I would add. Can't wait for the DVD to come out.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hands down one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!,"This movie is hands down the raunchiest and one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. From the beginning of the movie right up to the end it is consistently funny, there really are not any slow parts to this movie because they are on a constant journey and race against time. And just when you thought the movie couldn't get any funnier the last 30 seconds of the movie slaps you across the face. I literally was laughing so hard I cried.. I walked out of the theater feeling hungover from an overdose of laughter, great time!Nothing more to say, spend the money to see this and you won't regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
With 'The Hangover' you won't be sick!,"MovieRantsByTheDoctor.Blogspot.ComThis experience has me wanting to be hungover, in Vegas, not remembering a thing! You have to admit sometimes the most interesting/invigorating thing you can do is freak out about what you did last night, and try to put the pieces together! I'd say that would make a great movie but no...they went beyond that and made the movie gut busting. I'd say I haven't laughed that hard for a movie in a long time. Bradley Cooper was great he was the cool guy in the group who had a lot of the ideas, the cracks about his life were awesome and I am sure something all guys can relate too (especially the family men). Its crazy how they had the regular circle of friends for the movie, the ""smart"" one (Ed Helmes' character...Andy from the Office) who did some really stupid stuff, marrying Heather Graham though was the smartest thing he has ever done, would be any man's dream come true. The ""cool"" one, Bradley Cooper's character mentioned earlier, and the ""retarded"" one, (Zach Galifianakis) he was so dumb because basically he was comic relief for a comic which just basically added to the laughs. I am pretty sure his character in a baby standing silent with those glasses on made me laugh.I don't know what to say I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie, at some point I was put off but I can't remember when because they immediately recovered with an awesome laugh.So that's what I am going to do I am going to say only positive things about it and just say that if you are feeling blue and in need of good medicine, this movie deals out the best of it and in mega quantities. So go see The Hangover for a good time!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Roofers,"The detective story. We have many cases where humor is overlain.But we have few cases where the mystery involves the detectives. Usually the detective is implicated in some way, or is involved through some matter of honor. Other than ""D O A"" I do not know of another film where the detectives were the victims.The jokes work here, as does the pacing. It has energy. But the thing that intrigues me is the mystery. We have a missing tooth and a missing groom. There is an unexplained animal, baby, police car, wedding and pursuer. The setup, with a pending wedding that sets the clock ticking, probably relies overly on us having seen ""Sideways.""The strange engineering here is the distance maintained between the guy world and the girl world. Its too consistent and effective to be mere intuition. There are script consultants for this sort of thing but it is so well integrated I believe it have been there at the beginning. We have the chatty quite lovely bride, steeping in girlie stuff in soft poses. There is a prostitute who factors in the mystery. It seems they had to reach far to find someone as appealing as Heather Graham: needy, attractive, innocent but still a hooker. And then there is the bitch, harder than any stereotype known to me.The result is the reinforcement of the insular pretend work which we enter in order to enjoy the story. ""Los Vegas"" is just a way of assigning a space, as is the idea of locating on the roof.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Comedy
The Must See Comedy of 2009,Saw Preview at Vue Cinema Thurrock 2/6/09 This is without a doubt the funniest film I have seen in quiet a while to tell you anything about it would spoil the film but suffice to say that I thought my wife would need the toilet a few times during the film. It has some uncomfortable tones (it brings a whole new meaning to the expression 'never act with kids or animals) which may upset some people and the overall effect is a whacking success. The language is a bit rich at times but given the situations I think I might have sworn. The actors are mainly unknown (until now) and that adds to the unpredictability of some of the funniest scenes in that there are no heroes or villains as such except! No that would be going too far see the film and enjoy.May God forgive me for laughing so much. So would I buy the DVD? Most definitely can't wait,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
From a woman's perspective,"Because of the hype, I decided to give this one a try. I'm a fan of Wedding Crashers, Role Models, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and I expected this film to be of the same general caliber. It was, in many ways.However, this film is definitely a dude-flick (paralleling the *chick-flick*) as it explores the male-escape fantasy through a device I will not reveal due to IMDb's scary spoiler laws. I feel like it crossed the line several times in regards to a woman's sense of humor and her tolerance toward ""humor"" using violent sexual offenses, pedophile-related jokes, and sexualized breastfeeding--hard to make the ladies bust out laughing with this list of serious icks and no-no's.The other annoying part of this film was its audience. Sadly, half the theater was filled with ""gentlemen"" that had seen it before and were either yelling things like ""OH GOD, I LOVE THIS PART"" before the scene happened, giggling during silences in the movie, or naming the item (repeatedly) that is making him laugh so hard in the first place.I think movies like this should be made, and I'm so glad men are laughing and enjoying themselves--but ladies--you may decide to just let the guys go ahead and enjoy this one their own. Having seen ""The Proposal"" last weekend, I would definitely save my money and go see that with your girls instead. Hilarious, worth the ticket price, and a genuinely good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best comedy in years!,"What can I say, best comedy since the Jim Carry,Adam Sandler,Chris Farley days of the mid 1990's. Sure a little far fetched in some scenes but still never a dull moment. Just the little things Alan says,and the expressions on their faces, during the crew's small talk is priceless in itself.Taking place in Las Vegas just adds to the comedy value of the film. The unrated movie version is just perfect, and the original release is missing some key moments.They couldn't have picked a better cast and crew to do this comedy, 4 friends all different in many ways, but still find a way to laugh in the worst of times.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Long Live This Bromance!,"As a long standing admirer of movies and acting, I do enjoy my comedies (as the doctors say, laughter is the best medicine!) Sure, the face of comedy has changed from the sophisticated seventies of Annie Hall, but that isn't a bad thing eitherwhich brings me to the Bro-com or Bromance as I prefer. We've seen its early stages from Road Trip, Old School, Anchorman, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and blooming into gems such as Role Models, I Love You, Man & now the classic Hangover! (God, I still can't stop laughing as I'm writing this)And before you ask, I have seen this film 6 times already and aim to watch it even more upon its DVD release sometime in October (lucky guess I think).From the posts I've read on this thread, I would agree with some opinions, such as the fact that The Hangover is Sex and the City for men – but funny. It proves again that when a bunch of guys get together (as wonderfully illustrated in this film) that they're not leering at women from afar in Benny Hill fashion; but paying them cheeky compliments along the way: ""Excuse me Ma'am, in the leopard dress, you have an amazing rack!"" says Bradley Cooper's Phil Wenneck on a megaphone. I won't recap the scenario for you, as I am sure 95% of the USA has seen this already! Oh, and don't get me started on dweebs who say that the tiger in the backseat is unreal – IT'S A COMEDY for crying out loud! It's the same with Stu Price confronting the tiger in the bathroom and screaming like a girl when giving him his raw meat. The laughter would've been lost if he simply threw the morsel at the animal.Why I embrace the Bromance so much is that it outlines women's faults as much as ours. In I Love You, Man Rashida Jones's Zoe thinks it's fine for her to gossip with girlfriends about her sex life with Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) but he can't behave in the same manner with his male pals. The same goes for Ed Helms's (Stu Price) and the fact that his Antichrist girlfriend won't let him have a lads weekend away; but it's okay for her to sleep with a bartender! It also illustrates America's constant homophobia issues and luckily, it's acceptable for straight men to declare their brotherly love without worrying about waking up in bed together! What grates on my nerves are people who express their disapproval about so-called gay bashing in this and other movies such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin. This is comedy after all and you cannot be politically correct to please your demographic audience, that's just plain silly. Lines such as: ""Paging Doctor Faggot!"" are simply hilarious, because it's mocking that character's stupidity, not making fun of homosexuals. If you're gay and want to be offended, go and watch Bruno with Sacha Baron Cohen or Beerfest where they do nothing but reinforce the stereotype. If people start to nitpick about the flack racial/religious/sexual groups receive from comedies, then what will you eventually make fun of? I am actually mixed-race myself and have never taken offence to a classic comedy where the majority of the players are white. In fact, I welcome these movies than drivel such as Pooty Tang & A Thin Line Between Love & Hate (4.7/10 on IMDb's start rating?). Oh, and Bad Boys – unfunny, shouting and self indulgent.What makes The Hangover an instant classic is the casting & chemistry with all the leads (and Todd Phillips's hilarious cameo). Bradley Cooper, whose character of Zachary ""Sack"" Lodge in Wedding Crashers was such a douche-bag, but played the part to perfectionin other words, he was unforgettable. I was surprised at his casting initially, but the man can play comedy very well and gets a few good laughs, as I have mentioned already. He seems like a stand-up guy in real life and look forward to seeing more of the Coopster in the future! Ed Helms is also phenomenal in his role as Stu – and quite sympathetic at times as well. Don't know much about him but believe me, I am a convert now and will be watching The Office as soon as possible. Great comic timing and delivery doesn't hurt your appeal, does it? Zach Galifianakis: I used to watch him in Tru Calling but had no idea he was so funny! Yes, he's out of shape but that makes him more believable and his deadpan humour gives this movie some of its funniest moments – including the threat of not being afraid to beat-up an old man at the gas station or ""the side effects of Roofies is memory loss, remember?"" or the side-splittingly hilarious ""I didn't know they gave out rings in the Holocaust?"" Justin Bartha as (white) Doug: He didn't have a lot to do in this film, but as a testimony to visual comedy, his red face in the end is something else – and pretty sure his on screen bride-to-be couldn't keep a straight face either! The thing I love about this comedy is that unlike Sex and the City, these guys have ordinary professions (except for Alan & Doug, whom we don't find anything about) -which makes it easier as an audience to bond with and best of all, is the shared dynamic they all have. Also, the fact that you miss comedic moments the first time, means you'll savour them on repeated viewing. A great chemistry and a comedy that doesn't apologise when it comes down to using a baby for a jack-off joke! Let's hope Hangover 2 is as good as or surpasses this milestone classic. Todd Phillips, we salute you! PS: Ken Jeongwhat a legend and a great sport for understanding the values of being in a R-rated comedy. His ""So long gay boys"" line will forever be on my cellphone when the DVD is released!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The delivery of the plot is refreshing, I like the way they have to find out what happened the night before as they wake up from their eventful night. It's so refreshing to see them trying to figure out what they did, and to see the shock of what they really did! The jokes are phenomenally funny, it's out of the world.

The Best Comedy of 2009,"Todd Phillips did it again. He create this crazy comedy which only him can do. I'm a great fan of Road Trip and Old School. These movies are my favorite comedy movies of all time. But i think that the guys who rate on IMDb are complete idiots, because to rate Hangover 8,2 is the dumbest thing anyone can do. Rate of Road Trip is 6,4 and rate of Old School is 7, come on guys, these two movies are way better than Hangover. My rate of Hangover is 7, because many comedies which are better than Hangover are rate lower. I first saw Zach Galifianakis in this movie and he is the trade mark of this movie. He is The Hangover. Heather Graham is hot as always. I'm sorry of Jeffrey Tambor, because he is the man, he is the funniest grandfather ever, but he is in this movie for couple of minutes. But he rules. Remember him in Arrested Development. Bravo for the casting and thank you Todd Phillips for another great Comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

7 out of 10,"Comedies must be the most critical type of film for me, 1 1/2 hours or so of story line with a few laughs here and there, does that make it a comedy?

The best comedy i have ever seen,"When I first saw the trailer I thought there is another stupid comedy filled with generic humor, but this movie was just amazing I was laughing during the whole thing. Usually there are five or six extremely funny moments in every-one of this kind of films but this was entirely new experience. The plot is old, the actors are well known but somehow the movie is just hilarious, I am absolutely serious when I say that this is the best comedy I have ever seen. Everything in it is so unpredictable you just do not know what will be the next absurdly funny scene. And they do not over do it, something that is very, very important because you would normally say to yourself when watching this kind of movies, well that is just impossible or why am I watching this, here instead you would say I just got to have one night like theirs. And that is the thing that me and my friends said to each other after the film. It is so unrealistic and at the same time so plausible in an unbelievable way, that is what makes it so amazing extraordinary things happen to ordinary people. My advice is to watch this movie because it will change your entire idea of what comedies should be.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Comedy We All Desperately Needed,"In rough times like these, we need a good comedy to make us laugh and put a smile on our faces. The Hangover is that movie. Its a raunchy rowdy crazy good time, featuring everything from retro Mercedes to Mike Tyson. So far, it's easily the best film I've seen all year.The story revolves around a trip to Las Vegas gone wrong, which sometimes works (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) and sometimes dosen't (What Happens In Vegas). Two best friends, the cool schoolteacher Phil (Bradley Cooper) and the nerdy dentist Stu (Ed Helms), along with the bride's brother Alan (Zach Galifianakis) wake up in their room in Caesar's Palace, with no recollection of what happened the night before, which they spent having a wild bachelor party for their friend Doug (Justin Bartha). Turns out, there's a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet, Stu's missing a tooth,and (for reasons unexplained) there's a chicken in the kitchen. And, oh yeah, Doug's nowhere to be found. The three race around Sin City searching for the groom, where more crazy stuff starts happening. When the valet brings their car, it's a police car. Stu is married to a stripper (Heather Graham, beautiful as ever). They apparently had a run in with a mean gangster (Ken Jeong). They went to Mike Tyson's house. The list goes on and on, each misadventure produces more hilarity than the last.The cast is pretty much a poor man's Judd Apatow, without the cheap love story sandwiched in (yes, Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin were classics, but turned slowly into chick flick territory). Most of the guys you know you have seen, but just can't put a name to a face. Helms, best known as Rainn Wilson's rival on The Office, plays the role of Stu perfectly. He plays the delusional Stu with great humor, especially when he goes crazy on the others. As the closest thing to a lead, Cooper is the laid back guy who tries to keep everyone under control. Hopefully more lead roles are headed his way. Galifianakis plays the annoying Alan with perfect poise, that when he when he dosen't fret over the tiger when he first sees it, you just have to wonder why no one discovered him until now. Bartha's screen time is reduced, due to the fact he's missing for half the film, but he does his job well and manages to crack some good ones before he goes missing. There are some enjoyable cameos by Mike Epps, Tyson, and Jeffrey Tambor that will keep you laughing as well.Overall, The Hangover is one of the funniest films I've ever seen, and, as I said earlier, the best I've seen all year. A sequel is already being written, but I'm not sure if I want it. But knowing these guys, if they could make a comedy about anything, I'd probably watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Best Comedy in a LONG Time,"When I first heard about The Hangover I thought Wow this movie is going to suck. Then I saw something that told me that The Hangover was a box office smash and I suddenly decided to give the movie a try. Best decision I have made on a movie in my life.It has the typical group of friends when there is a wedding. The crazy one, Alan (Zach Galifianakis), The one that is going to tell you that you are making the biggest mistake of your life, Phil (Bradley Cooper), and the one who isn't allowed to do anything because he is whipped, (Ed Helms). What is so great about this film is it takes a normal thing (a bachelor party) and gives it a twist (A ""Hangover"").The acting is amazing, the script is amazing, and the plat is amazing which adds up to be an amazing film.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny...I mean very funny,"Unless you're some smug, pretentious, uptight anti-social person that people don't like to hang out with you're gonna love this flick. It's hilarious. Off hand the ""group of guys going to Vegas for a bachelor party"" doesn't sound enticing or something that could make for a great movie since it's an epic retread in cinema but director Todd Phillips takes the idea and runs with it.The movie, unlike most, doesn't center around the bachelor party but the next day as the guys try and trace their way through the night and figure out what exactly happened the night before in a drunken haze.The flick plays like a whimsical, drug induced detective story. They chase leads, confront many colorful characters, and find themselves in and out of trouble while trying to piece together the pieces of the night before and locate their pal (the groom) who was lost along the way.The Chemistry of these fellas is outstanding. None of them miss a beat and they're all funny. Of course the lesser known Zach Galifinakis really shines here as the not all there, cling-on, soon-to-be-brother in law of the groom. None of his one-liners miss their target and the sheer sight of him puts a smile on our faces.All in all a hilarious adventure that will keep you laughing throughout and this I promise you. NOW GO SEE IT!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Just wow...,"I actually made an account just to review this movie, because it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen Superbad :P So, the humour is top-drawer. Sure it's very crude, and even slap stick in some places, but that just makes the film so much funnier. The 3 main characters, (not including Doug) have great chemistry with each other, both in acting and comedy, and the side characters like the two crazy police officers, and the Gay Chinese Mobster were simply quality.All in all, it was £6.25 thats was well spent. The storyline was excellent, subtly combining many classic comedies to enhance the already fantastic quality storyline and humour.

The biggest laugh-out-loud experience in years!,"The Hangover is a riot! I did not think it would be this funny, but it was. It is outrageous, entertaining, crude, vulgar, and even offensive, but man, the best comedy in years. The cast is brilliant, especially Zach Galifianakis, who has given the best performance of the year so far. Rachael Harris was fantastic as such a b-word. The writing and direction are perfect. It really seemed it came from Judd Apatow, and I am glad that Todd Phillips still has some of the humor that he did in Old School. Thank you Todd Phillips for making the best R-Rated comedy of the year, and the funniest film in quite some time (along with the horror-comedy Drag Me To Hell!)The Hangover is quite a ride!",,Anonymous,Comedy
Clever Comedy!,"It's really wonderful to see a comedy movie that relies on its script more than its jokes. And Jon Lucas and Scott Moore's script is one of the most clever scripts written for a comedy movie ever. What proves that is that this movie isn't fast-paced as the rest of comedy movies. Actually, it's sorta slow-paced, but I liked that, and I think it's perfectly paced. That doesn't mean that the movie isn't funny. In fact, there are many lines that are hilarious, but, honestly, I didn't laugh out loud, or even laugh a lot as much as I should or wanted.The jokes at the third act are kinda silly and lazy as well as the third act as a whole.
 
The chemistry between Galifianakis, Bradley Cooper, and Justin Bartha is gold!(7.5/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"This is the only Hangover you should watch, but it's not for everyone.","4 life-long pals decide to sneak off to Vegas for one last blast before their younger friend gets married the following day. What starts off as a boys night out in Vegas ends in a hungover, drug-induced nightmare with the groom missing and the 3 remaining friends trying their best to track down information to find him as that his wedding is on in a day or so. Mayhem ensues as they are arrested, attacked, targeted, missing teeth, terrified by a tiger, menaced by crime lord, all while time is ticking.So the groom (Doug) played by Justin Bartha is the missing one, he appears to be much younger than the rest of the cast but well cast as the groom. The leader is Phil played by Bradley Cooper who is kind of the reason they're there in the first place. He's equal parts duchy aging frat boy, but genuinely concerned for his friend and has a heart of gold. The other (much older) friend is Stu, played by Ed Helms is the neurotic kind of guy that is easily influenced by his friends and doesn't appear to have enough of his own spine to tell others no, when her really wants do. There is a sub-plot, where his girlfriend is mean and abusive to him and he consistently gives into her, this should have been dropped and it added a level of tension that the movie already had plenty of. Then there is Alan, the future brother-in-law, who is a little left of center and eccentric. Well cast, he kind of made the showI decided to watch the trilogy over the long weekend as I got sick and could do anything so ""why not?"" right? I giggled a few times, I found myself wanting to see where the next clue would take them. Ken Jeong is hilarious in this and his over the top performance is truly grin-worthy. It wrapped up nicely and then it went into the sequel. I would only recommend that if you loved this movie and give it a 10/10, if you chuckled a few times and were moderately amused (like me) then you've seen enough. Its geared a little more junior than the ages of the actors but in this one (only) it works.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Was Bowled Over by the Hangover!,"With writers churning out script after mundane script; and story lines weaker than the state of some actors after a hard night on the town:- this film is exactly what those who have a hangover need; a breath of fresh air. This is the funniest film of the decade. Compare it to the likes of Yes Man which has Jim Carrey to carry the story but this script calls upon actors of lesser known fame- and it does the script and film more justice than having a well known cast member (I am not criticising Yes Man either by the way!). The laughs are sustained throughout and you are able to explore 'The Night Before The Morning After'. We have all been there, but it has never been this amusing. Even calling upon physical attributes of the actors for jokes; i.e. weight or facial hair allow this script to have more depth than modern day thrillers. A true classic is born in the shape of the Hangover.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Madcap Zany Fun Movie,"I did not really plan to watch this movie because I am not the type of guy who enjoys drinking alcohol. The poster was strange and the stars were unknowns. First impression was: Not Interested. However, the news came that this flick actually topped the summer box office Stateside. I heard a couple of radio DJs talk about how funny and cleverly plotted it was. I had some time to kill, so I was able to watch it.""The Hangover"" is about a stag party in Vegas which goes totally haywire. When they wake up wasted the next morning, their suite was thrashed, one finds that he has lost a tooth, there's a tiger in the bathroom, there's a baby in the closet, and worst of all, the groom is nowhere to be found. The three groomsmen needed to retrace the obviously wild night they had to find their friend and get him to the wedding on time.It was very funny how the director went on to steer the audience into realizing what happened together with the characters, as we follow them through their madcap misadventures. As this is a movie, realism is thrown out of the window and our IQ should be checked at the door. You simply know those situations are out of this world, but it grabs our attention as we too want to know exactly what happened. There were potentially offensive subjects like police brutality and Asian racism, but we know these were done tongue-in-cheek, so we go along with the fun ride.I have not seen these actors before. They are really the unlikeliest of gangs. I do not think people like them would flock together in real life. Bradley Cooper plays the mean alpha male. Ed Helms plays the nerdy straight-laced dentist. Zach Galifianakis plays the weirdo brother of the bride. Justin Bartha plays the groom. Their chemistry with each other and willingness to make fun of themselves adds to the success of this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Yes, I rate this a 10!","Absolute coolness! Great movie, a must-own comedy. The way the story's told and portrayed is excellent. I'm trying to find a fault, but the movie is pretty well balanced. Doesn't bail out on the ending either (Year One), this one follows thru right to the end. Has to be there at the top of my top movies ever, and that's a nuff said! I believe a strong indicator of a movie's success in popular culture is if people clap at the ending. Last time I saw it happen was with Wanted, and this movie is much stronger than Wanted in my opinion. This movie ended, people just clapped. And that's great! Now I'm not saying this is foolproof - I liked The Mist ending, and people in the movies hated it - but yeah, you get the drift. If not, open the windows! Bombo clat!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the most consistently funny movies in a long time.,"""The Hangover"" is what a comedy should be without being a bad movie. All the ingredients of a good movie in general exist here and the film is just so, so funny...and funny consistently. There aren't huge laughs followed by gaps of plot explanation or catch up or whatever. The plot is essentially the comedy driven ingeniously by the actors. There are almost no spots in the movie where you aren't laughing...and if and when you aren't laughing you are only listening closely and anticipating the next laugh and you never worry if the bulk of the comedy is over. It is nice to see a comedy that doesn't need Judd Apatow and company to make it a good one. The Hangover leaves the sophistication at the studio and just brings laughs - some crude, some stupid, some witty, some dark, some insulting - but all worth seeing this hilarious comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not even remotely funny,"Doug Billings and Tracy Garner are about to get married. Two days before the wedding, the four men in the wedding party - Doug, Doug's two best buddies Phil Wenneck and Stu Price, and Tracy's brother Alan Garner - hop into Tracy's father's beloved Mercedes convertible for a 24-hour stag party to Las Vegas. Phil, a married high school teacher, has the same maturity level as his students when he's with his pals. Stu, a dentist, is worried about everything, especially what his controlling girlfriend Melissa thinks. And Alan seems to be unaware of what are considered the social graces of the western world. The morning after their arrival in Las Vegas, they awaken in their hotel suite each with the worst hangover. None remembers what happened in the past twelve or so hours. The suite is in shambles. And certain things are in the suite that shouldn't be, and certain things that should be in the suite are missing. Probably the most important in the latter category is Doug. As Phil, Stu and Alan try to find Doug using only what little pieces of information they have at hand, they go on a journey of discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what happened to the missing items. However they are on a race against time because of Doug's wedding... I really wanted to like this film,I really did.It was extremely talked about,the premise seemed great, it has Vegas as a background and it has Bradley Cooper in it who I really like since he was in Alias(2001).Unfortunately The Hangover was a huge disappointment to me.And don't get me wrong I enjoy a good comedy as much as the next guy but this film is a total and complete disaster.Nothing about it was clever or creative, most of the jokes were just loud,crude and very simple. Nothing even quaint or quirky.I might have smiled a couple of times but I didn't laugh once. There's no point talking about the acting either because with such a poor script no matter how good the acting was the movie would be just as terrible. For me, The Hangover is a huge disappointment and one of the worst comedies of the year despite the high rating and all the hype.4/10",,Anonymous,Comedy
i find it funny that this generic comedy has such a high rating,"well basically, seen it, was a decent movie, 7/10.. nothing special, was definitely not up to par with pineapple express or half baked or anything like that, but was a decent mildly funny movie, nothing special really.The Hangover is currently 8.4/10 20,849 votes on IMDb, which of course is not a realistic rating for this movie that isn't even as funny as the naked gun movies (which i enjoyed, but they weren't movie classics like IMDb rating system makes this out to be) , ""Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas"" was definitely a top level comedy, just so you know my tastes in all these movies to help you tell just where this movie deserves to be in relation.sure the jokes were vulgar and such but i ain't gonna hate on an artist for expressing creativity or be wild since im a south park and family guy fan.i think everyone is just hyped and in a good mood for summer and their all in good moods, that would be my guess anyways, or maybe the movie makers spent a lotta movie to hire people to enter fake IMDb ratings, i really don't know, but take my word for it, this movie is generic and mildly funny, decently entertaining, but nothing special that hasn't been done by 100000 other generic comedies before it, and thats the truth of the matter.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The BEST comedy of the year!!!!,"Oh my god. I simply had to write this critique straight off the theaters. There is no way to exemplify how much fun and original this movie is without raving on and on about it all night (which would make me disclose a million spoilers, and you don't want me to do that).It's about four friends, one of them is getting married in two days, and they decide to go to Las Vegas to have their bachelor party. Everything starts out all right, with the four dudes toasting atop the rooftop of their Vegas hotel to a wonderful unfolding night, and then we fast forward to the next morning, when three of them awake in their hotel bedroom (which is wrecked beyond repair and features a hilarious set of new additions) and they notice the groom is missing. What's worse, none remembers what happened the night before. And so begins their two-day adventure through Vegas trying to find their lost partner and, in the way, discovering the hysterically crazy things they did that night.At first, it may seem like your typical bromedy, and you indulge in the movie's plot expecting to have a few laughs and later forget about it. But you get, oh, so much more. The character development is spot-on, the plot is seriously funny and (wow) believable even in its absurdity. The performances are very good, the directing is awesome. The film actually involves you, and it doesn't take itself too seriously and it doesn't try to be funny, unlike other comedies who seem to strain themselves to force laughter out of you. This is a truly special comedy, perhaps the best comedy I've seen all year.The screenplay itself is worthy of its praise, and I wouldn't be amazed if it pulls a stunt at next year's Oscars receiving an Academy Award nod. Todd Phillips certainly rein-vindicated himself and his film earned a rightful spot among those which we'll remember for some time to come. Why, it's even better than ""Pineapple Express"" and ""I Love You, Man"", which I also consider to be excellent bromedies.Whether you simply want to be entertained, or whether you want to experience a fun, modern comedy that's both hilarious and perfectly-made, you can't miss out on this one.Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 4!!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The best thing is that you won't wake up the next day and have forgotten all about it.,"""We all do dumb s*** when we're f***ed up"" concedes a rather sombre Mike Tyson when reviewing security footage of four random drunkards stealing his tiger and urinating in his pool—and it's at this moment, around two-thirds of the way into the bizarre but infectiously humorous trip that is The Hangover that everything shifts into place. Maybe it's something to do with the fact that if Tyson can sit back and laugh at the absurdities and downright obnoxiously reckless abandon that he witnesses when brought into contact with those guys, then we can too. I seriously doubt it, but the entire expedition that is The Hangover is equally as—if not more-so—dubious than seeing a bearded guy get knocked out by the heavyweight boxer to the tune of Phil Collins' In The Air Tonight, but this in no way makes the feature any less entertaining or downright hilarious. In fact, that's exactly what makes it the romp that it is; it's silly, indulgent and somewhat charred like a barbequed steak mixed with some tough liquor, but with a fine ensemble of tangible characters and a pace that keeps things readily engaging and entertaining, The Hangover is fun, fun, fun—and the best thing is that you won't wake up the next day and have forgotten all about it.Taking place over the course of two days and nights as three best friends attempt to put the jigsaw pieces of their wild night out in Vegas together in order to find their missing friend, The Hangover is a deliciously simple albeit compelling story. Striking right at the heart of modern western society and its tendency to do just as these guys do every now and again, the majority of Todd Phillips' feature here is steeped in infectious pathos that plays into that ever-so tried-and-true method of combining observational humour with broad, situation farce. The result is a story that flows excellently from act to act, keeps the jokes and gags steady throughout whilst developing characters and throwing them around often enough to keep the viewer laughing, intrigued and laughing some more. To be fair, there is a certain lack of substance to the overall arc of the adventure penned here by Lucas and Moore (something that is evident in a large portion of their previous works to date) that inevitably stops the feature from ever becoming more than a light-hearted buddy-comedy, but you probably won't notice thanks to lack of pauses in laughter provoked by the script or the actors.At its heart however, despite the robustly imaginative and complex intertwining of the central characters' journey, it is the characters themselves that make the majority of this hangover such a joy to watch. While the movie ostensibly revolves around four friends, much of the screen time is given to just three of those who share a wonderful chemistry that always feels flesh, edgy and natural. Through the performances of Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis (who gets much of the movie's laughs as the awkward and weird bearded guy with a baby), the buddy/road-trip story that serves as the centre-piece for all their drunken antics, missing teeth, stolen babies and stun guns to revolve around really hammers home the key narrative that propels things forward and retains the script's distinctly Y-chromosome-centric nature. Sure, there's plenty of material here that the ladies of the audience will be able to latch onto, but there's no denying the overtly boyish tendencies that rule supreme here that will be sure to give male audiences with a thirst for profane, crude comedy the most satisfaction. Sharp dialogue and genuinely exciting plotting makes this one of this year's most remarkable and hilarious comedies.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Different,"This movie was brilliant on so many different levels. It had humorous moments from almost every character which tends to be rare in most comedies. There always tends to be one person that carries everyone else. Though Zach (Alan) was the most funny of the characters, he did not carry the whole movie. It was funny all around and I was very glad to see a good comedy this summer, seeing as how Land of the Lost was somewhat lacking. The Hangover had so many different things going on that it is a movie worth watching more than once. I, personally, went to see this film twice and I will for sure be purchasing it when it comes to DVD. This is a definite must-see movie of the summer!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I went in blindly. Then WAM, this was F-U-N-N-Y, funny stuff, if you didn't laugh, that's sad, maybe time to lighten up. For me these were original and fresh gags!

The problem with this movie is that it just isn't funny,"I'm not above juvenile humor. The 40 Year Old Virgin and Forgetting Sarah Marshall were at times tasteless, often juvenile, and hilarious. Knocked Up, less so, but with more heart. Wedding Crashers was laugh out loud funny a lot of the time as it continue to go way too far.I laughed maybe....*maybe* three times at most during this movie. Including the supposedly ""laugh so hard"" sequence during the credits. The characters are unlikeable, the plot is basically ""Dude Where's My Car"" in Vegas, and the jokes fall way flat. That several notable critics think this movie is great either means that I haven't had nearly enough drunken misadventures to relate to this film or that there is a ""stupid"" pandemic in this country that puts swine flu to shame.For anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet and is unsure whether to trust the negative reviews or the positive reviews, I say this. Find someone who has seen this movie whose opinion on movies you almost always agree with. If they say you'll like it, go and see it and join in with the stupids who find this rehashed tripe hilarious. If you're going based on hype, you may end up as disappointed as I was.Oh and BTW, there's no way this movie belongs anywhere near the Top 250 of all time.

Memento a la Blotto,"Firstly as The Hangover is basically ""Blotto Memento"", and unfolds back to front I can't give ya too much in the way of plot.I will tell you things I thought prior to watching the movie:1/ In advance of the movie starting I had set the over/under of gay jokes at 5. And I had the over. (I was close but wrong. Although the first 2 gay jokes come in the first couple minutes.)2/ I saw Heather Graham's name in the credits and thought that exponentially increases the chance of seeing boobies. (Again only sorta right, not sure breastfeeding counts.)3/ This seems to want to be quotable. (The jury is out, I for one can't think of much that I would regurgitate in social situations.4/ This one from my wife, ""Bradley Cooper is Ben Affleck hot."" Now I know my wife so sadly I know this is supposed to be a compliment - not sure Cooper would agree.Now the limited things I can say without giving too much away:The boys leave for a Buck's party in the days prior to the wedding. Zach Galihhjgajsdfjgbjksbdjhikis (sp?) is the standard ring-in-relo that is almost always in attendance, everyone has met him multiple times but no-one really remembers him.Quick question, why a buck's party so close to the wedding and why could such an apparently cool guy only have two friends and a relo that would want to go? As a guy I would consider that poor form, any reasonable guy needs a couple days recovery time from a good buck's party.The jittery bride is told on the phone that the wedding ain't going ahead as planned, then the wavy lines appear (in our minds) and we go into flashback mode.The Hangover basically starts when three of our four lead characters awake after a ""rough"" night celebrating a bachelor party. In their $4,200 per night villa are the ingredients that over the film provide most of the laughs and help explain just ""what the hell happened last night?""A Tiger A Chicken A Missing tooth A Baby A Hospital tag A Mattress on roof A Cop car in their hotel bayAll of which are explained fully... aside from the chicken. Seriously, what happened to the chicken? I really hope there is an explanation in the sequel explaining the chicken's existence. Why? Why? Why? Was it to feed the tiger?Unfortunately, these are the things that keep me awake at nightAnyway it wasn't the hilarious, quotable laff riot I half expected going in, it was a pretty funny 90 minutes with some memorable scenes:Getting out of a night in prison. Finding a random naked guy in the car boot. Meeting Mike TysonZach Galikjuhkgcvksvdckhvsjikis (sp again?) is suitably random and apparently wasted-without-being-wasted at all times. But not as randomly hilarious as described in other reviews by any stretch.Bradley ""Affleck"" Cooper is the most rational and realistic of the three, while he is still a w**ker at times he is no more a w**ker than a myriad real-life guys that I have encountered at various Buck's parties and gents events.And as far as the dentist-guy and his b*tch girlfriend goes, no man should ever be as whipped as he is, and no comeuppance could be drastic enough to teach her a lesson. (I am not being sexist, everyone should have the right to a 50/50 relationship, and if they choose to have a 60/40 or a 70/30 and both parties agree so be it. The chick in this film is a total b*tch and needs a flogging.)Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Humorous but by no means hilarious. Will however be deemed an immediate classic by those still too young to have forged their own drunk stories. (God willing their time will come and this won't be as ""far out"".)If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I love it!,"One of the greatest comedies ever made is The Hangover. The story follows a group of friends and Alan as they celebrate a bachelor party in Vegas. Zach Galifianakis steals the show with his portrayal of Alan, providing constant hilarity in every scene he graces. The four friends have great chemistry, and the story gets crazier and wilder as it unfolds. It's amazing that the same director who made Joker also created this comedic masterpiece. He's proven his versatility with two exceptional films. If you haven't seen it yet, you should. The movie is filled with iconic and quotable moments, making it a must-watch that guarantees bursts of laughter.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Wild night,"The Hollywood bachelor night movie genre hasn't brought much glory to the industry. This put it all to extremes. The guys wake up one morning in Las Vegas and find a hen, a tiger and a six-months-year-old baby in their hotel suite. But one of the pals is missing.The rest is even more crazy. This is a performance in taste-lacking, but it's very funny and the tempo is high. The movie is certainly totally of this world, but 1,5 half hour of shallow plain entertainment.Las Vegas the myth, is once again the main character here.

The girls had some mixed feelings, they thought it was gonna be a black comedy with humour only men can relate to. They were wrong, since the movie begin both girls and guys where laughing 24/7. It's a fast and really entertaining movie!

Need a laugh...go for this one for sure!,"When did I laugh so much for a movie....long time!! If you are in for a good laugh...go for it! The movie is just fantastically made, with all the characters fitting in perfectly for the roles. Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Ed Helms are all so very amazing. Its Vegas baby, and who doesn't want to be there! The Script is perfect for the location (bachelor party) and the Director, Todd Phillips has just made a wonder out of it. Except for the scene where they carry back the Tiger, I never felt that there was any moment in the movie that looked ""unreal"". Plain movie where circumstances take them around, and made such a good humorous flick out of it. Phil (Bradley Cooper), the cool dude, driving the story, with Alan (Zach) in all that crazy stuff and Stu (Ed Helms) cracking those comments just perfectly fit in to make it a mind blowing hilarious flick. A special mention to Jade (Heather Graham) who looks lovely as ever making the guys skip a beat for sure. Mike Tyson with his best punch and the Chinese guy Ken Jeong with his unique style just make it a worth watch file. Liked the last part the most where they check out the pics and finally have the mystery unfolded.Must watch movie guys. I did already twice.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
More than expected,"I just returned from the theater where I saw ""The Hangover"", and I must admit, with what I saw from it first, I wouldn't have chosen it myself, but a very foxy lady (Italian, redhead, and a nice rack) asked me if I wanted to see that one, and any guy will know that if a girl like that asks you out, SHE chooses the movie. Awaiting her arrival, I met my cousin up front, and he told me he thought""The Hangover"" was that chick flick. After just watching the film for 2 minutes, Bradley Cooper appeared on the screen and my date said ""Oh God, he's so hot, that's the reason why I wanted to see the film"". At this point, I didn't really think this movie was going to be something, but soon I had to review my opinion.The humour in this movie for starters is of different levels. There is the sexual innuendo/teen-humour, there are crazy and absurd situations, there is some slapstick, basically, whatever humour you favour, this movie has got it. You'll laugh at some point in the film.The beginning of the movie gives you a great feeling. It really somehow has that vibe of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", where you also had the feeling that you wanted to experience the same fun the actors in that movie had. You just feel like you're on a ""magical ride"" with them, and you regret not being there in real life.The characters in this movie are really worked out nicely, both by the screenplay as well as the actors. Hot shot of the evening, Bradley Cooper, really gave me the impression like he was an incredible fun person to be around with, and I'd definitely want Phil (his character in the movie) to be my friend in real life. Zach Galifianakis (Alan) plays a great annoying little moron too. In the beginning of the movie you hate him, and you'd wish they dump him in the desert, but he manages to win you over by his at least good nature.A nice addition to the movie is Ken Jeong who plays a (probably) gay leader of the Chinese mafia who seems obsessed by imitating Western (African-American) slang and manners. Normally I'm not too fond of Asian actors, but this one really give the movie extra humour.Don't let a weak trailer keep you from seeing this movie. I've enjoyed it immensely, and had quite a few laughs, while I'm usually not the kind to break out in laughter.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Excellent Writing, superb acting, very clever","Anybody who comments about how this is a ""guy's only film"" should know that my doctorate wife laughed as hard and frequent as I have ever seen her laugh. This is an exceptionally well-written movie. There was only one spot where I felt I knew what was happening next. The Asian bad guy, Mr. Chow, was very funny at first but his gay side was overdone.The ending was superb bringing the entire picture to closure for us. We laughed throughout the entire movie. My wife did not feel offended and we both want to go see it again. This movie is very well made.It should be stated that we find very few funny movies being made in the past decade. The Hangover is a huge exception. This is a comedy with creativity. I haven't heard that much laughter in a theatre since ""There's Something About Mary"". I imagine that movie also insulted some people with some of its ""vulgar humor"".The poster who said he felt he wasted $20 on the movie and the food he bought at the theater has judgment that cannot be trusted. After all, who spends that much on food at a movie theater?",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"It's okay, but if you've been bombarded by the ads you've mostly already seen it","I was wary of seeing this, because I've really disliked Todd Phillips previous films, which include Starsky & Hutch and Old School. I just find them tremendously poorly written and directed. And, yes, that does matter, even in a comedy. Timing is everything, and Phillips hasn't any timing. The reason I did go see this movie is for one of its actors, Zach Galifanakis, one of the funniest comedians of today. Bonus points for Ed Helms, who was probably the best of his generation of Daily Show correspondents. Galifanakis is one of the most oddball guys around, with a low-key style that's definitely a breath of fresh air in an industry now lead by Dane Cook. So does he overcome Phillips general horribleness? Yes. Well, he does. He runs away with the movie without trying. The movie doesn't triumph in the end, though. I have to admit, that's due a lot to the fact that the ads for this film have been relentless. The first trailer gives away about 70% of the movie's best jokes. And I was watching The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien most of Friday morning on Hulu, and the ads there filled me in on about 15% more of the jokes. So, yeah, they gave away about 90% of the jokes in the ads. And of the remaining 10%, there's only maybe one gag that floored me. This movie will definitely play best to those who haven't heard anything about it. Trying to judge it objectively, as if I hadn't seen all the ads, I'd still say that a ton of jokes fall flat anyway. Like I said, timing, and Phillips doesn't have any. He likes to continue on for too long a lot of the time. I also greatly disliked the movie's lead, Bradley Cooper. I guess it's not too big of a problem, as Galifanakas is never upstaged by him. Nor is Helms, even if he doesn't get the best material. Cooper is there, I think, to draw in women. He's the kind of guy women love and men hate. In short, he's great looking, but a total jerk. The film tries to play him off as a semi-sensitive man when all is said and done, but I never bought it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Profane, Vulgar, Obscene.  Loved It Like a $2 Whore.","You know how sometimes a film's buzz can be so loud that your high expectations are undermined by mindless drek? ""Hangover"" is not one of those films. Brilliantly paced, the laughs were in almost every bizarre development, and the actors were so superb that every absurd twist, and nearly every line seemed natural.A few sequences were exceptionally worthwhile -- the first morning after events set up the rest of the film with outrageous sight gags that suggested epic debauchery without revealing too much too soon.Stay through the credits for a big payoff. You'll laugh until you hiccup, and then after you catch your breath, you'll laugh even harder. In fact, I may need a comedy intervention.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Got to love it,"Great movie about 4 guys going to Vegas for a bachelor party, they wake up the next morning missing a friend who is going to marry very soon. They are going to look for him. This will not go so simply because they have forgotten everything, so they try to remember by going to all the places en people they have seen the night before. I just saw it about 6 hours ago, in Almere(The Netherlands). It's very hilarious, with some very (and when I say very I mean VERY, VERY) random things in it. Some jokes are predictable, but that is not annoying, sometimes it even makes it better. This is a great movie for all guys out there, and for some even recognizable.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Hangover - one of the best comedies in a while... classic!,"I watched this movie without any real hopes of seeing a great comedy, I was expecting a movie that would make me laugh in certain situations, BUT I was so very wrong. The Hangover is one of the most memorable comedies ever made.The script is very well written, the jokes are unique, fun and the most important thing is that they aren't silly as most of the jokes in comedies nowadays are. The characters are very well created, they make you care for them and ""feel them"" and most of all they are funny (you must know what I'm talking about). The acting is great, there isn't any overacting and even if there is, it makes you laugh so hard that you forget all about it. I won't bother writing the storyline or any of the jokes in order to make this movie experience even better for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet, but I assure you, if nothing else, it will make you laugh.I recommend this movie to everyone who has ever been drunk, married, bored etc., basically I would just like to say that i recommend this movie to every single person.

Am I missing something?,"I am a little surprised that this movie has averaged such high reviews. It seems to be universally well reviewed on the web and many people I know that have seen it have highly recommended it. This may be the main reason why I was so disappointed, but overall I thought it was quite an average road-trip-gone-wrong type of movie and would have rated it as I have regardless. I certainly didn't experience the laugh-a-minute entertainment that others have mentioned. A faint chuckle here and there, but that's about it.Now I don't mind the odd far-fetched ""silly"" movie so I'm not a prude when it comes to this type of genre. The premise of the movie had potential, but the execution just didn't quite cut it for me. For starters, the acting was mediocre. ""That was bad acting"" came to mind in several scenes. Some of the situations were a little over-the-top, juvenile, and lacking in comedy. The cops with the tasers is just one of many examples. If you're into ""kicked in the nuts"" kind of humor, then you may find this really funny, but only barely made me grin.Not the worst comedy I've seen and overall wasn't a totally unenjoyable experience, but certainly (for me) not worthy of the hype it is receiving.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the more inspired and successful comedies of recent times,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThere's lots of places I'd like to visit in America, with it's fifty one states and stapling as the most powerful country in the world. But Las Vegas, to be honest, has always stood out as one I could quite comfortably avoid. The emphasis to me has always seemed to be on the casinos, and I've never gambled in my life (well, I've brought the odd lottery ticket.) But of course, there's also plenty of super hotels, nightclubs, world class shows...the place would seem to have something for everyone. But, from the sweeping over shots on the opening of The Hangover, my main problem with it now is that it all looks too over whelming to me, with bursting visual stimuli coming from every pore. ""Designed to inflame the senses"" as Ned Flanders well described it in an episode of The Simpsons. ""A place where it's against the law to be responsible"" as Piers Morgan more worryingly described it in a recent newspaper article for the Mail. Aya Napa and Ibiza are wild enough for me, but if you had the time and the money, just how out of control would things be if you had your stag night in Vegas? There's people in the world that could do that, and that's the high concept idea of this film.How wild it gets is that the groom Doug (Justin Bertha) goes missing...that's without mentioning a trashed hotel room, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet, a stolen cop car and the naked Chinese man (who turns out to be a camp Triad boss!) who jumps out the boot. Somehow smooth Phil (Bradley Cooper), charmless Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and meek Stu (Ed Helms) must make sense of it all while searching for their friend who's getting married in less than twenty four hours. It's such a simple but effective idea that probably works so well because of it's what if?...potential. Men together are laddish and egg each other on, and just how out of control could things be and just what would the consequences be? Of course a lot of the humour is facile and over the top, but it works well with the tone of the film in that's the mindset of the men involved and quite often the film is pant wettingly hilarious.The director (who luckily has a string of well known credits behind him) has taken a cast of unknowns and produced a highly successful high concept comedy that's inspired and original and like the best of them nowadays, about as politically correct as a drunken Roy 'Chubby' Brown. As such, it's definitely one of the better comedies of recent times. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Masterpiece!,"When you talk about Hollywood Cinema... You would talk about films like. The Shawshank Redemption. The Godfather. Citizen Kane. Scarface. The Dark Knight. Titanic. The Departed.

"So funny, so clever but, so raunchy, you don't want to tell your Sunday School class that you saw it!","Doug (Justin Bartha) is about to walk down the aisle with a beautiful lady, Tracy (Sasha Barrese). Therefore, his pals are taking him to Vegas for a big bachelor bash. These include schoolteacher Phil (Bradley Cooper), businessman Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug's soon-to-be brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis). Free-spirit Phil is trying to loosen everyone up, for Doug is less than adventurous, Stu is hogtied to his girlfriend from Hades, Melissa, who thinks they are going to Napa Valley for a wine tasting, and Alan is a chubby, consummate weirdo. The friends arrive at the hotel and go up on the roof for a toast. That's the last thing they remember, for in the morning, they wake up in a daze. A tiger is in their bathroom, a baby boy is in the kitchen, and Doug is missing. What happened in-between and why can't they remember? As they try to piece things together, while taking care of the little lad, they have encounters with the Korean mafia, Mike Tyson, a hooker who is sporting Stu's grandmother's ring, and more. Will they find Doug in time for him to make it to the ceremony? This film is very clever and very funny, sending most of the audience into a bellyache of laughter. However, it is definitely on the raunchy side, which some filmgoers will find offensive. You definitely don't want to mention in Sunday School class that you saw it. The cast is nice, with Cooper and Bartha quite fine as the two friends, and the lesser cast members are great, too. But, stealing the show, are Helms and Galifianakis, for they are funny beyond words and create very memorable characters in Stu and Alan, respectfully. The scenery in Vegas is glitzy while the costumes, camera work and other film amenities are very fine. Most importantly, great applause should be extended to the devilishly clever script and the rapid-fire direction. That does not mean, however, that drug use, excessing drinking, and other unsavory practices will seem ""funny"" to everyone. But, all in all, unless you are supremely hungover and have your head in the toilet, you would do well to head to the cinema for this one, all you comedy seekers.

One of the funniest movies I've seen in some time,"I had been expecting The Hangover to be released in theatres here in Peru for some time - the movie was ridiculously well-received in the States, and it eventually became one of the most unexpectedly popular movies of the year. Why it took so much time to arrive in Peru? God only knows - or maybe the ones who have the distribution rights too - but the fact of the matter is that, unlike other movies of its ilk, it has arrived in Peruvian theatres, much for the delight of local movie buffs and average Joes. And that's because being a sort-of ""Independent"" movie - yes, it was produced by a big studio, but it features no big name ""stars"" and it was made with a pretty limited budget - no one expected it to be as funny as other comedies featuring more recognizable actors and inflated budgets. But it is. The Hangover is decidedly hilarious - the funniest motion picture I've seen in the last three years or so, actually.When I say The Hangover is the funniest movie I've seen in recent years, I really mean it. The whole point of the movie is to watch these guys trying to remember what happened during their night of craziness, looking for clues everywhere they can, interrogating people who seem to have partied or done stuff with them, although they can't remember being with them. This leads to a whole lot of ridiculous and over-the-top situations, which include -but are not limited to - realizing that they got involved with some sort of crazy, gay Asian gangster, that the tiger they stole - yes, stole - belonged to Mike Tyson, or that Phil spend a portion of the night in the hospital. The movie doesn't provide with anything particularly outrageous - there's plenty of bodily fluids and profanity, although nothing that hasn't been seen before - but it is nevertheless hilarious because it knows how to exploit its funniest bits without tiring the viewer.None of the principal actors are particularly well-known, but they nevertheless seem to belong in this movie, playing these parts. Bradley Cooper is great as Phil, portraying him as a sort of asshole who, despite being what he is, can be likable from time to time. Ed Helms plays the out-of-place nerd who discovers that he can be pretty wild and crazy if he wants to - or if he has consumed enough alcohol - and does it marvelously. The weirdest - and by far funniest - characters is Alan, who as portrayed by Zach Galifianakis is definitely the most memorable character in the film. His strange personality can lead to some awkward situations - take the ""blood brothers"" oath for example -, but also to some of the most hysterical situations I've seen in any comedy. The Hangover ears its R rating by having some profanity and showing a couple of bare, male buttocks - you know, male nudity always seem to cause viewers to laugh - but it isn't as shocking as other films of its ilk. It doesn't need to be. It only needs to be funny, and it accomplishes this goal beautifully.I really wanted to see The Hangover, and now that I have done so, I can't say I was disappointed. Considering so many Hollywood comedies nowadays fail to make me laugh simply because they are too stupid or too derivative, it's refreshing to watch a raunchy comedy that's actually funny. It also helps that its main characters, despite not being particularly three-dimensional or realistic, are charismatic enough for the audience to care for them. The movie laughs with these guys, not at them, most of the time, and that's why, despite having a couple of stupid parts, it never really feels overly dumb. What can I say? With some solid performances, hilarious gags and jokes and very original premise - I really wonder why a ""hangover"" movie hadn't been done before, at least as effectively as this one -, The Hangover is an stupendous comedy. It will hardly offend anyone, and it should make most audiences cry with laughter.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Justin's off kilter, soon to be brother in law, the incredible Zach Galifianakis, joins them as well.The next morning the three of them wake up in a trashed hotel suite with a chicken, tiger and no sign of Justin.

He has a bit of early John Belushi to him, thanks to the heft and delivery. More importantly, he is not predictable in the least.Mike Tyson, who shows up for his tiger, adds quite the offbeat element, especially while singing Phil Collins ... wow. Rachael Harris is perfect as the bossy girlfriend to Helms and their showdown near the end is a winning moment.

Entertaining but on IMDb Top 250? No.,"It took a while for me to build sympathy for the characters. The action starts slow too. I guess they could have shortened the first half hour or so.

Some fun stuff, some childish scary-movie-type of jokes.While this is an entertaining flick I don't understand how it wound up on #130. Better than Snatch, Big Lebowski et al? No way! In my opinion this is one of the better comedies of the last several years but that is about it - especially since the best part of the movie comes with the credits.

A Hangover you wont soon forget,"What do you get when you take the concept of ""Dude Where's My Car"" add Mike Tyson, a tiger, and set it in Vegas? The result is a bloody masterpiece. Director Todd Philips (Old School) has outdone himself, and brings us his latest comedy that's so rude, profane, offensive, and raunchy, you just can't help but laugh. With days before his wedding Doug (Justin Burtha AKA: Riley off National Treasure) takes his friends Phil (Bradley Cooper – He's Just Not that into you), Stu (The Daily Show's Ed Helms) and Doug's Joaquin Phoenix look alike brother Allan (Zach Galifianakis) out on a road trip to Vegas for a night they'll never forget. The next morning Phil, Stu, and Alan wake up hungover with a tiger along with a baby in hiding their hotel room, and Doug missing. With only a day left to find him, the men set out on a city wide search using CSI tactics, but the question is can they find him in time for the wedding? The Hangover is a hangover you won't forget anytime soon. It takes what could have been just your average R rated raunchfest and turn it into something that's fun, classy, and utterly outrageous (thanks to the hilarious and likable chemistry between the cast.) At moments you'll feel that the comedy is forced, and some of the crudeness felt unneeded but at the end you'll realize you've had such a fun time you won't even remember its flaws. This is sure to be an instant classic and is by far the best comedy of 2009, but it's made for a certain audience in mind so if Sex Jokes, Profanity, or partial nudity isn't for you then, you might want to sit this one out. For those that don't care about that, if you're looking for a comedy loaded with fun, heart and cameos (Mike Tyson being the most obvious one) then grab $10 sneak in a bottle of vodka, bring your friends and let this be a hangover you won't forget.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not quite Ferris Bueller...,"Okay, it's about a stag night that goes wrong, four thirtysomething lads are heading out to the city of sin, Las Vegas - when they awake the next morning things have gone badly wrong but they can't remember any of it and have to retrace their steps.I enjoyed it enough but it didn't quite hit the spot, somehow I felt Judd Apatow (Knocked Up, 40 Years Old Virgin, Forgetting Sarah Marshall) would have made it work better. It has the flavour of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but we don't quite get time to know the characters and the humour is a bit broad, a bit obvious in that it's designed to evoke the audience sympathies. Ooh, one of their friends is a bit weird with a horrid beard and lets his pants hang down of his backside! He's not allowed to be near schools it seems! What a character! Yawn. None of the actors are really comic actors. I didn't quite warm to them.Towards the end of the film it loses touch with any semblance of reality, unlike 'kids'' movies like Risky Business or Ferris Bueller, where you had your heart in your mouth towards the finale.What it did have in common with Apatow's films is the vein of misogyny he gets accused of; all of the women are shrews bar the happy hooker in Vegas played inevitably by Heather Graham.Great soundtrack, Vegas looks terrific but not a hugely endearing film.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I've never seen a movie that throughout the movie every at most 2 minutes i wouldn't laugh.firstly i'm not gonna tell you any funny parts or quotes in the movie because its not fair 4 you but it wouldn't make much difference if i told you 5 or 6 parts because there is so many funny parts its hard to think of them.Basically it beats all of my past favourite comedy's by Judd Apatow although he is a genius in himself, he just does not beat this movie. all my past favourites like superbad (my 2nd favourite comedy), knocked up, forgetting Sarah Marshall nd i love you,man just are not as funny. it is very hard 2 admit but it is simply just the best comedy ever if not in my top 5 movies of all time.A MUST SEE nd A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The greatest thing to happen since Wedding Crashers,"Yes, it's that good. I just got out of the theater, and instantly felt the need to write a gushing review for this movie.The premise, free of any major spoilers, is that four friends go to Vegas on a bachelor party, black out and lose the groom. Now this could have gone wrong in production, since a simple recounting of the crazy events would have made a funny but very ordinary movie. Instead, the movie focuses on the morning after, and laugh after laugh results from seeing crazy sh*t that transpired in the last 14 or so hours: including a tiger, Mike Tyson and a naked, angry Asian mobster (whose voice was stereotypically a bit reminiscent of Kim Jong Il from Team America).It's the characters that really make this movie. The groom doesn't really play that big a role; the future brother-in-law, Alan, and the two best friends, Stuart and Phil are hilarious. Alan is a weird and inappropriate guy that never fails to shock and produce hilarity, with memorable comments like 'Classic!', 'I find your language offensive' and the wolf pack speech. Phil is a bit more of a cliché, but he fills the void of the necessary 'cool guy' of the group, who likes having a crazy time. Stuart is a neurotic kind-of-dork-but-not-really, someone you sympathize with because he's totally whipped.In conclusion - I think this movie is a must see for anyone that enjoys this kind of humor. There are no fart jokes for the lowest common denominator, but there is an overload of genuinely witty banter and plot twists. There are no clichéd epiphanies or moralization. It's about a good time, perhaps too good a time, that went wrong, that'll make you want to hop in your car and drive to Vegas. This movie really took a trite topic - the bachelor party - and turned it into a great plot, great characters, hilarious lines and a satisfying ending.Definitely a 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I've never laughed so much in my life!,"I went to go see this film about a week ago not long after it released here in the UK and I have to admit I was expecting the usual comedy where the best parts are in the trailer! That was not the case:The Hangover has got to be one of the funniest, well written and comically genius movies of all time!! It will have you laughing from beginning to end and if you don't go see this you are definitely missing out!!Everything that you want in a comedy you will get with this movie and then some! I'm a big fan of eighties comedy when everything was new and unseen so i rarely find todays comedies as funny but this film has made it to the top of the list in my eyes and i will be very surprised if anyone doesn't love this movie as much as i do! it will definitely be making it into my DVD collection and i may do something i hardly do...i might go see it again at the cinemas!Amazing!

Remembering The Night That Was,"The HangoverFor those of you who are looking for a low-brow summer comedy with offensive jokes relating to babies, overweight men, testicles, drugs, hookers, strippers, immigrants, dentists, Las Vegas, and Mike Tyson than 'The Hangover' is the right movie for you. Directed by Todd Phillips of 'Old School' fame, he brings back classic characters from his claim to fame; the infamous wedding singer returns as well as the guy looking for the 'gang bang'; to shed light on the history of this genre of comedy that some producers and audiences can't get enough of. This movie is no exception, it pushes the limitations of its audience with its humor, both physical and verbal, from the hilarious mannerisms of Alan (Zach Galifianakis) to great writing and pacing of a night that nobody can remember.It all starts with a wedding, followed by a flashback which begins with the bachelors Alan, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and the groom to be Doug (Justin Bartha) driving to Las Vegas for one last night of fun at Caesar's Palace. Each character carries excess baggage with them (Phil is looking to escape his mundane life as a teacher, husband, and father; Stu is dating a possessive woman that monitors his every move; Alan is a hazard to be around in general; and Doug is getting married). Their plan is to just have fun and forget about where they came from and this comes back to them full circle because they get drugged before the night begins and can't remember any of the events that took place or where to find Doug. This is the premise for the film, but the flashbacks are limited to security tapes and photos that act as the refresher for the three remaining members.They go on a wild goose chase to a hospital, wedding chapel, sketchy motel, police precinct, impound lot, casino floor, and the dessert looking for Doug. They encounter doctors, police officers, strippers, a baby, a tiger, Mike Tyson, and a Chinese dignitary. But all of this is a blur to them and they make fools of themselves in the process trying to piece the night together, but it is all in vain as the trio only puts together a time-line of events and can't decipher when are where their friend disappeared. They make fun of themselves, each other, those around them, and by those around them along the way; bringing to life their personalities and giving hope to solving their problems back home along the way which adds to the humor of the storyline.Each character has their own subliminal conquest when entering Las Vegas, they don't solve it when they leave but living through the night of their lives sheds light on their current situation causing each of them to appreciate the things that they have, or don't have, even more when they go back home. In their attempt for a night of fun they overcome their backgrounds and are considered equals when it comes to their memory. While searching for their friend they learn things about themselves that weren't quite clear prior to their trip and are able to bring all of their past problems to the surface. However, no real solution is devised for any of them or their problems, but they return to California changed men for the better.'The Hangover' shouldn't be viewed as a comedy or and coming of age story,as it gets played out as. Rather, look at the film as a guidebook for what goes into a man's head. Not everyone has experienced a night like this, nor will many have a chance at it, so use the film as a vehicle to explore the unknown and take notes on what one should and should not do along the way.I don't want to spoil the ending so I'll cut myself off here and leave you with a plea to see the movie with an open mind and a plan. The open mind will make the jokes more amusing, especially since they all come out of nowhere. The plan is for how you can avoid these situations with future bachelor parties or trips to Las Vegas. If nothing else see this movie so you know what to avoid when experiencing one of these two.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Funny Film, Not My Cup of Tea, But Pleasant","Just before his wedding, a man and his three friends go to Vegas, a land of adventure where anything can happen. And in this movie, anything does happen. You'll never believe so much can go so wrong in such a short time. How will the friends be able to recover from such a seemingly disastrous night?I had heard some positive buzz on ""The Hangover"" from a variety of people, and figured why not watch it? And I will say that while I'm glad I did, it's not quite on a par with other comedies, despite several humorous and outrageous moments. The first twenty minutes is a bit slow, and although it quickly recovers, I just didn't end up feeling as entertained as I had hoped when it was all over. Maybe the characters weren't lovable or something... I don't know. I see this film's popularity declining in a year or two. I'd much rather watch ""Slackers"".Don't get me wrong. The cop car bit is hilarious, the Asian guy from ""Community"" is pretty cool, and the tiger... well, there's a tiger! In fact, my favorite part is Ed Helms' song about the tiger (sometimes referred to as ""Tiger Snooze"", though the actual title is unknown to me). Oh, and a Holocaust ring. My biggest complaint is Heather Graham. While she does fine, I just never cared for Graham and I heard that the part was offered to Lindsay Lohan. I much prefer Lohan, and it's a part that could have helped her collapsing career. Oh well.If you like ""Old School"" and ""Wedding Crashers"", this is probably your sort of film. I don't mind those, but it's not really my favorite. And this isn't exactly the same -- it's not Will Ferrell, it's not Judd Apatow. But, the trend in comedies these days is going in a direction I don't necessarily appreciate as others do. I can't pinpoint it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best comedy since ages.,"This is definitely one of the funniest movies since ages and for me it comes right after ""the 40 year old virgin"" and ""The big Lebowsky"", which I consider as the funniest movies for men ever.Gladly all the stupid ""hollywood business as usual love stuff"" was left out of this one. It's full of surprises and not only a commercial copy of other successful comedies like so many others I have seen within the last 3 years.I guess I will see it over and over when it comes out on DVD.Because I consider the music as slightly too commercial, I'll keep the last point for me and hope there will be a second part of this next year.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Probably the biggest disappointment this year,"I must have read a half-dozen reviews of this movie before seeing it. My wife and I were in need of a few good laughs but instead we struggled for every one. I frankly can't imagine a more damning criticism. My expectations had been wildly off the mark. The players were pleasant enough but not particularly engaging or worth as much time as given to them here. Allen, though over-the-top, was my favorite as the bearded somewhat sappy goof-ball. He was fun to listen to and watch, for a while. But the storyline was not very impressive and seemed to have been written by someone in high school. It just tries way too hard to be cute. Probably one of its better points is it didn't denigrate or belittle any particular ethnic group. To the contrary, one of its obvious intentions is a strangely low-key and stealth attempt to put in a good word for Jews as, I guess, fairly ordinary, fun-loving people. It did take a shot at gays, however, and Mike Tyson, probably without realizing it, is made to mimic a fairly recent European commercial where an ape plays the drums to a familiar song whose title I can't remember. If I were the producers I'd pray Mike doesn't find out about that!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Chaotic, stupid ,but very funny","Nothing more then a deranged completely unashamed thrill ride of laughs, This film delights itself in mocking, teasing and outright twisting things that would normally be frowned upon if they were ever committed in real life.Showing a fairly accurate portrayal of how things can get out of control in Vegas, The film follows the exploits of Phil, Stu and Alan. Three guys who one day go out on a stag-night to the city of sin itself before a wedding with Groom-to-be Doug who goes missing the following day next morning leading to the three trying to piece together the events of what exactly happened during that crazy last night in which they were all tipsy and out of their minds.Characters swear like sailors, Propert is broken and smashed, Danger is made a complete laughing stock, all put together to form one anacarhic and funny comedies.

"Overstays Its Welcome, Hang Around at Your Own Risk.","About-to-be-wed Justin Bartha is accompanied by his three friends (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis) to Las Vegas for one last breath of bachelor freedom. All hell breaks loose though after the first night as Bartha is nowhere to be found and the trio of pals have absolutely no recollection of anything that transpired. Would-be comedic dynamo which starts off like a champion and then fades into obscurity like a washed-up bench-warmer. The typical ""Old School"" and ""Wedding Crashers""-styled comedy wears out its welcome as the zany situations (a missing tooth, an abandoned baby, a loose tiger, a stolen police car, the yakuza, and so on) come at you fast and furiously with adult situations and sometimes downright vulgar outcomes being the orders for the day. Lost in the mix is Bartha (just basically getting lost in the shuffle early on) and usually dependable performers like Heather Graham and Jeffrey Tambor who have little more than token parts. Cameos by Mike Tyson and Mike Epps are unnecessary distractions and the inclusion of sexually-confused Asian crime boss Ken Jeong (seeing more of him than we want) are dizzying sidelines which represent little rime, reason, and most importantly merit. Good for a few laughs, but at an over-priced expense. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Good Comedy,"The Hangover is a very funny movie with several parts in the movie that made me laugh out loud for quite a while, my friends too and the whole audience also obviously really enjoyed it. This movie is better than most of the new comedies I've seen in the last couple years or so. The performances are good with all of the actors knowing their roles and getting really good laughs with the parts they've been given. On the down side there are a few parts where they go for too easy a joke or a joke you can see coming, or where the movie drags without any laughs for a while, but all things considered this is still well worth seeing if not at the movies then rent it when it comes out on DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Freaking hilarious,"I had a feeling about this movie, from watching the trailers, and let me say, it's THE most hilarious movie I have ever seen. It's escapism at its best. Who wouldn't want to roll into a movie theater, be thoroughly entertained for 100 minutes and literally laugh your *ss off so many times you come out feeling like you've done two hours of crunches at the gym the next day? It's rude. It's vulgar. It's raunchy. It's so, SO politically incorrect. And it doesn't apologize for any of it, which I LIKE. There are many grains of truth in it's absurdity, which really is what makes it so funny. The cast clicks and the story line, while ridiculous, is engaging. I absolutely loved it. I'd go see it again, and it would be just as funny the 2nd time.For those who hated it, to each his own. That's why some of us like sushi and some can't stand it. C'est la vie.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A real comedy,"Just when I was starting to think I lost my sense of humor, along came The Hangover. I've been getting an uneasy feeling over the last decade that comedy is a dead genre; the ones that achieve any kind of critical acclaim are either mixed genre and dramedies, like Little Miss Sunshine or Juno; and I've enjoyed some absurdist films like the ones of Wes Anderson; but strict comedies have been hijacked by the likes of Adam Sandler, Will Farrell and - horror of horrors - Friedberg and Seltzer. These are crude comedies that rely on gross-out humor and very cheap laughs, while dismissing everything else that makes a movie watchable. Not since the late 90's have I truly enjoyed a comedy purely for the laughs. Was something wrong with me? The Hangover was a big surprise - at first glance it looked a lot like those gross-out comedies that are everywhere to be found. Indeed, Todd Phillips doesn't shy away from crude sexual and physical humor - which can be seen as early as his forgettable debut, Road Trip. But The Hangover has some other things that Road Trip didn't - good pacing, solid characters with interesting interactions, and genuinely funny moments. The humor is still mostly physical, but the story manages to grab the viewer's attention, and the far-out jokes fit right in, rather than being tacked on. It's a rare species these days - a strict comedy, which is truly funny and truly entertaining. I don't think I saw a pure comedy this funny since 1999's Office Space.The Hangover isn't a masterpiece, of course - it's a formula movie, and it embraces that formula whole heartedly. The characters are all familiar stereotypes, but they're written well enough and their interactions interesting enough that they feel real and compelling. In the same way, the editing, cinematography, music etc. are solid and built on well-founded and well-tested formulae that keep the viewer involved without distracting, the style never taking over the substance. It's a classic comedy, with no artistic pretenses but with plenty of laughs, comparable with John Landis at his best, and it's a real joy to see a movie like this can still be made today.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Hangover is perhaps the funniest movie of the year,"Well, I finally got to see the comedy sleeper of the summer: The Hangover. In this one, three groomsmen (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zack Galifianakis) are looking for the about-to-be-wed friend (Justin Bartha) after an alcohol-induced bachelor party in Las Vegas. This leads to so many weird twists and turns that listing them here doesn't do them justice. Let's just say a certain boxer is involved as well as a tiger, a baby, and an accidental marriage of one of the groomsmen. Many lines and scenes are both cringe and laugh-inducing enough that I had a pretty good time throughout. By the way, I recommend you stay for some of the ending credit sequence. And I definitely recommend you watch this quite most hilarious and at times touching movie, The Hangover.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sometimes everything is done RIGHT in a movie!,"Simply put, The Hangover gets everything right. First, the movie is hilarious. Second, the direction, script, and comedic timing are spot on. This is one of those movies that guys in their 30's and 40's can relate to very easily. So many of us have either been in or known friends who've been in situations like this only to relive these experiences later in life as our ""You won't believe it story"". As someone who rarely takes time to comment on films, I have to say ""what a great job!"" to the director and all the other cast and crew for really getting all the elements to come together so well. From the choice of actors to the cinematography, editing and score, this film made me laugh over and over again, while appreciating how well all the talented folks who worked on this movie did such an outstanding job. I can't remember when I've gone to see a movie more than once, and I've seen this one 5 times! This is extremely rare for me. Don't wait for the DVD go see it now, but I will buy the DVD. I can't wait to see the deleted scenes and extras like director commentary on this. Thank you for making a classic!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"No headache, just laughs in Hangover.","The Hangover is a reckless comedy that follows the usual male bonding road trip formula but with an edge that makes it stand out from the rest of the pack of sophomoric comedies made in this vein.Stu, his two best friends and his rather odd brother in law head for Vegas to celebrate his bachelor party. On the rooftop of the Bellagio they drink a toast to the night ahead. Flash forward to the next morning where three of the four awake to a trashed suite with a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in a bedroom. Stu is nowhere to be found and everyone's memory (due to spiked drinks) of the night before is a blank slate. In order to find Stu and get him to the church on time they must piece together the night before.Hangover's ability to maintain a degree of suspense, albeit comic, throughout while remaining irreverently hilarious as it goes in an out of bounds of credulity and taste is what makes it a refreshing entertainment. So a wedding chapel owner gets shot in the shoulder with no repercussions or the hapless trio agree to be tasered by police in a classroom who then give students a turn. Ridiculous? Yes? Hysterical? That too.It's clearly a guy film with it's un PC chauvinism, insensitivity and actions by the eclectic band of jerks in full display of extended adolescence but women's laughter was every bit as evident as men the day I caught the show.

"Still funny-ish, doesn't age well","When The Hangover hit theaters in 2009, it became an instant cultural phenomenon, celebrated for its raunchy humor, outrageous antics, and unexpected plot twists. The premise of three men piecing together a chaotic bachelor party gone wrong struck comedic gold at the time. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis delivered memorable performances, with Galifianakis' quirky, offbeat Alan stealing every scene. However, revisiting the film today reveals a comedy that hasn't aged gracefully.Many of its jokes rely on stereotypes and humor that, by modern standards, feel dated and often offensive. The depiction of gender roles, casual homophobia, and the treatment of characters like Mr. Chow lean into punchlines that lack sensitivity or nuance. The absence of meaningful female characters-relegated to nagging wives or exotic dancers-feels glaringly one-dimensional.While The Hangover remains a snapshot of 2000s comedy and its wild, boundary-pushing tone, its reliance on shock value limits its ability to resonate with audiences.I saw this movie in theaters when it came out and thought it was hilarious. Just watched again for the first time in many years and it didn't hold up.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

What happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas unfortunately,"After seeing the movie I was so unimpressed I felt like writing an ironic review praising the fine acting and exquisite plot in this film. However, since it's currently in the IMDb top 250 and number one in the US box office, being a bit more serious seems like a better choice since I think the irony probably would be lost on most people.The Hangover is about four guys who go to Las Vegas to attend one of the guy's bachelor party. They have a wild night and wake up the next morning not being able to remember a single thing from the previous night. This setup could possibly make for a somewhat entertaining film, however they have failed on this one. Out of the running time I think I laughed about two times. It's a very excruciating thing to watch a film where even one joke falls flat, in this one which is supposed to be a comedy they turn into string combos of jokes that simply aren't funny.The humor is crude, sexist, violent, and still without going ever going over the line which is a problem. Comedies that go over the line, like Borat for example really is my cup of tea, but The Hangover never really dares to venture there. For example you are supposed to think the fat guy is funny because he is weird and stupid, although he comes off as too pathetic for it to be funny.The plot never draws you in since one does not feel anything for the main characters, they are all unlikeable in their own unique way. In movies it's important to have a logical thread going through the entire film, and not introduce too many random characters or events that are not motivated, especially not in the later half or so. In The Hangover way too many characters and situations are just randomly inserted which I suppose is meant to be goofy and hilarious, but it just comes off as bad scriptwriting.Worst of all though, and what really puts me off in The Hangover is the glorified picture of Las Vegas it produces, which unfortunately is very common in the mass media today. Las Vegas appears to be a paradise on Earth, where you come to have fun, win lots of money, and still leave with a smile on your face, no matter what happens. Because, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Well, let me tell you something: I've been to Las Vegas. Never in my life have I been to a more horrid place. I would never ever want to go there again. To me Las Vegas really embodies all the bad parts of the American culture. Nothing feels real there, it's all about surface and everything has this plastic, artificial feeling to it. Commerce is what it's all about there, spend money or lose it by gambling. None of this matters though, because most of the average joes watching this film will never go there, so film makers can continue to picture Las Vegas in this almost mythological way.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest movie of the year.,"Well, it might be that everything there is to say has already been said, but today I feel like sharing my opinion. I am one of those people who put their DVD players on repeat. Especially, if I like what I see. I saw this movie for the first time already long time ago, but I do watch it over and over again. Today was one of those days. I must say that even though I've seen it many times, it is still funny. I guess it is not that easy to come up with jokes that would be funny when repeated over and over. This team has done it. I am so impatient for the sequel. I do wish those guys most of luck and success in making the second film just as good and funny. I love the fact that this movie has a reality feel to it. No matter how ridiculous and impossible the situations are, it still seems plausible. Maybe it is because those guys could be anyone and everyone. Like who hasn't been to a wild party?! Well, maybe not as crazy as that Any way, it is something new and fresh in the vast sea of American-Pie-type movies and all those romantic comedies. Don't get me wrong! I liked the first American Pie. May be the second, but all those sequels and alike no, not really. And what's up with all those romantic comedies!? Girl meets boy, boy meets girl, and so on. Most of them are all the same. You can see them once and forget just as you exit the theater. Sometimes I catch myself guessing the turns of the plot and ruining the movie for my friends by telling them exactly how it is going to end. I don't like to be able to do that after the first twenty minutes. I like surprises. It is really rare nowadays that one gets that in a movie. There are so many things made that I can understand that it is hard to find an original subject and, even more, to surprise the viewer. Well, I would like to conclude this short account of my impressions by citing a friend of mine who said that this movie is the best thing that has happened in cinema this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

the  chaos,"for many viewers it represents one of the great comedy. it is not a wrong verdict but important in its case is the courage. the courage to use so many ingredients, the courage to create and use a big chaos, the courage to work with a special cast. and that is, for me, the source of its impressive success - the freedom as only way to say a story in each person discover himself. the result - a profound different comedy because it only seems an easy job but it is work of high precision of script and director art. a film about nothing but not another Seinfeld. a film without taboos but , strange, not vulgar. a film about friendship as link between ordinaries men. and few memorable scenes. an old recipes in new clothes with a fresh spirit. that could be all. but it is not a bad idea to see it. again. and... again. for fun. and for the charm of insignificant details who becomes real important.",,Anonymous,Comedy

It was probably on par with Step Brothers, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Knocked Up (also overrated), etc. It was a solid, good funny movie, but has no business being on the top 250 list, and being one of the top comedies of all time (according to the list). There were laughs, but I never found myself sucking for air or bending over cause my sides hurt, which I did for the previously mentioned movies.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Hangover,"The Hangover, is about a bachelor party in Las Vegas for a couple of friends that ends up going totally wrong, resulting in the friends trying to remember what exactly happened the night before and retrace their steps to eventually get back home again in time for the one character's wedding. More problems and off the wall hilarity follows. It seems recently that a film like The Hangover could really be a hit, or a miss. It is an R rated comedy that is very crude and sometimes very silly and something like that could go either way with critics. We have all seen how well the R rated films of Judd Apatow have been received as well as films like Borat and Wedding Crashers. All of those films for the most part I enjoyed a lot and I will add The Hangover to the list of R rated adult comedies that actually work really well. The comedic performances, which I always find so important to a comedy, are right on target here with a few exceptional performances from some of the supporting cast and overall they make the film work. The film's script is like I mentioned, pretty off the wall and it really is a wild and crazy movie, but it makes for a very entertaining, hilarious and at times exciting ride that you just get fascinated by watching. You do not perhaps want to be one of the characters in this film, but watching them and as things keep getting worse and worse for them in totally unpredictable and bizarre ways it is very captivating and will sure to keep you entertained. Even if this genre of comedy is not your particular taste, I would find it hard for someone to be bored by this film because it is so faced paced and wild that we feel the characters and us in the audience have just entered a non stop roller coaster ride that will make us laugh, feel a bit nauseated at times and will certainly keep us alert and wanting more of the crazy ride we are on. That, I feel is an appropriate way to describe this movie. And even though a lot of the film is silly and a bit on the far fetched side, a lot of it is very creative and just to make an almost two hour film work so well as this one does, you have to acknowledge the talent that went behind it. The performances work, the script works and the fast paced direction all work and make this film not just an above average comedy, but instead a very good comedy that is one of the best of the past few years. It is very funny, entertaining and like I mentioned it will capture your interest and take you on a wild jolted ride till the film ends. I personally really enjoyed myself when I saw this film and this is a perfect example of an adult comedy done right that is pure entertainment, but done well, so we are not only entertained, but get a lot of laughter and enjoyment from watching it. One of the best comedies of the year so far and for fans of the above mentioned films, this is highly recommended for you as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Overaged wannabe ""bachelor party comedy""","The problem with this one is that all the men are over 30 years old (Zach is 40) when the film was shot and they are filming a bachelor party comedy. However, it failed my expectation. 4 men ride to Las Vegas for the bachelor party of one of them and when they arrive at the hotel, they strangely end up on the roof to drink some shots that Alan brought along. After that, the story resumes from the next morning in their huge hotel room where everyting is a mess. There is a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in a closet. Guess what, they synchronously lost their memories of the previous night. The story is about recollecting what happened that night and finding their missing friend. It is a farce comedy and everthing is overly exaggerated. Director even resorts to slapstick to save the day, but for me it does not work. Maybe, it can be a good pick for teenagers.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""The Hangover"" Sustains Greatness","In the opening of ""The Hangover"", in the middle of the Mohave Desert, Bradley Cooper's haggard Phil calls Doug's fiancée Tracy (Sasha Barrese) to inform her that they have ""lost"" Doug (Justin Bartha). Distressed Tracy reminds Phil that they are getting married in 5 hours. Phil replies, ""Yeah that's not going to happen."" Director Todd Phillips's ""The Hangover"" is the funniest movie of the year. And the story by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore is brilliantly hysterical.The premise is outrageous. In a Las Vegas bachelor party completely gone awry, a group of buddies wake up the next morning to discover their Caesar's Palace suite demolished, with a tiger in the bathroom, a baby, but missing the groom Doug (Bartha). Phil (Cooper) has sore ribs and a hospital wristband. Dentist Stu (funny Ed Helms from ""The Office"") is bloodied and missing a tooth. Tracy's brother Alan (wacked out Zach Galifanakis) is sans pants. All three have no clue what happened in the previous 10 hours, when they lost Doug. The last thing they basically remember is making a toast with Alan's Jaeger Meister. Phil, Stu, and Alan must pool their damaged resources and return Doug for his wedding back in Los Angeles.The defining moment of ""The Hangover"" comes when the crew watches a surveillance video with Mike Tyson at his home. Mike asks, ""You guys stole a police car?"" Stu sheepishly cops to this. Mike high fives saying, ""Nice!"" Later after watching the entire debacle on tape, Phil apologizes to Tyson. Mike says, ""We do dumb sh**, when we're f***ed up."" That pretty much sums up Todd Phillips's ""The Hangover"". It is a hysterical ride, and ultimately all plausible. Make sure to stay through the credits of the movie. Bradley Cooper as ring leader Phil is going to be a star. He is tall, handsome, and has great comedic timing. Cooper also is the surprising solid one, who literally rolls with the punches. Ed Helms is the brilliantly unglued Stu, who is about marry his bitch girl friend Melissa (taut and scary Rachael Harris). Zach Galifianakis is initially warped creepy as Alan. He points out to Doug when they pick up teacher Phil that he can't be within 200 feet of a school or a Chuck E Cheese. Galifianakis effectively morphs into a lovable loner. Justin Bartha nails the straight man Doug. He is so comfortable being with funny, which is not easy.While blitzed out his mind Stu marries big hearted stripper/ escort Jade (stunning and hysterical Heather Graham). Graham is amazing and beautifully lends ""The Hangover"" its deceptive charm. With all the high jinx including being attacked by a naked Chinese mobster Mr. Chow (funny Ken Jeong) wielding a crow bar or being stun-gunned by kids in the police station demonstration, ""The Hangover"" is all fun and never mean spirited. Writers Lucas and Moore craft a hilarious tale that is strangely plausible, and really about heart-felt friendship. Granted there are more hysterical moments that should not be missed. What I really appreciated about ""The Hangover"" is its spirit and sense of fun. ""The Hangover"" is one the funniest movies around.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
That's my grandma's ring. She made it all the way through the holocaust with that thing. It's legit.,"Funniest movie I've ever seen!!! The quote above is just one of many from this movie!!

Ed Helms is at his best for sure here! I have nothing against ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" but how can you compare those two movies!?!The end was the best part though. My girlfriend's face was so red for days from laughing so hard!!!! And the bachelor party in the movie was so much better than the ones I've been to in real life!!

The Hangover,"The Hangover has got to be one the funniest movies to come out. Between the dirty humor and the constant stupidity, it had everyone cracking up.The movie is mostly about these four guys who set out to go to Las Vegas for their buddy's bachelor party and end up losing him. They spend the whole movie looking for him, because they have no memory of what happened, hence the movie name the hangover.I mostly enjoyed this movie because it keeps people my age super entertained, and excited for the next one they come out with. In my mind there will never be a funny movie to beat this one, and there isn't one that even comes close to touching the fantastic acting played in this movie.I would recommend that everyone see this movie, once they reach the appropriate age.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Overrated...................Moderately funny,"I am a teenager, and every day at school kids would talk non stop about The Hangover. How funny it was, etc. I finally got the time to watch it and was very disappointed. I expected the movie to be the greatest comedy of all time. Instead, I got a moderate comedy with a bad story line.The plot for the movie is very unoriginal. They copied Dude, Where's My Car? and a Simpsons episode ( Homer and Ned travel to Las Vegas with hilarious consequences.) The flashbacks were very clichéd and not funny.Their were a few jokes in here that made me chuckle, but not laugh. Zach Galifinafkis had a very unfunny part, and Bradley Cooper didn't have any funny jokes, neither was Stu.I expected a great comedy, but got a flopper. Did I expect too much with this movie, or did I just not get how this movie was a masterpiece?",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Amazing,"Honestly the funniest movie since Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Right up with it, and 40 Year Old Virgin.Has a completely different comedic style to the majority of the Apatow inspired comedies of the last few years (not that there's anything wrong with Judd's films). But at the same time, totally different, and MUCH better than Old School.Galifianakis is brilliant, and the cameos fit in perfectly. Even the way in which the protagonists piece together the events of the previous night is well woven and not disjointed in any way. It's been superbly put together.Just a great great comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This Was Supposed to Be Funny?,"I didn't have very high expectations just because these kind of made-for-fraternity movies aren't usually appealing to me. In that regard it was what I expected. Not clever at all, there really weren't any jokes. I mean you pretty much know that the movie is going to be about a terrible hangover, and it is - but there aren't any very clever jokes, solid characters, or interesting situations where something funny might happen. Instead, the writers take the easy route (but not a very funny one) and all of the attempted humor is just pure shock-value. It just doesn't meet my definition for what a good comedy or good movie should be at all. I kept waiting to laugh, but never did. I would not recommend this film to anyone. It's all hype and marketing and does not deliver.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Genuinely Funny,"It's always great when you can share a movie experience with an entire theater of strangers. When an entire crowd can burst out in a unison of laughter, all the while making you appreciate each gag for its originality and authenticity. ""The Hangover"" is one of those rare movies where the audience becomes an extension of the group of buddies with which you went to see the movie. Not to mention, it's f**king hilarious. The unity with strangers aside, this movie is wholly satisfying as a comedy. Biased though I am (a Zach Galifianakis fan for years now), I enjoyed this film for everything it is: a gut-buster, brimming with laughs not only farcical in its whimsy, but deep-rooted in the stellar casts' interplay. Galifianakis is brilliant as the somewhat-disturbed third wheel thrust upon the bachelor party, almost all of his lines memorable and quotable. Cooper is spot-on as the dis-likable man-boy, ultimately redeemed through his belief in friendship and a renewed relationship with his wife. Helms somewhat continues his role from the office, an overly preppy suburbanite with a wild side (not to mention, wholly committed to the wrong woman), and uniquely hilarious nonetheless. So here's the kicker: I'm a film graduate, raised on uppity purebred master cinema, praising the work of the ""lowest"" form of entertainment: comedy. This movie was thoroughly entertaining, engrossing, and above all, absolutely hysterical. Shouldn't my reason for purchasing a ticket to be entertained? Isn't that what this movie did? Did it not unify a roomful of complete strangers with its unabashed hilarity? What then, is so wrong about this relationship?",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

As well as with the director, Todd Phillips.As the director, Phillips does a very nice job of having his actors involved in comedic antics, while moving the story along at a nice pace.I believe that it was at the top of the charts when it first opened and that it has been doing pretty well since.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Surprised By How Dull and Safe This Movie Was,"I judge the quality of a film comedy by how much it makes me laugh. I think I laughed exactly twice during the entire running time of ""The Hangover."" I was a willing subject. I wanted to like this film after hearing the endless praise others have heaped on it. I sat waiting for the jokes to land. And waited. And waited.I heard more than one person say that they never see movies, but they saw this one and loved it. That should have been my first warning that it wasn't going to be that good. It's jokes are so obvious and ordinary. There are a bunch of stock characters -- the fat schlubby guy, the nerdy uptight guy, the alpha male -- and a bevy of tired jokes built around things like breast feeding and naked guys.I guess I missed the memo that straight males are supposed to find the sight of another guy's naked ass the most hilarious thing ever.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I particularly disliked the guy who was always being an asshole towards the others as he seemed to be a complete douche and a waste of air. The guy named Alan was overacting in a way that is hard to describe. The one with glasses was boring and dull and the last one we didn't really see that much, which I am grateful for.This is just dick-humor, and a bad attempt at that even.

Underdressed,"""I didn't know they gave out rings at the Holocaust."" Alan (Zach Galifianakis)If you want more anti-PC humor, The Hangover gives it: gay Asian thugs, old man without underwear, shrill girlfriend, lovable whore, and Holocaust joke (see above). This boys-will-be boys comedy thriller has enough raunch and racism to garner a near NC-17 (stay for the credits) and enough crude laughs to make a few hundred mil.The weekend in Vegas for three groomsmen and a groom before the wedding turns into a lost one for the revelers, who can't remember what happened because a low-rent dealer gave them a date-rape drug rather than cocaine. The result is the chaos only a fiancé could dream of: lost tooth, child, and tiger; marriage to a hooker; $80 K of debt; and some very perturbed waiting women at home.The premise of their retracing the evening is a good one, providing a flashback with a detective edge.

Great mixture but not a milestone,"A great movie, good comedy, with fun and laughter, with drugs and dough, with obscenity and perversion, with a light and harmless storyline. A great mixture of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and some Guy Richie imitation. Expect no deep emotions, no love line, it's a film to watch with friends and beer.The story is strong with a retrograde mapping of the happenings, but has nothing new to say, neither has this way of decoding the confusion some newish style. It is a simply watchable movie, with a 'don't expect a ka-boom at the end' ending. Once is enough.What really impresses is the cut and rhythm of the movie. It is well balanced, no real slopes and hills, just evenly tense till the end.There is one scene that had some sort of introducing function, a nice idea: after drinking Jägermeister and forgetting the whole blood-brotherhood crap from Brother Alan, they raise their glasses to Cheers, than the camera swings on to the Vegas horizon showing the accelerated dawn behind the skyline. Let's the story begin!!! Harmonic few seconds...The characters, especially Alan are lovable, not to mention here, that the actors appeared until now in low-budget, somehow neglected films, which gives some extra taste and virginity to the film and the evolution of the characters.Summarized up I can only tell You, watch this film, it's worth.

"Low budget, low humor, low-classed, tasteless and generic. Trash.","This movie being rated with a similar rating as such a great films as ""Some Like it Hot"", ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Annie Hall"" shocks me.So generic. I find nothing funny about the same old gag trick of someone suddenly vomiting (which didn't look real, but I don't care), a car being trashed, people beaten up, cars trashed more, more beatings, slap-stick gags, breast shots, genital shots and ugly fat asses and more vomiting.Certainly the writer or whoever, wanted to use shock effect since most people nowadays have seen so much and heard so much that they have to go quite far to shock, but this was sooo cheap and low grade. A few others here have mentioned this as well and I really wish I had read their comments, but they were too far down the chain of praise for this stupidity. I only read the main comment that the IMDb gang has posted as the representative comment. Not to slam IMDb, it's a terrific site and I've used it for years, but there needs to be a balance so that people like myself don't get sucked into shelling out my hard-earned money to be dragged through this trash.It starts right off with insipid, re-hashed, foolish-high-school-kid type pranks which drones on to the very end. And that weird pedophile. What humor does anyone find in a pedophile? Do most people nowadays think it's funny? Or maybe it went over their heads. I don't know. Then the poor little baby was obviously frightened on purpose to get him to cry. Just that alone was upsetting me.I did laugh in a couple of places, but that was after I'd already been sitting there for half an hour kicking myself that I'd actually paid to watch this garbage and that short interval of ha ha didn't make up for the rest of the film which leans heavily on the above-mentioned cheap, low-grade, slutville humor.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A new yardstick for comedy genre,"Time and again the audience has proved fresh thoughts and new ideas are lapped up with immense joy and the success-o-meter of ""The Hangover"" is the proof. It goes without saying that the writing takes the crowning glory. Very smart, quite clever, intelligent and definitely out-of-box thinking translated into pen and paper.The four lead characters are so distinctly separate that everyone carves a niche in your head. Bradley ""Phil"" Cooper, the super-confident hulk obviously gets icing on the cake with the length of the screen time. Ed ""Stu"" Helms leaves an impression on how a typical alpha-male transforms into a prey to the BDSM acts of the oppressor, to the point its become an acquired taste. Zach ""Alan"" Galifianakis is a lovable character whom you would love to hate, but later unveils his hidden talent. Justin ""Doug"" Bartha, the bachelor who makes everybody do a chicken-run is found only in the beginning and in the end. Heather Graham has a limited screen time and she doesn't miss the opportunity to pop-out her ""hidden"" talent. Jeffrey Tambor as the would-be father-in-law leaves an impression. And yes Mike Tyson is a bonus in the movie.The good thing about the screenplay is the ""blacks out portions"" of the bachelors party which builds up the suspense quite effectively. A few snaps as the credit rolls attempts to provide few clues though. Some good one-liners and a few memorable scenes are bound to be topics of water-cooler discussion.Here hoping the sequel manages to raise the bar yet again - fingers x'ed.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Fun and mature comedy,"""The Hangover"" is a raunchy, outrageous, and hilarious comedy that follows a group of friends as they try to piece together a wild night in Las Vegas. Directed by Todd Phillips, the movie stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Justin Bartha as the four friends who wake up after a bachelor party with no memory of the previous night's events.The movie's strength lies in its clever writing, which expertly balances humor and heart. The script is full of laugh-out-loud moments, from the opening scene to the final credits. The cast delivers strong performances, with Galifianakis stealing the show as the eccentric and unpredictable Alan.The film's pacing is quick and energetic, with a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck speed. The movie's tone is unapologetically crude and irreverent, but it's also surprisingly sweet and sentimental.One of the standout aspects of ""The Hangover"" is its ability to balance gross-out humor with genuine emotional resonance. The movie's portrayal of male friendship is surprisingly nuanced, and the cast's chemistry is undeniable.If the movie has a flaw, it's that some of the humor may not age well. Some of the jokes and references may feel dated or insensitive to modern audiences. However, the movie's core themes of friendship and redemption remain timeless.Overall, ""The Hangover"" is a hilarious and unforgettable comedy that is sure to leave you laughing and quoting lines for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Plenty of laughs and likable characters makes the Hangover a winner in my book,"I first watched the Hangover about 3 years ago and absolutely fell in love with it. Having watched it again this evening, I must admit that I didn't love it quite as much as the first time I watched it, but it is a still a winner in my opinion.The plot is very simple and focuses on four friends Alan (Galifianakis), Phil (Cooper), Stu (Helms) and Doug (Bartha) all heading to Las Vegas for a bachelor party prior to Doug's wedding to Alan's sister Tracy (Sasha Barrese). Once in Vegas, the lads decide to celebrate Doug's last night of freedom in style which involves plenty of booze and plenty of gambling in the casinos. The following day the men all wake up worse for wear (as the title of the film implies), but there's a problem the groom Doug is missing and the lads can't remember what they did the night before and therefore they have no idea where to start looking. The men find themselves in a race against time to try and find Doug in order to get him back to LA in time for his wedding....There are several aspects that make the Hangover work. Firstly there is the script - John Lucas and Scott Moore have clearly put some thought into the script as there were many surprises along the way (most of which are as a direct consequence of the lads drunken behaviour). I found some of the twists in the Hangover to be pretty effective and as a result I found myself more and more engrossed in the film. Secondly, all the characters had a certain likable quality about them. Although, they still cause mayhem 'post hangover' they all still have a certain charm about them and a lot of the time they find themselves in ridiculous situations and doing ridiculous things all in a bid to try and find their lost friend so for that reason it is hard to dislike them. Thirdly, the chemistry between the 3 leads was also really good. Cooper, Galifianakis & Helms all worked well together - they are all very different characters who all think very differently which caused them to bicker quite a lot (which was funny in itself).The Hangover is a very funny film with a few surprises that can be found along the way. Whilst, I don't believe it is the funniest film I've ever seen, it certainly is a funny film that you should definitely check out.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
wackiness and loathing in Las Vegas,"In the tradition of ""Dude, Where's My Car?"", we have here a movie about some friends who go to Las Vegas for a bachelor party, only to wake up unaware of what happened and lacking the groom. All manner of high jinks follow.Basically, it's the sort of movie that they obviously had a lot of fun filming. Todd Phillips shows the same flair that he brought to ""Road Trip"" and later brought to ""Joker"".

Hilarious Movie,"The Hangover is a very good comedy movie. I spent almost all the movie time laughing. This one will make you laugh till you fall on your back. I can rate it one of the best comedy movies in history. . A group of friends meets many situations in which they act, think and talk some comedy. I didn't laugh this much a long time ago. I loved every second of the movie. and I'm ready to watch it again and again and again and I'm sure I will not be bored. All the four characters are amazing in this film. They played their roles very professionally. So, if you want a good comedy movie, this is the one you are looking for. As I can see (in the moment I wrote this review) it has a rating of 7.9 and I'm sure it deserves more than that. I rated it 10 stars as I love comedy movies especially good ones like this.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Hangover use of Foreshadowing and Time Elapse,"October 2, 2013ReviewTime plays a huge role when it comes to the making of a film. Foreshadowing is a technique that is often used at the beginning of movies to get the audience attention. This technique can have both a negative and positive view on a movie. In the movie The Hangover, directed by Todd Phillips, starts with Phil on the phone with Doug's wife Tracy. He told her that they messed up the night and lost her soon to be husband Doug. Then the movie goes back two days earlier to reveal to the audience what happened the nights before. Another example of how Phillips played with time is by showing the elapse of time over the Las Vegas skyline during the night of Doug's bachelor's party with his three friends in Las Vegas. I believe Philips' use of foreshadowing and the elapse of time is very effective because it kept the audience anticipated to see what happened.The use of foreshadowing at the beginning of the movie kept me engaged to see what happened to Doug and the bachelor party night. James Berardinelli from Reelviews quotes, ""The Hangover begins and ends conventionally""(N.p). Foreshadow at the beginning was conventional because it was unexpected and grabbed the audience attention immediately. Berardinelli went on and states, ""The film begins with a teaser: it's the day of the wedding, the groom is missing, and his friends are in the middle of nowhere""(N.p). Even though the situation Phil presents to Doug's wife Tracy was a serious situation, it was also considered to be comedic because who gets lost right before their own wedding. From Phillips starting the movie with a flashback it created the mood and plot for the rest of the film. This was a genius idea because it tells you the problem, but it does not go into detail on what happened for this problem to occur. This technique is opposite of an ordinary movie because usually the problem is built up into the movie, rarely is it given at the beginning of it. The counter argument for using this technique of displaying the problem at the beginning is because it reveals the main gist to early. I do not agree with this dispute because I think this was very much needed in The Hangover because it creates an attention getter.Another brilliant idea that Phillips used in The Hangover is the elapse of time over the Las Vegas Skyline. Even though the audience would have probably like to have seen what happened the night of Doug's bachelor party they didn't get to see the outcome. This is the counter argument of Phillips use of time elapse. Honestly I thought his use of time elapse was a great idea. The reason why I agree is because I think that Philip had in his mind from the start of the movie process that he wasn't going to reveal the bachelor party and what happened that night until the end of the movie. From Philip's doing this he created a mysterious effect to the movie making the audience question what happened the night of the bachelor party. Robert Ebert the movie critic states, ""The next morning, Doug will be missing. The other three are missing for several hours; none of them can remember a thing since they were on the roof of Caesars Palace, drinking shots of Jagermeister. They would desperately like to know: How in the hell do you wake up in a $4,200- a-night suite with a tiger, a chicken, a crying baby, a missing tooth and a belly button pierced for a diamond dangle? And when you give your parking check to the doorman, why does he bring around a police car? And where is Doug?"" (N.p). Philip's gives the audience the answers to the questions by showing how the three friends gathered up clues to determine what happened that night to find Doug. Ebert states, ""The search for Doug has the friends piecing together clues from the ER doctor, Mike Tyson's security tapes and a mattress that is impaled on the uplifted arm of one of the Caesars Palace statues. The plot hurtles through them""(N.p). The structure of this movie through the elapse of time gives it a unique element.Philips was able to create more of mysterious theme in a comedic movie through the elements of foreshadowing and time elapse. The Hangover is probably one of the most successful comedy movies in this century. Through Philips play on time it adds a more realistic effect to the humorous movie. The play on time fits perfectly with the randomness of the movie.Work Cited Berardinelli, James. ""The Hangover."" Reelviews. N.p., 05 Jun 2009. Web. 4 Oct 2013. Ebert, Robert.

Review of The Hangover: A Chaotic Comedy Full of Surprises,"The Hangover is a comedy that stands out with its unique premise and surprise-filled execution. Directed by Todd Phillips, the film follows three friends trying to piece together the events of a wild bachelor party in Las Vegas after waking up with no memory of the night before.The chemistry between Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis is strong, creating a dynamic that's both funny and unpredictable. The comedic moments often stem from the absurd situations they encounter while trying to retrace their steps.The film delivers fresh humor, although some jokes may feel too crude or not align with everyone's taste. Nonetheless, The Hangover succeeds in providing hilarious entertainment with constant surprises.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

funny,"This film is certainly the funniest film I have seen in my life. I have found most comedies over the last couple of years to be extremely worth to watch and I started to worry that I didn't have a sense of humour but this film proves that I was right and all the other comedies that have been made recently were wrong. The Hagover made me think that I should watch all the series of film in the future. Well, it is definite that I will suggest to people who ask me whether I know any comedy film to watch and have a nice time. Of course there are lots of films like that to watch, but the point which differ from others for this one is its charming sense of humour.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Highly overrated.,"My brother-in-law, who is in his mid 30s and who knows I love a good comedy, handed this DVD to me and said ""Here, you need to watch this. It's the funniest movie I've ever seen."" I should've known then it was going to be awful, considering in most cases his idea of ""humor"" is about the same as that of a 14 year old boy. However, I had heard others say how funny it was, so I thought ""maybe, why not?"" For the record, let me state that I'm a big fan of low-brow humor. I love the majority of the classic ""dirty"" comedies. The Hangover is DEFINITELY not in that group however. At one point I looked at my wife, who also likes a good comedy, and asked her if she wanted to watch something else. Her exact statement was ""Maybe it will get funny."" Not a good sign.The first problem is that the characters are just not likable. Justin Bartha's character is probably the most likable, and he's hardly in the film. Bradley Cooper's character is a massive jerk (much like his role in the Wedding Crashers, which is a MUCH better movie than this one!), Ed Helms' character is an irritating whiner and Zach Galifianakis character wasn't much better, just stupid irritating.Secondly, the movie tries too hard to be funny. ""Look, a dentist pulled his own tooth out! Isn't that funny?"" ""A tiger in a hotel room! Isn't that funny?"" ""Look, the idiot is a genius black-jack player! Whew, didn't see that one coming!"" ""Mike Tyson! Wow, that dude is funny, right?"" I could go on... The supposed gags feel contrived and forced.Finally, the ""dirty humor"" comes across as crass rather than funny. Animal House does dirty humor very well. It's funny. The Hangover does not. It gets the dirty part, but misses the humor.Save yourself two hours of your life and watch something else.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"In this current dark period of cinematic comedy, it's a relief that great movies like The Hangover are still being made","The intelligent comedy is a dying breed. Gone are the days of the Marx Brothers and good Woody Allen movies; here are the days of Meet the Spartans, farting and cameos from Carmen Electra. It's relieving, than, that in this current dark period of desperate cinematic comedy, great movies like The Hangover are still being made.The Hangover proves that there is still genius to be derived from the unsophisticated: this isn't routine slacker/bromance fodder; this doesn't sacrifice all its integrity for a flurry of puke-awful penis jokes. It carries itself with the wit of a sitcom and the flare of the big screen, resulting in the funniest mainstream comedy of the year thus far (I said mainstream, In the Loop, so don't worry).Todd Phillips has outdone himself this time, because The Hangover is his best film to date. Though, given his last outing was School for Scoundrels, that mightn't be saying much in terms of personal vigour, but his latest trumps a lot of America's recent comedic output.It's become a recent fad in cinema to compare almost every American comedy to the work of Judd Apatow, a more mature (but not quite as legendary) Kevin Smith. Following his rise to fame, his movies have conquered the hearts of cinema-goers, pleasing both the box office and critics. So, how do comparisons with The Hangover hold up? Well, if Apatow is an auteur for finding hilarity in the mundane, or deadly serious (unplanned pregnancy, heartbreak, etc.), than Phillips is the master for creating comic genius from the completely insane.In fact, the only thing that's even remotely similar to Apatow's frame of work is the layered character observations, because what's significantly exceptional about The Hangover, and that indefinable quality that made and didn't break it, is that it's very taken with its characters. Rather than constantly busy itself with an excessive drive of punchlines, it's very involved in the surprisingly acute development of our illustrious trio's relationship, and frequently reaches breakthroughs in terms of simpatico. An oddball (Zach Galifianakis' Alan), a lothario (Bradley Cooper's Phil), and a neurotic (Ed Helms' Stu) they may be, these characters are still very investible and very believable, and given the ludicrous events that transpire during the movie's runtime, that's pretty impressive.Though that doesn't mean it doesn't yield many a punchline; in fact, the gag rate is unfathomable, and, on average, there's a joke every few seconds. Even more impressively, for every joke that misfires, there are two that hit home, to hilarious effect.But going back to characterization, it brings me nicely to the performances; what's refreshing about The Hangover is it's neither the first comedic outing for a major actor, nor does it's cast consist of the usual humdrum SNL affiliates. While the primary trio are seasoned, it's great to see some different faces appose to the norm. And, boy, you wouldn't want this cast any other way.Bradley Cooper as Phil is cocksure charisma winningly applied to an everyman the average schmo can both like, empathize with and, similar to Galifianakis' Alan, somewhat idolize. He's slick, he's suave, and he's no slouch when it comes to punchlines, and, thanks to his leading man good looks, he's enough to bother Ryan Reynolds, and just as talented. Given that he's never really given a definable moment to shine, his insanity, compared to his co-stars, is admirably low-key, but, sadly, he is upstaged by both Helms and Galifianakis.Ed Helms, one of the most underrated and scandalously underused comedic actors to recently come about, fits the role of Stu perfectly, which is a pleasant surprise; fans of his will probably be more acquainted with the many self-serving, idiotic assholes that have shaped his frame of work so far. Hats off to Phillips for giving him the attention and limelight he deserves, because it was definitely worth it; watch Helms throughout, and you'll see how his increasingly-frustrated Stu begins to squirm. The character's outbursts mightn't come as quite a surprise as a result, but you'll still be able to watch a maverick subtly begin to take centre stage. If, however, you don't have the tolerance to do so, than simply laugh your ass off at his piano/voice solo midway through the movie, and particularly his rib-tickling fermata.And, finally, Zach Galifianakis... It's not difficult to identify which aspect steals the show; Galifianakis as Alan turns in a comedy tour du force; thanks to Galifianakis' undivided dedication to manic vivaciousness, and the innocent, dumb grace he inhibits the character with, Alan is the unfaltering focus of a very devoted audience, all of whom should be waiting for his next hilarious pratfall or observation (you can't masturbate on a plane because of 9/11, apparently). He is endlessly funny, and just never wears thin.Unfortunately, not everything is as steady; there's a hammy Ken Jeong, who, after one funny moment, just becomes plain irritating. Also, the film fancies itself both a comedy and a mystery movie, but the characters' sleuthing grows a little monotonous as things proceed. Every twist is very predictable, and while some scenes do offer legitimate pathos (the scene in the impound lot, for example), others just deter from the general interest. Thankfully, the movie is deliriously fast-paced and doesn't fret too much therein.And you yourself should not fret, because there's more than enough here to entertain and enthrall: three supporting players finally getting a stab at lead; a wonderful high concept used to its fullest potential, not to mention a great depiction of the title ailment; such unprecedented delights as a taser gun demonstration with two over-enthusiastic cops, a winking Rain Man spoof with a great and well-publicized use of the song ""Joker & the Thief"", and a rooftop speech from Alan that had me in stitches long after the movie was over.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Every scene is almost always stolen by Alan Garner, played so well by Zach Galifiniakis. Every actor plays off each other in a seamless way. This is not a real subtle, ""smart"" comedy, but it is so awesome that it doesn't have to be. There are so many great lines and scenes in this movie that when your still laughing at one line, another comes up and you laugh harder, overlapping each line and making you feel so fantastic.

The R18+ extended version is a must-see!,"The Hangover is, proudly, a film that does not follow the footsteps of those college and break up films, like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Old School, that is being overused nowadays and is rapidly becoming a bore but now we have a dirty, rude, hilarious film called ""THE HANGOVER"". It is one of those films that seem worthless but, instantaneously, from the first scene becomes a destined classic comedy that takes up your number one spot on your top 5 comedy list. It is a film with a stupid plot that quickly changes into a film with, matter of fact, unbelievable twists and action, not to mention the slick, hilarious, continuous sick stunts and jokes. The film was probably the most deserving of its award at the Oscars for best comedy or musical because with a movie like this, it can definitely go wrong, in a good way. One extra award should have been given out for Zach Galifianakis for his priceless role as Alan Garner (P.S I am definitely not exaggerating when I say that he should have won an Oscar. Damn you Oscars!!!!!) Todd Phillips is my new director to look at out for and he, obviously, has some great films under his title. Here I come Road Trip! A director like him is very rare nowadays because he is someone who never hides or thinks something is inappropriate for the eyes. He is one of a kind. His camera angles are impeccable. The acting cast did a brilliant job of making this riot come to life and the four main actors were perfect for their roles. I haven't seen much of Bradley Cooper on film, with the exception of He's Just Not That In To You (which he acted great in), but after watching him in The Hangover I have to say that this man has some great talent to show-off. He left a great impression on me and I have to get The a-Team just for him. Bradley Cooper is playing Phil Wenneck, a school teacher who has the ""same maturity level as his students when he is with his pals"", is one of the unlucky friend that goes to Vegas for the (worst) two days of his life. Ed Helms is, surprisingly, quite funny for a geeky dentist that can get pretty wild at parties, especially when he is drunk, and he looks tougher than he actually is. He is another unfortunate soul. Ed Helms has a great transformation from a dentist who is under the rule of his soon-to-be fiancée to a newly made man. In real life Ed Helms is quite cool and with playing a dentist with no balls, he is someone to look out for. Justin Bartha (National Treasure I and II) is Doug Billings, a soon-to-be husband who is ready for the time of his life, too bad he didn't see this whole thing coming. Justin Bartha has changed a lot from the last time we saw him in National Treasure. He still felt a little out of his place. The Main Star of the show is Zach Galifianakis who plays the hilarious Alan Garner, the brother in law of Doug Phillips, and who has an addiction for trusting druggies. The whole sh*toad of trouble starts when he puts Roofies into each glass of wine that he brought from a druggie who seemed trustworthy. He is the landmark of stupid/funny characters in films like these that the laughter flows out from. He is the fat part of this film and also the immaturity as well. I do not know how Zach made this guy come to life and how he gathered up all the energy? Anyways, Zach is a gifted actor that belongs into the Mensa of films. Well done! The rest of the cast is history......Since the plot is too complicated and funny to comprehend, I took the liberty of copying this straight from IMDb: Just two days before his marriage with Tracy Garner, Doug Billings, in the company of two friends: Phil Wenneck and Stu Price; and Tracy's eccentric brother, Alan, head out to party in Vegas. Driving his father's Mercedez, they rent a pricey villa at Caesar's and head for the rooftop to have a good time. Three of them later wake up with a hangover, unable to re-collect what exactly happened. With the villa in a wreck, turned upside down, they find that they have a baby in the closet, a grown tiger in the bathroom, Stu has a missing tooth and a hooker for a bride, and Doug is missing. Hilarious chaos results as the trio head out to re-trace their steps, find out that occurred in order to try and locate Doug, and bring him home in one piece before the wedding.The film has a cameo by Mike Tyson who is a fierce little fella and he lights the screen on fire once he makes an appearance. The punch must have hurt when Alan got it! The film has too many classic scenes and it would be very hard, if not impossible, to choose one but there are some scenes which stand out from the rest. The whole Alan making the baby look like it is jerking off is stuck in my mind for days and I laugh whenever it is thought off. I laugh in the classroom in sleep, even in the toilet. The Ending, which I won't certainly not spoil, is also very funny because it outlines the stupidity that the bunch had to go through after realizing......... (lets leave it at that.) The film amazes me when I think of the R18+ rating it got because the film had hardly any nudity to what you might expect but the foul language and the offensive acts fill that up in a flash.

Over hyped and over rated.,"After the reaction that this film created I thought that it was about time I watched it - two years after its release. The name of the film made me believe the humour would be entirely predictable and probably a bit too crude. I was expecting to see the best comedy of the past decade because of people's amazement when I could say 'I have never seen ""The Hangover' and I can now say that I don't regret my rather late viewing of the film.I was disappointed by the film's humour, there were too few 'laugh out loud' moments and I thought that because of this the film just seemed to drag on and on. I would not call it boring, but I would certainly call it mediocre.The acting was of a fairly decent quality, Bradley Cooper seems to have come out of nowhere, although I seem to be the only person who remembers him from ""Wedding Crashers"". I have never particularly liked him as an actor, partially because of his arrogant presence on the screen, and this, for me, it a problem in the film. I found the other two of the main characters to be fairly sound, and seeing Heather Graham was a breath of fresh air. It was nice to see her in a major(ish) film, her first since ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" over ten years ago.While the above is for the most part fairly negative, it was still a film that you could watch from start to finish while not feeling bored at its end. My particular part was a certain cameo appearance which was probably the highlight of the film, as this made the fairly crude humour to be more ridiculous and entertaining, which was definitely needed.All in all, ""The Hangover"" is worth a watch, but don't expect to see the best comedy of your life, because realistically it is not better than most of the other comedies coming out at the moment.",,Anonymous,Comedy

In the air tonight,"Comedies are so hard to review after many years have passed. As perhaps what was funny then seems cringey now. Nonetheless, the Hangover still in 2023 sustains the passage of time. There are certain jokes that are outdated for sure, but it still hits in several levels. I've never blacked out at all, so I can't relate to that, though the concept is really great.Aside from the outdated jokes, some of the characters are pretty stereotypical and somewhat predictable. And watching this time feels more on the side of Cooper and Helms that give accurate portraits of what really happened the day before. Galifinakis while his presence makes every scene a more silly vibe with how he dresses, his comments, etc can be expendable.The movie works from the plot only and not the intended comedy like the cops or anything Galifinakis does or Leslie Chow in certain parts.

Side Splittingly Funny,"""The Hangover"" (2009) is a professionally produced comedy about three friends, Phil played by Bradley Cooper, Stu played by Ed Helms, and Alan played by Zach Galifianakis, that wake up with no memories of a bachelor party the night before in Las Vegas. During their eventful enlightenment they search for their missing bachelor friend, Doug played by Justin Bartha, in order to get him safely back to his scheduled wedding. This film is hysterical in every right. It made my laugh from beginning to end with it's over the top antics and comical twists. It reminded me of similar life experience, though not as extreme, still very funny and nostalgia inducing. The writing and dialogue are both very well put together, though different backgrounds effect dialogue, but it's the story that is actually magical.Even though this film is a comedy and the acting is executed superbly in its extremeness, the story is about having your buddy's back. I sincerely enjoyed how the director, Todd Phillips, allowed the comedy to flow without abandoning the message. The whole film is about trying to figure out what happened the night before, but it is all in an effort to locate and save Doug. Through the comedy, the director still provides a sense of identifiability to the audience in caring for a friend. Overall, this is a top-notch comedy that I would recommend to everyone that has friends they would bend over backwards for.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

IM DYING,I REWATCHED THIS MOVIE AFTER YEARS AND ITS SO FUNNY IM CRYING BYE WATCH IT.,,Anonymous,Comedy
"Good plotting, but not as funny as the trailer.","I enjoyed this daft comedy well enough, but it isn't the funniest film to recently come out of Hollywood – in fact it would probably struggle to make it into the top three even though it serves up a regular supply of laughs. I suppose that's the trouble with funny trailers – they tend to be a double-edged sword because they draw the people into the cinema but fail to achieve the level of laughs suggested by the trailer that many might expect. The film follows the misadventures of a group of average guys on the stag night of one of them who goes missing following a night that none of them can remember. The guys wake up in their trashed penthouse villa with monster hangovers and discover a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in a cupboard.I liked the fact that the guys here weren't sex-crazy teens but thirty-somethings with the attendant baggage a few more years under the belt inevitably brings, even though it fails to sidestep some clichéd situations. The film goes out of its way to undermine preconceived notions: the funny cops are also sadistic and vindictive, the outwardly respectable girlfriend is a foul-mouthed harridan who cheats on her partner while the seasoned Vegas stripper/escort is a sweet girl, Mike 'ear-biter' Tyson (who I feel comfortable saying is looking decidedly porky these days, seeing as he is more than an ocean's distance away from me as I type this) is a good guy, the vicious villain is camp and weedy, and so on. It's no doubt a strategy to keep things fresh, and it works for the most part. The four friends make a likable bunch, even as they bicker and fight, and the mystery at the core of the film means that the pace only occasionally flags.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Hilariously Chaotic Adventure That Redefined the Comedy Genre,"""The Hangover,"" directed by Todd Phillips, is a wildly entertaining comedy that became an instant classic upon its release in 2009. The film offers a fresh and outrageous take on the bachelor party gone wrong trope, combining clever writing, strong performances, and unapologetic humor to create a memorable cinematic experience.The story revolves around four friends - Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis), and Doug (Justin Bartha) - who travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party, only to wake up the next morning with no memory of the previous night and the groom missing. What follows is a chaotic and hilarious journey to piece together the events of the night and find their friend before his wedding.Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis deliver standout performances, each bringing a unique comedic style to the film. Cooper's portrayal of the suave and somewhat irresponsible Phil contrasts brilliantly with Helms' portrayal of the uptight and anxious Stu. However, it is Galifianakis's breakout performance as the odd and unpredictable Alan that steals the show. His eccentric and offbeat humor brings a new level of comedy to the film.The screenplay by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore is sharp and witty. The film's humor is a blend of physical comedy, clever one-liners, and outrageous situations. The narrative structure, with the protagonists retracing their steps, keeps the audience engaged and guessing, making the unfolding of the night's events both surprising and enjoyable.""The Hangover"" is not just about the laughs; it also touches on themes of friendship and the responsibilities that come with adulthood, albeit in a very light-hearted and irreverent way. The chemistry among the lead actors is palpable, making their bond and misadventures feel both genuine and entertaining.Director Todd Phillips executes the film with a perfect sense of timing and pacing. The film never feels slow or dragged out, and each comedic set piece is more absurd than the last, keeping the audience thoroughly entertained. The use of Las Vegas as the backdrop adds to the film's wild and hedonistic atmosphere.The film's soundtrack, featuring a mix of contemporary and classic tracks, complements the film's tone and setting. The iconic scenes, such as Mike Tyson's cameo, are enhanced by the effective use of music.If there's any criticism to be levied at ""The Hangover,"" it would be that some of its humor relies on stereotypes and tropes that might not appeal to all audiences. However, these elements are in line with the film's overall irreverent and over-the-top style.In conclusion, ""The Hangover"" is a hilariously chaotic adventure that offers a unique and refreshing take on the comedy genre. With its strong performances, clever writing, and relentless humor, it earns a well-deserved 8 out of 10. The film not only provides non-stop laughs but also marked a significant moment in comedy, influencing numerous films that followed.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Nutshell Review: The Hangover,"I guess you'll probably know by now the yardstick I use for comedies, and that's if I don't laugh until my tears flow uncontrollably, then it's not 5-star funny. Granted that there wasn't any comedic situation here that had warranted my laughter from the belly and opened my tear ducts, it did have some classic moments that would bring out some genuine mirth, albeit sporadically, though the film managed to fuel itself up to last the 100 minute distance.Doug (Justin Bartha) is about to get married, and as a rite of passage, his best male pals in schoolteacher Phil (Bradley Cooper), dentist Stu (Ed Helms) and brother-in-law-to-be Alan (Zach Galifianakis) decide that they should have a no holds barred bachelor's party in sin city Las Vegas. After all, whatever happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. But who would've counted upon a rag-tag group to deliver him there and back safely and on time for his big day, since Phil's pretty much the frat boy leader of the group, just too eager to let his hair down, Stu's toeing the thin line of being the party-pooper, having to deal with an overbearing girlfriend, and Alan's just plain Rain Man dumb, which of course is perfect for some nonsensical one- liners and moments.After a wild night out which we don't get to see (and so to keep you guessing), Doug's found to be missing, and to add to that, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore's story sets everything up for the events soon to follow, planting elements such as those which you've seen in the trailer – a broken tooth, a baby, a tiger in the bathroom, a hotel suite totally trashed and a stolen police car. Every element links to something that happened in the last 12 hours, and it's up to the trio to establish the series of events from the clues presented, so as to find out where their groom could possibly be.It plays out like fusion of a comedy and a light hearted mystery, since none of them could even remotely remember what they did (and that too is not a stone left unturned). The fun factor came from how the trio of Cooper-Helms-Galifianakis share some incredible chemistry as boys who discover their hand firmly within the cookie jar, having to untie the knotty mess that they find themselves in. And to add to the delight, a lot of events happening in proper chronological order, have plenty of random bits to keep you tickled pink, before you realize that they all actually made sense, especially when you have enough clues to piece them all together. After this I'm on the lookout for future Galifianak projects as it seemed that he's now a contender up the Jack Black's niche alley.Director Todd Phillips had thrown in plenty of the staple profanity and token nudity commonly found in Hollywood mass comedies, and not forgetting racial stereotypes such as drug dealers and effeminate gangster chiefs all for the sake of eliciting some laughs. Something you can credit Phillips for though, is trying to sustain a comedy but unleashing the funny bits in a restrained manner so as to evenly spread out laughter, though the last 20 minutes to its inevitable finale did seem to fizzle out a little, until the end credits roll for that photo montage.The Hangover boasts a contemporary pop soundtrack, though the winner in the film is of course Las Vegas itself, with the film being quite a shrewd city promotional video, with its glitzy night time neon lights, and showcasing a host of activities one could get into, such as casinos that never sleep, and quickie-weddings in small specialized churches for that purpose. Having spent a week at the same city, it's a treat of course to revisit on screen some of the places I've previously set foot on, and if opportunities present themselves again, I'm pretty sure I'm going back.Comedy of the year this may not be in my books, but it does have enough to make it pretty delightful to sit through, especially if you're in the company of buddies who share the same traits as the characters, or sharing the same sense of humour.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Hangover: A Good Hair of the Dog,"If some good, clean fun is what you're after, The Hangover is not the film for you. The film will, however, deliver two out of three (minus ""clean"").Director Todd Phillips (Old School, Starsky & Hutch) offers as much raunch, wit and general shock value in his newest comedy as the typical laugh seeker could ask for, and though The Hangover doesn't quite reach the same level of true humor as Old School, it comes close.The film centers around the aftermath of a Vegas bachelor party, the events of which unfold as the celebrants – sans the missing groom to be – investigate their nocturnal circumstances in order to find their friend amidst the worst hangovers of their lives. What they find far surpasses the embarrassing photo or puke-stained clothes that usually accompany the day after woes of a night of bad decisions.Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms deliver solid comedic performances, but it's the uniquely odd yet amusing qualities of Zach Galifianakis' performance that transform the film into the laugh-out-loud movie it is. A supporting role of bubbly Heather Graham also brings the film some charm.Watch for appearances by Mike Tyson; Matt Walsh, Bryan Callen and Dan Finnerty (some of Phillips' staples); and Mr. Phillips himselfall of which add an extra ""hey!"" factor to the keen observer.The Hangover doesn't breach the cosmic levels of comedic genius we always hope for, but it makes for an amusing evening. Worth full price.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Probably the 3rd worse movie I've ever seen,Considering the hype and 4 star reviews I went to this movie hoping for something more then a remake of Swingers and more adult then the endless juvenile 'we're going to swear and talk about gay things to shock the audience' movies that seem to be prolific at the moment - I can honestly say I didn't smile once during the whole movie - and I loved Swingers! Getting embarrassed over a breast feeding Mother and an elderly patients butt - Oh please! Hollywood needs to grow up - they were making movies like this when I was in my teens (Porky's) - get your noses out of your school boy fantasies and try and make a decent movie next time will you?

A Comedy Classic,"The Hangover is a hilarious film with many memorable moments and great characters. One of the best is Alan, played by Zach Galifianakis. His unique sense of humor and unpredictable behavior make him a standout among the cast. Whether he's getting into mischief or delivering one-liners, Alan is a true comic genius.But Alan isn't the only thing that makes The Hangover special. The movie's clever writing and clever use of nonlinear storytelling set it apart from other comedies. It's a film that will have you laughing from start to finish, and one that you'll want to watch over and over again. So if you're a fan of comedy, be sure to check out The Hangover.

This is a comedic genre masterpiece. I wouldn't change one thing about this picture,"The Hangover (2009) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows a bachelor party in Las Vegas with a group of friends and an eccentric brother in-law. The night kicks off with a toast and next thing they know they wake up in a trashed hotel room with a Tiger, a baby and no groom. We follow the bachelor party retracing their footsteps from the night before as they try to figure out what happened and where the groom is...This movie is directed by Todd Phillips (Joker) and stars Zach Galifianakis (Due Date), Bradley Cooper (A Star is Born), Ed Helms (The Office), Justin Bartha (National Treasure), Jeffrey Tambor (How the Grinch Stole Christmas) and Heather Graham (Boogie Night).The writing and execution of this movie is out of this world good. The soundtrack is impressive and the circumstances are creative and clever. The dialogue and comedic content have you cracking up no matter how many times you've seen this. There's also some fun cameos like Mike Tyson, Wayne Newton, Mike Epps and Carrot Top. Ken Jeong (Crazy Rich Asians) scene jumping out of the trunk belongs in the comedic Hall of Fame. Even the photographs during the closing credits is smart and unique.Overall, this is a comedic genre masterpiece. I wouldn't change one thing about this picture. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
one of my favourite comedies,"I found this film very funny and in 2009 it was very different to any film i had seen in a while. I found myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes, so im glad i watched it at a mates house ha!! I still remember some of the famous quotes from the original film ""so long g## boys"" ""hey!! she is a nice lady!!"" ""you gonna f###on me?"" However, when something is good they tend to ruin it by making too much of a good thing to make money. I found the second one funny, but it didnt suprise me as much as the first one because they used the same scenario, having a such a hang over that you dont remember anything, and haveing a person missing that you have to find. The thrird one was funny but you could kind of tell that it was purely a film that had be created to make money rather than an originall film for veiwers enjoyment.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

One of THE Funniest  Movies Ever  - Epic!!,"This movie was absolutely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I laughed so hard I almost choked and died; and it would have been a good way to go.This movie is EPIC, like up there with Spinal Tap. I kept laughing for days. The only way I can think to describe it: If Pulp Fiction had a baby with the Wedding Crashers and gave it up for adoption to the Three Stooges. The movie has that weird, skewed-world feeling to it. The language is outrageous - there's not a ton of violence, but what's there is like, ""omg!"" Things don't quite make sense. You have to just roll with it and embrace the randomness - but it's easy to do that because the wackiness is pee-your-pants hysterical. The characters are utterly irreverent and so likable.

The funniest movie of the year!,"I just got back from viewing The Hangover, a movie I had never heard of until yesterday when I saw a commerical on television and several positive reviews. I'm really glad I saw this because I had so much fun.Of all the actors in the movie, they were all exceptional but the one that really stood out and stole the show was definitely Zach Galifanakis. Somehow I had not been familiar with his standup routine but in this movie he was hilarious. It's a heavily quotable movie and 95% of the quotes that are going to be repeated would be things that he said. All four (or 3) of them worked together with so much chemistry, actually having me believe at times that I'm watching real friends.The plot was totally absurd, but that was sort of the point. The audience is in on the joke that we don't even know what they possibly could have done last night and it's a great mystery to unravel every tiny detail of it and laugh because it's exceptionally bizarre.The only complaint I could have was that it started off a little slow, like maybe the first 25 minutes until they wake up with The Hangover. After that point, the laughs keep coming but the first quarter may persuade people to walk straight out of the theater.This is without a doubt the funniest movie of the year and destined to become a classic. What could beat it? Year One? The Proposal? Nah. Maybe Funny People.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good comedy with a hint of mystery,"This film was a comedy set apart from the rest of the genre. What sets this comedy apart from others is a well structured script and a pace that doesn't allow any form of thinking. The chemistry between the four leads is also a plus. The jokes and actions will leave the audience rolling in laughter, sometimes making you feel bad for laughing.
The cinematography doesn't stand out, but it doesn't need to in this comedy. The actors did an amazing job with their roles. The chemistry between them makes the friendship feel genuine. The music choices fit the theme of Las Vegas escapades well. The plot was interesting and made the movie feel like a comedic mystery movie. It kept the audience guessing as to what would happen next and the comedy helped propel the story to its end. The Hangover is a great comedy that hits almost all its jokes and doesn't feel stale after watching it more than once.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Fantastic Comedy,"The whole Hangover trilogy recently hit Netflix so I have decided to go back and watch the first film The Hangover and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees 3 guys wake up from a Bachelor party not remembering a thing and with the Bachelor missing. They must go through Las Vegas and find out what happened in order to find him before the wedding.Main Character
For me this was the film where Bradley Cooper really stood out, and he is really good here. He is just so charismatic in his role and lets face it he is the guy that we all want to be in this film, and he really shows his superstar talent. He is really funny here and I thought he was just a funny character in a funny film.Supporting Characters
Ed Helms possibly does some of his best work here, he has a very obvious character arc here and really the only person with one but it works well. He bounces off of the other two guys really well and it raises him up to a really fun performance. Zach Galifianakis plays the third member of the crew and he is the shock humour character and he does it really well, some of things he says are so outrageous annd hilarious. The crew work extremely well together and their chemistry is what really drives the film and rises it above your average comedy. The rest of the cast fill their roles well with Ken Joeng having a particularly funny role. Plus this film has one of the best celebrity cameos I have seen in a film in recent times.Story
The story is really simple it is crazy nobody thought of it before, it keeps you invested as you really want to find out exactly what happened to these guys on this night out. Things get crazier and crazier and you are just entranced by how mental things get, plus you want to find out where the bachelor actually ended up. This film succeeds by not giving the audience much if any information and having them react with the characters.Script
The script has some hilarious dialogue in it, honestly it is a really funny film and if you are up for a straight up comedy then this is one to watch with clever writing and great ad-libbing. But for me a comedy needs to have some dramatic moments in it, especially for character progression. However, this film doesn't really have any of these moments which lead this to be the weakest element of the film.Style
The style of the film really focuses on the raunchy side of comedy and for this film it really works. As the film gets more shocking, the style gets more shocking leading to crazy moments. Also the pacing is excellent here, it doesn't take any time getting going and pretty much never stops moving which is great for a comedy.Overall
Overall, this is a truly fantastic comedy, one that is raunchy but one that if you are a fan of comedies is a must watch and one that should be kept in a collection.Rating - 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Definitely over-hyped,"It's hard for me to believe that this movie has a rating of 8 stars, while I feel that I'm being extremely generous giving it 6 stars. It kind of reminds me of when I saw Slumdog Millionaire last year which was also a movie that was over-hyped until it actually won the best picture award. That was a complete travesty. This movie, though not nearly as bad as Slumdog, certainly doesn't deserve the praise that I've been hearing.It won the Golden Globe award a few nights ago for ""Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy"". Now that I've seen it, that is so hard to believe. The only other movie that was nominated in that category that I have watched so far was ""Julie & Julia"", which I thought was a better movie. I'm sure that after I see the other movies nominated in that category, there will probably be a couple more that I would rate higher than ""The Hangover"". I can't say that positively, but I feel pretty certain that will be the case.This movie, like Slumdog will be forgotten in a few years by most, but will still unfortunately be in the record books. And all the 10 star ratings? I think a lot of people saw this movie drunk because they felt that it was the appropriate thing to do!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Unoriginal and cheap,"When the sum of a film's entertaining parts fit into its widely distributed trailer, you know something is wrong. The humor it devised itself is absurdly sophomoric, and while that can put a smirk on your face as you reminisce on your college binge-drinking years, it just doesn't justify an entire film. The rest of the humor, which is presented awfully, just isn't original. The cast is simply bad. Racial stereotypes are always a winner in movies, and this one just proves it. Why are we so keen to praise such a film? We'll only get more crap like this if we incessantly tell Hollywood it has us rolling on the floor.

great comedy,"The Hangover is one of the best comedies I've ever seen. This film mixes fun, adventure, friendship and many other topics in an exceptional way. The characters are perfect, I loved everyone for their character and also for the splendid performances of the actors. The best character is Alan, one of the characters I love most in the history of cinema. I also loved Phil, Stuart and Doug, each character has a completely different character from the other and this does what some incredibly weird and funny fights do during the movie. Zach Galifianakis, Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms were incredible and the others did a great job. The plot is compelling and interesting with a defined purpose. I loved the fact that I didn't immediately understand the reality of the facts but discovered some clues about the stag night. I also really liked the action component with so many crazy scenes as if it were an action movie but immediately after it snapped a laugh. I also really liked the presence of Ken Jeong, he made me laugh a lot. Even the special effects are of good level especially for the fact that this film I do not think certainly aimed to have a high quality technical sector but only the beauty of laughter and fun. The music are incredible and perfectly matched with the setting of Las Vegas, which is also great for the film. The ending of the film convinced me a lot and I think that when I need to relax and have a few laughs in a difficult moment, well, I will definitely watch this movie. A masterpiece of its kind..

My Favorite Movie of the Summer,"The Hangover is summer's best film! I won't go into details about the funny parts because if you are one of the few people who still haven't seen it, words just won't do this film justice. I will, however, give kudos to those involved in making this movie.Primarily, the film works as a result of a brilliant narrative device: we are just as clueless as the characters are about what happened the night before. As the film progresses, we are given one shocking revelation after another, each building to high comedy. The momentum is almost non-stop!A lot of the humor is also generated from the corky characters and how they react to each shocking development. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis all turn in brilliant performances and stay in character rather than just acting goofy. The fact that they all seem so believable makes the chaos that they face all the more hysterical.Laughter is valuable to your health and it is hard to produce an effective comedy these days.

And thanks to him i watched this and if i miss this, i think it is a real miss in the point of view of a comedy movie.Most interesting part is tiger scene in Mike Tyson's house. I would say this is the best ever comedy movie i have ever watched. It is a real comedy movie with a nice story. The only part they missed is they have forgotten to solve how the chicken came to hotel room. And also this movie is strengthen by without much involvement of actress's acting.Zach Galifianakis, super acting. I haven't seen him any other movies earlier. And also Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms, superb acting. Love to watch this again and again.Waiting to watch part 2.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Chick flick meets Jackass,"This is the funniest film I have ever seen genuinely, I cannot remember laughing so so much while watching a movie. OK most comedies advertise themselves as the funniest film ever but this can definitely take that title, I don't really go to the cinema very often because no movies have really taken my fancy that much and I also have a busy family life so I entered the theater expecting a few funny moments in the movie but once they started coming they didn't stop. I also didn't know who any of the actors were, a couple of them I recognized but in general didn't ""know"" them, OK the film would suit anyone with a sense of humor but would bring out the sense of humor in someone who does not normally show it I will be buying this on DVD as soon as it is out got to be seen to be believed.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Brilliant mixture of believability and heart,"Three close friends and the groom's strange brother-in-law travel to Vegas for a bachelor party they will never forget. Teacher Phil (Bradley Cooper) is a womaniser with a wife and kids, Stu (Ed Helms) is in an unhappy marriage with an overbearing, abusive wife, Doug (Justin Bartha) is the groom hoping for a send-off to end all send-off's, and Alan (Zach Galifianakis), is a naive man-child hoping to make friends. When they wake up in the morning, they find their suite demolished, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet, and most worryingly of all, Doug is missing. They clean themselves up and set out to find Doug, and using the various clues lying around, they begin to piece together the night.Of course, bachelor party movies are hardly hard to come by, and they have been a staple of the gross-out comedy circuit since the 1980's. The Hangover finds its originality in the fact that it focuses on the morning after, rather than the actual night itself, which we see none of. It also has a sense of believability, as if three of the characters have genuinely been friends for years, and are gradually accepting the increasingly strange Alan into their wolf-pack. After all, Alan is often unnervingly strange, but the group find him funny too, and why wouldn't they? Cult stand-up comedian Galifianakis has been around for years, starring in various failed pilots and never quite getting the attention he deserved, but he is by far the best thing in The Hangover, with the mixture of his quite sweet innocence and his random one-liners fitting in with the film's heartfelt moments.It also keeps the gross humour thankfully down to a minimum. Sure it's often bad taste, but there's a noticeable lack of bare-breasted women and any jokes involving bodily fluids. This is still R-rated, but the humour is in the script and the performances, and doesn't resort to someone shitting themselves for desperate laughs. It's similar in many ways to 2007's Superbad, where the language was filthy, but the laughs were genuine, and the situations, however absurd, still felt somewhat real. And when the credits rolled, I was left with that unfamiliar desire to spend more time with these characters. Special mention must also go to Chinese gangster Mr. Chow (played by Ken Jeong, who simply needs to be in more films), who has one of the best comedy burn lines in history, ""so long, gay boys!"".www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A one - note comedy... a flawless one.,"Where to begin? Guess I could start with the evolution of raunchy, R - rated yet smart high-concept comedies where three - dimensional key characters must deal with over - blown situations and charicatured characters in modern - day America, learning lessons in life in the end. These include such modern classics as American Pie, There's something about Mary and about a dozen examples by Judd Apatow and co. in the last five years. However, this would be just tooting my own horn, and since most of you have seen those movies, who gives a rat's a$$?So, here we have the latest inclusion: a comedy about three guys waking up in a terrible hangover in Vegas, only to realize they have lost the groom along with their memory in a barchelor party gone way out of the map, and that they have only about 48 hours to find him and get to the wedding. Directed by Todd Phillips, who also gave us ""Road trip"" (and which I've always considered superior to ""American pie"" for the sake that ""RT"" is just more laid-back).Unlike for example most of Apatow's comedies, ""The Hangover"" is not ""smarter"" than what the premise lets you in on. You can't break it down to analyze it, because it's just what the one - line description says. I guess the film-makers considered two choices: re-write it and force it into the successful ""Apatow"" mold, or play it out like it is: like an ""eighties"" comedy. They did the latter, and with that, the right choice.The Hangover's biggest assets are that it's been crafted to the hilt on all distinctive areas: - The characters. When you meet them at first, you go like ""ok, so they are not clear caricatures, but how could these guys ever be friends?"". But, along the movie, you grow into accepting them, with their pros and cons. You get to recognize their roles and how they ""complete a full circle"" without it being too obvious from the get-go. Huge plus.The dialogue. Well, the usual Kevin Smith/Judd Apatow - stuff. Kind of like ""Friends"" but with F - words and pop culture references. Good stuff, though.Plot. The whole thing plays out like a good mystery and gives a 100 minutes of laughs without missing one beat, losing pace or losing focus (basically this is what ""Dude, where's my car"", SHOULD have been). Let's just repeat the thing that really struck me in ""The Hangover"": there are no lulls. This, I consider a defining strength: when one clue has been solved, it moves straight into the next one. The ""ok...what now?"" - bits have been surgically removed. Also, you will NOT check your watch when the film moves from the second act to the third. Now THIS is rare.Gotta hand it also to Phillips (whose best movie so far) and to the cast - along with castING. Bold having this many new names in key roles.8 out of 10 stars. Hope they won't ruin this with the already green-lit sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Quite possibly the funniest film ever!,"Before ""The Hangover"" was released it was the talk of the town. Even its previews were funny. I mean, although most comedy film's previews are funnyor are at least supposed to be funny. This was more than I expected. Talk about ""LOL."" The Hangover was more than ""Laugh Out Loud"" funny.Even Mike Tyson, The Champ, surprised me with a little laughter in his tiger scene.The plot of this film held my attention by making me want to see what else happened ""last night?""This comedic trio of Bradley Cooper as Phil Wennick, Ed Helms as Stu Price, and Zach Galifianakis as Alan Garner, tickled my funny bone with their hilarious endeavors. Not only is ""The Hangover"" a knee slapper and a belly cruncher, it could actually be a ""Based on a true story"" film.

The best comedy of the year,"Usually when people talk about hangovers they usually meant about the day after drinking a lot. In this case The Hangover is the most ingenious comedy I've seen in the year. Directed by Todd Phillips, The Hangover contains all kind of comedy and humor existed in this world. It is an hour and a half full of laughs. It is cleverly written, Two days before his wedding, Doug and his three friends drive to Las Vegas for a blow-out bachelor party they'll never forget. The movie follows a fast paced rhythm, a very nice thin for the viewer because you never get tired or bored. It also has some great locations in Las Vegas, in fact you can see two different faces of Vegas, one at night so glamorous and shiny and the other in the desert with amazing landscapes. Another thing you appreciate from the movie is its wonderful soundtrack, the music is so good and every song in it fits to the perfection with every scene in the film. The cast is excellent every actor and actress delivers an excellent and convincing performance specially Zach Galifianakis as Alan, he was so funny and the special appearance from Mike Tyson was great. The Hangover only purpose is to entertain people and I'm sure people will enjoy every minute of it. In conclusion, it is the best comedy of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Where Most Comedies Fail, The Hangover Succeeds.","Freshly envisioned, skilfully directed & brilliantly performed, The Hangover is a roller-coaster ride of quality entertainment that simply ranks amongst the finest comedies to come out in the past decade for the film is full of hilarious moments, crazy characters & an engaging storyline that never goes dull for a moment.The Hangover tells the story of 4 friends who travel to Las Vegas to celebrate the bachelor party of one of their own only to wake up the next day with no memory of what happened the previous night & discover that the bachelor himself is missing. The plot follows their search as they try to find him before his impending marriage.Directed by Todd Phillips, The Hangover brims with freshness that's not easily found in the genre of comedy today and is crafted with deft elegance. Phillips' direction does complete justice to its quality screenplay & balances all aspects of storytelling from start to finish for there are enough genuinely funny moments that never feel forced & characters are finely refined as well.The Hangover also benefits from its dynamic camera-work & effective use of warm colour palette that captures Las Vegas in all its glory. Editing is one of its finest aspects for the story is briskly paced, trims out the unnecessary moments & keeps the entertainment going throughout its 100 minutes of runtime, and the soundtrack incorporates songs that simply fit its narrative.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms & Justin Bartha in the role of four friends, and all of them chip in with breakthrough performances with Zach being the highlight. However, what makes this film amazing isn't its characters but the interplay between them, and the chemistry between these actors goes a long way in making that part work in the film's favour.On an overall scale, The Hangover is a highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & endlessly fun cinema that's polished in all aspects of filmmaking, manages to retain its quality all the way & is a welcome addition to the genre of R-rated comedy. It's not without its shortcomings but the positives far outweighs the negatives while the charm of its cast brushes away the other complaints. And where most comedies fail, The Hangover simply succeeds.",,Anonymous,Comedy
not as good as people say but it has its moments,"i cant be 100 percent sure why people think this movies is that good i mean it has funny parts definitely, but as a whole i didn't think it was that funny. other then Zach Galifianakis i didn't really find any one to be hilarious i rather hated the character of stu price played by ed helms finding him to lack in the humor department and he became quite annoying after sometime. Don't get me wrong this movie is funny especially the first time but upon multiple viewings it seemed to lose its touch where as some other movies that i have watched numerous times such as anchorman, step brothers, billy madison and hot rod just to name a few, have continued to make me laugh every time i watched them. in conclusion this movie is watchable, is funny and is entertaining but its just not as good as people have said it to be i rate it a 6. All i have to say is kudos to Zach Galifianakis for being hilarious and thank you to the people who made this for putting him in it cuz without him the story line is kinda boring.p.s. thank god that the character of doug disappears in this film Because He Is A Horrible Actor. thank you and good night",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Hangover,"The Hangover is a movie about some guys (Stu, Doug, Alan, Phil) who go to Vegas for a bachelor party. The bachelor party is for Doug and it is just a few days before the wedding is supposed to happen. While in Vegas the group ends up losing Doug and the whole movie is their journey to find him. They try to back track (from what they can remember) and find him.There were a few reasons why this movie was so great. For one, the cast couldn't have been much better than what it was. Zach Galifianakis is one of the funniest people in Hollywood today. Also, it's a really catchy movie and is very easy to quote without even realizing it such as ""Driving drunk... Classic!"" Another reason I loved this movie so much is because it was appealing to people MY age (college student) and even people much older than me.I do not have very many complaints about this movie. There were a couple parts that I thought were a little slower than the rest. For instance, when they are in the desert at the end with the Asian (for those who have seen it know what I'm talking about and for those who haven't will know after you see it). Another bad part was Tyson's acting. I understand he's a boxer and not an actor but it could've been someone else famous who knew how to act a little better.Overall, I was very pleased with the movie and I am now a proud owner of the DVD. It will always be a classic to me as my DVD collection grows.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good But not great; worth Watching.,"The Hangover follows three amnesiac groomsman the day after a bachelor party as they track down the origins of a series of clues that they hope lead them to the lost groom, Doug (Justin Bartha). The main attraction for this movie was Mike Tyson's cameo role and i didn't expect much from this movie; Zach Galifianakis character (Alan Garner) was the best part of the film for me. overall i feel this is a furiously paced and inventive take on a tried-and-tested formula. An exemplary bromantic comedy that doesn't sacrifice heart in pursuit of laughs. This movie is not an all time great comedy, However if you have spare time you should check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What a great hangover!,"Todd Phillips, who has been a director who really misses his mark (with the exception of Old School) has landed his footing among comedic filmmakers. The Hangover is my favorite comedy of the year so far and is sure to become a cult classic among college students and young people.The film tells the story of Doug (Justin Bartha), a middle aged man who goes on a bachelor night with his best friends, Stu (Ed Helms, ""Andy"" from 'The Office'), Phil (Bradley Cooper), and his fiancée's strange brother Alan (breakthrough performer Zach Galifianakis). After a night of heavy drinking and waking up to a missing Doug, the three amigos venture out to find clues to their missing comrade.The comedy here is incredible with the raunchy humor that hits and sticks every time. The script keeps a great pace and keeps you laughing the whole time. Helms and Galifianakis hit hugely in this film and steal the show every time. The Hangover never loses sight of its objective and remembers its target audience. Through the laughs we are immensely stuck on these four guys and their quest to find fallen mate. There's actually a wonderful love story wrapped up in all laughs and a wonderful lesson to be learned....don't drink jagermeister!****/****",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

HK Neo Reviews: The Hangover,"Tagline: Most probably the funniest movie of the yearReview by Neo: It's been a long time coming, since I have encountered a genuine comedy that actually makes you laugh out loud at the cinemas. It is also been a while, since I can recall a Hollywood movie that actually got me laughing from start to finish. Nice shock and an excitement movie to finish off a hangover weekend on a Sunday Night. The trio (or foursome if you must include the one on the roof for the majority of the flick) performs in an almost faultless manner. All the more, the three cannot be more different, one is with serial player looks, one is just a dentist and the other is a brother in law who is just plain fat. So much so that the movie didn't seem like a movie, as the characters are simple and easy to relate to, as the audience goes along the ride with them, rather than simply sit and watch.The movie goes like this: 4 guys go on a bachelor party two days just before the wedding. Basically the destination is Las Vegas and before you know it, they are on a rooftop not knowing that the drink they are about to cheers is actually drugged. And so, they woke up in the villa of Caesar hotel, with the following items, a baby in the wardrobe, a tiger in the toilet (yes, literally), a stripper as a wife and the most of all, they lost the groom. So begins the journey of the three who are totally wasted and do not remember a thing, as they stumble here and there to the line of finding a friend.Usually flicks like these ones, the best jokes are already in the trailer, but somehow, Hangover, does not contain just a couple of laughs, but rather enough laughs to make your stomach burst. The fat guy (played by (Zach Galifianakis) is just so down to earth that it is funny and one of the best lines is certain the Caesar one. Basically he asks ""so have Caesar actually lived in this palace?"" Sure, it is a damn stupid question, but the audience can so feel that he is serious about it, that make it more funny than it should be. The guy with player looks (played by the guy Bradley Cooper, who got Scarlett Johansson on her knees in He is Just Not That in You) is cool and the way he interacts with others is just seamlessly fun to watch. Likewise, the film cannot be complete without the dentist (Ed Helms). The moment his tooth came out and married a stripper, he is just a stand down funny guy to endure.You must praise the director (Todd Phillips) for the perfect comic timing; a film like this can so easily go the wrong track and go the route down the path of films like Hot Chick, but luckily the fun is more on the scale of American Pie or Kumar Castle flick. His focus on the characters and allows them to act and interact and play off each other as though they are really friends is really a joy to watch. Another examples, is the enjoyable cameo appearance by Heather Graham, who plays the stripper who married the dentist. Her line: ""That is so Doug!"" works even though she only just met them the night before. Now that's a sign of cinema magic.All in all, Hangover is a joy to watch, a rare piece of cinematic gem, adding to the mixture of brilliant chemistry between the co-stars, the liveliness of nightlife in Vegas and evolution of down to earth comedy. It is a shame that not everyone will relates to the characters, but somehow, I got a feeling that most of good mates and I included embracing it. Coming off a trip from the wine district of Hunter Valley where me and my mates, tasted almost all the wines within the 9 wineries along the way. Hangover is really and is most probably the best comedy of 2009 and if you go in the cinemas with a relaxed mindset, I am sure that it will make you smile a little, laugh a little and enjoy life a little more  (Neo 2009)I rate it 9/10www.thehkneo.com",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Laugh Till you can't breath Funny,"I've seen The Hangover twice, within a week, which is a first to me especially with high ticket prices these days. It is absolutely the funniest movie of the year and the only competition may come from its sequel only. On both occasions that I've seen this, the whole audience was LOLing for the majority of the film. I literally cried laughing at the end of the film and most people did as well. What made this film so enjoyable and hilarious? For me, it was the chemistry of the actors, real life scenarios and troubles encountered with booze and drugs, and the thought of good friends partying in fabulous Las Vegas.

Hung Over,"Waking up in their Vegas hotel room with a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the cupboard and no memory of the events of the night before, three men desperately try to piece together the events of the previous evening in order to locate a friend who has gone missing in this Golden Globe winning comedy. Given the importance of wild, drunken shenanigans to the plot, one might expect 'The Hangover' to be a juvenile comedy full of laughs of the gross-out variety, however, while there is some over-the-top vomiting and toilet humour, the vast majority of gags in the film are surprisingly well scripted. The screenplay is in fact quite clever and innovative with many mysteries beyond just the baby, tiger and missing friend - most of which only gradually begin to surface as the friends delve deeper and deeper into the events of the night before. The shot of the friends by the side of the road before the film begins to flash back is thoughtfully done too to disguise one of the main twists towards the end. Not all the gags work, with several telegraphed too far in advance (Bradley Cooper mentioning that only the interior of the car is damaged) and some of the characters are a little grating, but the film is more amusing than most R-rated movies out there. A photo montage during the end credits additionally provides a pitch perfect note for the film to conclude on.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hang with this one! A gagfest!,"Unrememberable, that is what Hangovers are; Unrememberable, through beers and bars. My apologies to Nat King Cole! We have all had them, we can't stand them, but is a part of ""paying the piper"" for the few vivacious hours of liquid festive madness from the previous night! Hangovers!!! I think Hollywood was overdue in providing us a comedic film about them! Maybe they got hung up with the premise! But finally they gave it to us and they did not barf it up with the winning comedy ""The Hangover"". Let me throw you up the plot of this gem: Three groomsmen and their about-to-be-wed buddy go to Las Vegas for a stirring bachelor party. Phil is the cocky ringleader of this Vegasfest and also the best friend of the groomie Doug. Stu is the neurotic Dentist buddy who gives his possessive girlfriend muela by lying about where the boys are going for the bachelor festivities. Alan is Doug's soon-to-be brother-in-law who's probably gone over the hangover threshold zillions of times in his life thereby explaining his outlandish behavior. So these fearsome foursomes drink it up in Sin City and before you know it- Hangover Helper gets a service call! They wake up the morning after with chaos colliding in their not-so-little Caesars Palace suite- A tiger in the bathroom, a stolen police car, a baby in the closet, a hanging mattress, a broken tooth, and a missing Doug. Obviously, their alcohol-induced memory banks are at zilch so it is oblivious to Phil, Stu, and Alan how this happened. So consequently, they need to retrace last night's itinerary of events to find the lost Doug. I will not seltzer you up (whatever that means) with more details, so you just gotta hang on tight & witness this zany mayhem that is ""The Hangover"". Director Todd Phillips does phil up this comedic adventure Vegas ride with side-splitting, off-beat material that makes you crave for a longer Hangover running time! Bradley Cooper as Phil had the adequate charismatic pizazz in portraying him. Zach Galifianakis was very Belushish as the deranged Alan. Justin Bartha as Doug was not a barfa of laughs in his supporting role, but walked this acting aisle admirably. But my favorite thespian performance here was that of Ed Helms as Stu; Helms stewed it up just right with a perfect blend of comedic acting ingredients. So the remedy for your cinematic blues is to catch ""The Hangover"" before it gets out of your must-see system. ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This is so damn funny!,"The Hangover directed by Todd Philips is one of the best comedy movies I have ever witnessed.The movie right from its start till it ends is like a laughing gas which never stops.Story: Angelenos Doug Billings (Justin Bartha) and Tracy Garner (Sasha Barrese) are about to get married. Two days before the wedding, the four men in the wedding party - Doug, Doug's two best buddies Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper) and Stu Price (Ed Helms), and Tracy's brother Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis) - hop into Tracy's father's beloved Mercedes convertible for a 24-hour stag party to Las Vegas. Phil, a married high school teacher, has the same maturity level as his students when he's with his pals. Stu, a dentist, is worried about everything, especially what his controlling girlfriend Melissa (Rachael Harris) thinks. Because she disapproves of traditional male bonding rituals, Stu has to lie to her about the stag, he telling her that they are going on a wine tasting tour in the Napa Valley. Regardless, he intends on eventually marrying her, against the advice and wishes of his friends. And Alan seems to be unaware of what are considered the social graces of the western world. The morning after their arrival in Las Vegas, they awaken in their hotel suite each with the worst hangover. None remembers what happened in the past twelve or so hours. The suite is in shambles. And certain things are in the suite that shouldn't be, and certain things that should be in the suite are missing. Probably the most important in the latter category is Doug. As Phil, Stu and Alan try to find Doug using only what little pieces of information they have at hand, they go on a journey of discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what happened to the missing items. However they are on a race for time as if they can't find Doug in the next few hours, they are going to have to explain to Tracy why they are not yet back in Los Angeles. And even worse, they may not find Doug at all before the wedding.There's even another character named Chow who comes toward the end of the movie.The reason why I mentioned the character is because he is one actor for whom Hangover must be watched!He is so damn funny! The direction is marvelous.The dialogs are the icing of the cake.Special mention of those delivered by Chow in the end or even delivered by Zach Galifianakis at several scenes.Performances: Hangover also works because of some superb performances delivered by its cast.Special mention of Zach Galifianakis who just simply stands out with his amazing comic timing.Bradely Cooper is very good.While Ed Helms is funny.Heather Graham,Sasha Barrese,Jeffrey Tambor and Rachael Harris are fine. Ken Jeong as Chow is truly a scene-stealer.Rob Riggle and Cleo King as the cops are hilarious.Mike Tyson in a cameo is awesome.All in all,Hangover is an excellent comedy movie.I am giving it a nine on ten.Go,have a laugh!",,Anonymous,Comedy
It was decent but not GREAT,"I wouldn't say I outright hated it,but I don't think it deserves the hype it has gotten, but it has its moments.The Hangover, the newest feature comedy from Todd Phillips has hit the scene. Although I am a year behind in getting to this my super busy schedule has kept me from seeing films as much as I would like.I thought the film had some good moments, and some fun moments, but there wasn't any GREAT moments, not at least until the end credits rolled, and I don't mean that as a snide against the film in that the end credits rolling is the best thing, but it is because of what is contained within the end credits. Those moments are what i felt should have occurred.I will say Bradley Cooper was aptly cast and did an excellent job, in fact the 3 leads were mixed appropriately, I just think they needed a bit stronger mass of material.I hope what occurs in the credits is what makes up the Sequel when it films, but as of right now I would merely suggest it if you have nothing better to watch that night.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Can be utterly brilliant and painful to watch!,"Can you say painful? I watched video a while back, but my wife and I decided last night we should watch it again. I don't necessarily want to spoil this movie for those who have not watched this, but I'll give you the jist. Four guys played by Zach Galifianakis (Alan), Bradley Cooper (Phil), Justin Bartha (Doug), and Ed Helms (Stu), all go on a trip to Las Vegas for a bachelor party. The groom after a while night of who knows what happened, goes missing and now they have to back track what happened. One of these guys, I won't say names, but thought it was a good idea to put drugs in everyone's drinks which explains why they can't remember what happened. Throughout this hilarious film you will see some well known comedians and actors like Jeffrey Tambor, Rachael Harris, and Ken Jeong. It's painful to watch because throughout the movie they do some.....let's say, not so rewarding ideas. You will see, til then, enjoy and thanks for reading #schroyerfamilydaily.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sure To Become A Cult Classic,"""You mind putting on some pants? I feel weird having to ask you twice.""It has become so rare in this century, to find a genuinely decent and funny comedy. In the crowd of Scary Movie type comedies, Todd Phillips' fresh and hilarious The Hangover stands out as a clear winner for modern comedy.The plot is simple: four friends travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party and wake up the next morning with no memory of what happened the previous night, this plus the fact that they don't know where the groom is makes for a roller-coaster ride of hilarity as the remaining three friends try to find him in time for his wedding the next day.In short, The Hangover is just genuinely funny. It may actually be the funniest movie I've had the pleasure of watching in a long time, so much so that it has become one of my favourite movies. Galifianakis, the ""child with a beard"", effectively makes this movie the brilliantly hilarious trip that it is. His unashamedly idiotic behaviour provides much of the hilarity and it seems as if the movie would be pretty empty without him. But all three leading men have brilliant chemistry together and it's hard to imagine anyone else playing a different role in this movie.The Hangover is sure to become a cult classic and I don't see it ever getting old. I also really never thought I'd be feeling sorry for Heather Graham's character at the end. So far I've seen this five times and I'll probably watch it a hundred times more. A definite must buy!http://ukmore.tk/",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Didn't laugh once. Overrated.,"So, I've heard many good things about this film. I was told that it would be one of the funniest films that I've ever seen, I've heard people say that it's outstanding, and some people have said that it's the best comedy of the past decade. So, I thought, I should watch it to see how good it is. I don't really regret watching it, but to be honest, that was long droning monotony. I enjoyed the storyline and some bits were quite amusing, but I merely grinned at it. How this gets 7.8, I'll never know, because the point of a comedy film is to make me laugh, but really the only thing that was keeping me watching was the fact that the storyline wasn't actually too bad. Hence, I gave it a five. This might be the definition of an average film. Massively overrated.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Adult fun,"A refreshing change in the story line and a slick cast of characters makes The Hangover a must-see movie. The adult fun bordering on the likes of Borat makes the movie kind of more a guy movie than a chic movie. Not that chicks can't dig it, but it does have some over the top scenes which may cause severe embarrassment for some. The dialogs were quite catchy, the acting I thought was quite quite well, and Galifianakis, someone I never knew before this movie came into being, is certainly a treat to watch. I would rate it to be less funny than Superbad but somewhat in par with Wedding Crashers. Whatever the case a movie you will want to see again. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest film of the 21st century so far!,"I've paid to see ""The Hangover"" 13 times (my personal record for one title), so until a funnier flick comes along, it's my gold standard for what a modern comedy should be. A lot of folks would call this funny, but not the funniest. I can understand that perspective. And a lot of people who weren't laughing at all were attending weekend screenings I was at. I can only tell those who didn't bust a gut at this Vegas is hell story they should have stayed home and watched reruns of ""Murder, She Wrote"" or whatever crap they find entertaining. To keep seeing a film multiple times is to sometimes get a dream crowd and other days get a group of codgers who are simply at the wrong movie for them! Those Tuesday nights when the theatre was packed were amazing and the collective riotous laughter was louder than any other film I've been to besides ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""This is Spinal Tap"". I can only hope we get another collaboration from Phillips, Helms, Cooper, Galifianakis, Bartha and the rest of this band of lunatics. Best film of 2009!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Funniest Film Of The Year.,"After a wild bachelor party, 3 friends wake up in a destroyed room and discover that their friend, the groom, is missing. Now they must re-trace their steps from the night that they can't remember in order to get him back to the wedding the next day.This premise is just an excuse for some wild and random comedic scenarios, such as having a tiger be in your bathroom when you wake up. The joy of watching this film is seeing just how many crazy things come next, all of which the characters have no memory of. What makes The Hangover work so well, is not just those random comedic scenarios, but the cast that blended so well together. Specifically Zach Galifianakis, whom has been the audience favourite.As the film progresses, the characters find themselves getting into some serious situations due to their antics the night before. I want say what happens, as each one if funny and should be watched with surprise. It easy to say that this film will not bore you. It does have a particular comedic style though and you can judge yourself if you'll be into it or not from the trailer.Todd Phillips, of Oldschool fame, has his funniest movie here. Both Road Trip and Oldschool were good, yet were missing something that made me really love it. The Hangover has this something. It's not a teen comedy (road trip) nor is it a star powered film (old school). It uses familiar faces that make you go ""I've seen him before"" but never do these actors overshadow the film. Had it of been a bigger name cast it wouldn't have worked so well.The three friends are played by Ed Helms, the uptight dentist, Bradley Cooper, the suave smooth talker, and Zach Galifianakis, the odd brother in law. The groom is played by Justin Bartha, the National Treasure sidekick. It's easy to say the Galifianakis steals the show. It's obvious he will garner more roles from this, I just hope he doesn't get pigeon-holed into this style. He reminds me of Chi McBride and I want him to branch out before it's too late (Michael Cera). Helms and Cooper also hold up nicely, I'm familiar with Helms from The Office and Daily Show fame and Cooper from previous films has always been likable. Bartha isn't in the film that much, since most of it is them looking for the guy.The Hangover also doesn't suffer from the one thing that seems to kill so many comedies. Over exposed trailer. Yes we've all seen the Mike Tyson bit, but the film has so many random bits of comedy that you will enjoy yourself throughout the running time. If the film does fault, it's with the character of Mr. Chow. I like Ken Jeong, but here he plays the character way over the top and it becomes distracting. Heather Graham makes an appearance as well and as she does with almost every role she takes on, you see her boobies. Well, one boob.The film is funny, I was entertained, and I expect to see good things from Galifianakis. It's vulgar and obscene and don't expect to see much heart near the end or a good message, like Apatow films do. While it does have that one scene in which one character stands up for himself, it doesn't try to throw any real messages out the audience.Make sure you stay for the first bit of the credits, as the laughs don't stop.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

VERY funny without the need for bad taste or much sex either,"The Hangover is truly funny. But it is better than funny.First there is the plot: friends wake up in a hotel room and can't remember a thing. But although this is quite good already, it is only the starting point. What is truly funny, and truly creative, is their subsequent quest: there is a wealth of original ideas, of unexpected things, in all 2x or 3x more material and ideas than is found in your average flick.And, the acting is quite good, perfect for this kind of film.

"Great Ingredients, Undercooked.....","A bromance movie following in the Hollywood tradition of recent years, The Hangover stands at the crossroads between 2 Hollywood genres - the ""what stays in Vegas"" movie, and the road trip movie, as 4 male friends go away for a weekend of pre-wedding debauchery, but end up losing the groom and the plot. Indeed director and co-writer Todd Phillips' first feature was in fact 2000's Road Trip, and his second was the hilarious 'Old School', and it particularly shares the latter's theme of misbehaving buddies old enough to know better.The girls are an afterthought, either villains, super bitches, or sweet caring and perfect like Heather Graham's hot stripper/mom. But the accusations of misogyny are missing the point. This movie's not about the girls, but the friendships between the dudes.If the territory is familiar, the execution is not without its' charms. In particular, the charming weirdness of Alan, Tracy's brother, with his fat Jesus appearance and his sweet, innocent yet insane personality (Zach Galifianakis) a counterpoint to the worldly cool of Bradly Cooper's Phil, and geeky dentist Stu (played by Ed Helms). These 3 musketeers spend most of the movie trying to piece together what happens the night before (when Zach's character accidentally slipped them all a date rape drug instead of Ecstasy), which somehow involves a real life tiger, an actual baby, a missing family heirloom/wedding ring belonging to Stu, and the mysterious disappearance of their friend and husband-to-be Doug (Justin Bartha).As road movies go, The Hangover is a fun ride, hitting all the right notes with such fun ingredients, including a cameo from an air-drumming Mike Tyson, but the film never quite lives up to its' potential, and is likely to provoke laughter among the more literal-minded American viewers at which it is aimed, as the US reviews of this movie largely confirm. For the more discerning British viewer, however, some goofy ingredients like a tiger, a hooker with a wedding ring and date rape drugs will not compensate for the hit and miss humour of the movie, and a slight shortage of wittier banter or richer characterisation. For me, Phil isn't enough of a bastard, Stu isn't enough of a dork, and Alan could be just a touch weirder - in the directors' similar former movie Old School, the characters played by likes of Owen Wilsion, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn are just bigger and brasher, making for more fun. The Hangover, then ; like a great breakfast with some awesome ingredients after a great, messy night out, only slightly undercooked.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Perhaps this movie should have been given 4.8 instead of 8.4 and even this would be too generous, in my opinion. The movie is not only a cliché of Hollywood bachelor's night 'what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas' type of films, but 99.9% of the jokes were either tasteless or completely predictable.

The reason why I found this to be one of the funniest films of the decade as well as one of my favorite comedies is because of the film's plot, the main actors in the film(listed above) as well as some of the supporting actors(namely Ken Jeong and Heather Graham) and one or two of the cameos.

The technical work and editing do help push the creaky old storyline along.The writing is so-so.

If there was some kind of brilliant twist or tour-de-force, it would redeem the exercise. Unfortunately, the development is a surprisingly prosaic, vanilla treatment of the premise.I know this approach works OK for some folks.

A Hangover Gone Bad,"The Hangover takes place in Las Vegas when Doug Billings, played by Justin Bartha, and Tracy Garner, played by Sasha Barrese, are two days away from being married. Doug's friends, Phil Wenneck, played by Bradley Cooper, Stu Price, played by Ed Helms, and Alan Garner, played by Zach Galifianakis, thought that now is the time for a bachelor party and where else better to party then Vegas. To their misfortune, after a long night of hard partying and great times, they wake up to the worst hangover ever, find the groom missing, and at the same time have no recollection of what happened the night before. It is now up to the three of them to find Doug before his wedding just a day away. With no time to waste they begin to look for clues to help steer them towards the right direction to find Doug and in doing so find out piece by piece the crazy night that none of them could ever imagine.I believe ""The Hangover"" was one of the funniest movies I have seen since ""Superbad"", ""Step Brothers"", and ""Pineapple Express"". I laughed from beginning to end. ""The Hangover"" is a must watch in theaters. The character of Alan Garner is comical in the film. He brought a unique character to life with his funny scenes. Bradley Cooper, in the movie, is a teacher that would be awesome to have in real life. His character is what gets the group to be so much fun, by making them do all the crazy stuff with his frat boy like attitude. This movie is unquestionably one of the best comedy films of the year and a must see.Director Todd Phillips has a unique perspective of the film. He likes the way the characters portray their bad behavior and feels that this is what makes a film so funny. He doesn't really have a moral or point to the film except to make it funny and something that everyone can enjoy and have a good laugh. The director portrays the characters funny characteristics through their great personalities and funny punch lines. I feel he does an excellent job directing and keeping the film funny throughout the entire movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny? Yep. Hilarious? Not really...,"Now first let me get one thing straight, I didn't see this film at the theatres based on it's trailers. It didn't look that funny and I don't usually bother seeing comedies on the big screen as i feel they come across just as well on DVD as they are not riddled with special effects etc.But I was highly recommended this film from several different people who all said it was much funnier than they had expected and that the trailers didn't do the film any justice. One friend of mine even said the film was one of the funniest films they had ever seen!!!So as soon as it was released on DVD, i decided to check it out myself and make up my own decision.Now by all means, ""The Hangover"" is a fairly descent comedy. It has some funny scenes. But that being said, it wasn't THAT funny! The laughs were there but to me they were just brief chuckles and a few little laughs. I never once found myself out of breath from laughing so hard as i have in other rescent comedies such as ""Role Models"" and ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"".I know I shouldn't compare ""The hangover"" to those films but those comedies are the ones I find hilarious.I guess Hangover just felt a little predictable and the jokes were so forced in parts and obviously set up like, here's a scene, here's some dialogue and here's the punch line!.......ha ha?Plus that Asian dude who played the criminal in the film just wasn't funny at all! I haven't seen such terrible acting since Nicolas Cage's un-intentionally comedic performance in ""the Wickerman"" remake!I really did try hard to enjoy this film and it is a good film....it's just not great and overly original in my opinion.Don't believe the hype, that's all.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Some say it sucks, and I know why","Not because I agree with them, not at all, I loved the movie. I laughed so much throughout this movie, it was great. But there are those who hate this movie, and they all say the same thing 'Is it just me? All my friends seem to think it's hilarious but I barely even let out a snicker during the entire thing.' You can easily examine this and determine why these people think that this isn't funny. These people are annoying, egotistical asses who think they're god's gift to the world. The first line, which they ALL use, 'Is it just me?' shows how they try to identify themselves as unique and 'above' everyone who likes this movie. Yup, they think that they are superior people because of which movies they like. They then use the 'all my friends' line, which is laughable because these are the types of people without any friends. Then they say 'I barely let out a snicker', implying that the movie wasn't just bad overall, they try to make it seem as though there was no part of the movie, even for say, 5 seconds, that was funny enough to make them laugh. So, to the people who say they hate this movie: No one cares about what you think you self-centred moron. I hate these kinds of people, luckily I haven't known too many of them in my time. They also usually think that they are exceptionally intelligent, but their life situation, which of course matches their actual intelligence, is completely average and they blame it on something that they of course have no control over. Anyway, enough with those ass holes, this movie was awesome. If you are one of the people I described above with a ten-foot pole up your ass, then watch the movie. You'll control yourself and won't laugh at all to try to seem too high-brow for this movie, but secretly you'll love it and you'll hate that you love it because you need to seem intelligent because you know that you need to seem intelligent whenever possible because in reality, you aren't... at all.

Another thing: The night before the hangover, these guys sure don't do a lot of drinking. I'm thinking to myself: ""Small glasses? That's it?""

Whelp.,"My initial review of this was ""Eh."" Here it is:
""A dramatically sound comedy with a disappointing solution. It, and several other comedic moments in the film, are reliant on distractingly contrived and implausible variables. In other words, the characters would have to be more stupid than they are presented to be in order for this plot to be possible. So, it's funny, and I watched the whole thing, but overall... eh.""However, this review does not fully account for what you are delivered as a result of these contrived plot points. Sure, a plot hole or two-rather, an impossible scenario or two-can make a story very challenging to agree with.

Hilarious film! One of the best comedies of 2009 (So far),"This has n't really been a good year for comedies this year and when I saw this trailer I did n't really expect much. But, always open to seeing a comedy movie, I went to the drive and really enjoyed myself. It was really funny all the way along and even when it stopped to set up a scene it was still really interesting to watch and I never got bored throughout the movie. I think most people are used to films like this right now, with the shock value level set high and trying to make as many people annoyed as possible, but I like to think this film has a lot more going for it, with much better humour and if not that, much funnier character's.The film also uses its concept better then all the other comedies that have been released this year, and the plot line does n't disappoint and the disaster theme, while used in thousands of other Hollywood films before this is again done really well and keeps this film interesting and lively.Overall, this was a much funnier movie then I thought it was and is another movie that has really surprised me by doing the opposite of what I thought it would be like (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) and I was very glad I decided to this. I give this movie 83%. I would recommend this for lovers of Apatrow styled movies (Knocked Up, Superbad, Zack And Miri Make A Porno).",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""So long, gay boys.""","Going into this, I was a little pessimistic. Most likely because this is a comedy film, and I'm worried I'll find it boring and unfunny; that defeats the overall purpose. I don't think that's happened to me yet. At least completely. And I've barely watched that many comedy films yet, either. So, it's needless worrying on my part.Now, at the same time, I didn't laugh out loud a lot. That's probably due to watching everything by myself, being by myself, with a bit of desensitization. I've found that when I'm with someone, the littlest things seem to make me laugh involuntarily. The kind of laughter you get, generally, not just with films, when it comes to instances you aren't supposed to laugh at, trying desperately to hold it back, not laugh. That makes it tough to determine whether I found a comedy film funny, so even with comedy films, it still comes down to entertainment; was I entertained?With this film? In a nutshell, yes. It was entertaining to watch; I wasn't slowly getting bored. I can understand how the comedy aspect would be hilarious to people, either overall or in some parts of it, even though I didn't laugh much.My favorite part/what I liked most about it was probably the lead characters, especially Phil and Alan. That aspect of the writing did a lot for this film. And, of course, the performances by Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis helped with that, too. Mr. Chow (including Ken Jeong's performance) was also up there. Overall, the three leads had good chemistry with each other, which bled into the film/their characters, and that, combined with the writing side of things, ended up with a good result.Interestingly enough, despite being a focal part of the story in an off-screen capacity, Doug stood out the most. I wanted him to be more present. Something about Justin Bartha's performance gave more of a likeability factor to Doug, wanting more of him, which I hope is the case in the other two films. But I feel like that won't be the case.Two other aspects that stood out tremendously were the soundtrack and the cinematography (as well as some of the film's editing by Debra Neil-Fisher). The soundtrack was by far the best one I've heard so far out of every movie I've watched. 'Fantastic' doesn't even come close to describing it. And the cinematography was shockingly great; I wasn't expecting it to be, especially for this kind of film. Lawrence Sher did a great job with it.I haven't read much of what people say about it, but I get the impression that the reception is similar to Tropic Thunder, and if you've read my review for that film, you'd probably guess that I'd disagree with that sentiment for this film, too.Yes, you're correct. (If my impression is spot-on) this film is overrated. Just like Tropic Thunder. But it's far from bad.So, overall, this film was pretty positive. Pretty much everything I liked (the story was straightforward, but that's not a negative), which made the whole movie even better.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Pretty much a composite of every wild,bachelor party story ever told;still very funny","On a balls-out,let-it-all ride Bachelor party trip to Vegas,friends Stu(Ed Helms,unleashed at long last here to full comedic effect),Phil(Bradley Cooper,a career that's appeared out of nowhere to become money in the bank)and future in-law Alan(Zach Gallifinakis,in my mind the biggest scene thief of this show) run into one small problem after a night of inspired debauchery:the guest of honor,groom-to-be Doug(Justin Bartha,who's sorta there for the film)is missing. And now,three guys whose various poor or short-sighted judgments have left them disoriented and in some legal trouble,must combine their wits to go find their friend and future husband-to-be in an economy of time and an odd,sometimes disturbing set of clues left in wake to help them.Director Todd Phillips,expanding upon the ""bad boys being bad boys"" formula that was modestly offered with star power to back it in Old School,now goes for a slightly more modest cast(from Will Ferrell,Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson to Helms,Bartha,Gallifinakis and Cooper)but a more ambitious,raunchier(if that can be believed)and adventurous story to make this largely funny,sometimes hard to believe comedy. A deft usage of actors in supporting roles--among them the now underused Heather Graham as a pleasant,bubbly single mom of infant,who just happens to be a stripper and escort;Ken Jeong as the wiry,foul-tempered and quite possibly gay Asian mobster who has it in for the heroes;Rachael Harris as Stu's brittle,domineering bitch of a girlfriend;and Mike Tyson as,get this,Mike Tyson--highlight this tour de force,and that's not even to mention the near cameos as some not-too-lightweight-themselves talents as Jeffrey Tambor(as the Bride and Alan's dad),Bryan Callen(as a thick-accented wedding chapel proprietor),Sasha Barresee(mostly in one-note fret mode as the unravelling bride-to-be),Mike Epps(as a discombobulated drug dealer),Rob Riggle(as a uniform cop,one of Vegas' NOT finest)and Cleo King(as his equally inept and cruel partner).The summary line notes that this movie,as funny ands sometimes shocking(stay for the credits and try not to be caught at least a little off guard!)as this film is,at its core it is little more than a compendium of wild stories that guys have spun,whether based in truth or no,set around giving their buddies and/or enduring their last night of un-wedded fun. So while the originality of this particular movie isn't all that remarkable,the set-up,follow-through and denouement of it is! Good,raunchy,raucous fun for anyone(guys in particular)who appreciate good,solid immature tomfoolery before settling down and ""becoming mature"". Perfect film-going for summer!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Poor script lets this down,"I laughed once at this movie, where the wedding singer does 50 Cent's 'Candy Shop'. Apart from this, nothing. The acting was okay, the characters too. The main thing that was lacking was a good script. You know what you're gonna get with one of these kind of movies, but unfortunately this just didn't deliver. I had a few beers before, and was ready to laugh.... but this movie just couldn't deliver them. Shame, because the premise sounded fairly good. I don't like trashing movies, but I think it's best that if you must see this movie, then don't expect a lot, and you won't be too disappointed. I know lots of people rated it highly, but I can't think why for the life of me. I'm not a prude, and laughed pretty good at Stepbrothers and stuff of this ilk, which you can call puerile and stupid. I'm just very disappointed that the most important thing of the whole film was just not up to it, cos everything else was there. Sorry guys!",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Officially a ""Classic"" Comedy - Gosh, I'm Getting Old...","The Hangover is, unquestionably, one of the ""A-tier"" comedies of the 2000s.Bolstered by a cast that is clearly having a blast with the whole setup, the 100 minutes goes by in a snap of the fingers - a frenetic pace that never feels rushed or uncomfortable. It's a lot like the friend at the wedding who is just ON - he isn't always like this, no, but tonight is a special night: just enjoy the routine.The film is unapologetically funny, and it accomplishes this in different ways.Sometimes, the film relies heavily on the well-written script (and the delivery of the fantastic actors portraying these zany and lovable characters) - we see this mostly in the outlandish quotes of Zach Galifianakis's ""Alan"", the heart and soul of the picture.Other times, the film borrows heavily on its fantastic comedic setting, Las Vegas, to deliver hilarious visual gags.Others, we see the animalistic pacing on full-display. Tigers and Mike Tyson, anyone?Whatever is making us laugh, one thing is crystal clear: it is never gimmicky, never cheap, and never half-baked.The Hangover, above all else, acts as the comedy film that by presenting itself as the stupidest film in the theater is actually the most sharp and enduring.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fear and Laughter in Las Vegas,"More than once in my life, I have been accused of lacking a sense of humor, and lately I've been wondering if that's really the case, or if American comedy has become a sad case of settling for less (and just praising it more). I still don't get the fascination with Sacha Baron Cohen's outrageous publicity stunts masquerading as ""films""; nor do I manage many laughs at the efforts of box-office juggernaut Judd Apatow. My decision to see ""The Hangover"" was influenced by two factors: the praise some casual acquaintances had given it; and a genuine lack of anything else interesting playing. With a Sunday-afternoon audience of probably 30 people, I found that the American comedic film--not to mention my sense of humor--was more than alive and well. Directed by Todd Phillips (""Road Trip""), ""The Hangover"" is the tale of four friends: cocky elementary-school teacher Phil (Bradley Cooper); meek, whipped dentist Stu (""Daily Show"" correspondent Ed Helms); WASPy groom-to-be Doug (Justin Bartha); and his mentally deficient future brother-in-law, Alan (Zack Galifianakis), who trek to Las Vegas for Doug's bachelor party the night before he's set to tie the knot. After a rooftop Jagermeister toast that commences the night's activities, we flash forward to the next morning, with the friends' hotel suite in disarray (including a tiger holed up in the bathroom), and Doug nowhere to be found; while trying to remember what happened the night before, our trio of suddenly sober man-children embark on a quest that is as hilarious as it is unpredictable. Instead of a straightforward narrative where all the comedic beats are telegraphed in advance (such is the fate of most films of this sort; and the story is admittedly nothing new), John Lucas' and Scott Moore's screenplay mines the sort of surprise and revelation that marks a good mystery thriller (which the film could have easily been played for), transforming each punchline into an uproarious zinger as a result. One of the best films I've seen this year, ""The Hangover"" is also the funniest Hollywood comedy in ages.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
not bad but not funny,"Against my better judgment I decided to see this film because of the success of its sequel and the high ratings here. Surely if a sequel was made for a film, then the original film must've been good enough to warrant that, right? Well... no, it wasn't. I should've remembered the Resident Evil and Scream series. (They just keep pumping these out, don't they?)Anyway, I can't say I was disappointed. I pretty much got what I expected: a bunch of guys getting together to do something wildly stupid so that we could laugh at them. OK, I was hoping for more because of the success of the sequel but, unfortunately, that was it. It was about as funny as watching some guys trying to tip a cow. In the words of Seth from Superbad, ""That's not even clever!""This film could've been funny and the jokes sound funny on paper, but on film, they weren't. I mean, an image of some guys waking up from their stupor to find themselves in the middle of a disheveled room with a chicken and a tiger and no clue as to what they've done does sound funny. So why wasn't it? Probably because there was no chemistry among the main characters. It was just a group of individuals experiencing unusual circumstances. I felt nothing for them.The only time I actually laughed was during that scene where the bearded guy was playing with the baby. That was roughly 20 minutes into the movie and that was pretty much the only, really funny, though somewhat vulgar and tasteless, scene. The rest of the time I was only interested in finding out how the movie would end.I didn't find much humor in this film but it did keep me interested enough to finish watching it which is why I'm giving it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Can I have that hour and half of my life back please?,"When the movie was first released and I saw the trailer, I wasn't impressed. After it was released on DVD and I saw that 90,000+ IMDb users had rated it at 8.0, I thought maybe I missed something and should give it a chance. I did give it a chance; I didn't miss anything. Wow, what a waste of time. There were a few jokes and a few situations that hit the mark, but mostly it left my group shaking our collective heads and wishing we could have that hour and a half of our lives back. The premise was promising; 3 friends plus an odd-ball brother-in-law in Vegas for a bachelor party (although for most of the time, it's just 3 since the groom-to-be goes missing) that goes awry. But out of the 3 remaining prominent characters, only 2 of them are interesting on any level. Bradley Cooper's school teacher is supposed to be the straight-man in the group that plays off the wackiness of the others, but he adds no comedic value and the other 2 aren't wacky enough, with a few exceptions, to be funny on their own.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Opposite of a Headache,"The Hangover is a compelling anomaly of a comedy, one that easily could have been just another movie where a group of thirtysomething dudes get drunk and into all sorts of trouble. The method in which its story is told, however, sets it apart from its comedic kin and makes it all the more hilarious and brilliant.A small group of friends, pretty boy Phil (Bradley Cooper), lady-whipped Stu (The Office's ""Andy,"" Ed Helms), socially inept Alan (awesome newcomer Zach Galifianakis), and groom-to-be Doug (Justin Bartha), decide to go to Las Vegas for a final free-roaming, binge-drinking evening away from their normal lives, two days before Doug's nuptials are set to take place. Predictably, the drinking begins early upon their arrival, and not surprisingly, the antics begin. The best departure about The Hangover, however, is the intelligent structure of the story from there on out. The bachelors awake the next morning to discover that not only do they not remember a single thing from the night before, but also that their man of the hour, Doug, is missing and nowhere to be found. It turns out that, for reasons the film so elegantly reveals, that the men had been drugged. Their hotel room is in shambles, a baby is found in the closet, and a tiger has set up shop in the bathroom. The three friends are in similarly puzzling positions: Phil finds a hospital bracelet around his wrist, Stu is missing a front tooth, and Alan yet again finds it difficult to locate a pair of pants.From that point, as the viewer, you're taken on a journey throughout Vegas with the film's three main antagonists, to determine what happened to them and their ride home, Doug. You find out just as much as the three friends do, and at the exact same time, about their night out, which drives up the anticipation of whatever following humorous event the friends discover. The interaction and comedic chemistry between Phil, Stu, and Alan is amazing; the casting couldn't have been done any better. The Hangover also contains cameo appearances from several unexpected characters, including Mike Tyson and several actors who starred in 2003's Old School (one of director Todd Phillips's fantastic previous works). The dialogue and language is crude and offensive, yet appropriate and rip-roaringly funny, and there's even bits of karmic plot points that round out the movie as an extremely well-accomplished work of raucous, constant humor.Up until this point, Old School only had a small handful of competitive equals, but The Hangover is so confidently funny that it eclipses many of said competitors with ease. Even if somehow you don't begin to enjoy the movie from its opening moments, you'll be unable to stop being washed into the swirling miasma of curiosity and humor that The Hangover possesses. Chock-full of one-liners and hilarious moments, The Hangover is a treat, and unlike hangovers we've all had, will be one you'll be more than pleased to undertake a second time.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Hung Over from the Hangover.,"Hell, another good 2009 movie. For all my grievances about not being able to see Up, Moon and The Brothers Bloom all in one week, it seems like all of it is finally paying off, as I found this movie very entertaining.The comedy is hit and miss, but to be fair, it's mostly hit, with my only real criticism being that the characters are kind of stock - but then again, they're still enjoyable and really fun to watch, and surprisingly developed and well written in the end, too. The dialogue is good and the first forty five minutes or so are really good, with the random suspense mixture throwing you for loop after loop until the conclusion. The comedy, when it's really ""on,"" is delightfully vulgar and silly, and the pace of the movie is great, sending you on a wild adventure that you won't forget any time soon, full of laughs.The ending seems to drag on a bit, but again, nothing that really hurts the movie. The Hangover isn't a modern classic, but it's definitely a good movie, and it kept me interested. Recommended. I really did like what they did with the ending credits, that was just great. Set this movie apart from others; and it didn't even make you wait until the ages of credits were done to see anything extra.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Fat Jesus has left the building.,"Not since 1984's Bachelor Party with Tom Hanks has a good old bachelor movie come along like 'The Hangover'.

Fat Jesus).The night doesn't turn out as planned and they wake to find their hotel room trashed, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet and the groom missing. With no memory of what happened the rest of the movie is a hilarious trek through Vegas trying to put the pieces together.There are no big name comedians, instead a chemistry that develops quickly between the guys which makes the comedy work, especially from Zach Galifianakis who really shines. Heather Graham is as hot as usual, and Mike Tyson has a cameo which is the only part I didn't like. A lot of improvisation can be felt through out the whole film and there are some great photo's at the end credits that looked like they really did go on a wild night in Vegas.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Entertaining, but overrated","I'm surprised to see that this movie rates 8.0 at the time I'm writing this. Not surprising is that 'Aged under 18' gave the highest scores, because that's the perfect target group for this kind of movie. If you haven't seen a whole lot of good comedies in your life yet, this will be funny. However, if you've seen more movies, it will be all too obvious that the main ingredients of this movie are derivative and/or cheap.The 'doctor/dentist' gag comes straight out of Wild Hogs for instance, and many of the other situations come from other movies which in most cases did a better job at it. For someone who has watched 'Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas', it feels like the makers of this movie wanted to duplicate the hotel suite scene but were too chicken (pun intended) to do actual damage to their film set. When the humor isn't derivative, it often stoops down to puerile level instead.This is a 'trailer movie': the best parts are in the trailer and the rest is mostly filler. Don't get me wrong: it's not terrible as a whole. As a kind of remix of existing movies it was entertaining enough not to get me bored. It just doesn't deserve the 10 or even 8 stars many people give it. 6/10 seems much more reasonable.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very funny adult movie,"I was not in a really good mood when I went to see this movie and I thought that I needed some mindless humor to cheer me up a bit. To my surprise, this movie turned out to be really funny and endearing at the same time. I found myself actually liking everyone acting in this film. The humor was more intelligent then I had expected and I found myself completely engrossed in the situations on the screen. Don't get me wrong, it was still raunchy guy stuff, but the writing and chemistry of this film are way beyond normal mass produced material. But the main reason that I am writing this review is because I don't understand the people that give this movie a rating of one or two. It is OK if you don't care for this type of humor, but it is something else to say the movie was real bad, even when the rest of the movie theater is laughing out loud throughout the whole film. Do you think the rest of the people in the theater are mindless freaks, or are you so self absorbed that you don't realize the rest of the people are really enjoying the film?

Hungover on The Hangover,"To begin with, I just have to state that it has been a really long time since I laughed as much as I did while watching The Hangover, and I am a film addict.The Hangover is a refreshingly original story about 4 guys (Stu, Alan, Phil, and Doug) and their wild bachelor party in Las Vegas. The originality of the movie comes from the fact that we do not actually see the night of partying, but the day after -- it's a surprise that this has not been done before. The plot of the story is that Stu, Alan and Phil must retrace their steps because they seem to have lost Doug, their best friend who is getting married. The only problem, is that they can't remember anything that happened the previous night.After Todd Phillips' success with Old School and Starsky and Hutch, he has become one of my favourite comedic directors and I had very high expectations of The Hangover because of Phillips.The extraordinary characters that were put together for this movie is what makes it so epic. Without Phil (played by Bradley Cooper) - the handsome masochist, Stu (played by Ed Helms) - the ""responsable"" dentist, and Alan (played by Zach Galifianakis) - the insanely odd but hilarious brother in law, The Hangover would not have been what it was. Credit must also be given to Heather Graham as she plays Jade, the happy stripper with the lost baby. Furthermore, the addition of Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow bring together a hysterical cast that will not be forgotten.Again, the fact that this storyline has not been done before (at least so well) is mind blowing. The wild and insane situations faced by this group of friends is laugh-out-loud funny. The slapstick humour, along with each characters original personalities, make us want to watch the movie over and over again. The amazing one liners that will be quoted over and over again to friends and family make us wonder about the minds that come up with such things. And the (musical)cameo by Mike Tyson is just icing on the cake.So for all those who are skeptical about Todd Phillips, and live by Judd Apatow, I truly suggest putting that skepticism aside and watch The Hangover. Call up all your friends, get comfortable, and prepare to laugh for and hour and a half straight.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

not much on paper but the finished product is hard to dislike,"A simple, familiar setup is made worthwhile in this amusingly raunchy comedy. Four friends from Los Angeles, one soon to be married the other three his loyal groomsmen, take a trip to Las Vegas to have the time of their lives and give the would-be groom a night he'll never forget. Instead it turns into a night they all forget when they awake the next morning with a bad hangover, no recollection of the previous night, and a lengthy series of misadventures that only grow stranger as they try to piece together the events of their wild ""bachelor party."" What initially sounds like a variation on the dreadful stoner comedy Dude, Where's My Car? (yikes) actually produces some very clever results with more than enough vulgar and very funny gags, appealing characters, and a feel-good tone. Slow at first, but the more out of control the jokes get the more laughs they're able to provide, though it does arrive at an inevitable conclusion. Beyond that it's wildly good fun. ***",,Anonymous,Comedy
A good and funny if not overrated comedy,"The Hangover, crude possibly overrated film, well maybe that is true but I still liked this movie and found if funny enough to be good. The whole story revolves around a bunch of friends who go to Las Vegas to celebrate a guy named Doug's soon to be marriage and well, get in a lot of trouble along the way. The plot not only has people going missing but also it has in such a humorous movie actually not that bad a story, kind of exciting in a certain way. Overall really the whole film is one continuous laugh placed over an actual story but it works somehow and even though I do feel people love this a bit too much, it's still more than OK.The movie stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Heather Graham and also Zach Galifianakis who is by far far far the best character of the movie, very funny and he does exactly the kind of job you would want from that kind of personality. Now I'm not saying that the cast are bad, the acting is good no doubt but my only problem was that some jokes aren't that funny, or at least the one's given to the main cast other than Galifianakis. If you follow the story closely and become really engaged, the only real big laughs will come from Zach and although actors like Ken Jeong have their moments; it is the man playing Alan who is supreme.The script is one of the other great things in this movie, a fine screenplay from Jon Lucas and Scott Moore who seem to mix the right amount of crude humour with an actual plausible story(kind of). Todd Phillips directs and does a good job, I never felt his vision truly was great and some attempts to get a joke across are flat, nevertheless Phillips continues his career in crude comedy well and I can't say his work is anything but fine. One thing that I really noticed was the cinematography, absolutely brilliant skyline shots mixed with some fantastic angles when trying to simulate being drunk, getting into a fight etc.As movies go in popular culture, The Hangover trumps many a movie in the way of memorable quotes and that is pretty much all because of Alan. I think what makes him so memorable and also likable is not just the writing and the acting but also the direction in which Phillips gives. The jokes are timed so well it is impossible for Phillips not to have had a hand in making them stick, of everything he does in this movie; this is truly the only part I feel he got truly very well done. I'm not discrediting Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms etc but it is only the comedy stems from one character, and I think the laughs have to revolve around Alan to make this movie funny, and I think it does that just about enough.In conclusion the Hangover is maybe not the most funny comedy ever (nor the smartest), but it is what it is and it isn't shy about that. Of all the jokes the crude ones never get out of control except maybe once with the needless one's such as the one aimed at Ed Helm's character Stu right at the start.

My curiosity was piqued since on the surface, the film represents a sophomoric genre that targets a more juvenile, male-oriented audience. However, director Todd Philips (""Old School"") infuses what could have been a tired premise with a no-holds-barred comedic sense which is refreshingly consistent and surprisingly human. The pacing is so frenetically furious that the filmmakers give a viewer little time to question the credibility of the often ridiculous plot turns. Written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, the story revolves around a typical Vegas bachelor party where three close buddies get together for one last night of drink and debauchery. The trio of prospective groom Doug, straitlaced dentist Stu (who is engaged to a controlling harpy), and cynical schoolteacher Phil is joined by the bride's brother, Alan, a bearded, beer-bellied and socially awkward geek who turns out to be a little too desperate to be a natural member of this fraternal clan.The newly established quartet drives from LA to Vegas and ends up staying in a palatial $4,200-a-night suite at Caesar's Palace. After a rooftop Jägermeister toast, we flash forward to the morning after with their room completely trashed. Inflatable sex dolls in the hot tub, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in a closet, a hospital band on Phil's wrist, and Stu's missing front incisor are the only clues they have to figure out what happened the night before. Even worse, Doug is missing, and they have approximately 24 hours to find him for the wedding. What Philips does cleverly is turn his comic hi-jinks story into a detective story without sacrificing any of the raucous comedy. In fact, the subsequent plot draws broader and broader circles of implausibility with each development reinforcing the absurdist tone with sharp precision. Not too surprisingly, as the movie provides greater clarity on what exactly happened, the movie starts to lose momentum and becomes rather predictable with the inevitable climax of a high-speed scene. Nonetheless, some of the sight gags and set pieces are unapologetically hilarious, for instance, a stun-gun demo for a classroom of grade school children, a naked gangster pouncing from a car trunk, and a highly inappropriate rendition of 50 Cents' ""Candy Shop"" at the wedding reception.Much of the film's success has to do with the easy rapport that the four principals have with each other. The absence of a dominating comedy figure like Will Ferrell or Steve Carell actually helps this time around. As Phil, Bradley Cooper (""He's Just Not That Into You"") somehow manages to make the standard role of the cocksure alpha male into a genuinely likable character. Ed Helms (Andy in the US version of ""The Office"") appears to be channeling a bit of Stephen Colbert in bringing out Stu's neurotic, self-protective tendencies. However, most of the laughs are supplied by stand-up comic Zach Galifianakis, who makes Alan not only the model social outcast but also a subconscious manifestation of all the well-intentioned actions that get us in trouble. Justin Bartha has little to do as Doug, as does Heather Graham as an obliging stripper/hooker who finds herself married to Stu. Ken Jeong, the cranky obstetrician in ""Knocked Up"", does a loopy turn as a gay gangster in a bit that goes on too long, and look for a very off-the-wall scene with Mike Tyson. The closing credits provide the details of the boys' notorious night through a hysterical series of increasingly outrageous photos.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It's quite funny in places and has its own fan base.,For a Hollywood comedy it's almost funny and has a great surprising cameo by Mike Tyson. I'm sure a film most will either love or hate and it's certainly a watchable and enjoyable ride.,6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It's About Dam Time!!!!,"God only knows when the last time I actually laughed at a ""comedy"" film that I saw in the theater. Most ""comedy"" films are full of poor acting, recycled garbage, terrible jokes and toilet humor. I mean, how many times can you see the same thing over, and over, and over again, before it gets as stale as a bag of month old potato chips?With that said, ""The Hangover"" was BRILLIANT! Finally a comedy film directed towards a mature audience with mature humor. The characters worked extremely well together, and the plot was, actually interesting.So many comedy films these days are so, ridiculously, stupid, there isn't much of a plot at all, just lame jokes and cardboard acting. This film took it to the next level, and it's the first time, in forever, I can say I actually laughed out loud at a comedy film.OUTSTANDING!!! For MATURE audiences only",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny Road movie detective,"At first, I thought, why not? Another party movie. But in the end I was pleasantly surprised, because the party was not visible and it was a kind of comedy detective story where the main characters find out what actually happened that night. I enjoyed it. Fast paced, gradual revelations until the climax at the end which wrapped up the film nicely. In the end, it turned out to be a very good road movie comedy for me. For me, a good movie to recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Comedy Without Limits,"One of those movies that gets better every time you watch it.We follow several friends who head to Las Vegas for a bachelor party.

One of the funniest comedies since SUPERBAD!!!!,"I had to admit that I was a bit skeptical about seeing this movie, I'm not a big Todd Phillips fan and Road Trip and Old School were slightly disappointing to me in the light that I thought they could be way more dirtier.This movie proved to me that Todd Phillips was holding back for a reason: This movie contains some of the funniest comedic scenes you will ever see on-camera. Most notably is Zach Galifianakis, who pretty much owned every scene in this movie with his awkwardness and witty dialogue. Another great newcomer is Bradley Cooper from ""Wedding Crashers"" who did a great job leading the rest of the cast. I'm pretty sure that those two have a big career laid out for them after this movie.The movie contained so many great comedic moments and hilarity that I found it hard to keep still in theaters, I noticed a few other people sitting next to me with the same problem.All in all, a great comedy not to be missed, you'll love the baby, you'll love the tiger and you'll love Mike Tyson.

"wow, this movie was really over-hyped...","expecting a laugh riot after the huge buzz and the top rating here on IMDb, i was rather disappointed by this 'chuckle-fest'. the first smile didn't cross my face until about half an hour into the movie, which is way too long for a comedy.this movie consists of a rather uninspired plot without any really fresh ideas, and of dialogue that seems mostly improvised. the endless 'beauty' shots of vegas also struck me as either needless runtime-padding or product placement.the solid efforts by the main cast make this one barely above average.(imdb: the 10-line minimum on these reviews is really annoying!)",,Anonymous,Comedy
A lot better the second time around.,"THE HANGOVERI remember watching this when it first came out and I was the only one out of all of my friends that thought it was crap.The film is about 4 guys who go to Vegas to celebrate a stag party. The problem is, the stag is missing and nobody can remember what went on the night before. There are a lot of things wrong when they wake up the next morning. The stag is missing, the room they are in is wrecked, the dentist is missing a tooth, there is a tiger in the bathroom and they find out they have as police car! Their missing is to now try and retrace their steps to find out where their friend is so they can get him back in time for the wedding.As I said at the beginning, I have seen this before and was very disappointed. But after watching it again I really liked it this time around. The story is really well planned out. I love the idea of the film starting when it has already all gone wrong. You have no idea, just like the characters, what has happened and it is a great adventure what happened the night before.I loved some of the twists in the story. It does just keep you laughing throughout. Just when you think it couldn't get worst something else comes to light and you realise it is a lot worse than expected. The characters were not very likable. Every one of them has something about them that makes them the worst friends in the world. But they do stick together and do not stop until they get their friend back. The acting was really good throughout. It makes a change but the casting was perfect. The film stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha, Heather Graham and Ken Jeong. There was even a great cameo by Iron Mike Tyson. Mike can't act to save his life and he definitely can't sing but it did add to the comedy in this movie.The adventure in this film plays along so well that it is a roller-coaster ride to watch. This film is very funny and if you have seen it and didn't like it, watch it again. I liked it a whole lot more the second time around.I will give this 7 out of 10.""What do tigers dream of when they take their little tiger snooze? Do they dream of mauling zebras, or Halle Berry in her Catwoman suit? Don't you worry your pretty striped head, we're gonna get you back to Tyson and your cozy tiger bed.

MYeah's review: The Hangover,"Hello everybody! This weekend I saw The Hangover.The film centers on four best friends: Phil Wenneck (Played by Bradley Cooper) Stu Price (Ed Helms) Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug Billings (Justin Bartha), who all travel to Las Vegas, to celebrate Doug's bachelor party before he gets married. But the morning after, they wake up to a massive hangover. And for some reason, they cant remember ANYTHING from last night. And what's worse? It turns out they have lost Doug. They find out that the reason WHY they can't remember anything is because they were slipped roofies. They have to retrace all of their steps from the twelve hour period that they have no memory of to find Doug.And the film is absolutely hilarious!The script is creative, inspired, and brilliantly structured. The film is occasionally very random, but it's still so funny. The film is very well paced, and isn't hindered by slow pace that the first few minutes does suffer from a bit.The performances are great in this movie. Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis all play off of each other so well as an ensemble (They're the three best friends that anyone's ever had. :D ), and just as good separately, along with Justin Bartha as well. They're all supported by some great cameos from Heather Graham, Jeffrey Tambor, Ken Jeong, Rob Riggle, and Mike Tyson among others.Overall thoughts: The film's strongest benefits are from it's creative, and hilarious screenplay, and performances.The movie gets *** out of **** from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

High quality comedy let down by the appalling Mr Chow,"One of the better comedies of recent years but probably still a little overrated. The main cast are solid, although Zach Galifianakis' character is a little overdone and Bradley Cooper is way too stylised. Ed Helms is my personal favourite and remains so through all 3 movies.The inclusion of Chow is by far the biggest downfall of this film (it gets even worse with the sequels) and brings the quality down significantly. Such a terribly written character and played atrociously by Ken Jeong. Not sure why they would ruin such a good movie with such an unnecessarily slapstick character like this.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Evoked more anger than laughs,"Probably the worst picture of the year for me in terms of disappointed expectations. I didn't laugh once during the entire length of this so-called comedy. Witless, charmless, without one likable character in its ensemble cast, I was especially dumbfounded by the hype accorded to Zach Galifianakis, whose lack of talent somehow manages to make Adam Sandler look like a comic genius.""The Hangover"" is obviously targeted to an audience who likes their humor broad and sophomoric. To make matters worse, it relies heavily on obnoxious stereotypes that are patently offensive.This piece of dreck utterly pales in comparison to a similar buddy flick, the eminently watchable ""I Love You, Man."" ""The Hangover"" was an utter waste of time and money. Caveat emptor.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Took me by surprise,"I as well as my wife truly enjoyed this movie and neither of us expected to. In fact, the entire theater broke up laughing more often than not - and at the appropriate times too. One odd comment is that a family brought their son, perhaps aged 3, to this one and even he laughed at several funny slapstick sort of moments. This kid's laughter caused others like us around him to laugh even more.As a note about kids; this movie definitely earned its R rating. I suppose a 3 year old isn't badly affected by this movie because all the R stuff went over his head, but if you are offended by sex jokes or situations, avoid this one at all costs. Both my wife and I were surprised at how much one can get into an R rating. We thought we'd stumbled into some other rating but then again, I don't know what else their is either.Mostly what's fun about this movie is that it has a good spirit. It's not mean although some of the situations the 'boys' get themselves into can feel pretty tense. If you'll enjoy this movie depends if you have a sense of the absurd as well as if you feel comfortable with openly sexual situations. If you say ""No"" to either of those, you just can't enjoy this thoroughly modern absurdest comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
By far the year's best film so far,"Yes, a raunchy comedy revolving around guys who have had a few too many is the year's best film so far. It's not only the gallons of laughs that Mike Tyson and Zach Galifianakis are only the start of, it's that this is a great mystery film. The mystery revolves around Doug (Justin Bartha), a man who's about to get married. He goes to Vegas with his friends Phil (Bradley Cooper), and Stu (Ed Helms), and his bride-to-be's brother Alan (Zach Galifianakis). Their perfect night in Vegas turns into a hangover for the ages. They've lost Doug, and can not remember a thing from the night before. They must go out to find Doug. The night before involves a tiger, a chicken, a baby, a stripper named Jade (Heather Graham), who Stu accidentally marries, and Mike Tyson. The real joy of this movie is that we're as interested to figure out what the hell happened as much as they do. You feel like you're part of the mystery. The conclusion is nothing less than perfect. When the end credits roll, you see a bunch of pictures on a camera that show what really went down that night. It is the perfect finale to a movie that can only be described as a funnier, raunchier version of Dude, Where's My Car?",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best Comedy Ever,"You know I thought it would be hard to top the comic lineup of films that we had in 08'. Tropic Thunder, Pineapple Express, Step Brothers, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and Role Models. Last year was a good comedy year. Until 12:01 A. M. June 5th, 2009.The Hangover has got to be the funniest film I have ever seen. The characters have great development and fall wonderfully into their situation. If you haven't seen the preview here's a synopsis: Guy's go to Vegas for bachelor party, they get messed up, spend the rest of movie looking for the groom they lost the night before. Bradley Cooper was the perfect choice for the leader of the bozos about in Las Vegas. Ed Helms is perfect as the doctor with the horrible girlfriend (Also played very convincingly by Rachel Harris) and the uptight but loose at the same time attitude. ALAN is the off the wall comic relief in this equation and has some of the most memorable lines in the film. The soundtrack is also great and goes well with this film.This is truly the funniest movie in a long time that I have seen.Go Watch AS Soon AS Possible",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Exceeds Expectations!,"I have been waiting to see The Hangover ever since the first trailer came out. It looked a great comedy and I was looking forward to seeing it. Well I finally saw it last night, and I must say it was awesome. I expected it to be funny, but it exceeded even my expectations.The Hangover follows 4 friends celebrating their bachelor party in an outrageous fashion. They go to Las Vegas and are looking forward to having a good time. However when they wake up the next morning, things aren't right. One friend is missing, one has lost a tooth, they find a baby in their hotel room, and they can't remember a thing. With the wedding coming up in a few days the 3 of them must find their missing friend. They spend the movie doing that with hilarious events happening along the way.All of the actors deliver in the film. The supporting actors do a fantastic job and Mike Tyson delivers a great punchline (I'm not talking about a joke). As the days go by and the friends continue their search, crazy things happen to them, each worse then the last. With each passing scene the film gets funnier and funnier.The Hangover will make you laugh and it doesn't let up on the comedy. If you want to have a great laugh, this is the film to watch.

critique for the critical critics,"From reading the reviews on IMDb and looking at the ratings of many movies, I now understand why it always seems a bit skewed. It is because generally the critics look for certain things in a movie, such as originality, creativity, great plot....but also decency.Tasteless comedies, pointless action movies and gory thrasher flicks get destroyed by critics. People need to appreciate a movie for what it is and have an open mind. Face the fact that you cannot be a critic for all types of movies unless you generally like those types of movies. I'm not going to post a rating for GI Joe because I'm not into military movies (other than maybe Full Metal Jacket which is in a category of its own).If you don't like dirty, unrealistic, ridiculous rated R comedies then why are you posting a rating? I would guarantee the same close-minded people that gave The Hangover a rating under a 6 probably also hated Knocked Up, Grandma's Boy, Porky's, and Clerks 2.The Hangover was funny, fun-filled and wild from beginning to end. Zack Galifanakias is a stand up comedian and is well-respected. If you don't think he's funny (for some odd reason) then give your sense a humor a sanity check. Ed Helms is on The Office. He is also a real comedian and actually The Office is a funny show (at least most human beings I know think so). If you don't think he's funny neither so be it.Okay - so the movie had a similar theme as Dude Where's My Car. The concept behind The Hangover is actually a bit more interesting considering it involves a bachelor party (if you think bachelor parties are lame and offensive then I seriously doubt you would like any dirty rated R comedies), a Vegas stripper, a cardcounter, a baby caught up in the mix, a mattress on a roof, and Mike Tyson, Ken Jeong and Mike Epps having a whole lot of fun cracking jokes and whatnot. A combination of an idiot savant, alpha male and a feeble nerd is actually a lot better than Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott acting like boneheads. The comedic brilliance behind this movie runs a lot deeper than some of these straight-to-the-point, predictable, basic comedies like The Proposal, What Happens in Vegas, and I Love You Man (which I respect all 3 of these movies).If you open your mind and truly enjoy a nice, dirty comedy, you might actually think it's funnier than classics like Airplane, Blazing Saddles, 40 yr Old Virgin, and Clerks. It is up there with the best of the best. I saw it twice and laughed throughout the whole movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Wild comedy that only works once,"When I first saw this movie it was very funny but now a couple of years later as I watched it again it wasn't as good as I remembered. I think that's because of the ""mystery"" nature of the story where the plot slowly unfolds. All kind of absurd things happen when you don't expect. On the second viewing it was just an ok comedy but not that hilarious anymore.If you haven't seen it, check it out once when you're in a mood for a crazy party flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Not just a great comedy, but a Great Movie.","The Hangover centers around four friends and their attempt to understand the events of the previous night. Doug is getting married and he and two of his friends Stu, who is henpecked, and Phil, who doesn't appreciate what he has, are going to celebrate his bachelor party in Las Vegas. Alan, Doug's annoying soon to be step brother, wants to tag along and Doug says it's okay much to the chagrin of Stu and Phil. The four toast on the roof of their hotel and the next thing they know they are waking up without any idea of what happened the night before and they can't find Doug. Stu, Alan, and Phil must figure out what happened and find Doug before his wedding later that day.The plot of The Hangover is much more original and complex than most comedies. The fact that they have to figure out what happened with what they find makes for an interesting almost backward telling of the story. They and the audience are given the end result and both have to figure out what led up to it. It's also fun because you get to find out what everything means as the characters do. Another really amazing aspect of The Hangover was the amount of jokes they would cram into each scene. Whether they were funny or not every scene would just have joke after joke.All the characters are funny and interesting in their own way. Zach Galifianakis' performance as Alan is one of the best break out comedy performances I have ever seen. Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper also do great in both of their first big roles. Even the minor characters that only get a few lines manage to squeeze some comedy out of their very small roles, which is another thing that sets this apart from other comedies.I was somewhat disappointed in the ending however. I found it to be a bit predictable and a tad too perfect. Rarely will a comedy have a good ending though, so that isn't a big deal.So in short, The Hangover is not only one of the best movies of 2009, but one of the best comedies ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
As funny as advertised,This is an absolute instant comedy classic. It's easily a top 10 funny movie all time.

"Foul but fresh, ""Hangover"" is unforgettable","It's nice to thoroughly enjoy a comedy this decade without catching a single whiff of Apatow. The fact that audiences are eating up the boundary-crossing humor of ""The Hangover"" this summer and the famous producer of ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"" nor any of his cronies (Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, etc.) don't have so much as a finger print on it might be over half the reason for its praise.Starring rising leading man Bradley Cooper (""Wedding Crashers,"" ""Yes Man""), Ed Helms (""The Office"") and stand-up comic Zach Galifianakis, ""The Hangover"" doesn't boast the stylings of any comedic actors that we've already been beaten to death with by Hollywood in the last ten years and they're all extremely talented. Their characters are incredibly well-developed and free of too much stereotype, their comedic timing excellent and the concept they're thrown into so perfect you can't believe it hasn't been done before.Two days before their friend Doug's (Justin Bartha of ""National Treasure"") wedding, the aforementioned characters head out for a night in Las Vegas as do many a bachelor party. But ""The Hangover"" doesn't show their night out, instead it takes us straight to the next morning where they wake up to find strange animals in their room, one is missing a tooth and the groom-to-be is missing. And of course they don't remember a thing.Todd Phillips, director of ""Old School,"" another comedy that for its time brought us new comedians and situations keeps the timing and revealing funny moments at a healthy pace. Every time we think it doesn't get funnier or more ridiculous, it does. The writing team of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who delivered last winter's notable flop ""Four Christmases"" really hit it big here. Having character retrace their footsteps and discover their debauchery of the previous night rather than showing it gives the trend toward R-rated comedy a new set of wheels. The gags here are nothing all that foreign to us, but with an unfamiliar cast of talented actors it feels pretty new. Everything is just revitalized, given new life because the script really fits the characters.I didn't particularly like Cooper previously, but he gets more of a chance to exercise his range with a character that's not stale. Helms can truly be a foul-mouthed funny kind of guy, but his nerdy girlfriend-whipped character Stu is perfect because it forces him to hold back, therefore making the moments he explodes funnier and more believable. Galifianakis is something else. He's the new funny we've been looking for. Alan is a horribly dumb, outrageously gutsy but sweet character with a child's heart. Galifianakis plays a wide range of comedy perfectly whether needing to hold back and be dumb and cute or go all out physically.There are some gaping holes in ""The Hangover"" like the fact that they are apparently hung over but do not eat or drink the entire film. Also, only Helms' character gets a true subplot - - everyone else is just there to make us laugh. This isn't one of those comedies with heart. Instead, we learn to love the characters because they're funny and we empathize with their ingeniously funny situation quickly. Still, some of the most original comedy I've seen in years. And don't forget the best and most boundary-pushing credits sequence ever. No question now that this is the era of dirty comedy and ""The Hangover"" delivers some of its finest.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The laughter HURT in a good way,"Yes, the F word was thrown out every 5 seconds, and in my opinion, a few of the end credit pics were NOT necessary, but overall...this film might just be the funniest comedy I've ever seen.

However, for me, it went far beyond my expectations.You will laugh at lines. You will laugh at situations. You will laugh at WTF moments. As a 17 year old, I wouldn't recommend it to the younger ages, but I'd go out on a limb and say most 17+ would enjoy this movie.Basically, I'm just trying to fill up my ""10 lines"" here...but GO SEE THIS MOVIE.

If you can suspend your disbelief (and you will need to to get past the obviously unrealistic events), get past the fact that there's really not much of a plot, some stereo-typical garbage, and just enjoy the laughs you'll like this movie.

"An R-rated ""teen"" comedy that actually has some sort of heart...finally!","In recent years, Judd Appatow has become a major influence on comedy films. His R-rated films that he directs and produces are what seems to be in style, comedy movie-wise. Despite Appatow's popularity, his films all seem to have one major flaw, and that's his characters. Seth Rogen has yet to play a likable character, and never in any recent R-rated comedies, do we actually get the consistent feeling that people care for each other. The Hangover, along with being a dirty comedy, also contains likable characters, and heart. It's a refreshing addition to recent R-rated comedy films.Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) are friends going to Vegas for their friend Doug's (Justin Bartha) bachelor party. Also going along is Doug's odd soon to be brother in law, Alan (Zach Galifianakis). After a wild night, the guys have forgotten what happened the night before, and Doug is missing. They have to follow various clues to figure out how they got to where they were, where Doug is, and various other amusing plot points.It's hard to label this film. It's not really a sex-comedy, as there's not any overabundance of sex. It's not a drug comedy, because these guys aren't drug addicts, and the night before it not entirely their fault. It's more of just a comedy about 4-guys that happens to be rated R because of it's foul language and occasional nudity. It's nice to have an R rated comedy not out here to push the limits of the R-rating. Really, this is like the buddy comedy family film of rated R motion pictures.The actors are great, and have a lot of chemistry together. Zack Galifianakis as Alan is really the one who brings most of the laughs with his performance as a complete moron, who's out of touch with reality, but completely likable. These guys may be profane and goofy, but they're still normal guys...again something Seth Rogen doesn't like to perform as. He always has to be angry.There are a few problems in the film. It's got some spots that are missing laughs, and Mike Tyson is quite a bad actor, but aside from those, it's actually a well done buddy comedy and mystery. The box office has been gracious to this film, as well it should have been, and hopefully this R-rated comedy will show other producers of R-rated comedies, that comedies can still be successful even if the characters are likable (Amazing but true).My rating: *** out of ****. 100 mins.

The Hangover creatively embeds a flashback structure which creates infrequent laughs.,"""The funniest comedy of the 00s"" this is not, and I'm tired of other modern comedies referencing ""from the producers of The Hangover"" as if it's a work of art. It's watchable, with a few laughs (none from me though...nothing new there) that will appeal to the majority of viewers. A group of friends party the night away before a wedding but as they wake up with a killer hangover, they quickly realise that they had an extremely eventful time where their friend is missing. With no recollection whatsoever, they must retrace their steps which often results in absurd encounters. A tiger in a bathroom, stealing a baby, unknowingly piercing a mattress atop a rooftop statue and missing a tooth...which happens to be the most realistic outcome. Look, I'm sure we've all had terrible hangovers, but none this stupidly absurd. The lunacy of these situations is what supposedly creates the laughs, to which I give credit for the inventive use of the flashback narrative structure. But I was left feeling dumbfounded rather than joyous. Sometimes less is more, and in this case fewer silly scenarios would've made the story tighter and more cohesive as opposed to just being a montage of events. The dynamic friendship between Cooper, Helms and Galifianakis was thoroughly developed and conveyed with buoyancy. There's banter, emotion and fights, enhancing how the reckless night has affected them mentally. Acting was charismatic from everyone, except Helms who I just do not like. He is just so plain in everything and typically unfunny. The screenplay does have some quotable dialogue, often recited by many teenagers thinking it was cool to say ""paging doctor f****t"". Oh yeah, and Mike Tyson has a cameo. So if that hasn't tipped your glass then I don't know what will. Unlike most hangovers, this is rapidly entertaining with some humorous lines and committed performances but remains mostly unfunny leaving a bland beer aftertaste. What I do want to know is what they were drinking, because I'll have what they had...",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Great movie, watch it friends for more laughter.","Plot: 7-7.5, based on just the title and poster for this piece, you'd expect the movie to be about 3 drunk characters waking up the next morning dizzy and confused. Well that's exactly what you'll get and much more with it. Furthermore, with most comedy movies you start predicting what's gonna happen and often times this ruins the delivery of the joke. With hangover it is the opposite, you can't predict any scenes making the jokes more enjoyable.Execution: 8-8.5, what made hangover a masterpiece was purely the overall direction of the movie. Everything felt almost perfect, from the casting decision, the scenery, the camera work, the writing.....everything was up to standard. Although, at certain points some scenes should've been added for more context. Additionally, If the movie were to just focus a tad bit more on the relationships of certain characters.....Stu & Jade, this would be a 10.Comedy: 8-8.5, 90% of the jokes were funny on a first watch basis, the rest were slightly cringey but needed to be there to create the awkwardness amongst characters. If i were to change anything i'd probably give Alan (Zach Galifianakis) more screen time.Music: 7-7.5, was mostly in theme with scenes. The decrease in rating is because of personal preference for certain songs which would be better.Acting: 7-7.5, if you're expecting an Oscar-worthy performance from this movie turn away. As good as Hangover is, the acting is good/commendable at best.
Alan portrayed by (Zach Galifianakis) and Mr. Chow portrayed by (Ken Jeong) carried the movie when it comes to acting display. The rest of the characters merely had to put in a above average effort since they were outshined by these two.Overall: 7.5, good movie. Watch it with friends if you wanna laugh a lot more.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very Funny,"We've all been there. There have been nights where we've drank too much and can't remember everything. For Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Alan (Zach Galfianakis), this happens on the bachelor party for their friend Doug (Justin Bartha). Unfortunately, the morning after, they realize that they lost Doug.The humor in ""The Hangover"" comes from the bizarre situations that the characters find themselves in. Or more specifically, that they got themselves into the night before, and are just now remembering it. This type of humor can work, although a film that completely relies on it (like this one) runs the risk of making the material get dry and tired. Fortunately, director Todd Philips keeps things brief enough and the pace quick enough that this doesn't really become a problem.It's hard to address the acting, because the actors play very familiar types (this is the film's biggest problem). Bradley Cooper is no stranger to playing a jerk (he got his big break in ""Wedding Crashers,"" although he's more sympathetic here). Ed Helms, while not being a stranger to comedy, is not a well known name. He's the worrywart who turns into a doormat whenever his over-bearing girlfriend is mentioned. Zach Galifianakis is the black sheep of the group, who's only along because he's going to be Doug's brother-in-law. Nevertheless, the comedy works because all of the principal cast members have a sizable amount of comic aptitude.Not everything works (the movie feels underdeveloped--with a little more care, it could have been a masterpiece), but most of it does, and there are some very big laughs to be found throughout the 100 minute running time (the end credits alone are worth the price of a few admission tickets).""The Hangover"" is comedy pure and simple. Nothing is understated, and it's not quirky. It's just plain funny.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Amusing,"This is a good movie, not great, but good. The movie has an offbeat story with an interesting twist, almost like a whodunit except that here it's a ""what happened."" Although the story has its amusing moments, it is not uproariously funny. Actually, the movie worked better when showing how three fellows are following up on all kinds of strange and weird clues to figure out what happened to them. There is a lot of slap stick, reminiscent of The Three Stooges, and if you like the Three Stooges style of comedy, then this movie will make you laugh. The funniest character is the Chinese guy played by Ken Jeong whose acting is definitely over the top and is a scene stealer. The three lead characters are amusing but do not come close to generating anything approximating a real loud guffaw. The best part of the movie are the end credits, which says something about the celluloid that preceded it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Incredibly funny,"This is Incredibly funny - it is Hilarious. That is all I'm going to say. Just watch it ! What annoys me is why someone who doesn't like a film gives it a 1.

The Perfect Combination,"Hilarious storyline + Great Cast + Amazingly written=the funniest movie in recent memoryThis is not your average summer comedy. This is what i call the perfect medium of low and high comedy. With the exception to Zach Galifianakis, the cast is not full of colorful characters and hilarious antics, but rather letting the mysterious wonders that Las Vegas has to offer unfold for these gentlemen. This genuine work of art has some much of the high comedy that many of today's comedy's are missing, putting ordinary people in extraordinary situations. But also including the guilty pleasure that we all enjoy, the low comedy, especially Zach's hilarious performance and dialog. Actually, I am a firm believer that this film will be a jump start for Galifianakis's long career ahead.This won't be one that will be forgotten anytime soon.

From nowhere to Las Vegas and answered the funniest questions ever asked,"The Vegas comedy done right. Mostly because ""The Hangover"" is actually funny. Very funny. As the guys start out on their bachelor party trip to Las Vegas we quickly get a sense of how funny this will be because of the sense of humour the characters have. Phil (Bradley Cooper) is completely unscrupulous, but that's okay he's only a school teacher. Alan (Zach Galifianakis) thinks the prospect of killing someone or being killed is absolutely hilarious.Their tame night becomes morning and questions need to be answered. In order of increasing severity: Whose baby is in the mini-fridge? Why is there a tiger in the bathroom? Will Alan put his pants on? And where is Doug? Finding Doug will answer the other questions but it will also take all day and all night and raise more questions that need answering.This works because we want to find the answers. The questions which we start with are just so outrageous, original and intriguing that we know they will be funny. Along the way we also want to find Doug. He's the sane and normal one so surely our world will be righted once we find him.""The Hangover"" achieved greatness because people weren't expecting it. Hollywood didn't produce it, so to the masses, it came out of nowhere. It made Bradley Cooper a movie star, Zach Galifianakis a fearless comedian and gave Ed Helms the respect he deserved. I'm hoping Part II will do the same for Justin Bartha, but it's hard to come out of nowhere after Hollywood has hyped it for two years.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Original and absurdist,"Highly original mix of raunchy comedic, snappy dialogue and absurdist situations. The Hangover is the comedy you always wondered why Hollywood doesn't make. The movie manages to combine the smarts and observation of ""Juno"" with the absurdist situations of Marx brothers movies and frames all of it in an R-rated Las Vegas romp. The non-linear narrative structure makes for a re-watchable film that is destined to be a cultural touchstone along the lines of ""Stripes"", ""Better Off Dead"" and the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" series. Best comedy since ""Tropic Thunder"" although that was a better and more substantial film.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Summary: A must see film that will have the entire family laughing.,"Todd Phillips (Director) has done a good job with ""The Hangover"" just as he has in a previous movie ""Old School"". Phillips previous movie pertaining to ""Old School"" is filled with good actors/actress, dialogue, and comedy. Both of Phillips movies ""Old School"" and ""The Hangover"" are full with comedy and action that will have tears coming out and on your knees. Phillips along with writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore have set out to do what they planned to delivery. Throughout this movie you will see the different in low-key lighting/high-key lighting, motifs, and angles (low/high) and the music as scenes are being transiting. The Hangover was filmed in Las Vegas, Nevada. Doug Billing is about to marry one of his friend's Alan Garner sister Tracy Garner in two days. Doug and Alan along with two of their other buddies, Phil Wenneck and Stu Price are off to Las Vegas for a couple of days for some male bonding. Phil, a high school teacher and married, tends to acts childish when with his pals. Stu, a dentist has a girlfriend by the name of Melissa. She's very controlling and is very much against Stu going on this male bonding trip. One day he hopes to eventually marry Melissa. However, Alan seems to be on another level with the social graces of the western world. The next day after arriving in Las Vegas, they all wake up with the worst ""Hangover"". The suite is in stumbles and things are where they shouldn't be and missing. They can't remember anything that happens within the last 12 plus hours. One element for sure is that Doug is missing. Therefore, they are running out of time before they are due to be back in Los Angeles. If not back than they will have to do some explaining to Tracy what they haven't returned. In one scene you will see where all four of them are on the roof top in Las Vegas toasting to Doug last night as a single man. The scene is relevant to the theme because it takes place in Vegas and the scenery is great. Just imaging the lighting along with the setting it's great. The other technique that was used in this movie, angles. The scene was when Phil and Stu were outside looking in the truck of the car and there goes that great shot of the sky and Mandalay Bay hotel. It's funny to watch men to exploit their insecurities. The Hangover was a smash for 2009. I hope to see more of Doug, Alan, Phil and Stu in upcoming movies because they were great. Phillips when will we see ""The Hangover II""?",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Party. . . after the Party,"Like apple pie and STDs, raunchy sex comedies are common, and ""The Hangover"", a film helmed by Todd Phillips (""Old School"", ""Road Trip"", ""Starsky and Hutch: The Movie""), belongs in the genre, yet it has a straight story to make the whole film likable and competent, even to some haters, who dislike T&A and profanity.Unethical schoolteacher Phil (Brad Cooper of ""Wedding Crashers"", ""Valentine's Day"" and ""A-Team: The Movie""), henpecked dentist Stu (Ed Helms of ""The Office"", US version) and bizarre rich man-kid Alan (Zach Galifianakis of ""Bored to Death"" and Phillips's upcoming ""Due Date"") decide to give their bud Doug (Justin Bartha of the National Treasure films) a wild bachelor party in Las Vegas, where gambling, alcohol and loose women are endless, before marrying Alan's level-headed sis, Tracy (Sacha Barrese).However, Alan sneaks some ""Good Morning, Cinderella"" (aka the date rape drug) into the boy's initial party drinks, and the three endure the title, let along missing the groom!To find Doug, the trio has to retrace their steps, involving Stu's missing tooth, a stolen police car, a baby, the baby's stripper/escort mom (sweet Heather Graham of ""Boogie Nights""), a foul-mouthed mobster (Ken Jeong of ""Knocked Up""), $80,000, Mike Tyson's tiger and Mike Tyson himself. Adults, these daysPhillips expertly takes the solid script penned by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"", ""Four Christmases"") and reinforces it, making sure it doesn't go off the tracks like some of the works of Judd Apatow, yet the film can be recognized as an unofficial sequel of ""Superbad"", due to the similarities of the films' heroes.The cast works so damn well, it wouldn't be any surprise if they had real war stories of indecent revelry. Cooper and Helms shine as man-children on different levels; the former feeling trapped by his job and family, the latter being pussy-whipped by his shrewish girlfriend (Rachael Harris). Due to their predicament, they man up. Galifianakis's the resident goof, making the late John Belushi look sane while Graham spunky reps healthy womanhood, giving relief to Helms, my favorite of the three.There are nice bits by Jeffrey Tambor (""Arrested Development"") as Alan's dad and Mike Epps (""Next Day Air"") as a drug dealer. I could do without the R-rated wedding singer, who's no Barry White in the art of seduction. Phillips has a fun cameo.

Big surprise,"Definitely did not expect this to be anywhere near as good as it was. The drunk buddies doing dumb stuff format is a good formula for comedy, but it has been overused. However, this movie refreshes the premise with some clever humor and innovative situations.The three groomsmen who take their engaged friend on a wild bachelor party adventure to Vegas at first appear run of the mill stereotypes of the boozer-buddies genre. The dumb fat guy motif makes you think, ""Here we go again,"" but they balance routine gags like that with a story that makes some roller coaster twists that usually work. As things unfold as to what actually went on during their ""black-out,"" the plot gains more and more steam. The story is constructed well, showing believable and likable characters. In other films of this type, too often the heroes are made out to be obnoxious jerks, which ruins the humor. They really are concerned for the safety of their missing friend, for example.Minor flaws: Tyson isn't funny, even when he mocks himself. The Asian stereotype seemed thrown in as if they felt they were obliged to do it for whatever reason. It didn't add anything to the comedy, which was already great in this film.Hangover is probably the best comedy of this type since Animal House.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Silly, but genuinely funny","Writing a comedy is surprisingly difficult; in a way, it's easier to know why something is tragic or worrisome, but what makes a movie funny is generally regarded as some kind of mystery. I believe that a valid approach is to construct a movie with a Chinese-box structure.At the first level is the overall premise of the movie: in this case, three friends wake up after a particularly irresponsible bachelor party and discover that they've lost the groom. At the second level are the jokes which set up a punchline for later, like the reference to ""Rain Man"". At the third level are the funny dialogues and at the fourth level we find one-liners.In order to make a comedy work, all those four aspects should be well-made and that's the case with ""The Hangover"". Simpler jokes make for immediate laughs, while references to previous events in the movie give a sense of overall coherence and satisfaction. Furthermore, the question of ""What ever happened during that night?"" adds some mild mystery to the flick. To be fair, not all the jokes work and some come across as needlessly vulgar, but overall there are more hits than misses.In conclusion, this is a silly and somewhat shallow film which refuses to make any statement, but if it manages to be entertaining for an hour and forty minutes, it did its job.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Don't Believe The Hype......,"Hey....I'm a guy who loves all types of humor, both highbrow (most Woody Allen films) and low (Billy Madison, Bachelor Party). As an example of a film in the lowbrow category, The Hangover disappoints......tremendously. There is no doubt, however, that the context of extreme hype this movie generated added to my disappointment.After seeing Bradley Cooper in this movie and in other roles, I now conclude that he is an actor of limited range, delivering forgettable performances, and who adds absolutely no value to any film. In contrast, Ed Helms appears to be an actor perfect for a comedic role. I will definitely seek out his future performances (Hangover 2 the exception). The director, Todd Philips, produced two other forgettable movies in the same buddy format as Hangover: Road Trip and Old School. Both are derivative, unfunny films. Look for him to churn out more junk in the same mold.Believe me I love to allow the juvenile in me to enjoy a crazy buddy movie. I just don't get this film. If you enjoy crazy movies that Hangover attempts to emulate watch Clerks, Billy Madison, Little Nicky, or even Dodge Ball.If you to continue to have a desire to see this movie wait for its appearance on a non-premium cable channel.Nuff Said",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Not what it could have been,"The hype surrounding this film was enough for me to give it a watch, and while the movie itself was decent and funny, the best moments of comedy come not from the film itself, but from the stills of what happened during the wild night in Vegas.Now I won't say the film is a total let down, some of the scenarios are quite funny and watching the group trying to put the events of the night back together and seeing their escapades unfold makes for some good short laughs or quick smiles, but so much more could have been achieved if the film went into a different direction. The simple plot device of a bachelor party weekend in Vegas can provide so much fodder to work with, and I am sure that a great writer could have incorporated numerous scenarios into place to make a great flick, even coupling the events of the night with the escapades of the day after, but instead we are kind of left sifting through the unknown aftermath, and while it may come off as funny a lot of jokes don't work like they should because you don't know what led them to that particular point.It is still an enjoyable watch, but it does leave a lot to be desired.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
delivers more than enough laughs by keeping the comic tension tight all the way through,"The Hangover takes a standard premise and turns it into a hilarious comedy that combines raunchy humor with ""what's going to be next"" mystery. After the crazy bachelor party, the three guys can't remember virtually anything about what actually has happened and where the groom can be. This simple concept appears to be very productive and the team of screenwriters squeezes all the juice out of it providing plenty of laugh-out-loud scenes. The humor not only stems from frequently absurd situations the guys come across, but also their mostly hilarious interactions. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis make for a great comedy trio playing characters of totally different personalities. Phil (Cooper) is a party animal; Stu (Helms) is a pragmatist; and Alan (Galifianakis) seems to live in his own bizarre world. They all bring different elements to the film. Galifianakis is especially hilarious delivering totally unhinged, yet perfectly likable performance.

Take a coffee after you see this...,"The Hangover is about four guys who go to Vegas for a bachelor party. In all recent comedy fashion and just what you would expect from the title, these guys wake up, after having spent a night of being blown out of their minds in Vegas. Unfortunately, one of the guys is missing and they start out on a terribly misguided adventure to find out where he is.So in other words, The Hangover follows the formula of Dude Where's My Car, with comedy that is overall more shocking and less about stupid comedy and more about shock comedy. If you can let yourself go for a little while, and try not to think about the thousands of moral implications brought on by the storyline, then you're liable to enjoy some good dirty fun, and one of the funniest comedy movies this century.Unfortunately, there are some down sides. This movie really is ONLY about the misadventures brought about by their actions from the night before, nothing deep or meaningful here. While you do have to let yourself go every once in a while, it's a shame the movie didn't take more of a shot at the corrupt morals it takes to ruin your life in Vegas, and simply promotes Sin City's decadence of stupid young twenty something lifestyle being played out by mid thirty aged actors.That being said, the actors do a great job. The shining role here is played by Zach Galifianakis, as the brother of the bride, and his lines of really screwed up shock comedy, rather than every other actor in the movie. Ultimately the second best actor is the guy you see the least of, the groom.The Hangover is good for some nice, not so clean, fun. Basically it is what it sells, and that is what every other after-the-party comedy sells, and that's decadence in a lifestyle that really isn't that great.

funny as hell,"The thing that made this movie so good is that nobody saw it coming, these three guys who seemed to be lost in a world of adulthood get stuck with a baby and a missing Groom and a wedding that they need to get too, while they have no idea of what happened the night before. The movie delivers a shocker in the acting area and the script was funny to the core, that you don't feel you have seen this movie till you watch it a second time.The Hangover was a big financial success and it helped propel the careers of the three lead actors, making more than 12 times its production cost, the studio just had to make a part II, which was not as good as this initial one, as it featured same people doing practically the same thing that led to what happened in the first hangover.The movie plot was inspired by a real life event that happened to Tripp Vinson (a movie producer); Tripp had gone missing from his own Las Vegas bachelor party, blacking out and waking up in a strip club. Jon Lucas and Scott Moore took the tale and drafted a script which they sold to Warner Bros. for over $2 million. The movie director Todd Phillips, went ahead to add additional elements to the script to put in more life into it and extra adventures, he added such like Mike Tyson and his tiger, the baby, and the police cruiser.The movie plot is about Vegas gone wrong; Doug (Justin Bartha) and Tracy (Sasha Barrese) are about to get married so Doug's two best friends Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) decided to take him for a bachelor party in Vegas tagging along was Tracy's brother Alan (Zach Galifianakis).While in Vegas, the four had a night out, and then the worst thing happened they woke up the next day knowing they had the time of their lives but can't remember what happened. To make it worse, there is a Tiger in the bathroom, the groom Doug is missing and they are with a baby whom they know not where he came from.The movie was shot in like two weeks and it is a must watch to all movie lovers that is for sure, there is plan to make a third Hangover movie, the part II was released in 2011 it was not as critically accepted as the first, but the box office sales was just as impressive so with that on their side the studio will be taking a chance with a part three.

Waste of a creative story,"This movie is hard to evaluate. It has some very good points, but it is not as great as it might sound. It's just good. The story is creative, with weird and curious mysteries to be unveiled. Although not at a slow pace, the film goes at a slower pace than it should, considering the various things happening. Most mysteries are explained, but the things done by the characters are not believable. Most things that are supposed to be funny are just plain dummy. So, in the end, this is a pretty average work. It's well produced, as expected from a Hollywood movie. An average movie with a creative story. All I can say is that they wasted a good opportunity to make a great movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious,"After Todd Phillips rather disappointing debut in this genre of low-brow comedy, 2003's 'Old School' not many people would be expecting a lot from 'The Hangover'. How refreshing therefore that despite taking a tried and tested formula, 'The Hangover' manages to be consistently funny and emerges as a strong contender for the funniest film of the last few years.Focusing upon husband to be Doug (Justin Bartha) the film begins with his three best friends; Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Phil (Bradley Cooper)waking up in Vegas the morning after their friends stag night, only to find there mate has gone missing. What adds particular kudos to Phillip's film is that unlike most films in this genre we are spared the pre-amble of the drunken night itself and instead have no further clue than the characters themselves, only piecing together the previous nights evidence as we go along. Finding a baby in the closet of there hotel room, Mike Tyson's tiger in the bathroom and one of the main characters missing a front tooth are just some of the bizarre clues we are given at the beginning.Another problem with most films in this genre is you see the sixty second trailer, laugh hysterically, only to go and watch the film to find all the funny bits were within the trailer. Not so with 'The Hangover', with the laughs coming thick and fast; from Mike Tyson's cameo to the guys finding a naked Asian man in the trunk of there car, the film really does have it all! If I had to pick one thing that I think makes the film the success it is however, it would be the chemistry between the main leads. You really do care about the situations they find themselves in and that the ending is a happy one. You have Phil the alpha-male, Stu the neurotic nerd who gets everything wrong and the hilariously weird, bearded Alan. It is arguably Galifianakis role as him that his the star role, watch out for the hysterical moment when Mike Tyson knocks him out singing along to Phil Collins. In conclusion this film is hilarious and also features one of the best credit sequences ever when the guys find a camera after Doug's wedding that explains everything unanswered up to that point.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Over the top,"Some parts were funny. I found myself cracking up but I think it could have been done a lot better. A little far-fetched and silly at times. The acting was alright. I don't think it flowed well and the editing left much to be desired. The chicken in the room was funny but the whole thing with Mike Tyson was over-the-top. He's not funny nor that whole segment. The Chinese gang angle was funny. The climax of the movie was terrible. That should have been thought out more. But then again, I'm just a reviewer and making movies is hard and it's a tough business. Overall, I enjoyed it but I think it could have been thought out a little better. It had the potential to be a classic but fell short. Maybe the producers were pressed for time.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Don't believe the hype; it stunk ... I mean REALLY stunk,"As a 32 year old all American white male, I should have thoroughly enjoyed this movie. But not only did I not, I really really hated it. A low budget cast of unknown, utterly uninteresting, and completely unlikeable characters. A juvenile, mindless, and just plain stupid storyline that apparently tried to put a slapstick comic spin on 1998's excellent ""Very Bad Things"". You know the story; a group guys go to Las Vegas for a bachelor party that turns into nightmare. But this time the morons that made this movie threw in a gross fat guy, a tiger, and an annoying Chinese bad guy. Oh, and I can't forget a barely recognizable and very out of shape Mike Tyson. The only think that would have redeemed this mess would have been if they all did a Thelma and Louise and drove off a cliff, or in this case the Hoover Dam.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Modern Raunch at its Best,"Ever since Wedding Crashers, there seems to be a winning Hollywood formula for comedies: include as much shock value/gross out humor as possible, and intermittently sprinkle in some scenes that allow actors to deliver equally shocking (and, of course, witty) dialogue that doesn't give the audience much chance to catch its breath for the duration of two hours. The Hangover sticks to this formula in many ways, but it also surpasses it on several levels. The random, seemingly haphazard nature of the events which occur in The Hangover are just enough to separate the film as a worthwhile entry into the ever- expanding catalogue of R-rated comedies.If you've seen the trailers for The Hangover, you're already familiar with the plot. Doug Billings is getting married, and his buddies Phil and Stu have decided to treat him to a pre-wedding weekend bash in Las Vegas. Also along for the ride is Doug's soon to be brother-in-law, Alan (more about the brilliant performance of Zach Galifianakis later). Once there, the group quickly heads out for a night on the town. When they awaken the next morning, their $4200 per night villa is completely demolished, and there's a tiger in the bathroom. Strangely, they have absolutely no memory of the previous evening's occurrences. They soon discover that Doug is missing, and realize that in order to find him–and ensure that he's home in time for his own wedding–they have to play ""detective"" and figure out exactly what happened.This is one of the few movies I've seen that actually benefits from a plot that feels cobbled together. It literally seems as if the writers decided that they needed: A) a baby in a cabinet, B) Mike Tyson singing, C) a stolen police car, D) a scene with the main players getting shot with a taser. All of this serves to highlight the eccentric nature of The Hangover and its characters, especially that of Alan Garner. Honestly, everyone else in the movie pales in comparison to Alan and his antics, be it his decision to use Carlos the baby as a puppet; his assumption that wearing white pants, a tee shirt, and satchel out onto the casino floor is perfectly acceptable; or his questioning the clerk at the front desk of Caesar's Palace about whether or not the actual Caesar lives there. Galifianakas delivers each and every one of his lines with an uncanny amount of deadpan wit that you almost feel sorry for everyone else–essentially, they're all playing the ""straight man"" to his character.To avoid revealing too much about the developments in The Hangover, suffice it to say that there's no way they would've ever gotten out of Vegas given the stunts they pull. The movie is aware of its own ridiculousness, which is perhaps just as well, but I would've liked to have seen these guys really sweat things out and get their just desserts. With the exception of Alan, they all throw a few temper tantrums, but we all know how things will conclude–and, in the end, things do play out exactly as you'd expect them too, making this not quite as risky as, say, another ridiculous, self-aware comedy: Pineapple Express.So, all of that taken into consideration, what's the verdict on The Hangover? It's funny–at times downright hilarious. In many ways, we've seen it all before, but the quirky nature of Alan–and the seemingly random plot developments–make it stand out. If you're looking for a carefree night at the movies, The Hangover is a sure bet.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Best Comedy since Animal House,"I almost gave this movie a 10. But comedies are hard to do, and there are some slight imperfections. The characters were not really well defined before the fun starts. It might have been a little more interesting if we'd known more about the groom and the best man, who I guess was a bad teacher who doesn't like kids? Not sure. Anyway... that's not what this movie is about. In short, I loved this movie. My wife and I laughed our heads off. It has a great ear for the way people talk, and the one-liners fit well into the story and connect with the personalities of the characters. I love the way it starts the morning AFTER (hence the title) and the characters have to piece back together what happened. I guarantee this- you have never before been so compelled to stay seated for the closing credits as you will be for this movie- I wont say why. I laughed HARD from start to finish, and VERY strongly recommend this comedy to anybody who has just once understood what it was like to party JUST a little bit too hard....",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Tick box American comedy,"It's well written, the acting is spot on, the premise is good. The night after is somewhat familiar even, though minus the baby and tiger. I guess my problem with the film is something it can't help - being so totally American! American humour in these kinds of comedies is always pretty extreme, usually sexual in some way and a bit gross out. And most of the international audience love that, and that's cool! It's probably a boys film more than a ladies, not that ladies won't be amused but boys will relate to the kinda awkward friendship circle, the hazing, the humour. Unless you're a stripper or a psycho bunny boiler gf there's not many people for ladies to relate to, but hell, it's a film. I respect the writing and the reception plus it's popularity just not my kinda thing, I prefer more quirky, dry humour, less obvious, but I knew that going in!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Seriously, people think this is funny?","Maybe it was over-hyped, maybe it just sucked, but this movie is overrated. I am not a movie snob, but this movie was not very funny. There was not one scene that made me belly laugh. Bradley Cooper always seems to play the a-hole and his eyes are annoyingly crooked. Zach G is so much better on Bored to Death. Hated the way they used the baby. Anyway, good concept with weak writing. If you want a mindless comedy Old School is much better, but as far as this year, Funny People had more depth and way more laughs. Don't believe the hype! See it just to tell people how dumb it was.

Doesn't match the hype,"The Hangover is one of those movies which doesn't live up to the standards suggested by all the breathless hype. It's rather overrated, most definitely not one of the funniest movies ever made as so many of its ardent fans would suggest it to be. It's an OK movie, no more, no less. It has a smart, interesting setup but the setup proves to be better than the execution. You get the sense a lot of truly hilarious things happened over the time frame of the story. But we never actually see those things. We missed the debauchery and saw only the aftermath. It was an interesting premise, having the characters try to piece together what happened during the night of madness they can't remember. But it feels like we missed the good stuff. And what we're left with isn't enough to compensate. It's a movie which has its moments but what should have been the best moments are pretty clearly the moments we never see.The story surrounds a wild, crazy bachelor party. Doug is the groom, his wedding a mere two days away when he, his two best friends and his bride-to-be's rather strange brother head to Vegas. Note to future grooms: going to Vegas two days before your wedding...bad idea. The movie opens on the morning of the wedding with one of the friends calling the bride to deliver the bad news. They can't find Doug. Flash back a couple of days and we see the gang of four preparing for their excursion. We see the drive from California to Vegas, their arrival in Sin City and a toast to a night they'll never forget. And then it's the next morning. And all hell has broken loose. And Doug is gone. And none of the other three can remember a thing. And there's a tiger in the bathroom.There's the tiger. And a chicken, a police car and a mattress impaled on a statue. There's a baby. And a stripper, a naked Asian man and a former heavyweight champion of the world. How do all these things tie together? What the heck happened last night? And where is Doug? Our gang, now down to three, begins a seemingly futile attempt to make sense of the madness. As they try to piece together the puzzle we're treated to some laughs. But not nearly as many laughs as this movie's reputation would suggest. The movie just is not consistently funny enough, it's very hit and miss. And while the setup sounds like it makes room for all kinds of outrageous stuff the movie actually ends up being much more tame than you would think. The fact that the three main characters are as a group rather bland doesn't help. The characters of Phil and Stu, played by Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms respectively, are pretty much straight men, there to play off the really funny characters. And that's where the bride's brother Alan, played by Zach Galifianakis, comes in. He's clearly meant to be the most memorable character, the wacky, strange, outlandish funnyman. But while he's clearly funnier than the other two the character doesn't make as much of an impression as he really needs to for the movie to be as riotously funny as it promised to be. Supporting players, on the screen for only a few minutes here and there, really outshine the three central characters. And that's a problem. The Hangover is the story of one wild night. But it's one wild night which the audience missed out on. Much of the funniest stuff the film has to offer doesn't come until the closing credits have begun to roll. And by then it's much too late. Not a bad movie. But one which has a reputation which far exceeds its actual quality.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A memorable comedy of the late 2000s, but the jokes fall flat after repeat viewings","Bradley Cooper was so good looking in The Hangover. Mr. Chow was a funny antagonist, lots of memorable one-liners from his character. The premise makes for a lot of funny situations. The only great film out of The Hangover trilogy, which imo there should've never been sequels. The Hangover is funniest and original left as a standalone film, but after repeat viewings does hold up much less than endlessly humorous comedies like Dumb and Dumber (1994), Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), Step Brothers (2008), or even Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (2004), because the jokes and gags feel flat once you've heard them once and don't hold up as much after watching this film with repeat viewings. Also, the unnecessary singing from Stu is annoying and should've been left out of the film's final cut.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Blame it on the alcohol,"Todd Phillips, the writer/director of Road Trip, Old School, and Starsky & Hutch, brings us another rowdy trip through manhood with The Hangover. We follow Doug (Justin Bartha), his best friends Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms), as well as Alan (Zach Galifianakis), Doug's future brother in-law, who plan on making Doug's bachelor party one to remember. It's certainly memorable, but not the night itself.The morning after Phil, Stu, and Alan find themselves back in their hotel suite with very little clothing, a chicken, a baby, a missing tooth, and no Doug. Oh, and their is a tiger in the bathroom. The three set out in search for the missing groom who has a day to be back in L.A. in less than two days for his wedding. They take the baby, shake off their hangovers, and hit the strip looking for clues that lead them to the hospital, a wedding chapel, and Mike Tyson's house.The story is as ridiculous as it sounds, but I was still completely engrossed in what was going on. I couldn't believe how messed up their night was, yet I was completely focused on what would happen next. It's the kind of film where from the start you just accept that crazy things are going to happen and you just enjoy the ride.The three leads, Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis could not have been better choices. Cooper has the looks and charisma to handle his ""too cool"" character. Helms, more commonly known as Andy Bernard on NBC's ""The Office"", is perfect as the nice guy with a mean streak (and missing tooth). Galifianakis could not have made me laugh any more than I did. His looks alone let you know you can't take him seriously. He is pudgy, childish, and completely engrossed in his character.Unlike some filmmakers who make similar films, Phillips has not fallen off his game. He didn't get lazy and go through the motions. Each scene, each line, and each set up follow through in their delivery and add to the flow of the film. There were times when the action might get a little too serious, but he brings us back from reality and throws a one liner or situation you can't help but laugh at. It's so enjoyable.I really didn't know what to expect coming into this film and I sure am pleased with the results. I didn't anticipate liking The Hangover as much as I did and it is probably going to be one of the best films I will see this summer. If you are of age and are in need of a good laugh, go see this. I take that back. If you are of age go see it anyways. It's worth the price of admission and then some.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What Can I Say,"This movie is just funny beyond belief and wait for it, it actually has a decent script to add on to it (We're calling it a movie at the request of Mr. Todd Phillips). Now what made this film great wasn't the scenarios that the Wolf Pack got themselves into, even though they were hilarious, but it was the dialogue that lead us into, through, and out of Vegas. The dialogue was so creative and in the end was hilarious and is almost instantly quotable (at least it was back when it came out in 09). With that and a cast that basically made everyone rich particularly Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis, everything worked out. Much like every great movie that is marketable, it became the victim of a less then worthy sequel that wasn't written by Phillips and in the end will keep this film from being remembered as one of the best comedies of all time. Praying that this last sentence will be wrong but only time will tell.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best of the decade,"There are so many different direction I could go here so here I go....I remember seeing a billboard for this movie about a month before it came out and I thought FAIL. Now on Friday of opening weekend, I just blew everything off and figured what the hell. The theater was packed which surprised me but it was easily one of the rare gems that comes out during the year. Most movies are overly hyped and consequently never live up to expectations but this movie hit on every cylinder. It's one of those movies that magically finds it's way into o my DVD almost on a weekly basis. The script was hilarious, it was well shot, but I have to give most of the credit to the actors. The comedic timing enhanced the hilarity of the storyline ten fold.I knew of Bradley Cooper from Wedding Crashers and he played a very similar role here. He's the cool, jocky guy...likable even though he's a bit of a jerk. He did a great job but the star of them all was obviously Zack. The guy steals every single scene.

The funniest part of the entire film was when the credits rolled. I don't mean that as an insult. That part really was funny.

A surprisingly enjoyable modern comedy,"When Todd Phillips announced the viewing of his newest movie ""The Hangover"" my first instinct was to reject it immediately, because my track record with this director hasn't exactly been the best. Don't get me wrong, Todd has given us some exceptional stuff over the years. ""Road Trip"" was a bit dodgy, but overall a funny movie, Old School wasn't too bad either, it did have it's moments of enjoyment. But I think the moment where Phillips really lost my respect was with his 2006 film ""School for Scoundrels"", I can't even begin to describe what a bad movie that was.Anyway, my mind was set. I wasn't going to set myself up for disappointment again. However my friends would not give up until they got me to sit down and watch this movie. At one point, I believe they even threaten to tie me to a chair and tape my eyelids to my head and make me watch it. Course I knew they were bluffing, but I wasn't going to take the risk. So that same weekend I finally I gave in and decided to buy a ticket for ""The Hangover"", and with great surprise I came out of the cinema cracking myself with laughter. It's time's like this I'm glad that my friends are dangerously obsessive.The Hangover is a huge come back by Todd Phillips. It's a breath of fresh air that outwits most of the modern comedies you see now a days. The title makes it pretty obvious that it's about a group of blokes that have one hell of a night and as a result suffer from hell of a hangover, with one of its main symptoms being memory loss. After waking up in a trashed apartment with one guy missing, the three friends make their way to the streets of Las Vegas making several stops and gradually putting together the pieces of the puzzle that will hopefully solve the mystery of what happened at the bachelor party as well as mark the location of the soon to be married groom.A great thing about this movie is that you don't ever know what's going to happen. These guys just go from place to place with no idea of what lies ahead, and that in itself leaves for a very funny effect. Phillip's is also very careful to make sure that he doesn't expose too much information about what happened that night, the supporting cast only gives a limited bit of info to three main characters, so that way, it doesn't ruin the ending for the audience, as well as maintain the hilarious effect of not being able to determine what kind of unexpected occurrence will take place.Apart from it being genuinely funny, The Hangover also succeeds in delivering an equal balance of character and crudity. Although they appear somewhat stereotypical, Stu, Phil and Alan are all consistently amusing figures. The chemistry between them is convincing, effectively funny, and very well portrayed by Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis.With a clever script, efficient direction, and hilarious auto-play between characters, ""The Hangover"" makes for an overall considerably funny movie about the modern concept of road trip to Las Vegas.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the best comedies of the 2000's,"Many people over the years have told me to watch a movie called ""The Hangover"". When I saw the poster for the first time in 2009 I thought it looked kind of dumb and didn't really pay attention to it. Which is a damn shame!I really enjoyed this movie. It has some very good comedy and the story itself is very interesting. I was laughing all the way from beginning to end.Lets start with the characters. The three main leads are great. Each one of them was completely different and hilarious. You get that cozy feeling of belonging to the group that you get when watching TV sitcoms.The things that happen are way over the top, but in a good way. I never expected all of those things to happen. The story is also very interesting, you want to know what happened as much as the characters in the film. It is actually a very clever idea for a comedy.I would also like to praise the very good soundtrack and camera work, that reveals things to us in such a good way. The script is pretty great too, I loved how little exposition there was and we still understood a lot of things.In the end, The Hangover is just one of those movies that will keep you entertained throughout the whole run-time and you will really remember.Don't watch the second and third one though, those really suck.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
