As wonderful as the book!,"""The Green Mile"" is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times.  I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen.  Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King's ""Shawshank Redemption"" to the screen.  He does the same high quality work with ""The Green Mile"".  The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway.  The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison.  His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book.  The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that.  I can't understand the complaints.  The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long.  The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing.  Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes. ""The Green Mile"" will haunt you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Film was invented for creations like this.,"The Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best. The depth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering excellent performances. There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. He brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.The Green Mile should bring you joy, laughter, and if you are like most in the theater this night, tears.BRAVO!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Do not live your entire life without seeing this film!!!,"GREATEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN. i remember seeing it when it first came out when i was 12 years old. now i just finished watching it and have gone through practically a whole box of tissues...that pure, love and honesty was portrayed so exquisitely well by Michael Clarke Duncan... it made me want to tear my hair out. If there is anything in this world which reminds me of true human love and compassion, it is this film. If you ever give up hope on humanity and the destruction which our disgusting race has brought to this world, watch ""The Green Mile"" Hopefully it will change your outlook a little bit like it just has mine.11/10 SHOULD HAVE WON ALL THE AWARDS AVAILABLE THE YEAR OF IT'S RELEASE.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Rest in Peace Michael Clarke Duncan,"There's a reason why this Oscar winning tour de force is #67 ranked of all films on IMDb, despite the fact that it's 3 hours long and has some truly grisly scenes (not for the squeamish, children, or a first date.)It's chock full of outstanding performances, not only from Hanks, but also from the many supporting characters, all who are rich and full. It will seem slow to the impatient, but will be richly rewarding for those with the stamina to make it to the end.It will certainly get you thinking about capital punishment and perhaps different shades/degrees of evil. It is either a deeply moving spiritual tale or a wonderfully creepy journey down the rabbit hole of Stephen King's mind; take your pick. Either way, I put it right up there on my desert island list with the likes of Shawshank Redemption. It is definitely required watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"True to the book, which is odd for a movie.","Having seen the movie, The Green Mile, and read the novel of the same  name by Stephen King, I am glad to say that the movie stays true to the  book, which in itself is a great read.  I read the book in one setting about a year ago, and after seeing the  movie, I didn't see one scene from the book, or one plot point, left  out. There were a few minor changes from the book but which in no way  detract from either work.  As far as performances, I can imagine many people pointing to Michael  Duncan as John Coffey or Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb as the best  performances of the movie, and they are good, but I would hope that  Michael Jeter would receive recognition for portraying Eduard  Delacroix. He plays Delacroix exactly as I pictured him when I read the  book.  I can very well see why King himself said this is his favorite of the  movies adapted from his novels. It is the only one played out as he had  written it.  I wouldn't compare this movie or the book to (Rita Hayworth and) The  Shawshank Redemption because that would be unfair to both. They are  both great, but are both different. The Green Mile isn't a movie about  hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie  about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects.  But like The Shawshank Redemption, I give The Green Mile 4 out of 4  stars. Great story, great cast, great look.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
A rare gem of casting and direction.,"Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at ""the mile"" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is coloured by this.  Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan.It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camerawork is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation.All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. Five out of five.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
""" I knows you think  I's a powerful man, but  the  darkness  scares me boss ""","The world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner of men are housed. Because these men are said to have committed a crime, the places are manifest and most men serving there, have earned their stay. However, as history has shown, there are innocent men incarcerated as well. Occasionally, one of these innocents are not only imprisoned, but are further remembered because their life becomes legend. In this case, the realization is nothing short of incredible as the new prisoner is a natural empath. Steven King the prolific American horror writer, chronicles this unusual story in a Louisanna prison where one Joe Coffee, (Michael Clarke Duncan) a huge, nay, enormous Black man, having been convicted of murder, is sentenced to be executed, by electrocution. Tom Hanks( And Dabbs Greer) plays Paul Edgecomb, an aging Prison Guard, who recalls his years in the state prison. Working on 'Death Row' or "" The Green Mile "", Mr. Edgecomb recalls Mr. Coffee's arrival and the strange events during his stay. With sympathetic Guards, like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery Demunn and one particular sadistic guard called Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb recollects his discovery of the man's unusual healing powers and the surprising revelations concerning his innocence. The story is crafted by Steven King and it's application to the silver screen is perhaps one of the finest adaptation ever done. Duncan is magnificent and has a superb ability to allow the audience to learn his true purpose. Were it not for the sadistic behavior of Hutchison, who earned his ultimate reward, the story would not have carried it's genuine sympathetic awe which gave this movie it's Classic status. A great film and a must for true movie fans. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Excellent Movie,"Only two things.
1. The young Paul Edgecomb. At the end? If I was him, I would have said, ""My God have mercy on my soul"" knowing what he was doing at that point.

Great movie but people don't talk enough about Sam Rockwell,This is the first time I ever saw this fantastic actor. There is something very interesting going on behind his eyes and compelling about everything he does when he is on screen. Do people know how truly rare that is? He's watchable from the moment he shows up to the moment he's gone and you can't wait for him to show up again. That is serious start quality. I have sense come to love him in everything he's been in. I even watched a superhero movie because he was in it lol. Just kidding. Superhero movies have good and bad just like every other genre. I love great acting and great actors. Sam Rockwell is one of my favorites.,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"A good film that is certainly not a remake of ""The Shawshank redemption""","Frank Darabont as a director has only made 4 films. The most highly rated are ""The Shawshank redempion"" (1994) and ""The green mile"" (1999). At first glance these films have much in common. Both adapted from a book written by Stephen King, both situated in a prison and both about the friendship between a white and a black man.In fact the films are far more different than you are inclined to think. ""The green mile"" is more shocking as it is on death row. The story of ""The green mile"" also involves a supernatural element that ""The Shawshank ... "" as a more pure character study is missing.The character that contributes the most to the dfference between the two movies is the character of the black man. In ""The Shawshank ... "" Morgan Freeman plays the wise experienced inmate Ellis Redding. In ""The green mile"" Michael Duncan plays the somewhat ambigious John Coffey. On the hand he is a simpleton, reminding me of Lennie from ""Of mice and men"" (John Steinbeck). On the other hand he is ""a force of nature"" (I can't thnk of another discription that would not give away too much of the plot) whose initials only are very telling.Personally I prefer ""The Shawshank redemption"", which is more of a psycholigical drama. This is not to say that ""The green mile"" is only plot driven. With a running time of more than 3 hours Darabont takes his time to make individuals of his characters.In ""The green mile"" the guards are on average much more friendly than in ""The Shawshank ... "". There is one exception by the name of Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison). I think in preparing for his role Doug has taken a good look at Donald Sutherland as Attila in ""Novecento"" (1976, Bernardo Bertolucci).",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Emotional pornography,"I use that expression cautiously and deliberately. This film hides its massive illogic and implausibility behind emotional manipulativeness and cheap tear-jerker tricks. Fans of the film who may be reading this will naturally object as though I am invalidating their tears. But please consider that your tears were coaxed out by a crude setup. Some complaints: 1. Where on earth would one find such compassionate prison guards? To quote Mahathir Muhammad, ""Either one gets callouses on one's heart or you bleed to death."" 2. In the South of 1935, not even the white liberals would treat a black man with such dignity, let alone prison guards. 3. How would a patrician white woman thank an illiterate and dirty black man for saving her life? With a hug? 4. Once John Coffey sees Wild Bill, why would his only words be,""He's a bad man!""? Why did he say nothing? 5. After visiting Coffey's lawyer, why did Paul say nothing to any legal authority? 6. The execution of Delacroix was annoyingly unrealistic. A botched execution (and there have been many) would never be anywhere nearly as gruesome. 7. Finally, and this is the point at which I hated the movie, there were MANY opportunities for the guards to get Coffey's case re-opened, even if he didn't cooperate. But that would have turned it into a courtroom drama, not a religious-like story of redemption, suffering and eternal punishment.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Like the drink only not spelled the same,"This movie was spectacular!!  I was watching it intently from beginning to end and did not even notice the time.  This movie is a true masterpiece. Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan were wonderful and the supporting cast was fantastic.Based on a serial novel by Stephen King, the Green Mile is about Paul Edgecomb, a officer in charge of prisoners on death row and everything was the same as usual until the day that John Coffey (Clarke Duncan) was brought to the mile.  Coffey is an extraordinary person and Paul Edgecomb never believed in miracles until the day he met one.This movie is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel that I have ever seen.  I think that I would recommend this movie to everyone, and even if you don't like King's work I am certain that you will love this flick.  This movie was robbed at the Academy Awards, but never the less, it is still one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen.

A one of a kind classic,"This movie is a real gem.  It is hard to find fault with it.  Hanks is excellent in a role that clearly calls for him to suppress his natural slant toward humor.  He is Paul Edgecomb; Tom Hanks is nowhere to be found.  Yet he gives Edgecomb just the right flavor.  One cannot find a single weak cast member!  Michael Jeter should have got an Oscar.  Michael Clark Duncan put just the right shading on his huge character to make him vulnerable and sympathetic.Flawlessly shot on perfect period sets, the whole production binds together to bring the extraordinary story into the realm of a believable and compelling study of human injustice and charity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Mixing an emotional drama with a Miracle!,"As you may know, the movie is adapted from Stephen King's amazing novel.The director Frank Darabont showed this novels are quite amazing for adaptations.

Not only the storyline is good, the timeline order is the real key. If this movie was on chronological order, the movie would be half effective.Also the great chosen cast with so iconic performances makes the movie even more effective. Especially the brilliant performance by Michael Clarke Duncan.Cinematography is also quite amazing. I think we can see that in especially in the forest scenes and the rainy scene.I think Original Scores could be better.

Amazing and captivating rendition of the novel.,"The length of the movie was perfect. It kept to the story to an amazing degree. The few changes didn't hurt the feeling nor the telling.

An incredible movie.,"Paul Edgecomb and his team of prison guards get a surprise when John Coffey walks through the door, a man of huge stature, with a timid demeanour, but a special gift, but convicted for murdering two children.Is this one of the best ever adaptations from text to big screen ever made? I would argue so, twenty odd years on, and I am still captivated by the magic of The Green Mile.Not many films get me, this one always does, it's an incredibly moving film, one of those films where you will need your hankies for a few scenes. Many scenes hit hard throughout, some moving, some disturbing, there really is a richness to its content that is quite something.Plenty of outstanding scenes, I've always enjoyed that moment where the guards are first introduced to John, that scene towards the end though, (we all know which one,) that is such an incredibly powerful moment.Tom Hanks gives an outstanding performance, as indeed do the whole cast.The accompanying music works so well, the score enhances the film.It's quite a long film, but it's one of those will just fly by, you'll be so engrossed you won't even notice the hours ticking by.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
It will stay with you for a long time.,"The Shawshank Redemption is possibly my favorite movie ever. I had seen many movies before it, and I've certainly seen a lot after, but not many of them made me feel what that one did. Now, I have that feeling again. And once again, it comes from watching a Frank Darabont movie. I couldn't possibly explain the overload of emotions I experienced in the 3 hours it lasts. I have laughed. I have felt the emotions of every character. And most of all, I have cried. Very few movies have touched me like this one. Is there something to say about the acting that hasn't been said before? No, it isn't. You may have heard it is flawless, incredible, whatever. You did hear right, it absolutely is. I can't think of anyone in the whole movie that wasn't convincing in the least.

I didn't get really involved and enveloped into the movie as one would when watching a truly great film, and I even say this in a nice big theatre too.

Granted that neither film is meant to appeal to your intellectual side, but more to your emotions - this film even fails at that, in my opinion.  Perhaps I just couldn't get into it because it was too cheesy...Overall, this was a disappointing film, and I know I'm not the only one who thinks that as well.

"In 3 Words: Long, Intense, Involving","This was such an intense movie that, at three hours in length, I didn't really wind up watching this as many times as I thought I would. This was another of those films I rated very high on the first viewing but lower and lower on the second and third looks, finally eliminating it from my collection. However, that first look was a memorable one because this film had some dramatic moments!The acting in here is outstanding and runs the gamut from well-known actors like Tom Hanks to several unknowns, all having major roles. It's also nicely filmed. However, the story and the acting are the main attractions. The unique story gets you involved to the point where, even having to watch several very, very unpleasant scenes, you don't want to put the movie down.Big Michael Clarke Duncan elevated his career a lot with this role, playing ""John Coffey,"" a prisoner with strange powers. You could root for all the characters save two, a sadistic guard aptly named ""Brutus 'Brutal' Howell"" (David Morse) and Warden Hal Moores (James Cromwell). I was sorry to hear Cromwell blaspheme regularly but not surprised since he seems to have played so many ""bad guy"" roles in the past dozen years and done this in other films. With those two exceptions, however, it was nice to finally see prison guards as good guys, something rarely seen since the classic-movie era. Michael Jeter, one of those unknown actors, was a lot of fun to watch as ""Eduard Delacroix.""Overall, however, as much as I praise this movie, the unpleasant scenes, the high use of the Lord's name in vain and the length of it all make this a tough movie to watch over and over, but it's a movie to definitely see at least once.

"Sanitised, sugar-coated and shallow, unless you BELIEVE.","It's not all negative; the period feel is strong, if very middle-class (the sharecroppers have a phone???), and so are the ensemble performances. The Green Mile unquestionably does a good job of pressing the right emotional response buttons for entertainment purposes. So does 'Bambi'. My problem with TGM is the amount of disbelief that has to be suspended to enjoy it. In Disney cartoons you know that anything is allowed to be possible, it's an animation. In TGM it's completely obvious - and completely unnecessary - that John Coffey is holding a light bulb in the 'help' moments; it's completely obvious that his breathing out the 'badness' is gratuitous CGI; couldn't they just have left him and the others to ACT it? The overwrought SFX turn Coffey's miracles into cheap sideshow stunts. Don't get me started on the mouse, by which the cardboard characters are upstaged. TOO MUCH MOUSE!It's a shame that the script characterisations are totally subservient to the sentimental story, like in a pantomime. Cold Mountain Block D managed to recruit the most liberal-minded bunch of warders in the country - but not one of them ever has a twinge of conscience, let alone any sense of smell! The only point where a character seems to get complicated is when the oh-so-nasty nephew turns co-operative for five minutes after striking a bargain with Tom Hanks. He soon reverts to stereotype. The rest of the film they all just follow paths that wouldn't be out of place in a high school nativity play. At no time does any of these sensitive, earnest death row wardens question the morality of capital punishment - from either end, even to get slapped down. Nobody criticises it, nobody justifies it, it's just not an issue, even in the modern, smell-less old folk's home at the beginning. You're left with the conclusion that in spite of all their caring, sharing postures, that those warders are just pretending, and just want to see those guys fry, like waiters longing for the last customer to leave. And so you stop believing their good intentions, and your disbelief is suspended. Same as I felt when I saw that poster covering the hole waving in the draft in 'Shawshank'. The morality of capital punishment is an elephant in the room that TGM and its sensitive, liberal characters ignore - apart from the attorney - he had the right degree of bloodlust.TGM is effective as broad entertainment, but the reality of the situations (execution, racism) it deals with is so horrible that you almost want to shout ""stop sugar-coating it!"" at the screen. Tom Hanks - his usual dependable, if ever-so-slightly bland performance - experiences ten times more pain from his NSU than from the gruesome job he does, and the ghastly system he is a pillar of. And the reason TGM takes so long between story beats (how many times must we see him screw that thing on his head, already!) is that if it didn't, the paper-thin story would crash and burn in an hour. Don't take it as seriously as it takes itself, it's a well-dramatised piece of mummery.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Overrated,"I like how this film plays with the idea that as prisoners on death row might wish they can undo the things they did in the past, a guy comes along with supernatural healing powers, able to undo the harm that's come to people. Whether you believe he represents Christ or not, there is something transcendent in the idea that each of us is a ""dead man walking,"" and that we should simply be kind to those around us in the time we have. Unfortunately, the film isn't very deft at managing these ideas. Its characters are drawn as if cartoons, without nuance, and it sprawls to a bloated three hour run time. It had no business being that long! Along the way are cliché moments like drama on dark and stormy nights, contrived action in the plot, and moments we can see coming from a mile away.

Right next to Shawshank!!!,Frank Darabont directs another masterpiece adapted by a Steven King novel.Sheer brilliance at its finest.Tom Hanks makes perhaps his greatest performance as the corrections officer Paul Edgecombe who doesn't believe in miracles until he sees one.While Tom and the others all shine in their roles I think that Michael Clarke Duncan deserves most credit as his magnificent portrayal of John Coffey-a convicted 8 foot tall giant murderer.He is accused in the killing of two little girls and sentenced to death.With time however Paul starts to wonder if the gentle hearted Coffey really did commit the murder.The movie has so many emotional moments that it's hard not to sympathize with the characters.The deep emotional drama of some of them is mentally pressuring and you become connected with these people - again expertly accomplished by Darabont who perfectly understands the source material and sticks close to it.Like Shawshank before it the movie teaches us the value of human life and how strong each one of us can be.This is achieved here similarly as again there is an innocent man put in prison but unlike Andy John is touched by God.He is a magical being who calls forth sympathy and by the end the audience is so аttached to him that the somewhat tragic ending is quite sad.As his previous movie Mr Darabont creates yet another fantastic film sure to stay in your heart for a while.Steven King should be proud.,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

HOLY COW!!!,"I'm not usually the type of person that writes reviews like this but after watching this movie, I felt it needed one.When I first heard about ""The Green Mile"", I didn't think too much about it since it was over three hours long and didn't believe it was worth my time. People were telling me that it was a good movie and I like Tom Hanks as an actor so I finally took the time to watch it and I gotta say. In my opinion, I found it to be one of the best Tom Hanks films I had seen in my entire life. The whole three hours my eyes were glued to my TV. I laughed, I cried, I pretty much felt different emotions throughout the entire movie that made it an adventure for me. The actors gave an amazing performance and the storyline was a mystery that I was trying to piece together the entire length of the film. By the end, I was in absolute tears when the scene was taking place. It was an emotional rollercoaster that kept me on the edge of my seat up until the credits started rolling. Although the movie is slow, it definitely meets the criteria for my top 10 movies that I've ever seen. It is definitely not a waste of three hours. So sit back, relax and prepare for a crazy mystery that will leave you wondering what will happen next.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Racist and predictable,"Frank Darabont's follow up to the Shawshank Redemption is a poorly written and painfully unoriginal story.For starters, the Noble Savage stereotype is racist at best. A character that is misunderstood by society and doesn't want to live in that society due to the character's extreme moral idealism (i.e. edward scissorhands, powder, etc.) is far from new.Coffey's character is not the only one that is one dimensional. Pretty much all the characters' dispositions are made to be one of two things: good or bad. There are no gray lines and it is obvious who the audience is supposed to hate and who they are supposed to root for. It's boring and childish. The frenchman, Michael Jeter, is made up so that we feel completely sorry for him. We're not even allowed to know what his crime was because then we might not love him so much.The prison guards are the most loving forgiving group of prison guards that have ever lived. Hell, they're the most loving forgiving people that ever lived. A prisoner spits in Tom Hanks's face and he actually does nothing about it? My grandmother isn't that nice.Stop reading here if you have not seen the movie.And wasn't it convenient that that prisoner, Sam Rockwell, just happened to be the actual criminal behind Coffey's crime? And when they ""caught"" Coffey with the girls, can anyone honestly say that if a black man was found with two dead white girls that they would not shoot him? Black men in the 30's, and especially in the South, would be killed for being seen in public with a white woman, much less killing a white child.And when Coffey does die, Tom Hanks doesn't put too much effort into stopping the execution. He just asks Coffey what he should do, and Coffey says nothing, so that's what he does. Of course Coffey must die, because in all racist Noble Savage films the savage must die so that his white savior can learn a valuable lesson.And where is the warden at this point? He said he can't stop the execution, but I find that implausible. I'm sure he could at least try to save the man who saved his wife. And wasn't that a plot twist that was hard to see coming? I also found it interesting that when Coffey healed her, he also did her hair and put makeup on her.The whole movie has no real continuity being that it was adopted from a serial novel. The movie could have ended in about five different places and the audience wouldn't have minded.The only interesting element of this movie is its ending which certainly does not save it. I suppose this movie is more Stephen King's fault than Darabont's, but regardless the movie is a disappointment in front the backdrop of all the superb movies that have been released with it in the past few months.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
'what happens on the mile stays on the mile',This is easily one of my favourite movies of all time. do not be put off of watching this movie because of its run time(3 hours) because those 3 hours will just fly by as this movie is so interesting and such a huge success. tom hanks is the main character but i think that Micheal Clarke Duncan really does steal the spotlight away from him. Stephen kings novel (with the same title) is not as good as the movie but it still stands tall i would recommend viewing this little gem if you're a fan of tom hanks or Stephen king.i have never watched a movie that has made me cry but i have to say i was very close to tears after the undeniable ending.the script is just outstanding and the acting is spot on.the storyline is very original as i have never seen anything like this before and i don't think anyone will ever try to copy it.if you're thinking about viewing this title and you haven't seen it already i suggest you get the tissues ready.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
A rare gem,"Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie.

Miracle Mile.,"People would think that this film from the same director as THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, that this is another prison film.  Well, it isn't. SHAWSHANK was more about a man's search for hope.  The director, Frank Darabont, new film THE GREEN MILE, isn't about a prison, but about a miracle that happens in a prison.  This is a outstanding film that shows what a miracle that could, or we wish that could happen, and how would mankind treat it. The story is based on the Stephen King novel, where it takes place on ""E"" block of a prison in Louisiana.  The ""E"" block is the death row, also known as ""the green mile.""  On the mile, the chief of the security is Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), a sympathetic guard who cares about the health of most of his prisoners.  Paul has fellow kind and friendly guards at the mile which include, Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), and Harry Terwilleger (Jeffrey DeMunn).  There is one rotten apple in the bunch of guards, and his name is Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison).  Percy doesn't care about anybody but himself.  Percy is cruel to the inmates, and loves to taunt them. One day a new convict arrives to the ""green mile,"" a seven foot and 300 pound black man named John Coffey (Michael Duncan Clark).  Coffey (sounds like the drink, spelled different)was convicted of killing two young girls. But when Paul talks and meets Coffey, he believes that Coffey didn't kill the two young girls.  But that is only a part of the story.  There's a secret in Coffey that is a blessing or a miracle.  Whatever you call it, it's highly unusual for someone to have, and it does good towards humanity. THE GREEN MILE has ""classic"" written all over it.  This is a truly fantastic film!  Despite it's 3 hour plus running time, it's the fastest paced 3 hour film since TITANIC.  The story and character's grab your intrest, that time doesn't matter to you.  You're more concerned about the people.  That element alone is a sign of success. Frank Darabont tells a strongly dramatic film that isn't about a prison, but takes place in one.  It's a very emotional film, yet you would walk out of the film not only falling in love with it, but somewhat happy. Darabont does a excellent job of detailing the character's and their feelings and  traits.  And like SHAWSHANK, Darabont does a magnificent job on adapting the work of Stephen King.  If I was Stephen King, I would have only Frank Darabont direct the film adaptations of my stories from now on. But the acting is also worthy of picking up golden statues.  Tom Hanks is different and great as the very kind and caring prison guard.  So are his fellow guards (Morse, Pepper, and DeMunn).  James Cromwell is also excellent as the prison warden who isn't the ""stereotyped"" warden.  And Michael Jeter is quite good as the mousy prisoner Eduard Delaeriox, who's best friend is a mouse.  But two faces or actors stand out in this film.  First is Doug Hutchison, who is very cruel and creepy as the evil guard.  His character of Percy, is the type of villian that you would love to see him get punished.  And the other actor who stands out is Michael Duncan Clark.  Clark is huge, yet he's very emotional and gentle as Coffey that the audience does feel a certain kind of kinship towards him.  You care about Coffey, that you also would believe Paul that Coffey can't be a murderer. I was extremely pleased with this classic. This has Oscar for Best Picture (winning, not nomminated) all over it. It is indeed over 3 hours, yet you'll feel a lot different after watching this movie.  It's a excellent tale about miracles, that happen in the most unlikely places.  And if they do happen, don't abuse them, bless them.  THE GREEN MILE, is paved with gold!  DO NOT MISS IT!!!!!! ***** (out of five)",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Stephen King strikes again,"Stephen King never spins a bad tale, and The Green Mile is one of his most endearing, probably helping its widespread likeability.It's a film you won't be able to find many flaws with, but also isn't something I think will blow people away.All the acting is decent, but nobody blows you away: I would argue that the best performance probably comes from James Cromwell as the warden (a fairly minor role). The story does feel slightly dumbed down (I imagine King's original retelling doesn't hold so much of the feel-good factor), and the flashback premise is something I'm not a massive fan of, but otherwise this is a solid flick.The CGI has held up, and the characters give a clear direction of who to root for. It also doesn't skimp on the violence (however infrequent), and no doubt this is a plot you have not seen before; all in all, you can't go wrong watching this, provided you've got three hours.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"Overlong, but haunting, thought-provoking, moving and engrossing","I am starting to like Stephen King's work more now, and I read the book. A wonderful book, that is faithfully(mostly) adapted into an equally wonderful film. My only complaint of The Green Mile is the length, I do think it is too long. However, The Green Mile is a film that is haunting, thought-provoking, moving and engrossing.The film is beautifully directed by Frank Darabont(director of the slightly superior The Shawshank Redemption), is beautifully shot with a foreboding setting and atmospheric cinematography and lighting and has an engrossing and haunting story that is well-paced too. Thomas Newman's score is positively hypnotic and very beautiful, with some great authentic song choices, my favourite being Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams(And Dream Your Troubles Away).The script is thoughtful too, and the movie also has a big emotional impact without feeling manipulative, I honestly couldn't help crying at the end of the movie. I have to say as well, the execution scenes were really quite harrowing. The performances are strong, Tom Hanks is excellent as the warden, as is Doug Hutchison who gives a credibility and complexity to a character that could have easily been clichéd and David Morse as Brutus. But Michael Clarke Duncan is the actor I want to give the real kudos to, he has a wonderful character and he absolutely nails it.Overall, a very, very good movie. Had it been shorter, it would have been perfect. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"Fell asleep towards the end, and I don't think it was an accident.","There are some times when I can say that I must have seen a truly different film than the vast majority of other people in the world. This time is one of them. For this film to be rated so highly, is completely bewildering to me. Let me just say that I am by no means some kind of American working class slob who can only sit through a 90 minute action-packed popcorn film loaded special fx and t&a. I can easily sit through films like Barry Lyndon and 2001 without even getting up for a snack. If a film is truly great, it will hold my attention. If it isn't, then I may just doze off. At least I was interested enough to rewind it when I woke up to see what I missed. It wasn't worth the effort.This film failed on almost every level to connect or convey any true emotion to me. The only character I liked was Michael Clarke Duncan as a Christ-like figure who has exceptional healing powers, but is put to death for a crime he didn't commit. The film is slow, talky, and not very well-acted. This was truly surprising since the cast members of this film are usually quite good.Tom Hanks stars as a guard in charge of the death row wing of on old southern prison. Through most of the film, we see him and the other guards interacting with the prisoners and carrying out an execution here and there. Tom Hanks gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen him give. The only emotion he shows at all is agony while trying to pass a stone through his urethra! Yes, a major plot point in this film is that Hanks is having trouble urinating! Whatever.As far as the other characters go, nobody does that well in the acting department. David Morse, Barry Pepper, and James Cromwell have boring characters. The individuals who play the bad guard and the psychotic prisoner over-act badly. Michael Jeter's character is so annoying that I couldn't wait to see him executed. His execution scene is perhaps the most memorable scene in the film.And the part with the little mouse! Way too cutesy for words. I thought I was watching Stuart Little for a moment.And not to spoil the conclusion or anything, but there is absolutely no payoff for anything we've learned throughout the film. I at least was hoping the ending would tie everything up in a thoughtful manner that would somehow make the whole experience rewarding. Nope!Overall, this film is a dud. I really can't see where all the hype came from. Do yourself a favor and stick with Shawshank instead.

"""A Captivating Journey of Innocence and Redemption""","""The Green Mile,"" directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novel, is a poignant and powerful film that delves into themes of justice, compassion, and the supernatural.Set in a Louisiana penitentiary during the 1930s, the story revolves around Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), a prison guard who oversees death row inmates awaiting execution. When a gentle giant named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) is convicted of a heinous crime, Paul and his fellow guards (played by David Morse, Barry Pepper, and Jeffrey DeMunn) soon discover that John possesses miraculous healing powers and a profound innocence that challenges their perceptions of justice and humanity.Tom Hanks delivers a stellar performance as Paul Edgecomb, capturing the character's moral dilemma and internal struggle with integrity and empathy. Michael Clarke Duncan's portrayal of John Coffey is equally compelling, portraying a character who is both enigmatic and deeply sympathetic.The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the audience to immerse themselves in the characters' emotions and moral dilemmas. Darabont's direction creates a somber and introspective atmosphere, effectively contrasting the harsh realities of the prison system with moments of profound grace and compassion.""The Green Mile"" explores profound questions about guilt, redemption, and the nature of evil. It challenges viewers to confront their own beliefs about justice and mercy, especially in the face of extraordinary circumstances.The film is rich in detail, capturing the period setting with authenticity and enhancing the emotional impact of its narrative. The soundtrack, composed by Thomas Newman, complements the film's mood with its evocative and haunting melodies.""The Green Mile"" is a masterful adaptation that resonates long after the credits roll.

Epic story-telling - love Darabont,"I love every single thing about 'the Green Mile', the same way I loved everything about 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'Forrest Gump'.

Tom Hanks brilliantly portrays the complex character of Paul Edgecomb and the late Michael Clarke Duncan absolutely steals the show in an Oscar robbed performance as John Coffey. May he ever rest in peace. It wasn't, however, just those two who gave strong performances.

This film truly mastered characters and what they undergo during prison life.The directing and writing by Frank Darabont, the man behind 'The Shawshank Redemption' absolutely masters everything a film needs to get right once more and adds such layers to each character that we come to truly love by the end of the film.The tone to the movie is so dark that we are immediately thrown into the world presented in this movie. The movie is so sad on many occasions that I was truly left bawling my eyes out.**Spoilers*** The scene where Del is horribly executed to death was just too sad to look at.

Everyone has their own prison in the soul,"""The Green Mile"" is one of the most famous and excellent film adaptations of the works of the master of horror Stephen King. Choosing this movie to watch, you immerse yourself in the beautifully rendered world of the last century, where prisoners are waiting in the wings in a prison cell. And the guards are represented by a variety of images. And each of these images shows us completely diverse and well-developed stories. Those that allow you to get into the soul of each hero.Frank Darabont's magnificent production lasts more than three hours. However, this story will not have enough shorter timekeeping to introduce the audience to the whole picture. However, the film does not seem to be drawn out at all. He moves in a good narrative manner, with well-staged scenes, elaborate dialogues that allow you to get to know the characters from several sides. The accuracy of the frame, the lighting, the prison atmosphere - everything is shown very interestingly.The cast is full of famous names, among which the main decoration, of course, are two for me personally: Michael Clarke Duncan and Tom Hanks. The first one plays a good-natured big man accused of murdering little girls, who does not pull at all like a murderer. The second is the head of the security shift. Throughout the picture, their interaction, dialogues leave a feeling of some kind of restrained warmth and barely perceptible sympathy for each other. Hanks is ready to believe in the innocence of the hero Duncan, and he is ready to help with the warden's illness.Separately, I would like to say about the hero Doug Hutchison. He played Warden Percy. In general, I have my own attitude to this actor after the role in the series ""The X-Files"", where he played Victor Eugene Tooms, a nasty and nasty character. But in this film, the actor has reached a definitely new level. He conveyed the image so well that to this day, remembering the film ""The Green Mile"", I shudder from the memory of this warden. I think that this is a great actor's performance, if the viewer has such emotions.The picture, of course, is not complete without some mystical and even fantastic component. It is very skillfully and organically woven into the canvas of the work, makes you think whether what happened in the performance of the hero Duncan is real or not. And these moments are so successful that there is no doubt that the story is authentic.""The Green Mile"" was nominated for 4 Oscars, but did not receive any. It is sad. After all, among the awards could be the Best film and the Best supporting actor. These would be worthy victories. But this is not very important when you know that such a picture rightfully occupies one of the highest places in the ratings of all films that have ever existed. The film will not leave anyone indifferent, will give a lot of emotions, will allow you to look at the characters from unusual angles. The viewer will understand that not all people behind bars are the ultimate villains, and the police are completely human and represent justice and truth. I think that this film is mandatory for everyone to watch.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Fairly well endowed to the book,"Before going to see The Green Mile tonight, it was only very recently that I had read the novel, and so I was able to know who the names of the characters were fairly quickly, and a lot of the story,for the extreme running time it occupied, became pretty easy to follow.But, if truth be told, I could have read the book 4 years ago when it was originally published, and still today be able to draw the same comparisons.The fact is, that if you read any novel which the film you are about to see is based on, you can make up your own interpretation of the story, and that is way better, because it happens at your own pace, and it unravels in your own way. So, out of the two, although the film was good, I would probably advise to read the book instead.The film picked a wise number when it chose to add light, humorous intervals to the story,e.g. Mr.Jingles first introduction, and all the other comic moments it inspired. A movie focusing on a story this grim and unrelenting would need moments like this to make it bearable, because when it is, it chills the blood with it's nastiness. John Coffey's wailing with the two dea d girls, and Eduard Delacroix's execution are profoundly nasty moments in the film. Another of the film's merits is the performances of it's stars. Tom Hanks seems to subconsciously mesmerise with his portrayal of the lead character. His bit as the regular honcho guy who has to place firm law and order on the inmates and his henchmen is affected by the smallest of things. His eye movement, his expressions, and his observations of the time and the place and indeed, the situation he is in truly lift the character he is playing up many notches. As for Michael Clarke Duncan as Coffey, well, in the next role I see him in, I'll be wishing he was in this one again. With one shot, he transforms a regular joe movie personality into a magnificent powerhouse of a performance, that powerfully renders all the cliches/stereotypes obsolete.Another asset of reading the book, however, is also that if you absorb it, if you take in everything that is happening, ,it will make the film go by far quicker. Although the novel is a far greater suggestion, really, The Green Mile is what proper moviemaking is all about.****",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

A real tear-jerker,"Frank Darabont has given us some classic films like The Shawshank Redemption and whilst The Green Mile isn't as great, it's still an emotionally moving experience.The Green Mile shows the lives of several guards of Death Row and how the arrival of a prisoner named John Coffey, who has mysterious powers, affects them.Regarded as an absolute classic, The Green Mile is sure to tug on your heartstrings. Whilst the film may be three hours long, the emotional weight that this film brings is sure to make you cry. Frank Darabont's direction is great. You really feel transported to this place and Darabont conveys the cruel nature of the death penalty as honest as possible. The execution scenes involving the electric chair can be hard to watch especially one which becomes quite unsettling. The film does a great job making the audience care about the characters. Whilst the character of Del has done bad deeds, you still care about him after seeing his relationship with the guards and what eventually happens to him. My main issue with this film stems from its runtime. I think it's way too long and because of how long it was, I lost interest during some parts.The performances were stellar from everybody. Tom Hanks is great as usual and played Paul Edgecomb really well. However, the real star of this film is Michael Clarke Duncan. Despite his large nature, Duncan really manages to make Coffey seem as vulnerable and sympathetic as possible. He truly does a great job and is the trigger for tears streaming down many people's faces. Michael Jeter is terrific as Del and once again makes the audience sympathetic towards him. Both Doug Hutchison and Sam Rockwell did a great job as their characters and made us feel very hateful towards them.The Green Mile does drag with its three hour runtime but at the same time it's one of the most heartfelt and emotionally gripping films I've seen.

The Academy jury couldn't make a more blatant display of incompetence than giving the Oscar to American Beauty instead of this film.,"After reaching the pinnacle of cinema with 'The Shawshank Redemption,' it's almost unbelievable that Darabont managed to maintain the same standard, perhaps even surpassing it. It's an undeniable fact that Stephen King is one of the most impactful and creative storytellers of the modern era. But to have crafted such a sincere, high-quality, and profoundly human story about life, death, good, and evil-it's remarkable. And then to see it brought to the screen with such excellent cinematography, music, and acting-it's mind-blowing.To give an Oscar to a tired American modern father story instead of this film, one must have lost their mind. If members of the Academy jury are tired of life, they should seek therapy, take up yoga, resolve any issues with their spouses, but they shouldn't come and deprive masterpieces like this of their rightful recognition.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"Wonderful, Moving to Tears...","I love this movie, and I have seen it a couple times. It doesn't matter that I know what is going to happen or that I know the movie like the back of my hand, I cry endlessly every single time. I watched it again last night. My boyfriend and I bought it, and he had never seen it. So we sat down to watch the movie, and I realized how truly emotionally moving this movie is.IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE ENTIRETY OF THE MOVIE DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER DOWN...The characters in this movie really hit home. You fall in love with these men that are on death row..(all except for ""Wild Bill""). You don't know what on earth they have done, yet it is so bad that they are on death row, and you fall in love with them. You can't help it. I sat there last night, propped up on my pillow in the bed and watched and fell in love with this huge beast of a man that is convicted of raping and murdering two girls. (I knew from the get-go that he didn't do it). And I watched and fell in love with Dale, a French, homosexual, crazy, mouse-loving man. I watched him fall in love with Mr. Jingles. I grew into this hate for Percy ""WET""more (I still get a kick out of that name). And when it came time for Dale to be executed, I cried like I was losing a family member. It was so hard to watch this happen! My boyfriend had to pause the movie, just to check on me. I sat there for five minutes, crying so hard. Then the same thing for John Coffey, I couldn't even watch him be persecuted. I sat beside my boyfriend, face buried in his chest weeping every tear out of me. It was so awful. I have NEVER in my life had a movie effect me like the way this one does. It is a brilliant movie, and the characters chosen for each role could not have been better portrayed if this was a true story, with the real-life people playing their own parts. Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor, and personally I think he does his best when he is acting as a southern authority figure. He is such a convincing actor, along with everyone else in this movie. Props to the actors, director, and Stephen King, you all are wonderful!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
The Green Mile was excellent!,"My Plot Summary:The Green Mile, set in the 1930s, is about the mental and physical health effects of working on death row. In this film the guards encounter many different men that have been put to death for various crimes. It isn't until they come across a black gentleman that has been falsely accused of raping and murdering two young girls, that they begin to really have second thoughts about execution. This inmate has the magnificent gift of healing through his faith. A mix of the inmate's gift, and the fact that he is innocent, causes the guards to question whether or not this man should be executed. The situations a person encounters in their profession can affect them for the rest of their lives. Paul Edgecomb, played by Tom Hanks, is the supervisor on death row, a dimly lit, dungeon-like building. Edgecomb has suffered major effects from the many executions that he has taken part in. He encounters a once in a lifetime experience when John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is sent to the Green Mile to await his execution. John Coffey is a very large and intimidating man that is extremely soft at heart. All this man wants is peace in his life from all of the hurt that is going on in the world around him. He has been blessed with the gift of healing. While he tries to help all he can he learns that it is impossible to help everyone. Paul Edgecomb's fellow prison guards are of varying personalities. Brutus Howell, played by David Morse, is a large man who has been given the nickname ""Brutal"" due to his size. In spite of the fact that he is a tall man, and somewhat intimidating, he is a kind man that comes to second guess the ruling for the execution of John Coffey. Percy Wetmore, played by Doug Hutchison, is an all around jerk who is all bark and no bite. This is proved when one of the more violent inmates grabs hold of one of his co-workers while he stands there shaking in his boots. Percy's interaction with the inmates causes John Coffey to dislike him. As a result, John Coffey has decided to ""infect"" Percy with an ailment that he cured a person of. Percy lashes out on another inmate, kills him, and then releases his ""infection."" Percy, in the end, ends up going to a mental hospital.My Review:The Green Mile, starring Tom Hanks, David Morse, and Michael Clarke Duncan, is a brilliantly written and produced piece of work. The choice of actors and actresses along with their exquisite performances could not have been better. The lighting and angles made the viewing of the movie a one of a kind experience. The artistic dimness of the lights, and dull colors within the walls of the Green Mile made this film all the more believable. It gives the viewers the sense of doom and dread that is felt by the inmates knowing that their lives are soon coming to an end because of the crimes they have committed. John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, delivered the most convincing, amazing, and overall ground breaking performance in this film. In spite of his extra large stature, Coffey is a kind, soft hearted man who brings a lot of heart-felt emotion to the Green Mile. The attachment that the guards develop to Coffey makes it extremely hard for them to carry out his execution; there was not a dry eye amongst the guards. This film shows that any situation that is encountered in a person's profession, whether it is mental or physical, can affect them for the remainder of their lives. These men face the biggest moral obstacle they will ever come across in their lifetimes. When asked by Paul Edgecomb how he is to answer for the execution of John Coffey, he is assured by the large, gifted inmate that it is OK to execute him, that it will end his pain and he wants it to be carried out. All he wants is to end the feelings he has every day because of all of the violence and hurt in the world around him. This film is, by far, one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time. There was laughter, tears, and amazement throughout the entirety of this film. The performance of the cast of The Green Mile was above and beyond my expectations of a film that deals with a prison setting. Tom Hanks, along with the many other actors and actresses will leave you begging for more. If you have not seen this brilliant piece of work, then it should be added to your list of must see movies for the year because it is guaranteed to please! If you liked Shawshank Redemption you will love this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"A pretty decent, if unmemorable film.","The Green Mile is a fairly decent movie in most regards. Its well filmed with good production values and has a pretty OK story that overall is entertaining to watch. The performances are also all very good. Especially by Michael Clarke Duncan, Sam Rockwell, and Doug Hutchinson.However by the end of the film I just felt underwhelmed. Nothing really special happened in it. The super natural aspects really weakened the story in my opinion. Going into it I was expecting the story to be about a prison guard who works on death row who just so happens to befriend one of his prisoners. So when the whole thing became supernatural I was a little disappointed. If the story was more grounded in reality and had a lot less filler it would have been emotionally gut wrenching. But its not.Also there is a very out of place violent scene in this movie. A man gets slowly burnt alive because of a villain sabotaging the electric chair. Its a scene that feels taken directly from a Hostel movie. Ugh.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Green miracle...,"It is difficult sometimes to watch long movies, because just a few of them are so tense to rivet you to television for more then two hours, but this one really does, it shows you the way how to understand the people around you! It is story about human character,their life and believing...It shows how we react on things that just happen without reason, things that we can't explain even if we see it by our own eyes. It is true like movie tells us- it is difficult to find miracle or better that miracle find us, but if we do, we don't believe in it or worse we destroy(kill) it! Great act by Tom Hanks like always, role of a good family person, who help those around him, person who stands up for his convictions, is written all over his skin, actually whole crew that cared about prison was picked up very carefully and they really made a great entirety...great story by Mr. King...maybe a little unusual for his writing, but one more reason to congratulate him for this one!

"A Masterpiece of Cinematic Art -- Captivating, Reverent, Tear-Inducing","""The Green Mile"" expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama. It was adapted from Stephen King's novel by director/writer Frank Darabont and released in 1999. If you're not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I'm not) DON'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful and spiritually-profound film; ""The Green Mile"" is by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes.THE STORY: Tom Hanks plays the head Death Row guard at a Tennessee prison during the Depression. A new inmate is introduced, a hulking black man named John Coffey (exquisitely played by Michael Clarke Duncan), who is condemned to death for the rape and murder of two little girls. Hanks and his guard friends slowly become intrigued by the seemingly pure-hearted giant and begin to realize that he is eminently gifted in a decidedly supernatural way; they conclude that there's no way he could be guilty of the crime. If that's the case, who is guilty? And will the guilty party get away with it.""The Green Mile"" is a 3-hour film, way over my limited attention span, and yet it is somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings. The film is character/dialogue driven, unique and wholly unpredictable. Please don't mistake this for a run-of-the-mill prison flick. The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue. This is an incredibly powerful supernatural mystery/drama.*** SPOILER ALERT *** (Don't read this next paragraph unless you want to consider possibilities about the character John Coffey)John Coffey's last name is, evidently, derived from an ancient Sumerian word, kophi, which means ""winged creature."" Hence, John could be viewed as a angel or messenger from the Almighty. In truth, John is an obvious type of Jesus Christ verified in six ways: (1.) His initials are J.C. (2.) He's completely pure/good-hearted and can easily recognize true evil. (3.) He miraculously heals people. (4.) He pronounces and executes divine judgment. (5.) He is sacrificed even though completely innocent. And (6.) He offers eternal life (in a sense), as evidenced by the extended life-span of the Hanks character and the mouse ""Mr. Jingles.""*** End SPOILER ALERT ***BOTTOM LINE: Make no mistake, ""The Green Mile"" is one of the greatest films ever made. It ranks up there with my 5 or 10 best. Don't miss out on this cinematic masterpiece. Now please excuse me while I wipe the tears from my face.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"Brilliant, a lot of fun, and full of heart.","Truly a wonderful picture. I agree with what most people on here are saying: this film, along with Shawshank define great American cinema. Both pictures are ingenious in their conception -kudos to master writer Stephen King - and really spark more than just entertainment. This is not ars gratia artis, art for arts sake; it's art for the sake of humanity; for portraying brilliant stories that center around human interactions in the most inhuman of places. If anyone stumbles on this review, understand that there are few similarly heart-wrenching films out there. Others have pointed out more, and I agree.

Another winner,"I think I got the message of the film after about 45 minutes; that there is so much hatred and anger among people, and that revenge is nothing constructive. A very important message which I think the film delivers brilliantly, with John Coffey as a ""triumphant card"". The supernatural effects in the movie might be unbelievable if you focus solely on them, but I think they're ""metaphoring"" and make things a bit more understandable, maybe. A wonderful movie that moves at a measured pace on to a very unexpected ending. As with most great movies the casting is almost perfect and each character gives added depth to a rich script. Tom Hanks gives another outstanding performance, his supporting actors (particularly David Morse)actually support and enhance his role.

None of these characters did react realistically which quickly turned the movie into not only a raving bore, but an absolute farce as well.I didn't altogether hate this movie, even though it was awful.

My own opinion is that whereas the mind-numbing grind of life behind bars was alluded to (and briefly illustrated) in Shawshank, The Green Mile seems intent on spelling more of it out.

Is the the God-given gift of healing a fitting subject for sentimentality?,"I saw this film recently late one night on television. Just happened to switch it on. I knew nothing about it (I'm not a film(""movie"") buff), didn't who it was by, or whether it was a true story or a piece of fiction. I found it too long; turned it off after about two and a half hours (too late at night/early morning). Nicely paced, though; obviously, the story takes three hours to tell, which is fair enough.I went along with much of the early parts, the death row routines, the bad apple among the little good guys; the likable inmates - bad boys once but harmless old lags now. They bring in the black guy, he's marked down as the worst of the worst: good for dramatic contrast. I assumed he was going to be the healer. He is. Fixes up Hanks, blows - what: ash? evil? corruption? - afterwards.It's then I had my first doubts. Looked like hokey was on the way. And do we get a wagon load of it! Brings the mouse back to life - bright lights please, otherwise no one will be impressed. Then the big miracle, why even the house itself rocks: must be a big big miracle. So I had my fill of hokey: turned off the TV and went to bed.Never read Stephen King. From the comments above I gather that this is a good novel by him. So I never will readStephen King. I daresay some people need this kind of sentimental mush.My main regret (other then to lament the fact that some people are so badly caught in this life that they need this kind of escapism) is that these writers and film (movie) makers should exploit such serious issues for such pathetic ends.

Great film,"Loved this film - very powerful. The cast plays a significant part because these are people we care about, no matter how big or small their roles are, each one shines at a moment or another, providing an extra level of depth in characterization, and when they leave us, we can't help but feel something cruelly missing, as if we were really experiencing death as a human loss. But aside from the acting, the directing and the writing are responsible for this level of empathy we feel. Indeed, the film doesn't embarrass itself with subtleties or nuances when it comes to the characters, the guards are all sympathetic and Percy is clearly the main antagonist, doing everything to be unpopular both among the guards and the viewers. And in the prisoners' group, while they're all bad people by society's standards, only Wild Bill stands out as the evil one. In the hand of another director, this wouldn't have worked, but with Darabont it does.Darabont may not be the best director of his generation, nor the best writer, but he's got one rare talent: he's a wonderful storyteller. And this talent shows in his films, he has a unique ability to transport you in his universe with such respect and carefulness that you forget all the elements that could undermine the believability of the story. How can the death row's corrections officer guards be so mild-mannered? How wasn't John Coffey lynched at the very minute he was found grabbing two little girls' bodies in his arms, what's more, by a Southern angry mob? Why falling in the 'Magic Negro' stereotype again? I was so mesmerized by the story, and so focused on the supernatural power of Coffey and the bonding it inspired in the block E, that I unconsciously wiped all these considerations.And I enjoyed ""The Green Mile"" for what it was, a great MOVIE. And I emphasize the word 'movie' because there's a sort of genius in the way Darabont sticks to cinematic conventions. Darabont never hesitates to use archetypes because he's confident over his material; he knows that his screenplay is adapted from one hell of a story, written by the king Stephen. And it sure pays off, the story has the thrills of the electric chairs scenes, the heart-pounding horrific moment when the machinery goes wrong, it has the laughs, the joy, the emotion, and even a nice little comic relief incarnated by a little mouse named Mister Jingles.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Not Shawshank Pt. II,"Although The Green Mile shares the same director, setting, and source novelist as The Shawshank Redemption, it is about as far from Shawshank as is possible.  This slightly sci-fi, slightly eerie, and very moving drama is a top-flight morality whose ambiguous aims allow for a whole lot of interpretation.  In the preview screening that I attended, there was not a dry eye in the house during several scenes, and clearly rattled many members of the audience.  Tom Hanks continues his winning streak as a death-row guard, and is wonderfully supported by the entire cast.  Although this film may not be as technically groundbreaking as Being John Malkovich or Three Kings, it is not standard Hollywood fare, and achieves its own perfection. May sure to catch this when it is released, it will be the final classic of the 20th century.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"If this is Christian allegory, I'll eat my mitre","Everyone remember the story about Christ and the public stoning?  Well, to the extent that ""The Green Mile"" is Christian allegory, Christ said something like this: `Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.  -Oh wait, I'M without sin!""  THUNK!Why does everyone assume that this story even takes place in a Christian universe?  Is it because so many of the characters are Christian?  But this is 1930s American South.  What did you expect?  When a character with supernatural powers of healing lumbers up, OF COURSE everyone assumes the powers are God-given; they assume his perfectly ordinary eyebrows are God-given, too; but the script gives us no reason to suppose that they're right.  Rather the reverse.  There's something random and essentially pointless about Coffey's abilities and actions, something that suits an atheist or pagan universe in which all sorts of oddities just turn up, something which doesn't justify the atmosphere of reverential ponderousness adopted by Frank Darabont and his cast.  (What IS that brown dust that Coffey spews out periodically?  Is it now OBLIGATORY for directors to run the rough footage through a computer and make it worse somehow?)  But it's a very modern sort of paganism.  There's nothing at all beautiful about the magic, which is a telling flaw.Look: it's not as bad as I thought it would be.  I THOUGHT that Darabont would have let the extravagant praise heaped upon ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (a good film, by the way) go to his head, and produce a slow, lingering, pompous version of a less interesting story.  Sort of true, but it has its moments (although, as more than one critic I've read has added, ""perhaps by chance"").  I thought Tom Hanks would be unendurable.  Surprisingly, he does a good job, all things considered.  I thought the racism would get on my nerves.  It's not really racist.  Coffey is a simpleton, but not because of the rule that blacks must be simpletons; rather, the rule is that good people must be simpletons.  (Coffey is so good he can barely form sentences.)  I thought that the bookends would waste my time and weaken the film's structure.  They do.Objectively speaking, a bad film; but, although my interest waxed and waned, it was easy to stay involved through to the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

A sterling drama; complex and emotional...,"Prison guards in the 1930s are profoundly touched by one Death Row inmate. Surprisingly complex, absorbing and emotional film--surprising because ""The Green Mile"" is a big commercial release, it is (ostensibly) another Tom Hanks vehicle, and it's yet another adaptation of a Stephen King story--and yet, the talented filmmakers are able to pull some lovely magic from this trifecta. The subject matter, featuring several vile supporting characters, is unpleasant, though this doesn't detract from the emotional value of the piece, which is professionally-handled despite one or two small missteps (an execution scene, for instance, which runs too long). Terrific acting by Hanks (who blends right in with the large cast) and Michael Clarke Duncan, exceptional production design and cinematography. Some may quibble over the epilogue, but it's a sweet touch in a movie with a big heart. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Well told story full of racism,"THE GREEN MILE-starts out with an  older man, remembering the time he was much younger and working in 'the green mile', the prison cell block, prisoners were put in, before being electrocuted in the electric chair. The real story starts when a huge black man, John Coffey comes in, who much later in the film turns out to be able to heal people in a mysterious way. We also get acquainted with the other prisoners and wards. One of the wards is not as nice as the others, but a frustrated sadist. The story is well told with great eye for detail, also the actors, with Tom Hanks as main character are giving excellent performances. The film loses (great part) of its' credibility when John Coffey starts working his miracles. It is not very clear why we need to see not one, not two, but THREE electrocutions(of which one goes wrong and never seems to end).But what is mainly disturbing about this film is not so much its' length or the unnecessary flashback (why not start right away with the story?), but the portrayal of its charachters. The film seems to be trying to tell us, that we should be nice to all, no matter what or who, not be racist, but it does it in a very stereotypical and disturbing way, and thus sending the opposite message. As Hall already once argued, a representation of, for example violence, is not violence, but a message about violence. The huge, muscled black guy, is really a softy who is hardly able to pronounce grammarly correct sentences. It is very surprising nobody protested against this terrible stereotype, which I supposed has been overcome and  belonged to the past, where blacks were thought simple and stupid. The nice wards are all good christians (after all, we are in the south of America), and therefor it is impossible that someone who is able to perform miracles has done any harm. And indeed this 'angel' turns out to be innocent. Yep, the Good and the Bad are not to be mixed up, ignoring roughly the enormous grey area in between. Surprising  then that it is OK to treat the nasty ward, Percy, in a very cruel manner. OK, he is a very bad guy, but weren't we supposed to be nice to all? * 1/2 out of five",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Three reasons why I watched The Green Mile,"""The Green Mile, ""was the movie from 1999, which had been nominated by Oscar. The movie is adapted from Stephen King's novel of the same name. Through Tom Hanks acted a death row correction officer that make the movie full of exceptional. ""The Green Mile, ""is attractive based on story line, vivid character, reflection after finished the movie as well.
The story is about Paul Edgecomb as a death row correction officer. One day, John Coffey, a giant black man convicted by raping and kill two young white girls, arriving at the death row. John was full of mystery, unlike other prisoner, he was a kind, timid and lonely person. However, it happened a serious of miracles at the dead row.
The main character was acted by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, they were both a talented actor in 90's. They let Paul Edgecomb and John Coffey become more vivid in ""The Green Mile.""
After finished the movie, I had a lot of reflections and feelings. For instance, whether the death penalty is justice or not, like John Coffey, even if he was innocent, he could not escape his penalty. And the guilty in Paul Edgecomb.
There is one saddest line in the movie, John Coffey said, ""I am tired of people being ugly to each other, I am tired all of the pain."" In that scene, I cried with him. ""The Green Mile,"" is the classic in 90's, including the amazing story, lively character and reflection issues. It is one of my favorite movies, watching this movie at different stage of life will bring you different feeling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"A ""Bridges of Madison County"" for men","It's sometimes difficult to know what's able to hit you hard, until it actually hits you. I haven't had such an emotional reaction to a movie since E. T. when I was 10 years old.First time I watched The Green Mile was a late, hot summer night. My girlfriend became too tired to watch a movie, so I decided to watch it by myself. Good call...Frank Darabont's script and direction is flawless from the first frame to the last. Production design and acting as well. Story is very compelling and hits on all the emotional notes you can imagine. For anyone that has a problem with ""the supernatural"" as an ingredient in a story it might not be as strong. But if that's not an issue, you are in for an emotional ride.If you ever had doubts about your deeds in life, and question if you are doing the right thing, with the potential of eternal judgement, this is a very strong story.At the end I found myself sobbing loudly and uncontrollable. I was stunned that it hit me so hard. Glad I didn't watch it in the cinema, that would have been embarrasing :DStill watch it at least ones a year, and though I can now control my reaction (because I know the story), it's still very moving and really makes me think about important stuff. Life, death, justice etc.Can't recommend it enough, but talking about it with others, it seems you are either gonna be destroyed by it (like I was), or just think it was a good film.My girlfriend got to see it the next day, but her reaction was nothing near mine. Remembering her reaction to ""Bridges"" though, which was uncontrollable.weeping, I realized that The Green Mile was basically a ""Bridges"" for men...

Walking the green mile,A hauntingly good film that never ceases to emotionally connect. The characters have depth and are well cast. The storyline is unique and has the perfect mix of supernatural and drama.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
long superficial tale,"`The Green Mile,' since it is based on a Stephen King novel, emerges as a death row prison story with a sci-fi twist.  Chances are the viewer will either be swept up in this tale of life, death and spiritual renewal involving a group of characters working and languishing in a 1930's prison cell block - or dismiss it as a prime example of sentimental hooey.  Like the similar (and similarly overrated) Stephen King-inspired prison epic, `The Shawshank Redemption,' this new film provides far too sanitary and romanticized a vision of prison life to be either entirely convincing or particularly meaningful.  Indeed, `The Green Mile' goes a step further into the realm of parable by ascribing to one of its main characters the power of miraculous healing.  Unfortunately, however, a parable is, almost by definition, supposed to be short, pithy and to the point.  The story here - which runs a presumptuous 3 hours and 8 minutes - is so overstuffed with subplots and subsidiary characters that it actually works to weaken the emotional effect generated by the plight facing John Coffey, the innocent messenger from God condemned to death, and Paul, the prison guard assigned to run the death row cell block, who comes to learn of Coffey's innocence.`The Green Mile' certainly has its heart in the right place, but it divides its world too evenly up into good guys and bad guys.  Perhaps the decision to cast Tom Hanks in the leading role of Paul accounts for the fact that the character seems far too genial, soft-spoken and humanistic to be a man dedicating his life to dispatching convicted murderers to their just (or unjust) rewards.  Coffey, a mountain of a man in the form of actor Michael Clarke Duncan, ranks as the oldest cliché of all:  an uneducated, marginally imbecilic lug of a guy whose innocent, childlike heart and mind, though trapped inside a behemoth's body, provide the clean vessel through which God is able to work his wonders.  Except for this last fact, Coffey's pedigree descends from a whole multitude of earlier characters, including Lennie in `Of Mice and Men' and even Frankenstein's monster.  Is this possibly why `The Green Mile,' in deference to the former character, features a mouse in a prominent role?   Similarly, one doubts it is mere coincidence that the crime for which Coffey is convicted is that of raping and murdering two little girls, an echo of Frankenstein  - albeit, in this case, Coffey, of course, is innocent;  after all, having him be guilty of the brutal murders would muddy up the moral waters and make it a lot harder to elicit tears from a sentimental, happily rheumy-eyed audience.   Also, this allows the authors to pound home the Christ figure qualities of Coffey (John Coffey - JC - get it?) to an unsubtle fare-thee-well.  In addition to dying innocently for another's sins, Coffey gets to heal the sick and smite the evildoers (the latter, more in keeping with Jehovah perhaps than with Christ per se).Nor are the filmmakers much more successful with their villains.  Amidst all this amazing good will between condemned killers and supportive prison guards, there has to be some vinegar to cut the sweetness.  This comes in the form of a too neatly balanced duo, one a guard, the other a far-from-model prisoner.  The guard, Percy, is a craven, sadistic coward who delights in antagonizing the prisoners, taunting and torturing the men at the moment of execution and, most monstrously of all to the animal lovers in the audience, squashing a pet mouse on the eve of its owner's death.  The evil prisoner, Wild Bill, provides a similar two-dimensional quality to his wickedness, serving as a too-obvious foil for the other pure-as-the-driven-snow condemned men.  By so neatly divvying up the characters into clearly delineated categories of good and evil, the filmmakers rob their film of the moral complexity that might have lent it some real meaning.As to the film's rather startling and, initially unexpected, flights into fantasy, they serve mostly to further soften the edge of this already overly idealistic and mawkish story.`The Green Mile' is certainly not a `bad' film.  It sports a number of excellent performances, generates some moments of genuine emotional power and, though languorous at times in its pacing, admirably refuses to hurtle ahead as it patiently gathers the strands of its story together.  As with a good long novel, one approaches it with a sense of patience and goodwill. We want to give it the benefit of our attention.  Therefore, we regret even more that the makers of the film too often settle for the easy path of cheap emotionalism and simpleminded sentimentality.  Those of us willing to dedicate more than three precious hours to this particular cause deserve better.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"Good Performances, but Gets Increasingly Ridiculous","THE GREEN MILE  (1999)   * * 1/2   This movie has the best money can buy:  great character actors in most roles, wonderful sets, excellent photography, and is never boring despite it's 3 hour length.  That said, it's a shame that in its third hour the movie just keeps getting increasingly ridiculous to the point that I really can't recommend it.

They were so beautifully developed. Tom Hanks character, even though he sent peple to death hewas still extremley respectful and kind to those who were to be executed. This made his character so admirable and liked him instantaniously. Then Micheal Duncan and his character was portrayed so fantastically. His performance was so emotional as he was so innocent it was extremley moving to watch.I very very very highly reccomend this film, wach it at least once in your lifetime you won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Miracles and Missteps on Death Row,"As someone who appreciates a well-crafted story, I found ""The Green Mile"" to be an intriguing blend of the supernatural and the emotional, set against the backdrop of a 1930s death row. The film, directed by Frank Darabont, certainly has its moments of brilliance, particularly in the performances. Tom Hanks delivers a solid, if not slightly underplayed, performance as Paul Edgecomb, a prison guard who discovers something extraordinary about a new inmate, John Coffey, played by the late Michael Clarke Duncan. Duncan's performance is the heart of the film, bringing a gentle giant to life with a touching sensitivity that resonates throughout.However, where ""The Green Mile"" trips over its own feet is in its pacing and length. Clocking in at over three hours, the film sometimes feels like a marathon with emotional and narrative peaks and valleys that don't always align. The supernatural elements, while intriguing, occasionally clash with the film's more serious themes, leading to a tonal imbalance that can be jarring. It's like the film isn't quite sure if it wants to be a profound statement on the human condition or a fantastical tale of miracles behind bars.In summary, ""The Green Mile"" is good but not great. It's like a well-prepared meal where the chef can't resist adding one too many ingredients, leaving you appreciating the individual flavors but unsure of the overall taste. While the performances, particularly by Duncan, are commendable, and the emotional beats often hit hard, the film's overambitious length and tonal inconsistencies keep it from being the classic it strives to be. Worth a watch, but maybe split it into two sittings unless you're up for a cinematic marathon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

One of the Best Movies Ever,"My personal favorite movie of all time. How this didn't win Best Picture is beyond me. Just over three hours long and never feels like an endurance test. Not a single scene is wasted in this riveting saga of humanity and emotion.A raw and powerful study that forces one to look beyond the skin at such eternal issues as life and death, faith, the human condition, the innate goodness and evil of which humanity is capable, guilt and innocence and penitence, and criminal justice and capital punishment. So broad is this movie's scope that we see the value of life in everything from a creature as small as a mouse to as grand as a human.We see the power of kindness to make a difference in the end and of wanton cruelty to make just as big of a difference.This is a prison movie that forces a rethinking of the genre. We don't see good prisoners and barbaric guards like in Cool Hand Luke or The Shawshank Redemption. But it is not merely the opposite either. Humanity and barbarism are on both sides of the bars - from guards Paul Edgecomb and Brutus Howell doing everything they can to foster a calm environment (Edgecomb likens death row to an ICU in a hospital) while guard Percy Whetmore sadistically abuses a vulnerable inmate over and over and disrespects another inmate's body after the execution. At the same time, with the prisoners we have John Coffey's gentle nature, Eduard Delacroix taming a pet mouse and Arlen Bitterbuck reminiscing about his youth contrasting with the violent and maniacal behavior of William Wharton.Complexity abounds.Viewers will cry at some deaths and pithy emotional observations and will feel just as uplifted at some of the more miraculous scenes, rays of light in the darkness.An emotionally draining experience that will stay with you long after viewing.

Good story. But more like a play than a movie,"First of all, I must say that I have not read the novel. And after watching this movie, I had an indescribable feeling, perhaps that is the success of the movie, it makes the viewer have the same feeling as the reader. The actors' performances are very impressive, combined with the detailed and clear characterization of each character, creating a very realistic story. I also have the feeling that this story is inspired by some real event. Damn. The film's story also arouses curiosity about the meaning of life and death, as well as its message about race, which is very appreciable. With a backdrop where evil people are executed, most of the scenes in the film honor kindness and humanity, a very contrasting situation.However, what makes me unable to appreciate the movie is that I like stories that bring the viewer's emotions to the peak, something I didn't have when watching this movie. All the dialogue scenes in the movie somehow made me feel like I was watching a play. There are very few unexpected scenes or twists, everything is arranged so carefully and the story is not too unpredictable, it can be said that it is quite simple. The fact that a mouse gets so much attention right from the start makes it feel like it's a fairy tale for children, when in reality it's not. In reality, the actions and words of people like Percy were considered quite normal in such places. This unintentionally makes adults who don't have much ""poetic kindness"" find it quite funny in a way.What made me a little unsatisfied was the character John Coffey when he was about to be put in the electric chair. If he had a line like ""I know my time has come. I can see it"" or something similar, old Paul's last line about everyone having their own ""Green Mile"" would be more convincing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

You got me on why this movie is critically acclaimed...,"Upon reading that Tom Hanks was in another ""Oscar"" worthy movie, I decided I needed to see it.  This was four months ago.  This much oscar hype about a movie should have tipped as to how boring this movie would be.  Not since the ""English Patient"" have I been this bored with a movie.  Using that formula, I guess ""The Green Mile"" will win 9 Oscars. I'm not really sure what exactly bores me about this movie, but I'm pretty certain I can pinpoint it to the mouse ""Mr. Jingles"".  This mouse takes over way too much of the movie (precisely 1 hr of the movie is the guards chasing the mouse and it's relationship with the inmate played by Michael Jeter).  I have never read the book by Stephen King, but it has been pointed out to me that the mouse plays a much more important role in the book.  The book explores the relationship between John Coffey(whose initials, ironically, are J.C.).  If Durabont would have done this, the movie would have been four hours. There is nothing special about the acting here.  Tom Hanks does not, I repeat, DOES NOT deserve an Oscar for this picture.  It's nothing I haven't seen before by Hanks. Edgecomb is a combination of his ""Saving Private Ryan"" character and ""Forrest Gump.""  The one actor that does have a breakout performance is Michael Duncan Clarke.  His portrayal of John Coffey is the one reason I didn't walk out half way through the movie. If you have three hours on hand and want to watch a movie about a mouse, go watch ""Stuart Little"" twice.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Love Frank Darabont,"As a matured adult I experienced the film very differently. On the surface level, this film is about the brutal murder of two young girls which led a black man to be falsely accused of the crime and sentenced to death. The film delves into the relationships formed between the prisoners and the officers in charge, and the realization that he may be innocent of the crime. However, beneath the surface, the film is riddled with deep symbolism that makes it incredibly difficult to watch.The selection of cast members for this movie was expertly chosen - each one bringing a new layer of humanity to the overall story. Tom Hanks was breath-taking in his portrayal of Paul Edgecomb, the head guard on the mile who was greatly affected by the magical presence of John Coffey. Tom captured Paul's inner struggles beautifully and brought the character to life.The late Michael Clarke Duncan, who played John Coffey was mesmerising and I could not take my eyes off of him. His muscular physique and rough exterior made him perfect for the role but it was his ability to embody the mysterious and often naive nature of John Coffey's character that should have won him an Oscar. His character's growth throughout the film and his ultimate realisation that the only way to escape this unpleasant life is to go through with his execution are what made him so heart-wrenching to watch.Moreover, the underlying symbolism in this movie was expertly hidden and handled with care. Most notably was Mr Jingles, the little grey mouse who befriended inmate Edward Delacroix and offered him some relief from the pain he was facing as his impending execution was fast approaching, symbolising the child-like nature of the human spirit and our longing to cling to life. I found their interactions very heart-warming but it was his brutal execution that awoke a sense of hopelessness and sadness in me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

a wonderful movie adaptation,"The Green Mile is based on a 1996 Stephen King novel of the same name. Done three years after the book release, the Green Mile was nominated for four Academy Awards, which included Best Supporting Actor for Michael Clarke Duncan, Best Picture, Best Sound, and Best Adapted Screenplay.The movie was directed by Frank Darabont who also developed the screenplay of the movie under an eight week period, an adapted screenplay that i have to commend as one of the best i have seen, but it lost in the Oscars to the movie The Cider House Rules. Frank Darabont was also in charge of directing the critical acclaim The Shawshank Redemption which also earned him a nomination of best Adapted screenplay in 1994.The high point of this movie will be the whole movie itself; i happen to have read the book before seeing the movie so watching a well adapted novel on the silver screen made me feel like i was reading the book all over again.The movie plot and the story itself are based on a flashback of a tale Paul Edgecomb was telling an old friend about his time as a corrections officer in charge of death row inmates in the Cold Mountain Penitentiary in 1935.The cell block Paul (Tom Hanks) worked in was called the ""Green Mile"" because the condemned prisoners walking to their execution are said to be walking ""the last mile"". Here, it is a stretch of faded lime-green linoleum. The other guards which were Paul's friends in the movie were Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell (David Morse), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery DeMunn), and Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper).In addition to the guards was Percy (Doug Hutchison) an arrogant misfit who took pride in terrorising the inmates.Everything in the cell block was as usual until the guards got a visit from two inmates who changed their very view of life itself.One of the inmates that visited was John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) a giant of a man who had some weird miraculous power ability to heal and feel the pain and sufferings of others and the other was ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Sam Rockwell) who was a psycho, murderer and paedophile.Their arrival was plagued with chaos miraculous healings and with the addition of Percy it became a handful for the other guards.The Green Mile is a movie i have seen over and over again, and i believe you will enjoy watching it too.www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

"With Talent Like This, How is it So Disappointing?","In a year with so many wonderful, original, intelligent films, I expected The Green Mile to  deliver as well.  I left the theater in a daze at the 3 hour running time, and utterly disappointed in the film.  Let me just say that I thought that the film was very well cast, and the direction from Darabont was actually quite good.  What was lacking was a good, intelligent script.  If you break it down, there is not really an original idea in this entire film.  It's like King and Darabont watched as many prison films as they could, and stole all the good ideas.  If you don't believe me, check out Birdman of Alcatraz.  They even stole from their previous collaboration, and far superior film, The Shawshank Redemption.  This script, and story in general, also lacks any true heart or emotion.  The characters are paper thin, and we are told which ones to like and hate.  The filmmaker does not give us a chance to choose; the bad guys are totally bad, and the good guys totally good.  Plus, all the big so-called ""emotional"" scenes are totally contrived and completely phony.

The best film I've ever seen,"I was 12 years when I saw it for the first time. When I went into the cinema I had no clue what's gonna happen and what's this movie about. My Dad suggested watching it and I agreed because I admire Tom Hanks.But what I saw blew me away. I've never seen a film that was so amazing. In general I'm not a very sensitive person who cries often, but since I watched it for the first time I've been crying anytime when I saw it.After the I had seen the movie I read the book and it was the first time that a movie was as good as the original story. It's also very hard to to as well as Stephen King and to produce emotions and fear like he does. But this very movie succeeded in doing both.It's also because of its great story and its amazing characters. The whole movie is not just about one single person as you might think. You get to know about the story and the situation and the destiny of every single character.It was the first movie that made me cry. When you watch it you just don't simply ""watch"" it. You become part of it. You can feel the anger and the hatred that is felt by the wardens against this damn Percy and you can fell the pain John Coffey has. It touches you so much when Coffey says that he never had a friend to tell him where they should go. You wish to be his friend. You wish you tell him that he's the most fantastic person you've ever met in your entire life.The end drives the emotions to the peak. John Coffey: Sorry for what I am. What do you say, John? You are one of the true miracles! Don't apologise for yourself.

So much wrong here,"Comparisons of The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption will be inevitable: same author, same director, similar settings.  But where Shawshank was an inspiring story of one man's believable struggle to keep hope and follow his dreams, Green Mile resorts to magic and sentimentalism to make a vague, sappy point.Believe it or not, the ""point"" of this overlong artificiality is, simply put, some folk good and some folk bad.  It tries to be a stirring parable of accepting people for who they are, not what they're supposed to be, but several factors water it down.  The most glaring flaw is that the entire story hinges on a supernatural element.  How are we supposed to draw insight into our own lives from a movie that so heavily relies on fantasy?The characters themselves are two dimensional stereotypes.  You've got your good and fair cop here, your bratty and abusive cop there, both watching over a weepy gentle giant and a mischievous hell-raiser.  But there's never anything revealed about these characters' pasts, nor insight into their motivations.  Throw in a subservient and acquiescent wife, a put-upon yet diplomatic warden, a hard-nosed trial lawyer and a lovable, feisty trusty for nice scenery and you've got the entire scope of this film.  There is very little character development, either.  The only evidence we have of any characters' development is the maudlin lines they say the same way they say them throughout the entire movie.All of these glossy, plastic elements in a film with a subject as controversial and sobering as capital punishment borders on the appalling. The film as a whole feels detached from the real world, and when the explicit violence that occurs is perpetuated upon cartoons, the film itself becomes a cartoon, too.  It rings hollow.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

A soon to be classic movie.,"The Green Mile was definitely one of the best movies of the year. With the character driven storyline, all of the characters played well, to the mix of joy, laughter and sadness. This is one of those movies where every single actor puts their all into their craft. It was interesting that this was taken from a book that Steven king wrote being that it seems he writes a lot of horror and thriller books. I did not get a chance to read the book but i have heard it is almost perfectly taken from the book with just a few parts taken out that didn't improve the movie. Some people have complained that it was too long around 3 hours but i believe that is what made it even better. the way the story flowed and the skills of the actors the movie did not feel like it was slow and dragged on. The movie wasn't about the friendships on the green mile but it was more of a miracle of a man and the people he effects. When Michael Clarke Duncan's character gets convicted of a crime and is placed on the green mile everyone is in awe of not just his size but how humble and mild mannered he is. When a few miraculous events take place the guards start to think he has magical powers gifted to him from god. With all the things the happened and his attitude the guards start to doubt that he did the crime he has been convicted of. The message I got from this was that there is clear that there is injustice and the miracles can happen in the unexpected of places. One thing I also noticed was the depiction of the relationship of the guards and inmates. They all seemed like friends they seem to have been treated with respect and dignity and because of that they seemed to not have as many problems that you may have in other prisons. Weather that was because of the beliefs of King or the director or both that we should treat our prisoners better so that they don't end up back in prison and not as violent while they are in it. This film will get you to think about its subjects and gradually build on you. This will be a movie that will be hard to forget even after the credits have ended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"The Green Mile (1999) - Three Hours of Circus Mice, Electric Chairs, and Dry Sponges!","Frank Darabont, the extraordinary director of the hit ""Shawshank Redemption"", comes back to the big screen with yet another adaptation of another prison drama novel by Stephen King. This time, the story is ""The Green Mile"", and this time he has the help of Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan joining a powerful cast that also includes Bonnie Hunt, Michael Jeter, and Sam Rockwell. The movie stars Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, an officer on death row, with a serious bladder infection, who rounds up a new suspect named John Coffey, portrayed by Michael Clarke Duncan, a man with mysterious immortality powers, that may have been accused for the raping and killing of two innocent girls. The movie follows as a dramatic and entertaining tale of hope, faith, and courage. Darabont brings back the lucky charm used in ""Shawshank"", but this time he combines real life with fantasy, and creates a story of miracles and dreams. Anyways, the film has powerful backgrounds, and the film focuses on the story with lots of drama and thrills, and the script is more well-written since Shawshank was well-written. The special effects are amazingly realistic, and the story is like a special charm from the heart. I really enjoyed this film, and it's fun to watch it again and again.

Typical US cinematic naivety,"When I watch films like the Green Mile I feel absolutely furious. Mainstream US cinema industry has unfortunately bombarded us with products (I cannot treat them as artworks) of very low quality, to be consumed immediately and provide some instant but short-lived gratification of the senses. Such films trigger shallow reactions of fear, sadness, sympathy etc., but never stick to mind and will never become points to which one would return at leisure to ponder or draw meaning for one's own purposes. Extraordinary and unrealistic situations, special effects, obsession with violence and cruelty, cheap morality and ostensible moral struggle and (on other occasions) sex are the ingredients of 95 per cent of such products. I am deeply sorry that these so-called artists seek to maximise profits at the expense of their art and I hope that they sometime wake up, if they ever can, to complex social realities and relations and to the multiplicity of the human condition, which they so obviously ignore and downgrade.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"""...but sometimes, oh God, the Green Mile is so long...""","Well-acted, nicely shot, and at moments quite moving, ""The Green Mile"" is ultimately undone by its staggering 188 minute running time.  Such languorous pacing adds nothing to the film - except fuel the audience's irritation with an unforgivably predictable plot and some pretty heavy-handed moralizing.  Darabont tries his best to wring some significance out of King's story, but the material ultimately proves to be too slight: this tale could have been capably told in 100 minutes or, better yet, deployed as a 20 minute ""prison life"" vignette in a film such as Darabont's vastly superior ""The Shawshank Redemption.""  Dragging it over three hours stretches the material too thinly, and in the end leaves a potentially deep story looking rather shallow.  This is a good lesson in filmmaking: you can have a fine director, a savvy cinematographer, a marvellous score, an excellent cast, and $60 million to play with - but if you don't have a decent screenplay, then you might as well stay home.  Just ask Kevin Costner.   5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Overlong and too worthy but still a good story  just don't expect it to be anything like Shawshank 2!,"Now a resident in a rest home, one time head warden on death row, Paul Edgecomb, is struggling with his untold memories.  When a film brings it all back to him he recounts the story of the time when a huge black prisoner called John Coffey was put into wing.  It is not too long before the peaceful, loving prisoner, found guilty of the rape and murder of two children, has mysterious gifts that transcend the decay of the lives around the prison.After Shawskank Redemption I was attracted to this as many of the makers were the same not to mention the author, the prison setting and the running time.  However that same running time and some negative reviews put me off and I didn't get round to seeing it till recently.  The film is very slow and this is occasionally to it's detriment but not too often.  It's main failing is that it's supernatural spin makes it difficult to get involved and lose yourself in completely.  `Redemption's ` strength was that it was a human story.  Green Mile tries to have the strength of human spirit at it's core but it doesn't quite come off.That's not to say that the story still isn't moving and involving because it is.  However it doesn't come as easily as it should and when the story slows a little bit it does feel slow.  It could easily have lost 30 minutes as at it's current  length it feels like a long movie which is a bad thing  Two Towers is long but didn't FEEL long!  Also something I always find annoying is when a score really works the emotion where the actual film can't manage it by itself  here the score is working overtime to wring every drop of emotion from the scenes.The film is very well directed and there are powerful moments of cruelty. When the chair is used I couldn't help but feel that it was real.  However the main attraction (other than the mouse!) is a wonderful performance by Duncan.  True there is an element of slave cliché about it but he rises above that a gives a performance of such emotion and such gentleness that came as a surprise from someone of his build.  Hanks is also good and wisely plays it quite low-key and the support cast is solid, comprised of many many well known faces including Morse and Cromwell.Overall this is good but overlong.  It is a very different film from Shawshank and many will compare it to that much better film.  However the film is worth the work despite some simplistic errors and flaws.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"Well crafted, but sometimes rather over the top","This movie is what I think is called a ""well crafted"" movie. It makes use of dramaturgy, camera-work and music effectively and some of the acting is really good. I particularly liked Tom Hanks in this one. But on the other hand, some scenes are well over the top, for example the visualization of the healings. Although the story is very emotional, the ""message"" is rather contradictory: How can you promote ""the Good"" and at the same time subliminally justify violence in some scenes? Does the story make a statement for or against death penalty? The esoteric-religious background gets in the way of a reasonable evaluation of existential problems relating to real life.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Confused about its message,"So was this movie about a Christ-like figure who is killed because his actions are misunderstood?  Or is it about the guilt one man feels because he allowed someone innocent to be executed?  Or was it about what happens in to people who do not speak up with the truth?This confusion is at the center of ""The Green Mile,"" a film that is wonderful in some place, but baffling in others.  I loved the prison guard characters, especially the empathy and ""humanness"" at each of their cores. They establish relationships with the death row inmates, and seem torn apart when one finally has to die.  I also thought the movie as a whole moved quite quickly through its 3 hour plus length.However, I am still quite confused after seeing it.  Was the prisoner with the healing powers supposed to symbolize Jesus Christ?  It seems this was the road the filmmakers were taking in the beginning, but then the character did certain things Jesus would never have done.  And what about the ending? This movie seemed to be moving toward a more upbeat, uplifting ending.  As a result, I couldn't help but feeling that the whole ""curse"" ending was tacked on and really did not have anything to do with the rest of the film.  I think this opitimizes the confusion it seems the filmmakers had about what this movie was supposed to say and stand for.""The Green Mile"" is not a bad film, but it should not gain that many Oscar nods.  I think the Golden Globes made the right call, it was a good film, but not one of the best of the year.  With a great year of films, including ""American Beauty,"" ""The Insider,"" and ""The Man on the Moon,"" ""The Green Mile"" does not cut it as one of the best of the year.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
1.5 hour movie stretched to 3 hours,"I don't understand why this movie is so highly rated.  I suspect it's partly a christian-thing given the theme and all.  Not being raised christian it doesn't connect with me.  But regardless, the movie has several problems:First, every scene is twice as long as it needs to be.  Also include many formulaic scenes when I the moviegoer was supposed to go ""ooh ahh"" in wonderment, but instead I was so bored.  This film could have been 1.5 hours long with no loss of content.  Tom Hank's closing line is even something like ""the green mile can seem awfully long.""  Oh the irony.Second, the writers give the characters a handicap of being incapable of communicating -- JC rambles about ""helping people"" when he could simply say ""hey look I have special powers allow me to demonstrate.""  If I were in charge of sentencing, I could see myself putting him on death row too -- it is so frustrating.  The same frustration comes from the buildup to the scene with the warden's wife -- if Tom Hanks only lucidly told the warden what's up, they could've done the job in 5 minutes without any fuss.  Instead, they were cryptic and turned it into a 45 minute production.  What a waste of time.Third, the philosophy of the movie just doesn't seem right.  The prison guards all have super-cushy jobs.  Compare to the characters in Saving Private Ryan.  Which extreme commands more respect?  I don't see building heroes out of prison guards.  Similarly, the main character JC is wallows in self-pity.  Rather than be so depressed about the evil in the world, he needs to swallow it and go out and do something with his life.  Take valium if you have to.  If you're in trouble with the US government, flee to Yemen.These problems were on my mind every minute of the film.  Most likely you won't be bothered by them, given the ratings.  But to be safe, in case you watch The Green Mile and after 1/2 an hour you don't like it, turn it off you won't like the next 2 1/2 hours either.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Zap,I like the bit with the really really big man on death row,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
This was the last movie that I saw in 1999...,"...and I'd say that it was a perfect way to end the 20th century (unless you say that the 20th century ended in 2000). For years, movie adaptations of Stephen King novels bungled everything, but with ""The Green Mile"" in the hands of the man behind ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (also about a prison), it clearly had to be good.In case you've never read the novel - which I highly recommend - the plot has prison guard Paul Edgecombe (Tom Hanks) overseeing death row in a Louisiana penitentiary in 1935. When a very large African-American named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives, Paul witnesses some events that no one could ever imagine.This is the only which comes to my mind that I would classify as both haunting and heartwarming at the same time. Haunting because the prison's bleak environs drain all hope; heartwarming because of what happens in this particular prison. Both Hanks and Duncan turn in pitch-perfect performances, as do the other cast members. Bonnie Hunt as Paul's wife Jan, trying to cope with the effects that her husband's job has on their personal life; James Cromwell as Warden Hal Moores, doing everything to carry out his job but depressed by numerous factors; Doug Hutchison as despicable guard Percy Wetmore, who likes nothing more than to be as cruel as possible; David Morse, Barry Pepper, and Jeffrey DeMunn as fellow guards Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell, Dean Stanton, and Harry Terwilliger, respectively; Sam Rockwell as vicious inmate ""Wild Bill"" Wharton; Michael Jeter and Graham Greene as fellow inmates Eduard Delacroix and Arlen Bitterbuck, respectively; Patricia Clarkson as the warden's wife Melinda, afflicted by an awful disease; Harry Dean Stanton as loopy janitor Toot-Toot; and Dabbs Greer as the elderly Paul Edgecombe. Gary Sinise all appears as Coffey's lawyer. An 11/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Archetypal biblical-like theme of human nature,"I think this movie addresses a universal theme that's almost biblical in nature: Man is basically evil. He will manufacture and rationalize in his own way to distort good (in this case a good man named John Coffey) into evil (Jesus Christ suffered the same fate.) The question pose by this movie as we identify with the main character prison guard Paul Edgecomb(Tom Hanks) who is in the position as a modern day Pontius Pilate is this: When we are faced with what is told to us and packaged to us as evil, and we discover to the contrary, are we bound to be an agent to evil or do we have the backbone and strength of spirit to expose the wrongdoing and act on our principles for what is right? Life is a test and we will pay a dear price for bad choices with our conscience for the rest of our lives.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Epic Story of Prison Life,"The Green Mile is a great movie, almost epic in length but it never drags. This story of prison life consists of a series of episodes and scenes that are woven together to tell the experience of one man who spent a number of years working with inmates on death row and another man of great physical presence whose heart was larger than life. Some of the most depraved behaviour comes from one of the guards, who is bent on inflicting as much suffering and humiliation as he can get away with. I would point out that it is a movie that deals with the supernatural, so realism is not a factor in assessing the movie. However, we do see human nature at its best and worst. The best examples shine because of the extreme depravity and sadism that we experience. It is not a movie for the faint of heart; it is based on a Stephen King novel. King is not known for shying away from graphic descriptions of violence or what others might describe as ""being in bad taste"". So this movie brings those literary images to the screen. On the other hand, we also witness supernatural scenes but they are not treated as a normal part of the action, as in many modern ""thrillers"". I was tremendously impressed by Tom Hanks' performance but all the cast made a great contribution to the show. It is certainly a great movie, albeit with a confused ending. Despite that, I would gladly view it again.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Ensemble Performance,"Ensemble Performance (n): Wherein all elements of a stage play, film or other suchlike entertainment deliver together, all participants contributing equally as their characters allow, creating a singular and powerful presentation.The above is my own ""definition,"" if you will, but that's how I feel about The Green Mile. From Tom Hanks to Michael Clarke Duncan to David Morse to Doug Hutchenson in the major roles to elements as small as James Cromwell's warden or Gary Sinese's cameo, no one and I mean NO ONE ""phones it in,"" or merely goes through the motions.Also appreciated was the pace of the film. Some complain that three hours is too long. I submit that to allow the characters to unfold at the pace of the South in the 1930's, to get the depth and breadth of them, three hours was necessary. For myself, I started watching it of a Saturday evening, thinking I'd ""spot"" through it. The three hours flashed by. Frank Darabont creates the reality of a Louisiana prison in the 1930's, sets the stage with the characters of Paul Edgecomb, Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell, Eduard Delecroix, Arlen Bitterbuck and Percy Wetmore. Into this menage he weaves the magic of a simple black man, John Coffey (""like the drink, only not spelt the same""). The impact Coffey has on Paul Edgecomb, on Warden Moores's wife, on a mouse named Mr. Jingles, indeed on the entire Green Mile ... is a source of wonder in the story-telling that makes this period piece the marvel that it is.Also very worthy of mention is Thomas Newman's brilliant score, which brings blues and prisoners' chants and multiple flavors and nuances to the table, as much a part of the ensemble as the above-listed characters.Keep in mind, this is no action-packed, whiz-bang, shoot-em-up piece of eye-candy. It's a beautiful, detailed and subtle piece, not much like any other piece of Stephen King I know of other than ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (which I've yet to see, believe it or not!). And it's a piece I've repeatedly enjoyed for the quality of its production and the power of its performances.I recommend it heartily. Please enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Not a Character was Wasted,"The Green Mile was a tremendous movie. That's no news flash as it was nominated for four Academies and it won a host of other types of awards. And let's not forget, as of this review, it sits at number 45 on IMDb's top 100.The story was fantastically done. A man (perhaps) that can remove illness and injury from people and animals is arrested for murder. The dynamics of the story are further amalgamated by the fact that this man is Black during the Jim Crow era and he is accused of killing a little white girl.The acting was superb. Tom Hanks around this time was just hitting homerun after homerun. Philadelphia in '93, Forest Gump in '94, Apollo 13 and Toy Story in '95, Saving Private Ryan and You've Got Mail in '98, then Toy Story 2 and The Green Mile in '99. All of his performances were stellar. But the X-factor, the dark horse in The Green Mile was, the now departed, Michael Clark Duncan. An ex-bodyguard turned actor, he did a wonderful job as John Coffey.This movie evoked a myriad of emotions. Anger, joy, hope, and sadness. The various characters in this film all offered something.

"An excellent, unusual, disturbing and thought-provoking film","Without prior knowledge this long, long film threatened me with a late, late night. I started it with prejudice and with reluctance. Prejudice perhaps because the mere idea of death row is horrifying in itself, and to make a movie that is set right in and on death row sounds unappealing - and it is exactly that at first sight. But the quiet dignity of the boss warder (Tom Hanks) is convincing and compelling.In juxtaposition to the 'quiet man' was the wimpy, nasty little thorn in his side - Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) playing another prison guard. But as a vicious, sadistic little bastard who wants to inflict his own punishment on others because of his warped view of life and his own insecurities. Well enough played for one to develop a keen dislike for him within minutes of clapping eyes on him.Set in a time not long after Fred Astair and Ginger Rodgers this film plays out the agony of seeing a huge black man brought onto death row as a convicted murderer of two little blond girls. Even his defending council says the he is guilty and never to be trusted - not even for a moment. Implying that if Hanks is foolish enough to trust him he will regret it. Despite that Hanks takes the risk and pays the price in an unexpected way.This huge black man excellently played by Michael Clarke Duncan cures the ailing Hanks (he has a urinary infection in the days before antibiotics) just by a laying on of hands. Hanks accepts this as a miracle, but he then sees further evidence of this huge, gentle giant's miraculous powers.With a real sense of claustrophobia the scene of the nasty guard, Percy Wetmore being punished by his fellow guards is not for the squeamish. It will worry me for a time to come.The agony comes when the black gentle giant carries out further miraculous acts and yet is still not saved from the electric chair. The ironic 'punishment' Hanks receives for not saving him from his execution turns on its head what most of us would value greatly. It is both a sad, and yet at times a darkly humorous film, but at all events not to be taken for granted nor dismissed easily.For me this was one of the most compelling films I have seen in a long, long time. If you only watch films just to be entertained, don't bother. If you watch films just to be excited, don't bother. If you watch films because you want to be transported to another time and another place and want to experience the moral dilemmas of some good men and to see the actions of some evil men then this will hold your attention from start to finish.

Magnificent ...A splendid movie,"The Green Mile is a movie of emotions, a movie that leaves a life lasting experience and above all a movie that keeps you involved in till the very end. Director Frank Darabont does take his job seriously. The events in the movie take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at ""the mile"" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.The action done by each and every person is fantastic, specially John Coffey (Michael Duncan) who plays a little less prominent role in super hit movie Armageddon. This movie is all what a classic should have. It's not a special effects action or adventure.

I definately reccomend this movie to anyone, as long as they have the stomach for the executions. Cheers! xxmoviexqueenx315xx",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"Not bad, but overrated","Another insanely overrated movie from the nineties. I'm not saying it's bad, it's kinda almost good, but looking at the ratings and reviews you could think it's something out of this world, while in reality it's just a simple fine movie. You can almost always predict what's gonna happen next, the story is basic and pretty boring I'd say, cinematography is pretty good though. I never really had any strong feelings watching this, and 3 hours for a plot like this is just way too much. So yeah, I think 7 is the most appropriate rating I can give to this film, you should watch it at least one time, just to see what's it all about, but don't expect anything exceptional.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
A Great Film Experience,"The Green Mile is one of those films that makes you feel proud you went to the movies to see the picture.  Why?  Because The Green Mile has it all: Drama, Romance, Comedy, and everything else in a movie that makes it a masterpiece.  Especially the acting by Tom Hanks as the pleasent prison guard and more especially Michael Clarke Duncan as the miracle prisoner John Coffey (like the drink, only not spelled the same)and he not only gives his best performance yet, he gives probably the best performance of the decade. Add that plus a great score, great story (three hours gives it time to expand) and great direction (by Frank Darabont) and you got a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Predictable,"At some point, not far enough into the movie, it was pretty clear to me what the outcome would be.  Maybe it was just me, but after the ending was clear to me, the movie just seemed to drone on, and dramatize on.  It seemed determined to take the long way around to the ending.Maybe I'm just unfortunate in having my idea of how it would end up be exactly what happened.  To me, it seemed like a lot of attempts to dramatize a thin plot, and put touches on it to make it seem profound.  Apparently, it worked for many people, unfortunately not for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
It's not a great film just because they made you cry.,"Nice packaging, but too much of it. Typical Stephen King story, well-told but not much weight.  Full of stereotypes and predictable good guy/bad guy stuff.  I loved Tom Hanks in ""Philadelphia"" -- that was a challenging role and he performed it magnificently, with depth of character, pathos but no sentimentality.  Ever since, though, he's taken on one interchangeable role after another. Enough, already. The sad thing is that I truly CAN believe that almost 50% of the IMDB voters so far rate this very average and over-long film as a ""10"".  Excellence apparently is a function of the volume of tears they make you shed.  I say, ""make you"", because I think this film fully intends to manipulate emotions -- the emotions of white, comfortable, middle class Americans who enjoy cheering for the oppressed, simple but pure of heart big black man who is abused by Southern crackers.  Aren't we glad we're not like that? Yet again, a black man gets to be a parody, not a person.  We white folks don't have to be afraid just because he's big and black, see, 'cause he's really a Jesus figure (""J. C."", his initials).  What a relief. Still wouldn't want him living next door, though, would we? All in all, good actors playing two dimensional roles. In the real world, as Kosovo and Northern Ireland and Rwanda show, we're all just a hair-trigger away from being cruel.  Let's have more films that recognize that there are few good guys and bad guys, just a whole lot of us doing the best we can and trying to do it right.  That's too complicated for most Hollywood types, and doesn't usually make much money. ""Dead Man Walking"" was ten times the film that this one was, and even it wasn't a ""10"".""Besieged"" and ""The Informer"" were so much better than ""The Green Mile"" that to mention Oscars without naming those films is ridiculous.And that's all this middle-aged long-time and ardent lover of films has to say.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
One of my favourites,"I think I would go as far as to say that this is one of my favourite films. I love that it's a simple story of right, wrong and the goodness that some people can hold that is so strong it's magical. I recently read The Green Mile book and I can't think of any other book to film adaptation that is more faithful. About 90% matches up perfectly. The only things removed were some scenes in the nursing home that reminded Paul of Percy which didn't affect the story at all. Michael Clarke Duncan is excellent and understated as John Coffey, a role that could easily be too overplayed in the wrong hands. The Green Mile is a classic film that will never age.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Awesome.,"After many years, and hundreds of films, I really thought that The Godfather was the finished article, it couldn't be bettered.Until that is, I bought The Green Mile on a whim.I confess that I am a huge fan of Stephen Kings early work, Carrie, Salems Lot, The Stand,( in which Gary Sinese is tremendous)Christine,etc. Although in my opinion, most of his writing since Misery has been pretty grim.This is very different indeed.As an example, when I bought the film, I came home and stuck it in DVD player, just to watch the first 15 minutes, to see if I could get a grip on the plot. I was concerned that it would be another Geralds Game or Delores Claibourne and would be better in the bin.I watched the first 15 minutes and checked the clock, and found that 50 minutes had passed!!.  As i had to go work, I Left it alone.Later I watched it with my wife, and when it was over, we watched it all again.This without doubt the best film I have ever seen.  I have recommended it to numerous people who have, without fail come back to and said ""what a film , this is the best they have ever seen"".Tom Hanks is excellent, and in my opinion gives an Oscar winning performance when he is not even on screen!!, in a portion that he does with John Coffey ( Michael Clarke Duncan), Who tries to explain himself to Hanks.The opening part of the film, where a posse is searching for two missing girls, is frightening when they catch up with Coffey, you could see someone shoot Coffey, and it wouldn't have been out of place.David Morse is very good, as always, with a dry wit, that permeates through his role, similar to Victor Borge in a lot of ways.Doug Hutchinson as Percy Wetmore is tremendous, if ever i wanted to give someone in a film a punch in the face, he is the one. He plays the slimy, backside kissing, hateful, know it all to a tee.The only flaw I could find in the whole film was James Cromwell.  He played his part very very well indeed, but every time I see him in a film, I think of him as Zephram Cochrane in Star Trek - First Contact, Boogying hid brains out.This is an awesome film, without doubt the best of them all, better than the Godfather, not by much, but better, if you haven't seen it, watch it, and then , watch it again./",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
The best movie I have ever seen,As we all know the acting of Tom Hanks is exceptional. But in this movie he nailed it with his calmness. The story of tue movie is heart touching and peaceful. A great work of art,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Deeply moving film worth watching,"This movie makes you wonder how many innocent people have been executed.  I found strong religious symbolism in John Coffey to Jesus Christ in that Jesus performed miracles and he too was put to death despite his peaceful and innocent nature.  I do believe images from the movie will stay with you long after, but not in a bad way.  I didn't think the movie pushed a viewpoint regarding death row convictions in one direction or the other, but just made you think about the judicial system.  Maybe DNA testing would have freed John Coffey if the year was 2004, but I think he would have been implicated in some way, maybe as an accomplice, since people judge each other based on appearances.  There was one very nasty character in the movie who most people would agree deserved death row. But of course, is the satisfaction of putting down the vile murderers of the world worth the life of even 1 innocent person?  What if that innocent person was you?",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Something about this movie doesn't quite add up,"What's wrong with this movie?  The acting is first rate.  The direction is sure.  The camera-work, particularly given the use of limited locations, is worthy.  It must be the plot and characters!  The whole piece is soft-centered.  This in itself would not be catastrophic - one has come to expect excessive sentimentality in American movies.  But the surface is soft also.  These people are all one-dimensional and the story plods towards its inevitable conclusion. The only time the film ""threatens"" to take a real grip on the viewer is in the all-too-brief Gary Sinise scene. But then nothing happens as a result ... the Tom Hanks character has to get on with his job.  Oh, really!  Better than average, certainly - but one of the top 250 of all time, I don't think so!",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
this film is too long,"Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, and now The Green Mile.  They all begin with old croaker characters who begin to tell us a three hour story. Unfortunately, they come back at the end of the film as well and are sometimes nominated for Academy Awards.  Too bad the stories can stand on their own without these unnecessary flashback structures.  In this case, the sequences which take place in the present and are the bookends of The Green Mile ruin the film.  They tack on a good 20-25 minutes and the audience gains nothing for their extra time.This is an average good film.  I had to give it a 7 out of 10 because people are being too easy on it.  Better films about prisons include:  Bad Boys and Dead Man Walking, both with Sean Penn, Shawshank Redemption, and Cool Hand Luke to name a few.  This film joins End of Days (though is obviously much better) as films that mess too much with religious symbolism and are too obvious with it.  John Coffey is a goofy Jesus Christ, one who sucks the tumors out of one woman only to spit them into a troubled man.  The real Jesus Christ would've been more forgiving.If we spent less time with Jingles the Mouse, less time with the old croaker actors (the woman is really bad), less time with everybody but John, this would be a much better film, and no longer than 130 minutes.  While a good effort, this had better not be this year's best picture.  And please, Tom Hanks has enough oscars.  Let Jim Carrey and Kevin Spacey duke it out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Sometimes the mile is so long..,"That's the last line you hear in the movie, and, well, it sums up the entire film pretty nicely. TGM never ends.

I understand sticking to the original source,but was it all so necessary?? The supporting cast is very good,especially Percy and Brutal,and there are 2 or 3 moments that remain with you - the 1st electrocution scene, for example.

It's no Shawshank Redemption but it's still worth the watch,"The Green Mile wasn't as good as the shawshank redemption but it was still worth the watch. It was good because it began as your average prison start that didn't exactly blow me off my seat but it the gradually became more and more interesting until it eventually began to become a bit stupid when the guards discovered that the man on death row had some powers.The story is about an execution place where everything is normal until tall, mean looking, colored man enters and the saying don't judge a book by it's cover definitely occurs with this film when he touches everyone's heart and the workers there start to query the execution of the tall colored man.I'll admit that when the guards call out ""Dead man walking down the green mile"" it does become quite upsetting for the characters that you have just gotten used to are becoming executed. The acting is very, very good which should have won some awards.I'm not overly keen on the fact of the powers that the colored man gains powers, I found that that turned a normal movie in to a weird movie and those two certainly do not go well together. The directing was fantastic because the picture looked brilliant and the it also gave the depressing mood that it aimed to give.The Green Mile is certainly as I have already explained very different to your average film but still give's that upsetting atmosphere that it was aiming to give.

If only the mile day in gym was watching this...,"SYNOPSIS:
Everything begins to change for the guards on death row when John Coffey comes to the green mile. Unexplainable events start taking place that change their lives for the better and for some... the worst.REVIEW:
I have to start off by saying the acting in the film is incredible. Something you expect with a cast like this. Tom Hanks, David Morse, James Cromwell, Michael Clarke Duncan and the list goes on. Sam Rockwell is one of my favorite actors working today and he plays Wild Bill so well. I also really loved the performance by Doug Hutchison as Percy. You can really feel the tension of the room when Percy walks in. Then I swear Michael Clarke Duncan has to restock on fluids heavy after losing as much as he did for this film. The man can cry for days I couldn't believe it. Then Tom Hanks had me feeling his pain when trying to pee, I started sweating myself. If you've seen the movie you know what I'm talking about. The direction by Frank Darabont was done really well. He had very good timing and kept the flow of this 2 and a half hour film smooth. I do have to say that there is an element of this film that took me out a little. When the unexplainable events start taking place I was down a little bit. I like when things stay grounded and realistic and so for me, I was slightly disappointed. Other than that, there's not many bad things to say about this film. One of the last scenes of this film was beautifully acted and delivered from Darabont and left a good taste in my mouth. For that, this is a definite recommend. 7.6/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Enjoyable and beautifully filmed moral tale,"I watched the Green Mile a few days ago and since then have come back to it twice. My children have sat through all three hours, silent, and obviously moved. While the magical elements are at times whimsical, the leisurely drawing of the characters and the sheer weight of Tom Hank's and the supporting cast's acting, ensure that what could have been an over sentimental movie leaves you with the feeling that you have spent a worthwhile 3 hours - a rare feeling. This is not a particularly challenging film - its treatment of the death penalty is ambiguous but this is not the real thrust of the plot - this is a film about people, love and moral conscience. Main criticism is the end - unnecessarily contrived adding nothing to the message.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Of mice and men... and murderers.,"That it should've been, at least.But let's start at the beginning, which is, I might add, terribly slow. A lot of time passes before something actually happens. King & Darabont use this time to carefully put their chess pieces in place before making their move in the last 60 minutes or so. There's a host of details during the first 2/3s that later become significant. And since I'm not one of those who need to see fireworks of action and suspense from the first instant of a movie, that's fine with me. After all, the pace increases considerably during the course of the movie.Some of these aforementioned details are so predictable that I could guess the next turn of events half an hour in advance. And that's never a good thing.The last hour, however, makes up for a lot of the film's former trappings. There's no arguing that the solution is quite touching.So finally, a movie worth watching, but there were still a few things that bugged me. First, I would've liked to know more about the inmates as murderers, which I guess they were supposed to be. (You never notice, though.) In the way they're portrayed, these are good, righteous people that are good friends with the wardens, love a cute mouse and are generally lovable. So- why are they in death row anyway? I understand the novel shed some light on this, and the film could've certainly needed some of this other side of the story to avoid some of the schmaltz.Second, isn't this prison just lovely? I mean, it seems like a camping tour at some points. If death row is like that, I want to be in it!If The Green Mile was supposed to make any statement about the right or wrong of the death sentence, you'd better watch Dead Man Walking to form your own opinion instead of being manipulated into believing that all killers ultimately become nice people once they're in Our Favorite Death Row. It works for tearjerking, but not for discussion of that subject.But, mind you, I couldn't help being manipulated myself- and it worked. I was genuinely moved at the end and, despite the occasional predictability, the story had its clever moments.So, it was an OK movie, at times even a bit more, but it sure didn't deserve its Best Picture nomination at the Oscars, and it sure can't hold a candle to King's and Darabont's first joint venture, the brilliant The Shawshank Redemption. 7 out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Miracles on Death Row,"Based on a novel by Stephen King and re-written for cinema and directed by Frank Darabont with Tom Hanks in the lead role in what I consider to be one of his best performances. During the 1930s, the lives of some prison guards on Death Row will be forever affected by one of the inmates: a black man accused of killing and raping two girls, yet everything indicates that this is the type of man who would never do such a thing.A very beautiful story and very well transposed into film that really manages to evoke feelings of compassion in the viewer; some of the more melodramatic scenes look a bit elongated, but the director surely did that on purpose as this is a drama.

An outstanding picture,"When I was going to rent THE GREEN MILE, I was doubting that I would like it because of the idea that the story couldn't be that realistic.

When I watched it, my whole attitude changed.Frank Darabont's vision of THE GREEN MILE is amazing in everyway. It is so touching. Children to elders will hang on to the very end to see what happens. We see what it is like to live in the south, in the depression, in a death row prison. Tom Hanks leads an outstanding cast including Academy Award nominee Michael Clarke Duncan as the gentle giant John Coffey, like the drink only not spelt the same.The makeup in this picture is just as amazing.

"a terrible would-be successor to ""The Shawshank Redemption""","I really wanted to like this film, I really tried to. But in the end I heavily regretted having seen it and personally I think of ""The Green Mile"" as the first appalling film of this year. This saddens me the more as the director of that film is Frank Darabont who brought us the wonderful ""Shawshank Redemption"". The parallels to his debut from 1994 are obvious: a prison story full of optimism(a friendship between the two main protagonists (one black, one white)) written by the same author (King) and again overlength (this time you've even got a running time of 3 hours+).I would argue that already the story itself is problematic in its conception: the characterisation is implausible. The prisoners (with the exception of one) are all portrayed as good natured men who obviously could do no harm to other people. It makes the fact that they've been sentenced to death for heinous crimes the more unlikely. For a grim and dark place like a prison the green mile is a unusual harmonistic place.This depiction of a prison and the characters is not just naive and almost laughable, it also reminded me of how more realistic and appropriate in such terms ""Shawshank Redemption"" was. People could say that the film generally is not very realistic since John Coffey has supernatural powers but I honestly think that capital punishment is a too serious subject to treat it as an element of a fairy tale. Moreover the film never questions the death penalty, the message rather seems to be that death row is a necessity. Again I was reminded of an another film, Tim Robbins' ""Dead Man Walking"", arguably one of the best and most important american films of the last decade(if you want to see an appropriate and artistic convincing account of the death row, then you're in for a treat).There's basically nothing to say against an optimistic approach when you're talking about such a sad, disturbing and important issue, but what made me really upset about ""The Green Mile"" is the unbearable extent of sentimentality and naivety in the film. Sure, ""Shawshank Redemption"" was emotional, too; but there it felt right, there Darabont managed to find the right tone - here it is just pure kitsch. When Coffey says towards the end something along the lines that people shouldn't treat each other badly and that he wants a peaceful world, I almost started to giggle. Moreover the contrast between the harmonistic, light- hearted scenes with the mouse and the execution scenes doesn't work at all, it destroys the film. Moreover these three scenes (particularly Percys revenge on Delacroix) are not justdisgusting(and believe me, I can really bear a lot),they perfectly fit into this unpleasant mixture of feel good- mentality and pathos. There were good performances in the film (Doug Hutchinson, the ""Polaroid Man"" from Chris Carters ""Millennium"", Michael Duncan Clarke, who made the best out of his cliche role), but in the end I didn't care about the one or two good things I could say about this film. And Tom Hanks? Well, Hanks should really try something new-he's played the clean, good-natured guy so often, that it starts to get on my nerves and not just on mine.I just can't put into words, how much better, how superior ""Shawshank"" was than ""The Green Mile"". The difference is not just striking, it really hurts. When I was watching ""The Green Mile"" I heard people in the audience crying - I was tempted too, but not because I was moved, no, in my case it would have been out of sheer disgust. What a missed opportunity...",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Why don't they make movies like this anymore?,"Absolutely one of the best movies of all time!!! The storyline, the adaptation, the directing and acting ensemble was just magnificent!

I could not understand in 2000 how it did not win or get nominated for more awards!! Hanks wasn't even nominated for an Oscar? Probably because 3 wins in-a-row would be unheard of! It's crazy how Stephen King, the master of horror novels has had many great screen adaptations, but his 2 best were prison based flicks, Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile .. with the same Director I might add!

A Wonderful Watch,"I was thrilled watching the Green Mile. Such a brilliant story seldom comes around and having acting and direction to match is a miracle.The movie featured a diverse lineup of talented actors, and having Frank Darabont as a director helped bring them to life and provided great scenes typical of the 1930's.I was particularly impressed by the settings for the films. They mastered American ranch life in that time period and I always felt like I was in the era.Stephen King obviously influenced the supernatural features of the movie, which were put into screen format brilliantly.As I said, A Wonderful Watch. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"The Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best.","The Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best. The depth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering excellent performances. There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. He brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.The Green Mile should bring you joy, laughter, and if you are like most in the theater this night, tears.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
One of the greatest movies i have ever seen,"I have been thinking of watching this movie since 1 year, & i thought why this movie is on top of the list? However, i am really amazed after watching this great movie. All the actors in the movie fit perfectly for their characters & they really did an extraordinary job. At times, i feel like why did not i get bored of watching a movie with a run-time of 3:00 hours? because every player in the movie was absolutely amazing. Michael Duncan was exceptional & Tom hanks did justice to his character as well. Although, i really feel sorry for Michael Duncan RIP, Nevertheless, John Coffey will always be remembered in our lives just like in the movie as an AnGel :) In a nut shell, this movie is about GOOD vs EVIL, & it conveys the message that TRUTH shall always prevail & EVIL must die.Amazing work!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Will be considered a classic in years to come.,"I own this on DVD + I don't think I will ever get bored of it, it really is a fantastic film. Tom Hanks is showing good form, and Michael Clarke Duncan is probably the only actor in the world who could have played John Coffey so well. All the characters are well thought out and portrayed, and you really begin to feel a closeness and familiarity with the prisoners, and the officers working at E block. From Brutal, Percy, Eduard Delacroix, Wild Bill etc, all the characters are real, and the part where John Coffey is showing Paul Edgecomb how the Katie and Cora really died, it really is chilling and will send a shiver down your spine! I don't think this movie got the credit it deserved when it was first released, but in a few years this will be regarded as a classic, beautiful film - and it is hard to find fault. People talk about it being too long, but I think this type of film needs to be. A great film!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Good movie,"The Green Mile takes place in Texas, USA at a prison of capital punishment. Paul Edgecomb is one of the guys who works at the prison. One day a big man named John Coffey come to the prison. He has been convicted for the murder of two young girls in a nearby village. But his personality is far from a cold-blooded killer. Edgecomb gradually begins to warm to Coffey and begins research as to where he came from and considers the fact that maybe he didn't commit this terrible crime at all, especially when he begins to see the miracles which emanate from Coffey's vicinity.Paul Edgecomb is the first main character of the film. He's called boss by his partners and he's a very self-controlled and sympathetic man. He has a serious urinary infection and hasn't had the courage to go and talk with a doctor. Maybe he's afraid of hearing that it's incurable.John Coffey is the second main-character. Even though he is convicted for murder he seems to be a very calm and peaceful person. He has magical powers and his actions are synonymous with Jesus. Percy is the evil man in this movie. Actually he's one of the prison-guards but he's an immature and smug stripling. It's like he doesn't care for anyone and he does everything to satisfy himself.I think all movies are filled with several messages. So it's very hard to pick out a special message in a movie. In this movie I personally think it's that murderers aren't always bad people. Ed Delacroix is one example. He seems like a good guy in the way he takes care of Mr. Jingles and also in the way he treats Boss and his friends.Michael Clark Duncan gives an impeccable performance as the good-hearted prisoner John Coffey. Tom Hanks is a disappointment. He gives a rigid performance and is outclassed by the other lead-actors of the movie. I think a 2-times Oscar winning actor could have delivered a much greater performance. The movie is very boring in the beginning but after a magical healing of Paul Edgecomb's urinary infection the movie come to its turning-point. Overall the movie is good. It's a very good description on how it's to be on death row and i recommend it for everyone except those who requires realistic movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"Great intention, but too sketchy to deliver","It's amazing what Hollywood can do to a good book.  In an effort to make this a ""new age"" movie, Darabont stripped the book of its essential spirituality.  Whereas the book has several, specific prayers and a visible minister character, this PC version leaves out any specifics, in a seeming quest for the separation of church and mind.  This is not surprising, if you visit the official WB site, which has a link to a new age organization peddling a book ""Experiencing God without belief.""Many of the performances are exceptional, especially Doug Hutchison (Percy), who brought depth and finesse to a very difficult character.  King's compelling book is airbrushed and soft-focused out of leaving anything but emotional impact behind in a new-age soup of feel-good, feel-bad emotional highs & lows.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"Cookie cutter Christ-story, not what expected.","I went into this movie expecting a gritty drama or something about conflict of morals in a prison guard on death row. And this was reaffirmed by the fact that the director also directed Shawshank Redemption. What I got was a Stephen King-esq novel movie overflowing with lame symbolism and un-explained superpowers. In fact I know the exact point the movie turned for the worse. The first time John Coffey used his ""magic healing"" powers, I realized how lame this movie could be. Although I should have realized the clishe trip i was going to take when the movie opened with a flashback. This movie included most every dramatic clishe it could, including: old guy flashback, good natured guy (tom hanks) in a horrible place (the prison), and finally a christ story. But then what did you expect from Stephen King, an original story? This movie was a far cry quality wise from the excelent Shawshank Redemption, and shows that while Stephen King CAN write well a lot of times he DOES NOT. This movie was by far the worst of the christmas 99 releases. Save your money folks.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

One of the most penetrating films,"It's not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. ""The Green Mile"" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. ""The Green Mile"" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe. ""The Green Mile"" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from ""American Beauty"" in the best performance of 1999.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Puts audience's emotions on strings,"The Shawshank Redemption was a great movie - it had some flaws, most prominent of which was its tendency to manipulate emotions, but there was too much good about it for the bad to be glaring.But in The Green Mile, Shawshank's flaws are amplified.  Darabont pretty much maps out how the audience should feel at every point in the movie.  He never really gives the audience a chance to decide how they feel on their own.  Some scenes more than got their point across, but Darabont continued to draw them out, to make sure that even those that already fell asleep caught his drift.Which brings me to my other point - I have always had a problem with the MTV-generation of films that cannot stand still, but this film could definitely have stood further editing.I didn't think the movie stunk.  The acting was outstanding (despite Tom Hanks once again playing the nice guy role), and I did appreciate the shots of humor that kept the proceedings slightly more brisk than they should have been.  There are some standout scenes as well that perked me up amidst the sloggier parts.  In reality, it was just a movie that went too far too often to make the audience gasp.  The intentions were great, but the execution too heavy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"SUGAR COATED, SHALLOW, INFANTILE, PATRONISING, OVER-LONG HUMBUG","This is the worst film i've seen all year, in fact I thought it was aimed at children.  How anyone can call this a piece of uplifting cinema is beyond me.  Okay, Tom Hanks gives a pretty good performance for a one-dimensional do-gooder, but the rest of the film is pantomime of the cheesiest kind, Puss-in-Boots at my local theatre was less predictable. The characters are cliched stereotypes bar none.  We have good kindly guy, comedy good guy, insane bad guy, nice but dim black guy (particularly offensive for this millennium) which leads us to a tedious sermon on good v evil of the most simplistic sort .  The director is clearly living off his reputation, having directed the excellent 'SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION' and poor old Stephen King must be turning in his bed (hopefully he's recovered now). The best thing about the film is Mr Jangles the comedy reincarnating mouse who makes a glorious reappearance in the final reel with slightly longer fur.  The death of Mr Jangles earlier on in the proceedings probably arouses more sympathy from sentimental American audiences than the sight of nasty prisoners frying in 'Old Sparky'.  Please go and watch 'Midnight Express' instead for a slightly more realistic representation of prison life. Risible.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Most emotional film I've ever watched,"This movie is a masterpiece, plain and simple. It is well acted, has a beautiful story, a fantastic ending and is extremely emotional. I'd like to focus on the latter, and if you want a more ""normal"" review, there's plenty of those on this site. Let me tell you about about three ways this movie absolutely toyed with my emotions in ways I did not expect;1. It made me cry more than Forrest Gump. This is truly a feat, and a record I thought never would be broken.2. It made me despise a character even more than Joffrey from Game of Thrones. Yet another truly hard task.3. It made me walk away from the screen with my ears covered and eyes closed, for the first time since I was little. I just couldn't stand the shocking brutality of what I was watching.This raw emotion is what I believe is the true strength of this film, and what sets it apart from other movies.

An Outstanding Movie,"I had rented this movie along with ""The Shawshank Redemption"" to watch over the Christmas holidays since I had never seen either one before.  I watched ""The Green Mile"" first, and although I feel that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the greater movie, ""The Green Mile"" is an outstanding movie in its own right.Frank Darabont shows why he is one of the best screenplay writers/directors with this movie.  Despite being over 3 hours long, this was a movie that constantly kept your attention.  Tom Hanks, as always, gives an outstanding performance, but the real star is Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey (""same name as the drink but spelt not the same"").  David Morse, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, Michael Jeter, Barry Pepper, Patricia Clarkson, and even Gary Sinise and William Sadler (who also with Jeffrey DeMunn appeared in Darabont's other classic film, ""The Shawshank Redemption"") in bit roles give memorable performances as does Doug Hutchison who plays the weasel, Percy.Yes, it has more ""fantasy"" elements to it than ""The Shawshank Redemption"", but it is based on a Stephen King work.  And as much as I loved Shawshank, ""The Green Mile"" is DEFINITELY the sadder movie.

A Brilliant Cinematic Triumph,"The first time I saw this movie I had flicked it on about 20 minutes in while it was playing on the History channel. I was working on a school project at the time and I turned the television on just as a little distraction to keep me entertained abit. I kept the movie on for about 45 minutes until I realized just what I had accidentally tuned in to. I forced myself to turn the TV off because I knew this was a movie one needed to watch and devote all their attention to - and if I would have kept it on my project would never of been touched.About a week or two later I found myself with an empty Saturday afternoon, I sat down to watch a little TV. To my unexpected surprise The Green Mile was airing again on History channel and I caught it about 20 minutes after the part I had originally left off. I simply had to watch the rest of it, and quite quickly, the movie I suspected to be a deep & powerful story evolved into so much more.When the movie ended I sat through the credits unable to move, paralyzed in awe. The story was unbelievably powerful, messages were abundant, acting was terrific, cinematography was outstanding and I simply can't praise this movie enough. Keep in mind I missed the beginning of the movie and a small portion of the middle and this is the way I feel - as soon as I get a chance I will buy this movie and watch it through fully. It shook in a way very very few other films have ever managed to even come close to and I immediately knew the answer to that perplexing question, which before this experience I never believed was answerable: If you could only pick one movie to ever own and watch for the rest of your life, what would it be?Do NOT let the runtime scare you (I have always had a mean bias against movies running longer than 2 hours) it will be over much sooner than you want it to be. Watch this movie alone with no distractions.

Fantastic and fabulous !!!,"I saw The green mile yesterday, and wow I was very astonished. This is really a fantastic movie and sometimes I had the envy to cry when seeing it.It relates the story of Paul Edgecomb, a former warden who witnessed during the Depression miracles in jail which changed his life forever. He met John Coffey, a physically shaped and tall prisoner who was wrongfully accused of the murders of 2 little girls and unfortunately sentenced to death. This guy, a very kind person despite his threatening shape, was in reality a healer who cures with Faith, and he did miracles, like resurrecting a mouse who was crushed by a rebellious warden, curing the wife of Edgecomb's friend (who was in the death article) and of course curing Paul's painful urinal infection.But the most important thing that happened, is when Paul took the hand of John Coffey after he resurrected the mouse. It gave him almost immortality, cause in the end, Paul Edgecomb told his girl friend that he was 108 years old, and I was surprised for a man who takes walks outside with such shape and age. Unfortunately, all of his friends he had and loved, including his wife, died while he grew older and older.

Another Superb Cast in the Powerful and Magical Green Mile,"The film business is certainly going out of the 20th century with one hell of a bang.  1999 has had an astonishing amount of excellent films with some of the most powerful acting that I can think of.  Just trying to keep up with the slew of great films is a full time job and here at the tail end of the year comes another superb, if slightly flawed piece of filmmaking, ""The Green Mile"".  Like 1994's, ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Green Mile"" is adapted from a Stephen King novella and directed by Frank Darabont, who also directed ""Shawshank"".  The Green Mile of the film is the section of the Louisiana State Penitentiary for death row inmates. Tom Hanks is Paul Edgecomb, the head guard of death row, who is battling a nasty urinary track infection, a sadistic guard (Doug Hutchinson) and the crew of inmates, particularly the nasty William ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Sam Rockwell).  Enter into Edgecombs life, but a new prisoner, John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) who has been convicted of brutally raping and killing two young girls.  A seven-foot gentle giant, Paul is convinced that Coffey is not capable of harming a soul, especially after witnessing his unique healing powers that can't be explained.  The more Paul gets to know him, the harder it is for him to walk Coffey down that green mile.""The Green Mile"" is somewhat sentimental and predictable, a tad bit too long, starts off at a snails pace, plus the one prison guard is a typical stock villain and the mouse bit (a very cute one to boot) goes on a little too long, but this film is good old fashion story telling with some great acting to help it rise above its minor flaws. It is a powerful and mystical tale that shows the best and worse in humanity.  Much superior to ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Green Mile"" is one of this years best films that relies on great writing with potent acting. The acting is pretty much flawless and Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan are being mentioned for Oscar time.  Both are very good, especially Hanks, who gives another great performance as Paul, but it is Michael Jetter who deserves the Oscar nomination for supporting actor as inmate Eduard Delacroix.  Jetter, a veteran actor of film, stage and television (Evening Shade), gives a brilliant performance creating a very memorable character.  It was not till part way through the movie that I realized that the actor was Michael Jetter.  It will be a major disappointment if he is not nominated; it is a remarkable performance in a film with some of this year's finest acting. David Morse (St. Elsewhere) as prison guard Brutus also does superb work. This fine actor should be working much more; he is totally captivating while on screen.  Overall this is some of the finest ensemble acting this year.Tom Hanks has good instincts for picking great roles in very good films and ""The Green Mile"" shows him at the peak of his career.  If only more of today's ""movie stars"" could follow his lead.  ""The Green  Mile"", another great film to end 1999 and this century.

"Good, but...","After Darabont's excellent ""Shawshank Redemption,"" ""The Green Mile"" is somewhat of a mixed blessing. It's a good film, but falls short of the high expectations many people had for it. While comparisons are inevitable, it's best not to worry too much about the issue. They're just different stories with similar settings. Still, one must wonder if Darabont is destined to be typecast as a director of Stephen King-related prison movies.Putting all that aside, it's a good story, to be sure, one that affirms ""Shawshank's"" theme of hope being found under the most difficult circumstances. At times, the film does hit the mark perfectly, be it in a manner that is wrenching, touching, or even magical. The botched execution scene is as terrifying as anything in a traditional horror movie. On the other end of the spectrum, the miracle scenes are a joy to behold. Duncan's performance as a wrongfully accused man with a gift is nothing short of heartbreaking at times. Hanks, Morse, and the rest of the cast deliver solid performances.I just wish it was a tighter film. The midsection does tend to drag at times, with some characters taking up too much unnecessary screen time. This is especially true of the William Wharton character, one of the most hateful ever to appear in any movie I've seen. However, the final hour is nearly perfect; classic Stephen King.*** (out of ****)Released by Castle Rock through Warner Bros.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

"Good, but let's not go overboard","I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  The acting and story were both much better than I thought they would be.However, I do not really agree with the view that Oscars should immediately rain down upon this for a few reasons.  First, the screenplay, while certainly entertaining, has all the originality of a Disney script.  This is not to say it's bad; I just thought the movie was extremely predictable. In places, it even lapses into cliché.Second, while Tom Hanks and company do a fine job of acting, none of the roles were particularly difficult to play.  All of the characters (with the possible exception of John Coffey) were extremely one dimensional.  Half an hour into the movie I knew how each of them would handle just about any situation-- there was none of that ambiguity or uncertainty that can make a character not just an image but an extension of the audience.Finally, the directing is also good, but not spectacular.  While this movie script may be more challenging than most to shoot well, I think our director again lapsed into clichés with some of the screen shots (for a good example, pick any of the bird's eye view shots with the camera slowly moving up. Apparently the director is fond of these, as he also was liberal with them in The Shawshank Redemption.)Overall, this is a good, entertaining movie, but if you want an Oscar winner, walk over to the next screen and see Being John Malkovich or American Beauty.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

The rare film that succeeds in spite of itself,"When just about everything else comes together in a movie, gaping flaws in the premise can often be overcome.  Such is the case in Frank Darabont's second Stephen King prison adaptation, The Green Mile.  It's not just that it's hard to believe a mob of white people with shotguns would have turned a suspected black child killer over to the authorities in 1935 Louisiana, but this is a questionable plot point to start a goofily supernatural story.  This is not to say that a movie can't be done well if it features a Christ metaphor (E.T.) or a somewhat off-the-wall supernatural happening that even the characters seem to be having difficulty reconciling (Field of Dreams), but The Green Mile does not carry its premise as well, in no small part due to how ridiculous it looks when Michael Clarke Duncan grabs Tom Hanks for a minute and then expels a whole bunch of black things.  (Apparently all illnesses are caused by evil and not, say, bacteria or viruses.)Regrettably, The Green Mile doesn't quite get past the goofiness of the story.  It has some decent (if obvious) lessons to offer, but they're somewhat obscured by the heavy-handed allegory.  The game cast, led by a strong Hanks and filled out with numerous solid performances, does what it can to make up for that problem - and they're mostly successful, also helped by good cinematography and an atmospheric score by Thomas Newman (though Darabont might have avoided some of the inevitable comparisons to The Shawshank Redemption - not nearly all, but perhaps some - if he hadn't hired the same composer and then allowed him to make half his cues sound pulled from the earlier film).The film's earnestness as regards the story is almost its undoing, but the cast and crew mostly bail out the narrative shortcomings.  The film doesn't even drag at over three hours, which is impressive.  The Green Mile is truly a best-case scenario for defining the term ""elevating the material.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Politically correct nothingness,"""The Green Mile"" tries hard to be a nice movie, to steer your emotions, to feel along. Etc. Everybody who is nice simply is nice, character depth is secondary. What completely ridicules the entire thing is the influence of fantasy elements to enlighten the atmosphere. Not only is everybody nice, but heah, with some special abilities they are even nicer!Technically the movie is of course well done. Camera, lights, everything is in the green. Unfortunately that doesn't make a good movie, when characters are simply created to fulfill general expectations. Although this simply seems to be a routine production to appeal to mass audiences, anyway, and of course it hits right on the target. That Hanks was in for a role here is understandable - his main aim nowaday seems to be building up his reputation with the Academy. For Duncan the decision was probably more difficult, he got to play the usual part of the black country guy. But a chance to get a role in a ""made to please the academy"" film is a hard thing to refuse, esp. when your co-star is Hanks and a name like Stephen King stands for the novel.It is much more reccomendable to watch ""Dead Man Walking"" for a good look on the topic, but of course if you felt along with the characters in Cameron's ""Titanic"" this is your thing to go for.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

However, the Southern accents in this movie are the worst I've ever heard and that genuinely takes away from the movie an amazing amount. The accents are absolutely obscene, which is too bad. American actors not from the South almost always get them wrong and British actors do so much better at the Southern accent. Maybe some linguist can explain this phenomenon. The attempts in this movie are pitiful, especially the laughable attempt by David Morse, who I usually think is great.

Rarely does a movie force the viewer to suspend disbelief,"Rarely does a movie force the viewer to suspend disbelief, The Green Mile is one of these cases.  This movie is about some unbelievable events, yet the acting in it is extremely believable.  This all star cast of hardened veteran actors puts together one of the most impressive, emotional, and realistic performances I have ever witnessed.  Surprisingly, the most powerful performance comes from a relatively unknown Doug Hutchison, he plays the nephew of a government official that you love to hate.  And believe me, you will HATE him. While the acting is phenominal, the script is creative and original; it pushes you through an array of human emotions. You'll laugh, cry, laugh some more, and really, really HATE Percy Wetmore. The only thing that I felt the movie lacked was surprises.  Just from watching the trailer, I was able to tell everything that was going to happen a half hour before it did.  This is probably due to the fact that this movie was based on a very popular book (which I haven't read yet) and the writer was assuming most people know the story and can't be surprised.

"He paid what he owed, he's square with the house again. Books to a movie and more.","There is a time in most people when their memories of a wonderful book is remembered because of how it made you feel and why. The length of this film is not a problem in that regard as it tells a story about life and death where the species of human beings can kill their own and with death, a debt is due humanity, but in what way or manner.We know various countries enjoy writers who universally cross the cultures with their words. With films, the same reasoning applies but in a more focused way due to time constraints in telling as best one can, the story behind a book, if that was indeed the force behind the media.While watching can sometimes be powerful and create a shock of conscience to many, most will agree they take the comfort of the movie when the book has been read and the reviewing forces, people, pick up on the details that follow on in a humane way.One observation indeed recognizes another observation exists as far as how to review a film about death row. The matter at hand for many will come in what was the doctors role in certifying on the spot the death of a human being at the era and time depicted in the media.You can relate to so many things when Stephen King is involved. His books have saved the conscience of many fans who recall the human condition and how well certain authors can do this while blending humanity across the globe with a compass, a square, and a book, a Holy book for so many.There is that opportunity to improve yourself by what you read, films and shows and documentaries you keep, and how you list them only you will know if you decide to mix up how and why certain films get inserted in one or more lists.That is one way to proceed which is why reading saved me at several times throughout life and now the films recalled reinstill love, several truths, and always a relief because of charitable means that preserve dignity and integrity noting prudence, temperance, fortitude, and justice which is why this particular movie is important.Thank you for the opportunity of reviewing films that matter, old and new, watched and ones to watch, in a life where we internationally prevail in peace and families with children who are most important in a life of ever changing circumstances in our climate and beyond in space where all living things are considered together as a supreme architect of the universe in authors, academics, governing leaders, scientists, engineers, and law, medicine, and objective nature scientists knowing physics and biochemistry includes all art and science disciplines of study because we learn about ourselves and what we do have in common that preserves us from evil and uninformed decision makers. Always, thank you kindly with civility and universal use of words put into action that makes a difference for our families, our countries, and our space exploration thinking about how we all would start out a civilization on another planet than Earth.Being a film lover, one who respects authors, actors and actresses, crew members who create with methods that continue to fascinate, and thinking about what is beyond, a NASA consideration that is universal and in my opinion fits with these continuing reviews because of international participants in the James Webb Space Telescope and what I call the Supreme Architect of the Universe.

This film IS a miracle,"I feel reluctant to compare The Green Mile with The Shawshank Redemption, because IMO the latter film is more about what it can be like in a prison, with sadistic wardens, etc, whereas in The mile the guards (save for Percy...) seem to have quite a tender heart, they're more humane. I don't think this is a repetition of a movie, to make an even better one.I think I got the message of the film after about 45 minutes; that there is so much hatred and anger among people, and that revenge is nothing constructive. A very important message which I think the film delivers brilliantly, with John Coffey as a ""triumphant card"". The supernatural effects in the movie might be unbelievable if you focus solely on them, but I think they're ""metaphoring"" and make things a bit more understandable, maybe.There are flaws of course in this movie as in every other movie made, but I think it is unfair to give it a bad review, as the message is so important, there is so much magic in the film (I was totally spellbound and numb at times, and also nearly cried my eyes out, esp. in the later scenes), and the acting is so professional. The fact that I also took the movie quite personal (I tend to be a prejudice and critical about ppl sometimes - don't we all?), made me love it even more.If you are not touched by this great movie, you must not have been watching it very carefully - ""reading between the lines"" - or you have a heart of stone (which I hope you don't :)An absolutely emotional experience: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Deep ass movie!,"The Green Mile"" is an emotional tour de force that leaves viewers deeply moved and profoundly touched by its powerful storytelling and exceptional performances. Adapted from Stephen King's novel of the same name, this film is a poignant exploration of humanity, compassion, and the complexities of good and evil.Set in a Louisiana prison during the 1930s, the story centers around the lives of the inmates and guards on death row, particularly focusing on the enigmatic John Coffey, portrayed with heartbreaking sincerity by Michael Clarke Duncan. Coffey, a towering and gentle-spirited man with supernatural healing powers, becomes the catalyst for profound change within the prison walls.At the heart of ""The Green Mile"" is the relationship between Coffey and Paul Edgecomb, the prison guard played with depth and nuance by Tom Hanks. Their bond transcends the boundaries of race and social status, highlighting the inherent dignity and worth of every individual, regardless of their circumstances.Director Frank Darabont masterfully crafts each scene with precision and sensitivity, eliciting raw emotion from the audience with every frame. From the quiet moments of introspection to the gut-wrenching tragedies that unfold, every aspect of the film is imbued with a sense of profound humanity and empathy.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its ability to confront difficult themes with grace and compassion. ""The Green Mile"" doesn't shy away from the ugliness of injustice and prejudice, yet it also offers moments of profound beauty and redemption that resonate long after the credits roll.The performances in the film are nothing short of extraordinary, with each actor bringing depth and authenticity to their roles. Duncan's portrayal of Coffey is particularly memorable, capturing the character's inherent goodness and vulnerability with heartbreaking sincerity. Hanks delivers a powerhouse performance as Edgecomb, anchoring the film with his quiet strength and moral integrity.In addition to its stellar performances, ""The Green Mile"" boasts stunning cinematography and a hauntingly beautiful score that enhances the emotional impact of the story. Each frame is filled with rich symbolism and visual metaphor, inviting viewers to reflect on the deeper themes of faith, forgiveness, and the nature of redemption.In conclusion, ""The Green Mile"" is a cinematic masterpiece that resonates on a profound emotional level.

"If this movie is this great, I have to see Shawshank NOW!","Well, its been 20 minutes since I finished watching ""The Green Mile"", and I am still trying to take it all in.  Now,  I don't really need to  get into the story as the last 700+ reviews have probably stated the plot for the whole film, so I'm just going to get into the pros and cons.  What is great about on the whole for this film is the character development.  I could comment on the actors whose names I can't remember, but Michael Clarke Duncan gives one of the most sympathetic performances in film I have seen. It is his performance which, ashamedly, brought this 18 year old male to tears, which is a hard task indeed.  The only thing wrong with this film, is the 3 hour time limit.  Simply put, the first hour is quite slow and drags on, but the last 2 hours gave everlasting questions about the world and life, forever on my mind.From what I've heard, this movie is from the writer/director of ""The Shawshank Redemption"", which I've heard is a far superior film, which if true, I must see. 9/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Very well made film!,"I was very interested to see this film, since I had no chance to see it many years ago when it came out.First of all Tom Hanks really sticks out from the other actors. He really is brilliant actor and here in this role he really shines! Other actors are OK, but he so much overshadows them that it really is interesting as a phenomenon.Plot has its ups and downs, I was not really thrilled with all that supernatural stuff, that healing and all. What I liked was the character build up and portrayal of the deep South mentality.I found the film a little bit too long.I can recommend this film but it is not a must see by all means. It is just a good film! If not for anything else it is worth watching for the acting of Tom Hanks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

"Not bad, but a little too desperate to please","The Green Mile was fortunate to have such an outstanding cast, because the material wasn't top grade.  It wasn't bad, mind you, but it was the typical wow, gee whiz, aren't we going to be a movie that will win Best Picture schmaltz that all the good directors occasionally release in a moment of Oscar avarice and weakness.The story was definitely engaging, but it was also trite and overly convenient.  Events seemed forced so as to allow for future events.  At times it felt like effect was driving cause and not the other way around.Still, the cast is without exception, *phenomenal*.  They take a mediocre script and even at times directing, and really turn it up a notch.The result: an above average film that's slightly pretentious, but does ultimately deliver much of what it promises.

Uncle Tom is now a faith healer on Death Row,"I was coerced into sitting through ""The Green Mile"" the other evening on video. Quite a watchable thriller, really, but left me very uncomfortable. I'm a white Englishman, but even for me the words ""Uncle Tom"" were hovering in the air and refused to go away. OK, the plot device of the automatic assumption of guilt and wrongful arrest of the big black guy only worked if he was black. But the - apparently surprising - fact that he could be huge and black but still ""nice"" then seemed to be a central part of the plot.The only thing this story reveals is the prejudice and bigotry of the writer and his intended audience.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

I want to also point out the incredible performance delivered by Sam Rockwell as a heartless, blood hungry maniac. I was completely blown away by the story and especially Ducan's character who looks like a brute, but, in fact is the most innocent man on the face of the earth.

"A Walk Through Pain, Redemption, and the Unbearable Weight of Humanity","Some movies entertain, some inspire, and then there are films like The Green Mile-movies that leave a permanent mark, too heavy to revisit but impossible to forget.Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's novel isn't just a prison drama; it's a soul-crushing meditation on kindness, cruelty, and the quiet tragedy of the world. Tom Hanks delivers one of his most restrained yet powerful performances as Paul Edgecomb, a death row officer who witnesses the impossible when John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) enters his life. Coffey, a gentle giant with a supernatural gift, is a man who carries both miracles and sorrow in equal measure, a character so pure that watching his fate unfold feels like a wound that never quite heals.The Green Mile itself isn't just a prison hallway-it's a path toward finality, a place where hope flickers only to be extinguished. Every step through it is slow, deliberate, and cruelly inevitable. The film forces you to confront the unbearable weight of justice, or rather, the tragic failures of it. The execution scenes are some of the hardest to endure, but none hurt quite like Coffey's. His final moments, his childlike fear of the dark, the soft acceptance of a world that never deserved him-it's the kind of scene that breaks you in ways you don't expect.Michael Clarke Duncan's performance is a quiet storm of emotion, carrying an innocence that makes his pain unbearable to witness. And yet, it's not just his tragedy that lingers-it's the small moments of warmth, the friendships, the fleeting joys within the cold walls of death row that make it even more heartbreaking. Even the villains in this story-whether it's the sadistic Percy or the monstrous Wild Bill-serve as reminders of how cruelty often goes unchecked, how the worst people walk free while the innocent suffer.I watched The Green Mile once. That was enough. At 30, I still don't have the courage to go through it again. Some films are too powerful, too deeply affecting to revisit, because you know the weight they carry. But maybe that's the mark of true storytelling-not how often you can rewatch it, but how deeply it stays with you, even decades later.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Almost a copy o Powder!,"In my ""Powder"" review I mentioned the similarities between this movie and Powder where the latter was even written years before this one was released. If you see both movies you will know what I am talking about. The most charming scenes in the Green Mile are taken from Powder. I am sure that all who watched both remembers quite well the scene where Powder makes the guy who hunts the deer feels the pain of the animal. Exactly same scene when Michael Duncan makes the guy who kills the mouse feel its pain. Another similar scene or idea is when Michael Duncan in the ""Green Mile"" heals James Cromwel's ill wife which is taken from Powder who helps the Sheriff's wife to deal with her dying process.I am not saying that the ""Green Mile"" is not a good movie. On the contrary, I enjoyed it a lot but Powder is a decent one and was made way before the Green Mile so it deserves to be praised being the original at least.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
A movie is only as good what you put into it,"First of all, this movie fails like most Stephen King conversions to the big screen. Stephen King is a horrible writer, one of the worst of the 20th Century. His base characterizations are like poorly sketched comic book characters. The only thing that saves this movie are the actors supporting Tom Hanks (Sam Rockwell and Harry Dean Stanton to name two). Tom Hanks has a great money making face but his acting is pretty bland and sub-standard in most movies. The writing, however, is just stupid as most King ventures. Grown men get scared and pee their pants and the ironies that he is able to present are so obvious they are like being hit in the face with a building (very BIG black man is a sweet and harmless innocent).

The Formula that works,"The movie was good. I enjoyed it on one level and was slightly disappointed in the turns it took. It touched themes of racism and even played upon our own feelings about color and mental illness. The movie tried it's best to walk the green mile of movie telling by making the characters either fully terrible or fully good. My only problem with this movie is the fact that a mentally challenged man of color could be allowed to be wrongly electrocuted for a crime against little white girls. All they had to do was let the warden and anyone else (even the parents) touch John and see the crime as well. To allow an innocent man to die and call it a tear jerker is beyond me. The scene where John walks in to the warden's wife's room was totally innuendo with overtones which were unnecessary. The editor pulled down her dressed after the shock factor. Why couldn't the big healer get exonerated and a twist be put on the old formula where John studies Holistic medicine and become ""Somebody""? I wonder when we will transcend the usual stereotypes and not let the societal monster live. King seems to paint his characters with wide brushes but the sacrificing of the same types of people become formulaic. Obviously in the thirties this was most likely impossible in Louisiana but it was also impossible to put a black prisoner with whites. I guess we believe what we are allowed to believe.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Moving,"This is a good film, primarily because of Tom Hanks' subtle ability to portray a man who is tough, hard, and duty conscious, and at the same time compassionate and human. This character reminded me of Hanks' portrayal of Capt. Miller in Saving Private Ryan. A few scenes are grisly, but the tone of the film is generally positive, and several scenes are surprisingly moving. The supernatural powers of one character stood out strangely in a film that otherwise seemed to be dedicated to harsh reality, but I suspect that was intentional, for contrast, and it worked.One detraction was that I had a nagging suspicion that Hollywood was once again taking an opportunity to promote it's sociopolitical views, on capital punishment, race, and regionalism, but maybe I have become over-sensitive to this issue. At least they did not bash Richard Nixon, but then, it was set in the 1930's.Compared to American Beauty, this was a better film. I gave it a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
A best picture nominee?  It doesn't begin to be worthy,"A film that is not worthy of the Best Picture nomination it has received. My biggest complaint is that all the characters are static from beginning to end.  Characters who are good stay good, characters who are bad stay bad, and no one changes - this is more a chain of incidents than a real ""story.""But, furthermore, as a representation of Death Row, The Green Mile comes off as artificial.  All the guards (save one) are essentially good-hearted, laid-back, and a little too generally relaxed for their occupation.  None of the inmates (again, save one) seem to deserve to be there.  It's a happy-go-lucky environment where they occasionally execute somebody.  What a statement (though, I do give the movie credit for at least treating the executions themselves seriously).And the mouse - goodness, the mouse.  I'm sorry, but I find cute, little rodents to be out of place in serious drama.  For the purposes of this film, I guess it's supposed to illustrate the humanity of one of the inmates, but it comes off as a cheap attempt to try and manipulate the audience into some kind of ""Aw, Shucks"" mindset.Not that The Green Mile is a bad movie, but it is nothing more than a mediocre, functional film elevated only by a fantastic performance from Michael Clarke Duncan (receiving the only Oscar nomination I think this movie warrants).

Beautifully acted, directed and written, now all of that aside can this movie be seen as anything other than a re-telling of the New Testament set in a prison???  John Coffey, first off let's look at the man's initial's for starters, excluding the fact that Paul (Tom Hanks) tells us that he's God's mircale worker, it looks pretty obvious as to the real identity of who Michael Duncan was playing :).  Next we have the apostle, aka prison gaurds, with Paul playing the role of Peter, who denies John Coffey the chance at freedom three times - and his punishment is to watch everyone die. (which I found to be the high point of the film).  Our beloved mouse-killer Percy is Judas, and Wild Bill and the french guy that owned Mr. Jingles were the two criminals that died with Jesus on the mountain - one of who asks for forgiveness, the other who doubts him.  Now as for Mr. Jingle - is he perhaps God himself?  Who knows....

"Not as great as the book, but still worth checking out.","While the Stephen King novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" translated into one of the greatest films of all time, ""The Green Mile"" (while a marvelous book and a pioneer in the art of story telling), fails to achieve the level of intensity and magnificence of the book.

The movie revolves around the relationship between the guard, Tom Hanks, and the inmate, dramatic-newcomer Michael Clark Duncan. Both of these actors do a fantastic job, while the supporting cast only improves the aura of greatness. So where does the grief lie?

He is the supervisor of all the executions. His assistants are Brutal, Dean, Harry and New guy Percy. Usually the death row is called as ""The Last Mile"" but they call it as ""The Green Mile"". Paul and his team believe in smooth handling of the prisoners but Percy is not like that. He is very aggressive also he is the brotherhood of state government politician.

He become pet for one of the prisoner named Eduard Delacroix who is going to die in few days. But Percy wants the front row of the executions. If Paul gives the front row of the executions Percy will quit his job and will join in Mental Hospital supervisor. During Del's execution Percy didn't wet the sponge which should place in the prisoners head. So Del execution went horrible. All were angry with Percy for this. After sometime John cures Paul's urinary infection and saved Mr. Jingler life. So Paul thinks he can cure Hal's (Prison head) wife who is having Brain Tumor. After that John also met his destiny. Then it leads to again the orphanage. Old Paul and his friend Eille went to Mr.Jingler's house (as Paul and Brutal promised to Del the build the House for Mr. Jingler).

Miles to go Before Hanks Sleep,"""When I stand before God awaiting judgment and he asks me why I let one of His greatest miracles die, what am I gonna say???? that it was my job?"" The Green Mile is not a movie for those looking to fill a couple of hours in meaningless, mindless entertainment. The fireworks and special effects here are scene enhancing, and not the main attraction.The movie is based on a novel by Stephen King (Who also wrote The Shawshank Redemption). While I have not read the novel by King, the movie introduces a fantastical element that ordinarily we wouldn't believe. I believe this film is not a study into miracles, although they occur. It is a study into the meaning of capital punishment and what it means to face death and life with complete knowledge. Choices must be made, sometimes, that stay with us for the rest of our lives. This film leads us through our own experiences and feelings on our own choices.The film appears to begin at the end. Death row, the green mile, Old Smokey, cells filled with men who have been convicted of horrible crimes and are confined here waiting the unavoidable conclusion. It is quite clear that some are guilty and they inspire our feelings of justice. It is clear as well. However, that others may or may not be guilty and inspire in us only pity or sorrow or compassion. It is human, all of it. Sick, well, giant, mousey. Good and evil. If you let it, it will make you think and it may even change your life.Tom Hanks shows once again why he is arguably the most celebrated actor of all times. Hanks tells his saga as an old man. Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb who is the chief guard in Louisiana State Prison's death row. Part of his job is to supervise the executions of the prisoners waiting to walk ""the last mile"", in this case called the ""green mile"" because of the lime green tiles that cover the floor of the prison. I hate people who give away too much of a movie in reviews so I never do that in my reviews and in this case I am tempted to tell you more but I feel those of you who haven't seen it I'll be spoiling it all for you....I have been inspired by movies in my life, but this is the first movie that I have watched where when the credits rolled I had an immediate insight into my own spiritual existence. This movie will make viewers think about their attitudes, spiritual integrity, and overall meaning for existence.Also be prepared for graphic death scenes, racial hate, moderate depictions of violence against children, slight foul language and no ""everybody lives happily ever after"" ending.

Percy was just as it was in the book, stubborn and full of an ego, That was preferably the best book-to-life form acting I have seen so far in my short movie sighting life.What would make this film better is a pure guideline set by the author Stephen King and also him choosing the characters he envisioned to play the roles of the actors.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

It tries TOO hard,"This starts off as a fine movie. Excellent acting, especially by Michael Clarke Duncan in a marvelous turn as a condemned saint-like man. But as the Steven King plot begins to thicken so does the layers of pathos laid on by writer-director Frank Darabont. This is not a bad movie but an unterminable one that tries too hard to be important. Three hours can make one weary of the best intentioned designs. Framed like Titanic I predict it will also be wildly popular. It seems we can no longer recognize when we are being fed a sour pill.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Great movie to watch over and over,"I watched this movie in theaters twice. I own the movie now and still can never watch it enough!!! This is one of the best of Steve Kings movie.Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. Sad that Michael Duncan is no longer with us!! But he was a great actor! Tom Hanks did a great part also. Mr. Jingles the mouse is great. how did they get a mouse to do all that?This movie is never boring and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long.

A Timeless Masterpiece of Emotion and Humanity,"""The Green Mile"" is more than just a movie-it's a profound and deeply moving exploration of life, death, and the human condition. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novel, this 1999 film delivers an unforgettable cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll.Through its slow-burning narrative, the film examines themes of justice, redemption, and the inexplicable nature of miracles.The performances are nothing short of extraordinary. Tom Hanks, as always, delivers a heartfelt and nuanced portrayal of a man torn between duty and morality. Michael Clarke Duncan's performance as John Coffey is hauntingly powerful-his gentle demeanor and tragic fate evoke a deep sense of empathy that lingers long after the film ends. The supporting cast, including David Morse, Sam Rockwell, and Doug Hutchison, add layers of complexity and authenticity to the story.Darabont's direction is masterful, allowing the story to unfold at a deliberate pace that enhances its emotional weight. The cinematography captures both the oppressive atmosphere of the prison and the moments of unexpected beauty and hope, creating a stark contrast that heightens the film's impact. Thomas Newman's haunting score perfectly complements the story, amplifying its emotional resonance.What truly sets ""The Green Mile"" apart is its ability to touch on universal truths while remaining grounded in its characters. It doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of life, yet it offers moments of profound humanity and hope. The film's exploration of morality and the possibility of the divine elevates it beyond a simple narrative into a deeply spiritual and philosophical experience.In summary, ""The Green Mile"" is a timeless masterpiece that transcends genres. Its emotional depth, stellar performances, and poignant storytelling make it one of the most moving films ever made. This is a movie that not only entertains but also challenges viewers to reflect on the complexities of life and the enduring power of compassion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

I love it!,"Frank Darabont's direction does justice to Stephen King's novel, but unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the men facing death row in the film. The movie reveals that, like in real life, there are good and bad men on both sides of the prison bars.The film's success is largely due to its character-driven story, with roles given to actors like Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, James Cromwell, Barry Pepper, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene, Sam Rockwell, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Harry Dean Stanton, all of whom have well-deserved acting pedigrees. I had never heard of Doug Hutchison before this film, but his portrayal of Percy made me feel disgusted, loathing, and outright hate towards his character.Despite the 3-hour runtime, the story never lost steam, and I felt that we were all better off for it. The story and characters are complex and multi-layered, and a shorter runtime would have done them a disservice. The film's magic realism kept me riveted to my seat, eliciting a sense of wonder and awe. Prepare to experience a range of emotions from start to finish.

The Illusion of the Silver Screen,"The Green Mile is on the surface a film by which young and younger audiences will share a common like for and indeed they will all provide the idea that is not in fact believed in.The Green Mile is a cold calculating imposition as to the state and its mandate to execute these individual's whom it has deemed worthy of dying for there crimes against society.There is also no redeeming quality in there sentencing as both the law as well as the state provide and in fact by virtue of the film itself deny the existence of a supra-natural creator.There is no hope in this film,only the death that it solemnly moves toward.There is a terrible mistake that audiences make when they see a film like this and that is to judge it as to society and the system which rules as possessing any moral belief in God or even of Salvation.This film is a very clear predetermined denial of the existence of Miracles and as well that a God in Heaven exists,or has ever existed.The inability of the films underpinning to provide a belief in the innocence of the character named Coffe-is so cold and even bastardly that this is thought to be the law when in fact it represents the getting of ones way and further it represents through the conduct of its officials,from rookie cop to prison warden the desire to maintain the status quo.The revelation late into the film of the real killers identity should of provided at least some effort to see that an innocent man does not die for a crime that he did not commit.One of the reasons that he did go to the electric chair was because he was the one they chose and come hell or high water he's the one there going to fry.The idea that he fell out of the sky as like a patsy was made very evident by the attorney who represented him.What suggested is that when the law says its got its man it means it.If the viewer wishes to include some ideas about racism I too will not ignore it because there are simply to many stories about the perils of this life not to listen to the evidence.However this is not the end to this story about the world we live in,it provides only the sure thing that any who find there way to death row will most surely die.This film provides a problem and that we as a culture live in a world that is ruled over by a system as well run by Laws and the people it employs to enforce those laws.There are a couple of areas that are worth mentioning,it is this reviewers opinion that one of the attractions of the film is of the emotional content which is exemplified by the miracles witnessed by these officials.The Hanks ordeal is real enough however it is the Wardens wife who believes and in fact provides a witness that is indeed a very worthy chapter in this movie presentation.The makers of this film were very conscious of appearances where we see the wife upon Coffey entrance into her room and the subtle attempts to alter her appearance without changing the scene.The not spoken of up to this point is Mr. Jingles and though this may in fact provide for amusement it is deadly serious.This film made certain that it was not stated out right lest it be against the law however even as of just a couple of days ago-appearing in the New York Times(this day being-Dec.12,2004)there was a graph of the percentage of DNA that is possessed by other species not being human.The mouse then and even now is recognised as having the highest percent of DNA seen to be exactly the same as the human being,that being 55%.What does that mean?it provides for the fact that there is no belief in the existence of Devine Creation and that the human kind literally evolves from the likes of a lower order of life.This film is more deadly then a bullet because its underpinnings are understated and not immediately perceived by there audience.The introduction to the film and as well the end to the film are in fact the answers and seem at first incongruent with the telling of this tale.What answers-The impossible idea of the existence of Mr.Jingles just so in that cabinet-it is so convenient not to be taken seriously and though the old guy is older its not a worthy thought of him being as old as he suggests.If I remember he suggests something in the hundreds and so on,however it to me is not to be believed in and it would seem that in fact there is an admission of actually trying to steal the thunder of Gods Mercy through the carrying out of the orders to execute Coffe.These are unjust and unfriendly neighbors and never the Twain shall meet.What we are asked as of all things to believe in, is Christian in its precept and yet does nothing to assuaged the heart of the human kind as to the very deadly and dangerous purpose had by this overseer as well by its system.When you play with reality this is the kind of review you get and I promise you there is a-lot more where this came from.This film is about stealing the life from the heart of the human kind and though not being of itself particularly inspiring it is also provides for a look see as to what was being stolen if not the heart of the matter and that might be the opportunity to do so-I think we are in fact looking at the profit motive and how deadly serious it is with reality in tow to get its way-This is not recommended viewing and in fact is a UN-American film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

This Film Has Been PERFECTLY Cast!,"As I reflect on the film, I keep coming back to one basic thought. It is the thought that struck me about 20 minutes in: This is a film that has been perfectly cast.It has been four days since I last saw Darabont and Tattersall's The Green Mile and it still hasn't quite all sunk in. I had read Stephen King's serials while recovering from back surgery. The week before surgery, my girlfriend told me that the people who made Shawshank Redemption were adapting another King story and that it would star Tom Hanks and that big guy from Armageddon. So, finding myself confined to my bed, I started reading. I was finished within a day.I like delude myself a little. I like to think I know a few things about film and I could be a director, you know? When I read good stories, I like to picture which actors would be good for which parts. It was the casting of James Cromwell as The Warden that iced the cake for me. That was one I didn't expect. I thought he would be playing Irish Police Chiefs until he keeled over. Not that playing a southern Prison Warden is casting against type exactly, but he still puts in a nice performance. As does everyone in the film. This must have been a fun film to make.The only thing that I didn't like about the film was that it explained too much to the audience. So much can be said with just shot sequence and gesture. Sometimes dialogue gets in the way of things that can't be communicated with speech.Still, I cried like Nancy Karrigan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
The best Stephen King's movie adaptation,"I'm a big fan of Stephen King, and had no idea at all that his installment novel, ""The Green Mile"", would be made into a movie when I chose the book as the subject of my thesis for university graduation.I like the story a lot. But I'm always being skeptical to every movie who's adapted from a novel. So, I watched ""The Green Mile"" with great fear, and when it finally ended, I was greatly relieved as it turned out to be what I had expected. Although there are some great scenes in the novel that's been taken away in the movie (it'll be longer if they were inserted, I know), I must say this is the best movie adaptation from Stephen King's book.Many well-known reviewers in my country think it was too long. I have asked my friends (common people) who watched it and all of them don't think so. It should be that long, for if it had been a shorter movie, I would have hated it. (Tell me, which scenes that must be cut from the movie?)I might not be subjective about it, since I'm a great fan of Stephen King, but how many stories in the world that tell about the beauty in the death row prison, and how such pure and innocent beauty (symbolized by the mouse and John Coffey) is mixed up by the brutality and unimaginable violence (symbolized by Delacroix's execution and Wild Bill)? Frank Darabont might not the best director, but he succeeds in transforming the essence of the novel and displaying it perfectly into the big screen. I could immediately feel the sadness of John Coffey at the first time he appeared in the screen only by his expression. I could feel the pain of Delacroix's execution (the scene I fear most, in terms of not conducted properly) through his screaming. And most important thing, I could feel the magic.The Green Mile is a great satisfaction and must be a perfect example of movie adaptation.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

"Nice try, but NO.","For anyone interested in seeing The Green Mile, I have a recommendation: stay home and watch The Shawshank Redemption for the umpteenth time.Frank Darabont had simply amazed me with The Shawshank Redemption, and so I had high expectations from this film, which came from the same author, same director, same screenwriter, and an impressive cast. In fact, it left me nowhere near tears, except possibly those shed for spending three hours wading through excessive (and missed) sentiment.Let me stress something. If you happened to like The Green Mile, I can understand...to an extent. In fact, if this film had been an hour and a half long, I would have left throwing Academy Awards at it. If such a film had been accomplished within a humane amount of film, I'd have been impressed. But accomplishing this little dramatically when dealing with such a difficult issue as the death penalty over such an immense amount of time is simply inexcusable.There are some individual performances that stand out, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan and David Morse's. However, they are overshadowed by Tom Hanks playing Forrest Gump a second time (although a little brighter this time) and two altogether too evil to be believable villains (played by Doug Hutchison and Sam Rockwell).I think this film had great potential after seeing it. Nonetheless, in its overzealous chase for Academy Awards, it ruined its own legitimacy and pounded the viewer with more and more attempts to suspend disbelief.I, for one, am like a certain character in the movie.

His performance as the lovable giant, his portrayal of innocence was perfect. I hated Percy's character which means the actor did a great job. Michael Jetar and Sam Rockwell were top notch. No actor played there part bad.The message of Death Sentence was throughout the film it really made me question about these issues. The later theme of dying early to escape pain and living immortal to suffer was poetically written and shownThe movie takes time to set up all character and slowly unreveals the super natural aspects, yet the movie doesn't go crazy with concept and stayes in the boundary of reality, props to Stephen King.3 hour movie but I don't feel it is that long as the story kept me interested.

A tantalising tale of a true miracle.,"If you're after a film that will grip your heart, mind and soul...then this would most definitely be it. Stephen King's genius is reflected in this thrilling screenplay, based on his book of the same title.Tom Hanks gives an impeccable performance as Paul Edgecomb, a prison warden, working on The Green Mile (death row). This particular year in time he is faced with meeting John Coffey - magnificently played by Michael Clark Duncan. Coffey is on death row for the murder of two young sisters, but his persona is far from that of a cold blooded killer, he simply seems to be a gentle giant.Edgecomb gradually begins to warm to Coffey and begins research as to where he came from and considers the fact that maybe he didn't commit this terrible crime at all, especially when he begins to see the miracles which emanate from Coffey's vicinity.Warden Hal Morris - played by James Cromwell - has a sick wife who is suffering from a brain tumour...helplessly he turns to Edgecomb for guidance. Would it be ethical for Edgecomb to lay this sick woman on the hands of a miracle worker...even though he is on death row?!?!This King chiller is definitely not for the faint hearted, it is both thrilling and saddening. The performances from Sam Rockwell, as Wild Bill Wharten, a serial murderer and lunatic gives the film an added dash of genius.Doug Hutchinson as Percy Wetmore, a mean-hearted warden provides public enemy number 1 for the viewers. His relationship with Eduard Delacroix, a pocket sized French prisoner is chilling and the viewers find themselves on the side of the miniature criminal.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Tom Hanks distinctive facial and voice expression fits very well in movie,"Capital punishment still remains as controversial issues although still some innocent people go to death row and bad people walkout fine. And someone who is watching the ball s**t as a witness can't do anything about it but comfort the prisoners until the final day. But watching actual electric chair execution is whole different story. Disregards of intensity of crimes he did, no guards can watch him being fried from the chair. That's why many guards are nice to prisoners in death row because sooner than later the prisoners will face worst treatment ever. In this movie, I can see guards and prisoners bond with friendship behinds the strict rules. Well, there are ass-guards in this movie and so there are full of revenges here and there in this movie.One last thought, Tom Hanks distinctive facial and voice expression fits very well in movies such as ""Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, Turner & Hooch"" where he plays with black characters as partners. It is fact that there are plenty of racial conflicts going around and perhaps this movies (where he is in) can lighten up people.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Come on Frankie! What were you thinking?,"This movie was probably one of my biggest disappointments of the year. I went in expecting a great movie. I am a huge fan of The Shawshank Redemption. But, what I got instead was an ok movie. Sure, Tom Hanks was good as the good ol' every guy (what does that make this, four in a row?). And yes the supporting actors were good (reaffirms my admiration for David Morse and James Cromwell). Michael Duncan was good as the ""I'm huge, but I'm just a child"" man. But all in all the whole thing just did not seem to come together.The ending for one thing felt like it was just tacked on because they had filmed it. And when it ended (or should I say FINALLY ended) it did just that. Just stopped no conclusion, no wrap-up, nothing!And I can't forget to mention the horrific scene of the execution . This scene was so over the top and gruesome that it totally through me out of the narrative and I don't think I ever really got back into it. King has shown that implied horror can be much worse than graphic horror. I know that many people will disagree, seeing as this is the the ""It's popular to like this movie!"" movie of the year.

Soporific epic has moments.,"This widely praised film deigns slowly, as a parent to a child, right up until its first execution, which hits the audience over the head with a scene of a violent, tremorous death and ensuing smoke wisping from the corpse's char-broiled body. It then resumes its gentle preach until the second execution, which displays, in lugubrious detail, flames ripping up the side of a man's head, thoroughly cooking his flesh and gassing witnesses out of the room as he screams and while the guards debate the matter.Special effects, like countless modern films, do not enhance anything but rather only distract. Patience while enduring the slumberous opening and the presentation of unimaginative characters, plus the exhausted screen writing standard of the old man telling his drawn out story in a flashback, is rewarded by a good scene of men crying and an inspiring last line.Many details were unnecessary, and at over three hours long, it seems someone released the uncut version by mistake.

One of the absolute best of King's adaptation to film.,An unbelievable story that would make any amateur writer feel a fraud this film stands shoulder to shoulder as one of Kings finest Works put the screen. If you haven't seen it The Green Mile is an absolute masterpiece of fiction and cinema only made complete by an Unforgettable cast. Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan give oscar-worthy performances in a Unforgettable story about death row inmates and the guards sharing in their day-to-day. King captivates in a story that is very grounded sprinkled ever-so-slightly with the supernatural that will give you chills. The Green Mile is modern-day classic and must watch for any fan of the one true King of Horror.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"Entertaining movie but with childish magical elements, failed to touch me","Let me start off by telling the positive: the movie didn't bore me like some other people said. Some scenes were funny and the acting was decent. Overall the movie was entertaining.But that being said, I really do not understand this movie being in the IMDb top 50. I found this movie disappointing because of the almost random magical aspect they added. Though this is symbolism or whatever you wanna call it, I didn't buy it. And neither did my friend. When the first ""magical moment"" happened we were like ""hmm okay, that's kinda lame/weird, but okay i guess we'll get it at the end of the movie"". Unfortunately that didn't happen and after the first magical moment, this movie just downgrades to a simple childish story of a person having some kind of superpower and the prison guards being amazed by it. To me it lacks meaning, feels way too random and the magical elements are childish. If I were still a kid though i'd probably be amazed too by the magic, just like the main characters. So maybe the target audience they had in mind were kids.This movie did entertain me but nothing about it was touching or shocking. I personally couldn't identify with John Coffey, because to me he's not human but some kind of superpower. This movie was supposed to be meaningful and touching, but it failed miserably hard at it for me, would not recommend unless you're kid or you don't mind the random magic they added. This movie could have been much better if John Coffey was portrayed as an actual human and they kept out the childish magic. But surprisingly a lot of people really like this movie and i'm the minority, so watch it and go figure it out for yourself!",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

This is a masterpiece and an absolutely must see picture,"The Green Mile (1999) is a movie I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a death row prison and the personalities in it, both prisoners and inmates. When a new, unique and huge black man arrives a series of miracles start happening around him. The prison employees look to use those powers in circumstances necessary...and on death row there's lots of reasons it may be necessary. Everyone there could use a miracle or two.This movie is directed by Frank Darabont (The Mist) and stars Tom Hanks (Big), Michael Clarke Duncan (Sin City), David Morse (12 Monkeys), Michael Jeter (Jurassic Park 3), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths) and William Sadler (Die Hard 2).This storyline is very unique and so well done. The characters are very entertaining and the backstories are well told and unfold well. The cast is really impressive, top to bottom, and everyone delivers outstanding performances. I wasn't sure who was my favorite character, Michael Clarke Duncan or the mouse. The electric chair scene were also amazing and very thorough. The circumstances were unpredictable and you never know what is going to happen next or how. The end is very fulfilling and clever.Overall this is a masterpiece and an absolutely must see picture.

A Powerful Film.,"The Green Mile was a powerful film. It is one of the best films of all time. The acting, it was a Oscar deserving performance. Michael Clark Duncan played convicted killer John Coffey and Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb. Duncan delievered a powerful performance. He has that child like look in his eyes, something most actors cannot portray. Duncan also portrays that innocence that only a child would have. In a literal sense, John Coffey was an angel.

"acting si, story no","I still don't know if I really liked the movie or just loved the actors and Tom Hanks surprisingly is not the strongest of these. The prisoners are such incredibly interesting people, especially the chilly ""Wild Bill"" and the crazy De La Croix. I didn't even recognize Patricia Clarkson who was so good as the heroin addict girl friend to Ally Sheedy's photographer in High Art, here is the sweet (too?) wife of the warden. It is a small role but she did the most with what she was given. Then there is that incredible center piece , the guy that plays John Coffey, the original gentle giant wrongly accused, incompetently represented, predictably convicted and oh so beatific.The real problem is that this movie is: A. too long.B Too predictable (Wild Bill was the real killer to me almost as soon as the warden told Hanks that they had a real hard case coming in.)C. too hackneyed in production (The storm the night De la Croix is executed.D. Too silly Does Hanks really have to pee that much (Maybe it is just me, but as career signatures go, I much prefer Nicholas Cage's fondness for Volvo's to Hanks peeing). andE. Too gooey sweet, Brutal may be how a real death row guard operates, but this Brutal was the sweetest guy you will ever meet as were all of his cronies except of course for Percy.Which brings us to Percy who epitomizes the movie as a whole, well acted but poorly scripted, after the botched job he did in front of witnesses even the governor is going to say to him ""son you {blew it} this time and there isn't anything we are going to do about it"" this if he is still there after failing to help another guard in an emergency.

"By far, 1999's most moving film","1994 saw a modest Stephen King novel translated into a modest, little-seen prison drama...that is, until it was blessed with a surprising seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. Since then, everyone and their grandfather has espoused ""The Shawshank Redemption"" as the little movie that could...and did. Five years later, its director, Frank Darabont, has adapted yet another prison-based King tale into a highly pleasing entertainment. But there the similarities end. While ""Shawshank Redemption"" essentially belied its typically macabre Kingian origins, but for a similar tone and languid pace ""The Green Mile"" includes a crucial plot element not atypical from the horror-meister's oeuvre. Told in flashback, a former death-row prison guard (solidly played by Hanks) relates the extraordinary story of John Coffey (Duncan), a simple-minded and gentle inmate who is readily accepted as a killer in the summer of 1935 because of his hulking size and damning circumstantial evidence. But Coffey (initials J.C., ahem), in addition to his overwhelmingly considerate attitude, possesses a singular talent for psychic empathy with others and an ability to heal the sick. Gradually, he convinces most of his captors, to varying degrees, that he is not a man capable of the heinous crime he is condemned to die for imminently. Compounding their crisis of conscience are the presence of a callous fellow guard and a psychotic neighboring inmate. Despite its over-length (by at least 20 minutes), the 3-hour ""Green Mile"" succeeds in every other respect. Often moving and technically astute, its premiere quality lies within its ensemble of actors, each of whom is simply perfect in their respective roles. Hanks may be the star of the show, and Duncan may stand out because of the uniqueness of his character, but their co-stars are consistently equal to the standard they've both set throughout. That alone is reason enough to see ""The Green Mile"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
simply cinema,"The Green Mile has shocked me. This film is tremendously emotional, simply cinema. Every sector of this film is incredible. The plot is fabulous and original, the writing of the film is amazing. The directing is phenomenal and the photography too.

The latter, simply through facial expressions and his wonderful acting, conveyed in me what his character felt. Michael Clark Duncan as John Coffrey is a perfect character. Like him those of Paul Edgecombe, William Wharton and Percy Wetmore; also all the other characters I haven't mentioned are incredible. The costumes are phenomenal and the setting also: all 3 hours of viewing are practically always centered in the prison, but never bored. Always talking about the duration, the 3 hours initially might seem heavy, but they fly. The end of the film is simply cinema: incredible emotions.

A less-than-average movie for me,"It's just another movie for me. I could not find anything special or meaningful in the film as others say, and I honestly don't notice that 'The Green Mile' is well-made technically as well. Pacing of the film is so slow, and it's both the script and the editing problems. Because of elongated pacing,it's hard to be invested, and John and Paul's story is someone else's, not mine. I spot some moments the director intends to bring the peak of emotions from the audience, and I do not feel anything. The build-up process is so exhausting that I was already tired and gave up.Darabont's films do not impress me as much as they impress other viewers. Like a former work, 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'The Green Mile' contains Christian themes and analogies throughout the movie. JohnCoffey performs healing miracles and dies for sins and because of sins. He's also falsely accused and electrocuted with two other inmates.

It's a perverted sitcom situation in a death row, with Tom Hanks as the father figure. Disgusting. And there's racism, too: John Coffee is Uncle Tom, has the mind of a 3 years old. A white man must reflect what's happening with Coffee, a white must command him.The ""spiritual"" events are only superficial. They distract from the basic questions this movie cowardly avoids.

A decent yet flawed 3+ hour movie.,"I liked this movie, I really did, I never read the original story in it's serial form, and only having heard it excerpted I had no expectations. Well, I figured that as with most adaptations of King's books, this one had the potential to fail as dismally as others have. That ""The Green Mile"" was as good as it is overall proved that in the proper hands, King's stories can make enjoyable, if not astounding, film.I guess my only real problem with the movie has to do with some technical issues.  I was really disappointed over the use of modern clear plastic packaging tape when Percy was confined to the restraint room.  In light of the fact that the story's original date was set in 1932 but was adapted to make use of the film ""Top Hat"" from 1935, and that the story itself mentions the use of friction tape (certainly more appropriate to the time), the use of a modern roll of tape was just sloppy!Another thing would have to be the healing method that John used, in the instances of both Mr. Jingles and the Warden's wife, John ""takes if back"" by sucking the death/illness from the mouths of these creatures...well, not to be too disgusting here, but how is it that he was able to help Paul by merely grabbing his crotch?  I guess that would have changed the ratings at the very least!Otherwise, beyond where the film falters, there is an absorbing story about the many ways people struggle with a ""gift"", whether it's their own, or someone else's.

Heavy handed,"Made with little subtlety, grace, or wit, suffers from the same disease as Shawshank in seeking profundity in every vignette. Whereas I could overlook some of the preposterous and contrived situations in Shawshank and just enjoy the movie, the Green Mile just seemed contrived except for a few scenes and characters. Of course it has redeeming qualities about it, namely Duncan's performance and the gripping execution scenes.I like Shawshank alot despite its flaws, however The Green Mile is just plain mediocre, not one I would ever want to sit through again. It could have been a decent 90 minute movie. The far too long and frequent mouse vignettes detracted and cost the movie momentum, there is no need to show a guy pee 10 times in the movie, we understand that it hurts when he pees, enough already!. The evil prison guard was just far too simple and one-dimensional a character to the point of absurdity which eliminates the impact of his comeupance at the end, contrast this with the very satisfying end to Shawshank's prison warden (a far more interesting, faceted, and believable character). The end was diluted as well, I think the movie went a scene too far at the end into some fuzzy preaching, as a viewer it really wasn't necessary, the impact of Duncan's end on the Hanks character and the viewer is strong and moving and the movie should have ended there instead of having a scene to explain to the audience (as if to a slow fifth-grader) the truth of the moment.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

The film is beautifully directed by Frank Darabont(director of the slightly superior The Shawshank Redemption), is beautifully shot with a foreboding setting and atmospheric cinematography and lighting and has an engrossing and haunting story that is well-paced too. Thomas Newman's score is positively hypnotic and very beautiful, with some great authentic song choices, my favourite being Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams(And Dream Your Troubles Away). The script is thoughtful too, and the movie also has a big emotional impact without feeling manipulative, I honestly couldn't help crying at the end of the movie. I have to say as well, the execution scenes were really quite harrowing. The performances are strong, Tom Hanks is excellent as the warden.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"A movie, that can make a grown man cry... and did!","I have watched... many movies... and when saying many, I mean MANY... easily more than 2,000 movies. I have watched horrible ones and great ones. Some stood out because of plot, acting, great emotions, great action, great humor... When one has watched that many movies, its difficult for a movie to really stand out of the mass, even the mass of great movies. There are 3 special movies I watched. Those 3 are not necessarily my favorite movies, but they are special for a different reason. These movies, Forrest Gump, Hatchiko and the Green Mile, engaged me so much emotionally, that I couldn't help but cry at the end. I don't want to take any of the plot away, but John Coffey is easily the most likable character in a movie since Forrest Gump. I don't think that the difficult part is to be sad enough to make someone cry, but to engage the spectators enough to commit that much of there emotions. Verdict: The movie is great, not more, not less. The character development is top notch, the dialogue interesting... Never has a murderer been so lovable. Watch this movie...

They story line was brilliant as it kept you intrigued and made you watch it for the whole 3 hours, although you get so into the film you dont realise its thats long. It has some points where you laugh and some parts that definatly make you cry. It is so heartbreaking that you have to cry and i am not ashamed to admit that, because it proves just how good the film is and just how much you get into it.I have seen the film more than once and everytime i enjoy it and everytime it makes me cry.

Nothing is missed out and I think that every single one of the actors was cast perfectly, particularly Doug Hutchinson as Percy Wetmore who you can't help but hate. I think my favourite thing about The Green Mile is the sound track. The music in the film is just stunning and a few of the songs can bring tears to my eyes without watching the film, just listening.

"Long, Boring, Predictable, Lame Ending","I can't believe that an actor with the credentials Tom Hanks would star in this film.  It was so slow, my family & I were praying for it to end.

How could they drag the movie out that long for such a stock plot and predictable ending?  And the execution scenes seemed to be there for shock value only, and were quite gruesome and gratuitous.I like Tom Hanks, but I refuse to like a movie he stars in simply for reason that he is in it.

A meaningless philosophy,"Many criticisms about the philosophy of this film have been published in the media, which can be right or wrong, this film arouses the emotions of the audience in a very correct way and connects them with the character of the film, a romantic film with an effect. Special movies that want to revive honesty, friendship and kindness in the hearts of its viewers, also using a colored person as the main role of the film and using a white person as a supporting role has been able to create a sense of companionship and to keep the pain alive in the viewer, but it should be noted that the philosophy and worldview presented in the film, like many other films, lacks proof and only the use of the format was the director's concern, although it could have been with a little study of the appropriate content. Philosophical texts were also extracted from the holy books for this film, but it is preferred that the visual effects be sufficient.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Amazing movie,"This movie is one of a kind and not what I expected at all when I first picked it up. I guess this is to be expected from Stephen King.

The story, unlike most, was not predictable and boring, but surprised me at many turns and held me captivated the whole way through. (And I am hard pressed to find a movie that I don't get at least a little bored with after the 2 hr mark.) It's deep, emotional at just the right points, and quite unique. I highly recommend it.

Marvelous,"This movie is undeniably great, and arguably one of the best ever made.

A runtime of 3 hours 9 minutes isn't necerssarily a bad thing, but i do think the movie would have been well of with a shorter runtime, without taking anything away from the plot or the feeling.Secondly, the score. I often found the score very unsuiting for what the director tried to achieve, especially in the first part of the movie.All in all, a great movie and a must-watch for any filmlover, with only few things preventing it from being an absolute masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

"Good movie, bad ending....","Trying not to write a complete spoiler but it's tough, since the ending is what I want to talk about. I'd say, this is a partial spoiler but not completely!It took a very long time for me to finally watch this movie because I am such a fan of The Shawshank Redemption. I knew there were plenty of similarities both in subject matter, and people connected to both films.There's no doubt that I was increasingly on the edge of my seat as the movie progressed, but ultimately, I was deeply disappointed in the ending. Here's my reasoning:John had suffered so much pain and disappointment in humanity. He was living in a time very different from today when blacks were often scapegoats for the crimes of others. (Much like in To Kill a Mockingbird) He wanted and frankly, was in desperate need of someone to save HIM as he had done for countless others. Here was a man who delighted in the smallest things of nature, of art and music and in the good of humanity. No one would have appreciated a kind act more than him, nor did he need it so desperately. Yes, he was a sensitive soul who absorbed the pain of others. But if you've ever heard this from anyone you love and/or respect and believed they were a powerful force for good in the world, would you just take them at their word that they wanted to die? Of course not! He needed Paul to stand up for HIM. To save HIM, and to speak out at the injustice of executing any man for a crime he did not commit. That would have been the heroic thing to do.This had an expedient Hollywood ending but it doesn't make one feel a sense of triumph the way Shawshank did. Truth and justice did not will out. I know, I know, that's the way it is sometimes in the real world but clearly the movie was made to make a point, to convey important ideas. I much prefer a film that ultimately has an uplifting message that makes all the pain and horror of watching it worthwhile, at least in the movies!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
wonderful movie,"This is one of my favorite movies because it is a touching and tear jerking . Although it is a heart breaking movie, it also makes you feel warm inside because john Coffey is so innocent. It was a 3 hour long movie, but time flies because it is such a beautiful story. I don't think there were any scenes that could have been deleted in the film. I also thought that the cinematography was great. The director did not use many out standing colors because it is about murder and very dark topics. The only time the director used vivid colors was on the people who were healed from Coffey's treatment. Since the color of the movie was dull, i think the audience did not get distracted and was able to get in to the movie. All the actors fitted in the role; i don't think anyone else could have any of the roles better. Great choice of actors (non famous and famous).",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

One Powerful Movie,"When I first saw this movie, I was glued to my seat for the entire show. Frank Darabont is a wonderful director, and has all my support for this movie and others that I have seen.  Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecome was an excellent choice, as was David Morse whom portrayed Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell. Morse is the tall/quiet sidekick to Hanks in this movie, and he shows true restraint by not beating the pain in the butt, Percy Wetmore, (Doug Hutchinson) to death!  (At times I wish he would have!)  I have watched this movie many times and it is always as gripping as the first time.The story timeline is excellently written and scripted.  I personally could have lived without all the 'at home' scenes with Paul and Jan Edgecomb, as there were many.  Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey was unbelevable. What a superb actor!  He is that gentle giant that everyone wants to stand back in awe, yet hug at the same time.  The emotional scene where Paul has to make that final decision of 'pulling the switch' (or ""Roll on 2"") on John is almost choking.  That whole scene grabs you by the throat and does not let go until after the final decision is made.I highly recommend this movie.

Good - but not perfect,"I have resisted seeing this movie because of all the hype, but am glad I finally watched it - as it is far better than I expected.This is the first Tom Hanks movie, where I forgot who he is and became immersed in the character. I think this is his best performance ever, but it was eclipsed by those of Sam Rockwell as  Wild Bill and Michael Clark Duncan as John Coffey. Duncan's performance in particular was one of the most gripping I have ever seen in many years of movie going. There really was not a wrong note in the casting and all performances were far above average. The only possible miscasting was Dabs Greer as the Old Paul Edgecomb - surely there was someone available who looked a bit more like Tom Hanks?As with all Stephen King stories there are no shades of grey in the characters, they are all either good or bad and we are made sure of that right from the start.  This, particularly in a movie of such great length does pall somewhat, but the story gripped right to the end and there is lttle that could be left out.It is necessary in a story such as this to suspend disbelief, but then this is so with virtually all of King's stories. That is not a criticism, good entertainment should not have to be justified.The Green Mile is not as brilliant as its publicity suggested, but it is on the whole a thought provoking movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Oscar? Ha!,"If you go to see ""The Green Mile,"" be prepared to laugh. A lot. And not because the film's intention is for the audience to laugh--it's just that bad. It has all the outward appearances of a very moving, emotionally charged film that will make you leave the theater saying ""Wow."" (The subject concerns Death Row inmates, Tom Hanks stars, and the director is of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" fame). But I just left the theater laughing, because the movie had become so predictable in its plot and dialogue that the woman behind me had begun to recite the lines along with the characters. (And the sad thing about THAT is that I saw it on opening night).But its predictability is not even remotely one of ""The Green Mile""'s major problems, and those are an overly corny, hokey story and script that are nearly impossible to buy (especially those particles that fly out of John Cofee's mouth whenever he performs a miracle--what is THAT?), acting ranging from mediocre to downright bad (no wonder John Cofee was given so few lines), and a complete inconsistency in tone. A movie about Death Row inmates should NOT cut from a scene of a man being executed (of which this movie shows about three) to a scene of the guards cooing over a cute little mouse (which appeared in the movie so much that the damn thing should've been named after the mouse). The execution scenes are of such a brutal nature that directly juxtaposing them with light-hearted prison follies completely degrades the seriousness of execution and is outright jolting for the audience.""The Green Mile"" left a bad taste in my mouth from its opening moments which never really left. Once I began to get a feel for how limited it was in hitting the real issue of the film, however, I was able to view it as one of those happy ""drama-turned-comedy"" accidents. I can only say that any recognition for ""The Green Mile"" for any more than it actually is--a piece of cheese that never deserved to see cinematic daylight--is  a not-so-happy accident indeed.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Another moving film from Darabont and King,"The Green Mile caught me by surprise.  Being that The Shawshank Redemption is one of my all-time favorite films, I went into this film expecting an attempt to capitalize on ""Shawshank"".  Man, was I wrong.  Aside from the prison settings, these two films could never be confused with one another. While Shawshank is about the triumph of the human spirit, The Green Mile is more about who we are at our core.  Are we good or evil?  Can we change who we are?  Why are bad things allowed to happen?  There are some imbedded references to Christ, even symbolized in John Coffey, where we see the sacrifice of His dying for our sins.  The cynics out there may choose to smirk at these actions, but I think that they would be making a knee-jerk mistake.  This film makes no judgements about us as a society or any such nonsense, but rather tries to make us look at ourselves, individually, and how we relate to the rest of the world.Hanks does his best work in a few years.  Michael Duncan and David Morse, I think, are the most compelling, however.  I've heard criticism that the film is ""too long,""  I don't really know how to repond to that argument other than to ask the person if they came to that conclusion before having seen the film.  If a film grabs and interests you, then holds that attention, then there is no way one should be able to make that claim about The Green Mile.  It is the length it should be and needed to be.  I enjoyed it immensely and will put in in my top ten for the year.One last note to the cynics among us:  cynicism does not automatically make one smart or thoughtful.  In fact, it can be a good thing.  I only say that to remind you that just because a film, book, song, or event is about something ""good"" does not automatically make it bad or untrue.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

There are a lot of very bad movies out there, a lot of terrible pictures but this film is really 100% times better and only because of Michael Clarke Duncans performance and a very strong unique inspirational and magnificent story.Not many people will be disappointed by this film even though there are scenes of violence, a enduring and compulsive viewing.Thanks John Ledward",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Hanks Brings Out The Best,"Frank Darabont's second adaptation of a Stephen King story is far superior to his first, ""The Shawshank Redemption"", particularly due to the excellent performances he gets this time around.

Green Miles and miles and .....,"How far will elastic stretch? They managed to stretch this elastic band right the way round the moon.

I am one of those believers in the 90 minute film, but I appreciate that if the story merits it, more time may be necessary. In this case, there is absolutely no excuse. The story barely qualifies as enough for a film at all, let alone an event-less epic-length film.The overall story was weak and the film makers desperation to put in emotion was done in an over-dramatic way with little content and had no effect on me at all, except to genuinely annoy me. I found it to be insulting to watch, to be honest, and was the most boring, most frustrating film I have ever seen.I also felt the ending was obvious for the whole of the last hour. It won't ruin the story to know that there was a piece following a mouse around for about 20 minutes which added little or nothing to the story.

One common day John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives at the prison, a man with large proportions, afro-descendant and the most innocent attitude, he was condemned for the murder of two girls in confusing facts.In the course of the movie, Paul and the other guards live the most unexpected and magical situations, this makes them doubt the guilt of John Coffey, although with a the end very unexpected and breathtaking, that touch the heart of anyone, finish the most extraordinary movie nominated to Oscar Awards in 1999.This acclaimed movie catches your attention for the wonderful scrip, an excellent soundtrack and special effects and a location as good as in the real 30's.

"The more times you watch this, the better it gets.","This is a film which starring Tom Hanks ought to be good. I was wrong. It's mindblowing; absolutely magnificent. There is not one aspect of the entire film that I can pick fault with. Frank Darabont is clearly an exemplar of cinematic masterpiece; the Shawshank Redemption was excellent, this is so good there aren't words to describe it. It has everything; drama- the stories in themselves are quite a dramatic backdrop; comedy-the pathos one could cut with a knife, the characters are constructed beautifully, evil is scorned, goodness is reinforced, and yet it doesn't come across as at all preachy. The tinges of sadness, are just that. Incredibly emotional but never corny, the sentimentality is exuded and the resulting catharsis electrifying. Michael Clarke Duncan is just amazing as John Coffey (""like the drink, only not spelt the same....""). The scenes where the satanic Percy 'forgets' to wet the sponge, and John can feel the executee's pain and he is writhing and jumping in horror so much so that 'Mr Jingles' the mouse leaps from his hands and shoots straight under the door is just awe inspiring. The special effects with the lights exploding, together with Michael Clarke Duncan's acting and the wonderful, apposite score just gels together so incredibly well. The entire ensemble cast were just magnificent. I've always liked Tom Hanks but this has to be his best role. He shows such versatility as an actor. The many different characters he's played in films such as 'Big', 'Philadelphia', 'Forrest Gump'(his second best role), 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'CastAway'- the latter film was not a brilliant one but with any other actor it would have been dire. He has the power to keep the film going by injecting his humour, warmth and damn humanity into the roles, all of them with differences, and lights up the screen. My favourite american film actor of all time, bar none. If you don't own 'The Green Mile' then I suggest that you go and buy it now!!! It's been out a while and it can be bought for less than 8 pounds in most shops now (I guess that's the equivalent of about 13 US Dollars) and for that you get not only a magnificent film of the highest calibre, but a couple of documentaries too.  Well worth it!PS: If you haven't read the book, it doesn't matter. I would recommend you do though as it's Stephen King's best in my opinion. Other good (they're all pretty good) Stephen King novels include, 'The Shining', 'It', 'Misery', and 'Carrie'.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
All I can say is wow!,"What can I say?  Frank Darabont is a cinematic genius.  Every shot was well thought out, perfectly timed, and beautiful to watch.  As the story starts to unfold, we learn what each character is about, and we see them grow along with the story.  I don't think I stopped crying for the last 20-30 minutes of the film due to the amazing performances of everyone in the cast. Michael Duncan Clarke was superb and Tom Hanks delivers another great performance.  I admit I never read the novel,'The Green Mile' and have never really liked many ""Stephen King"" based movies.  I loved this one as much as 'The Shawshank Redemption'.  When I left the theatre at the end of the 3 hour film, all it's images, characters, and ideals went with me.  I really feel that Frank Darabont finally deserves his Oscar for both best director and best film.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"Good movie, but the ending is not felicitous","Hi, although I don't believe in such thing as wonders I enjoyed the movie very much, exept for the ending. The casting was very good, every actor was well chosen, especially greetingsd to Harry Dean Stanton, welcome back to mainstream ;-). The movie was a little simple-hearted but very thrilling. I felt it so unfair that a wife from the prison-system was rescued by a man who was sentenced to death. And the escape from the jail was a leak in consistency because all the other guards would had give notice when a prisoner would leave the jail. And I can not understand why the director choose to show such a long ending. In my opinion it would be better to let the movie end with the killing of John Coffee. The tension was gone and I felt that I wanted to leave the cinema (in real I saw it on TV). So I choose to give it only 7 from 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Stephen King story yet again makes a good movie,"What makes a story by Stephen King so adaptable for the screen?  The green Mile is a great example of showing the worst and the best in human nature all in one fell swoop.  Of course it is impossible to steer clear of comparison to the Shawshank Redemption, especially as it is directed by Darabont who accomplished to make one of the greatest films of all time. The green mile is arguably not as good as Shawshank Redemption but it is a prison drama told from a completely different angle and that is why one is not disappointed when watching it.  It has very sentimental moments and it has a certain self-congratulatory and self-conscious feel when it comes to relationship between Coffey and all the ""good white folk"" in the sense of: ""look how sensitive we are handling the race issue"".  The role of John Coffey is well portrayed and I love the way you can speculate about where he came from and how old he really is but the film does sometimes fall into sentimentality that evokes resistance to the fantastic story being told. Tom Hanks is reliable as ever in a story that would put anyone off the death penalty but then decides to change its mind in the end by condoning the death penalty after all but only for very, very, bad people.So all in all a good movie that doesn't particularly linger on in memory mainly due to the deliberate tugging at heart strings.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Rip-off,"Doesn't anyone else remember the episode of Amazing Stories called ""Healer"" which starred Patrick Swayze?  Stephen King must certainly have had this story of a death-row prisoner who can heal with his touch.  It was a great half-hour, and there was a memorable shot of Swayze touching the hands of other inmates on his march to death row in order to ""heal"" them.  That was a half-hour in 1986.  Why does Stephen King take 6 novellas and Frank Darabont over three hours to tell the same story with less impact.  Suckers who bought into the shameless ""Shawshank Redemption"" will no doubt place this film high on the top 250.

A Gift is not always a Blessing,"As in the ""Shawshank Redemption,"" Frank Darabont creates another brilliant transformation of a Stephen King novel onto the big screen with an award nominating success.  Although ""The Green Mile"" is three hours long, it is a film with complete character development. John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), the murderer of two sisters, utters one of the taglines from this film when the posse confronts him. Coffey declares that ""I tried to take it back, Boss but it was too late"". John makes the same remark to Paul Edgecombe (Tom Hanks), the supervisor ""Boss"" of death row, thus giving him a ""touch"" of the truth. This tagline was a double-edged sword which Darabont honed to perfection.  Not only was this comment mistaken as a confession, but also judged by the system to warrant the death penalty.  Innocence was realized by Paul through John's gift: A touch of life.  Paul was faced with a moral dilemma of knowing the truth,, but having to put John to death.  Paul asks John, ""What am I supposed to say when I stand before God on my judgement day and He asks why I killed a miracle of His.  That it was my job.""  The irony is compounded when we learn that a gift is not always a blessing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Did God give the gift of healing to a murderer?,"It's a tough job to have to deal with death row inmates every day and to give the electric chair to men you take care of.  Interesting relationships developed in Cold Mountain Penitentiary relationships between the guards and the captives, between the husbands and wives and between a little mouse named Jingles and the inmates.  After one of the inmates demonstrated the gift of healing, it became especially tough to have to carry out the death penalty on John Coffey, the giant black man.  Was there another way?  After Coffey had performed several miracles, Paul Edgecomb began to suspect that this man was not both a healer and a killer that God would not give the gift of healing to a murderer.The Green Mile got me thinking about the lack of justice in our world today and wondering how often people have been wrongly convicted or died for crimes they didn't do?  It also got me thinking about my own mortality about how much longer I have to live?  `We each owe a death.  There are no exceptions.

The Green Mile: A Captivating Journey of Innocence and Redemption,"The world pulsates with wretched prisons that house all kinds of men. These places, manifest and filled with individuals deemed criminals, are a testament to their deeds. Yet, history has taught us that among them lie innocent souls, unjustly locked away. Sometimes, an innocent not only endures imprisonment but also becomes a legend. Such is the incredible tale chronicled by prolific American horror writer Stephen King in a Louisiana prison. Enter Joe Coffey, portrayed by the immense Michael Clarke Duncan, a towering black man convicted of murder and sentenced to death by electrocution. Aging prison guard Paul Edgecomb, played by Tom Hanks (and Dabbs Greer), remembers his time in the state penitentiary, particularly on ""Death Row"" or ""The Green Mile."" Edgecomb recounts the arrival of Coffee and the peculiar events that unfolded during his stay. With sympathetic comrades like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery DeMunn), and the sadistic Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb uncovers Coffee's extraordinary healing abilities and shocking revelations of his innocence. King's masterful storytelling comes to life on the silver screen, making this one of the greatest adaptations ever crafted. Duncan's magnificent performance allows the audience to understand his true purpose. While Hutchison's sadistic portrayal earned its just consequences, it is this movie's genuine sympathy that elevates it to classic status. A true gem, it is challenging to find any faults. Hanks excels, expertly suppressing his natural inclination towards humor to embody Paul Edgecomb entirely. Not a single member of the cast falters, and Michael Jeter's performance deserved an Oscar. Michael Clarke Duncan delicately portrays his colossal character, showcasing vulnerability and garnering sympathy. Shot flawlessly on meticulously designed sets, the entire production weaves together, offering a believable and compelling exploration of human injustice and compassion. Initially expecting a typical film driven by Tom Hanks' presence, I found myself moved to tears and laughter. Emotions surged within me, defying description. This movie surpasses my expectations and ranks as the best I have ever seen. Some moments left me clutching my pillow with unparalleled intensity. I guarantee this film will leave an indelible impression on your mind, surpassing even ""The Shawshank Redemption."" With a fantastic story, brilliant performances, mind-boggling emotions, and an unforgettable drama, it completes your cinematic journey. I am determined to ensure that even future generations experience its power.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"Makes you want to cry, makes you want to laugh, makes you want to smile, one of the greatest!","""The Green Mile"" should be in the thesaurus as a synonym for ""amazing"".  The story it tells is one of the saddest, heartwarming, most brilliant ever told (and I don't mean just in movies).  Everything about this movie is perfect, it literally has no flaws.  Yes, some may complain about the running time, but anything shorter wouldn't have been able to tell the story right. Truly, I doubt anyone could put up a good argument that this isn't a terrific film.The [brilliant] story focuses on death row guard Paul (Tom Hanks) and how he copes with his job - executing the inmates.  Everything is regular until gentle giant John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives with a death sentence for the rape and murder of two little girls.  Coffey is an unlikely pedophile/killer - he's afraid of the dark, he cries in his sleep, he speaks with an innocence as if he's never come in real contact with a person before.  Seeing this, Paul starts to question whether or not Coffey committed the crime he was sentenced with.Paul is also suffering from a bladder infection, one day, when its really bad, Coffey grabs him, touches him, and then he's healed!  He does the same for a pet mouse crushed by the villain Percy (Doug Hutchison).  It is thought that maybe Coffey was trying to heal the two dead girls he was found with.And so starts this great, great film.  Every cast member puts forth.  There are some great side performances from Michael Jeter, David Morse and Patricia Clarkson - but don't get me wrong, there isn't one bad performance in this movie.Of course, the greatest comes from Duncan, playing a sad, hulking simpleton often drenched in his own tears.  This is the performance of a lifetime for Duncan - who is now unfortunately wasting his talent on ""Daredevil"" and ""See Spot Run"".  He was nominated for an Oscar for this film, but Michael Caine beat him.  This is an outrage, Caine always plays the sympathetic British guy.  Duncan's performance is one of the greatest I've ever seen.This movie is one of the most touching, sad movies I've ever seen, watch it, 9/10.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Better than the material,"Many films that take place in the deep south have a homey, nostalgic tone to them that feels like you're revisiting faded memories. ""The Green Mile"" does that, but even though it has strong performances and solid characterization, the story just doesn't quite work.Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is a prison guard on Death Row in a Louisiana Prison. Prisoners come in and stay until it's their turn to die, then more prisoners are moved in to take their place. One day, a prisoner is brought in, just like any other. Only this prisoner, named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), is a towering giant of a man whose size intimidates and shocks everyone there. What's more shocking is the first thing that Coffey says: ""Do you leave the lights on after bedtime? I get kinda scared in the dark."" Slowly, Paul begins to question whether Coffey has indeed killed the two little girls that he was convicted of. But Coffey holds a secret that will change everything that Paul believes in.The acting is very good and the characters are well-developed. Tom Hanks is always good, and he's great as the uncertain Paul, but he's willing to become a believer. Michael Clarke Duncan shines as the hulking gentle giant. The shock of seeing this giant man be so childlike is overcome by his terrific performance. Doug Hutchinson is terrifically vile as the sadistic and spoiled Percy; it doesn't take long for the audience to hate him. David Morse, the late Michael Jeter, Barry Pepper, James Cromwell, Sam Rockwell, Bonnie Hunt and a brief appearance by Patricia Clarkson all provide able support.Darabont's previous film was the similarly themed but inferior (and outlandishly overrated) ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (it's good, but belongs nowhere near the IMDb Top 250, much less at the top). Unfortunately, the story goes into sitcom-territory in the final hour, and try as they might, Darabont and his cast can't bridge that problem.""The Green Mile"" is wholly watchable, and I don't hesitate to recommend the film. For those in a very undemanding mood and who like this kind of movie, it will probably turn out to be a real winner. Even if you're not in this group (which encompasses a large amount of people), it's still a good film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Wow!  Very Overrated,"This movie takes the cake for 1999.  The Phantom Menace was highly overrated... but not as much as this stale movie that is only average at best.  With little surpises, a bland story, and pointless tacked-on fillers at the beginning and the end, it would surprise me if anyone would want to see this movie twice.  Not nearly as good as Shawshank.  Almost all of the jokes fall flat, which becomes embarrasing to watch... Darabont didn't spend a lot of time on this script, by his own admission even.  From Shawshank, I was expecting some stirring music and cinematography in The Green Mile. Neither were present.  In fact, the cinematography was so bad it almost gave me a headache.  I felt like I was watching a B movie, with all the non-stop close-ups, occuring at a methodic static pace.  Would you watch this movie again?  If not, how can you say it is the best movie of 1999?  It hasn't made any top ten lists of critics, from what I've seen... I really hope this doesn't win the Best Picture Oscar, but it is gauranteed to get nominated, simply because it has been marketed so well.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Absolutely outstanding,"An excellent movie that is beautifully written with one of the best casts ever assembled. Tom Hanks gives another brilliant trademark performance as ""Paul Edgecomb"" who gets first hand experience of John Coffey's healing powers.

Although enormous and terrifying on the outside, he doesn't have a bad bone in his gigantic body and one can't but adore him. The real star of the movie though is Michael Jeter who is absolutely outstanding as inmate ""Eduard Delacroix""- as well as Doug Hutchinson who plays nasty prison guard ""Percy"" perfectly, giving a performance so strong you end up detesting him by the end of the movie.

The Green Mile - Emotional and Mesmerizing,"The Green Mile is a movie based on the Stephan King book by the same name, however unlike some other movies based on his books, not only this is a magnificent movie but the movies stays true to the plot of the novel.The film moves at a slow pace, but it is still very entertaining to watch from it's beginning to the end, it's plot is also engaging and keeps us interested in finding out what will happen next. While the Green Mile has it's share of amusing scenes, it is a completely serious movie. As a matter of fact emotional might be more accurate. This movie has so many scenes that are just sad and may make you tear up. I try my best not to cry during movies, even during very sad scenes, but I just couldn't control myself while watching the Green Mile, many scenes just touch your heart and the tears will start falling down. The ending was also good but also very sad at the same time, but after this film ended I was simply in awe after watching such a magnificent work of art. The Green Mile is a 3 hours long mesmerizing masterpiece.The acting is almost perfect almost all actors play their role perfectly, Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan are fantastic in their roles, although i wish Michael got more screen time in the first half of the film. Sam Rockwell and Doug Hutchison play their villainous characters perfectly and really make you want to hate them. The actors who portray the prisoners and show innocence make you feel sympathy for them, like the guards in this movie, and you realize they really do regret what they did, and when they are executed you can't help but feel sad, at least from the inside. But the casting is almost perfect, the actors portray the characters next to perfection, specially Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, as a matter of fact King himself said he had imagined Hanks in the role of Paul Edgecomb.The music and direction is also brilliant, Frank Darabont did a fantastic job of portraying king's other book into film (ShawShank Redemption) and he continues his success with the Green Mile. He is a magnificent director, I just wish he does more movies based on King's book, because King + Darabont simply results in magic on screen.While almost perfect, the Green Mile's slow pace, long duration and large amount of emotional scenes do it's replay value no favors, also I find it hard to believe that all prisoners on death row are so civil and nice towards the guards and vice versa, it maybe explained in the book but I find it unrealistic, also the twist that was revealed near the end, in the flashback, just seemed random and ironic, they could have gone in another direction and used another method to bring more light to the truth. Also John Coffey's goes a little out of character in that scene.Regardless, The Green Mile is mesmerizing and a classic work of art which will make you smile, cry and simply leave you in awe.Overall Rating: 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

"A touching story about humanity, love and belief","""The Green Mile"" is the second adaption of a Stephen King jail house drama after ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994), both being directed by Frank Darabort. Tom Hanks in one his best roles plays a jail house office in the ""Green Mile"", the death row of a Lousiana country prison in 1935. When the tall black prisoner John Coffey arrives, being sentenced to death because of a double child murder), nothing will be the same. John appears as a simple-minded, but jesus-like faith healer, laying his hands on aching scrotums, trampled mice and maniac housewives and healing them within a few seconds only. While Hanks and his colleagues become aware of John's abilities and innocence, the sadistic rookie Percy Wetmore brings violence, hate and destruction into the small world of the ""Green Mile"".This is not just another prison movie, but one of the most touching statements about love and violence, life and death, belief and disbelief, and finally about humanity and against the death penalty filmed during the last few years. The jail house wardens celebrate a row of executions - one becoming a painful torture to the victim and the audience after an act of sabotage by officer Percy - like a ritual, switching off their personal feelings. In the end they have to execute John, and even if they all now that he's innocent they can't stop his fatal walk to the electric chair... the film ends with one of the most touching finals of the movie world during the last few years!The complete cast in this stunning drama is brilliant, especially Tom Hanks, his colleagues and the death row inmates. The most stunning roles of all is played by Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, not speaking or moving much, but with an instant expression of pain and suffering on his face that won't let you untouched.The whole atmosphere, especially in the Green Mile settings and the execution chamber, are touching, depressing and fascinating at the same time. There's a fine and minimal score by Thomas Newman and some lovely filmed tricks with a  mouse who becomes a big attraction in this small world of death and suffering. Even if Darabont/King use some standard elements of fantasy/horror movies like Tom inhaling the evil and sickness from other people with a light stream, it never becomes kitschy or unbelievable.

"""I've done some things in my life I'm not proud of, but this is the first time I've ever felt in real danger of hell.""","I usually comment on movies right after watching them, while still under strong impressions. Of course, provided that the film does leave impressions. Movies over two hours I watch in halves, two days in a row, or even thirds, in case they are extremely long and slow-paced. Also, I tend to ""rewind"". I often watch certain scenes two or more times, whether to understand them better or simply because I like them. I take breaks to search the Internet for answers to questions that pop into my head (Where have I seen this actor before? When did this guy die? What exactly does this word mean?), to make screenshots of powerful cadres, write a note in the skeleton of future review, do something that comes to mind and I'm afraid I'll forget if I don't do it right away...""The Green Mile"" lasts over three hours. It flew by faster than a sitcom episode. I saw it in one breath, without a single ""rewinding"" or pausing, without even blinking. Without a single thought unrelated to the movie. I don't remember the last time a movie caught my attention like this, and when it ended, I was left speechless. Even now, a day later, I am unable to write anything analytical about it. The technical aspects are excellent, but essentially irrelevant. I would only like to mention the performance of Michael Clarke Duncan, which was so convincing and full of emotional charge that he repeatedly brought tears to my eyes. The story this movie tells, the message and the emotion it conveys, are enough to make this film fully deserving of its reputation and its high place on the list of the best films of all time, side by side with ""The Shawshank Redemption"". If I recall correctly, King himself stated that this film is the most faithful adaptation of one of his novels. And when it comes to adaptations of Stephen King, we can divide them into two groups - Frank Darabont's adaptations and all the other adaptations that, compared to Darabont's, can only go to the corner to be ashamed of themselves (with the exception of Kubrick's ""The Shining"" and Reiner's ""Misery"").10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"awesome,inspirational movie experience","congratulations to a wonderful cast who could keep my attention riveted uninterrupted for 3 solid hours,with total obliteration of my personal surroundings.Tom Hanks is a wonderful entertainer whom I have followed avidly for years,but new to me was Michael Clarke Duncan,what an awesome actor,if his personality has even a remote resemblance to the role he played,well he must also be an awesome guy.For a movie which changed scenery so little,it only left those amazing character portrayals to lift the movie from the ordinary to the extraordinary.

Fascinating and Awesome,"I read the ""Green Mile"" book for school when I was younger. It was excellent.And usually films have a tough time living up to the depth of a book. But ""Green Mile"", the film, had met its potential in relation to the book.The relationship between the guards and the men in jail was an interesting duality.
The ending was one that I won't spoil either. All I'll say is it was great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Overrated,"Why are some people making such a big deal out of this film? It was decent but nothing great! The acting was borderline(with the exception of Micheal Duncan) even Tom Hanks was not at his best. There were moments of brilliance that could of had so much done with them, but the film went for cheap laughs(Wild Bill), stupid subplots(Tom Hanks bladder infection! come on.....) and that stupid prison mouse! It was pointless! Maybe it's because I went in with such great expectations, but can you blame me? The director of the much better Shawshank Redemption and Tom Hanks! I thought an instant classic.

It shows the relationship between the guards of prison and prisoners that must be killed at pnce for their crimes. It shows that most of guards are good people, they don't bull criminals and sometimes protect them from their bad colleague. The story of John touches the problem of death penalty - we can kill innocent person. Secondly, the cast is great, but especially I love Sam Rockwell who played one of the prisoners. He is awesome in this supporting role.
So, it's one of the greatest film ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Almost perfect,"This film is a testament to everyone involved, as well as to Stephen King's imagination. The performances are excellent and, typical of a Stephen King story, there is some real human drama that drives the story just as much as the more supernatural occurrences. The one problem I had, however, was with the latter. The thing is, most anybody, if they saw something like the events in this movie, would be shaken, to say the least. And not just at the time, but long after, questioning what they saw, if it was real and whether they might be going insane. But that doesn't really seem to happen here. Everybody's reaction to something that by rights ought to be world-shattering is really quite underwhelmed, comparatively anyway. Most of all Paul's wife, who doesn't doubt her husband's story in the slightest, and even starts giving him advice about it as though she were telling him how to ask his boss for a raise.Of course I understand that the film wouldn't work if you had to show all of the characters reacting realistically and making a big fuss. There wouldn't be time, for one thing. But you'd think they could have reworked the story a bit. Maybe not have Paul tell his wife, for example. Anyway, it's a minor point and it shouldn't spoil this film for you by a long way. But it is the reason - probably the only reason - why I like Frank Darabont's other King adaptation, The Shawshank Redemption, a little bit better still.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Did the book wonderful justice.,"I am 14 and I just finished reading the novel The Green Mile by Stephen King.

You even kind of like Delacroix. Michael Clarke Duncan. Wow. He nailed it. Same with Tom Hanks. Two of my favorite actors in my favorite movie. And they did it right. I was afraid they were going to change some things like it always seems to happen when you transfer book to screen. But they didn't. I could go on and on about it and still not state all my feelings.

When they made it into a movie, I like some other reviewers here, was hesitant about it being any good, seeing as how most King books don't turn into movies all that well, with the exceptions of a couple.

Touching and engrossing film,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" by Frank Darabont is one of my favourite films, but for some reason I didn't think that I would like ""The Green Mile"". Consequently, I didn't see it at the cinema (and basically, I try to avoid watching films that are over 2,5 hours long at the cinema -- I'd rather see them at home sitting comfortably in my sofa).Is ""The Green Mile"" as good as ""The Shawshank Redemption""? I have to say no. However, I really liked this film. It was very touching and engrossing, it didn't feel almost three hours long. Tom Hanks gave a nice performance. Michael Clarke Duncan was quite brilliant, very much worthy of the Oscar nod this year. The main problem, though, is the fact that the film *is* three hours long. According to me, there were several scenes in the film that were unnecessary, for instance, they could have left out the opening and closing scenes since they made the story kind of ridiculous. Overall, though, ""The Green Mile"" was an engrossing movie experience (it's been a long time since I cried so much during a film), the acting was great, but sadly a few scenes were superfluous.

Cinematic gold.,"If you've never seen 'The Green Mile', then you need to at least once in your lifetime. A truly beautiful adaptation of Stephen King's book of the same name based in Death Row of an American prison between the 1920 and 1930'The backdrop is a hot, unforgiving summer in what was the springtime of the guards lives. Led by Tom Hanks's character Paul Edgecomb, the men discover the extraordinary gifts of a prisoner by the the name of John Coffey who was to be executed for the rape and murder of two little girls. John was played by the late Michael Duncan Clarke, a man whose soulful demeanour and muscular build brought the adaptation of the character alive from the very first minute you meet him on screen. Despite John's size, his gentle demeanour and vulnerability soon reveals an extraordinary gift as Paul opens up to John about his urine infection. The guards set about utilising him to cure others.The film brings to the fore the harsh reality of the guards duties whereby they walk the condemned prisoners to their eventual execution along the last walk of their lives along the green painted floor dubbed 'The Green Mile"".The film depicts the array of emotions one would naturally expect, purveying the horrors of prison life, remorse and eventually death. Characters such as Wild Bill and Percy, both cruel and sadistic, thwart the lives of Paul, his men and prisoners under his charge.John, whilst in transit, discovers that Wild Bill is the true murderer of the two girĺs for whom he'd eventually be executed for dispenses his own justice upon him. Percy, after deliberately sabotaging an execution of a prisoner, also receives a similar fate of his own when John infects him with a tumour thus leaving an inpatient of the local psychiatric hospital.The film is tinged with both good times and sad, particularly when John is finally executed, breaking the spirits of Paul and the guards fortunate to have met him.It truly is a piece of cinematic gold and needs to be watched from start to finish in its entirety, giving you an appreciation of life's trials and tribulations.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Two words gut wrenching.,"At the end of this movie I was so emotionally drained it was all I could do to look at my husband and say ""oh my god"".

The story is riveting, and brings a Stephen King novel to life like many others have failed to do.  It took me several hours to recover from watching this because of the emotional upheaval which one must go through watching this film.  It is not fluff, it is not light hearted entertainment it is a soul searching, defining moment in film that will not be equaled for a long time.  One piece of advice, do not watch this movie if you have something else you must be doing, don't get up to get a drink, don't read the newspaper, make sure you have 3 hours to dedicate to watching this masterpiece.  It is worth every second of your time and will leave you with images and emotions for a long time after the tape has finished. Perfect 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

I actually read the book when it came out sometime in 1996 and remember not being particularly thrilled by its cover, but as always with King (it was also my first King novel), one page is all it took for me to be sucked in this wonderful story. This is also a movie that stays very true to the book it takes from, book that I recommend thoroughly to anyone as well.All in all, what you need to know has been said by many other reviewers here so there is no point in me repeating that.

I would have set him free!,"A fantastic film that conveys far more than its surface appears to suggest. For me, it is Frank Darabont's best; I know, I know many of you will disagree, and that is completely alright, but to me it came across as Darabont's best offering to date, even better than Shawshank Redemption.Not only did the narration feel more coherent and appropriate, but it also had a much greater impact on my conscience. I don't have enough words to express what I went through and what I exactly felt, it simply overwhelmed.There is so much emotion here, such deep humane drama, that it compelled me to reflect on my own life and choices. It amazes me to see how people who are days away from death can teach you the most important lessons in life. It often baffles me that people in such a fragile, vulnerable state could recognise the true value of our existence.When John Coffey finally sat in the chair and asked Paul not to cover his face (because he was afraid of the dark), I bursts into tears, even though I cried several times throughout the film, but that scene hit me on a different level.At that point, all I wanted to do was hug Coffey and get him out of that horrible place.

Starring: Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Bonnie Hunt, Jeffrey DeMunn, Bart Pepper, Michael Jeter, James Cromwell and Sam RockwellWhen I talk about films, with my friends, I often talk about my favourite films or my least favourtie films. Both in which are very debatable and it a totally personal opinion. There are good films and there are bad films. And then we have the films that stand out to me. ""The Green Mile"" is one of them.
The 1990's was a decade in the film history, where the quality was reaching another level. More advandced technology were avalable, and a lot of new-comers had their entry in the 90's.
1994. Probaly the best year in in films ever, and a year where two talented directors had their time to shine. The one we all know as Quentin Tarantino, with his crtitically acclaimed ""Pulp Fiction"". And Frank Darabont, who made Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" into a glorious feature-film debut for ""The Shawshank Redemption"". A film that now-days stands high on almost every movie-critics' top 10 list.
Darabont made his name famous and a few years later he worked on a film, also adapted from a Stephen King novel, ""The Green Mile"".
This 3-hour epic is quiet possible the best of the best of cinema, that has ever been crafted.
Every single element of the genius-written story and touching performances reach its peak in such perfection, it is hard for me to belive why anyone wouldn't like this film.
""The Green Mile"" tells the story about a prison guard and his team, working on the death row in a prison. Their lives are affected, when a black man, John Coffey, who is accused for raping and the murder of two children, comes to the death row and waits for his conviction.
This phenomenal movie stands out from all other films that has ever been made, by simply just letting the story to be told. Even though it's a 3-hour long film it never feels long or at least not too long. Every element just hit the perfect note, in every single scene. And most of this are due to the highly-talented director and screenwriter, Frank Darabont. His second film, and yet again he shows that he is one of the finest directors on the planet. His way to tell a story has been done so well, I cannot put any words onn how genius and perfect it is.
The film was nominated for four Academy Awards at the 72nd Academy Awards ceremony including one for best suppoting actor to Michael Clarke Duncan, who play the inmate John Coffey. His acting skills of this film are beoynd any actors' standard. He is a teriffic actor and has been casted for the perfect role in ""The Green Mile"". The rest of the cast are also very good, with Tom Hanks in the lead, nothing can go wrong.
Techincal, ""The Green Mile"", are a gorgeous looking film. It's musical score is written by Thomas Newman, who again shows off his skills in conducting a beautiful score and build up tension at the right moment. Also the movie is shot very beautifully.In my opinion, ""The Green Mile"" is a better film than ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Though, they're both very strong films, with each of their own qualities, I just prefer ""The Green Mile"". It has all what it takes to be a masterpice of cinema. On a technical level, and on an emotional level. Don't miss out any chance of seeing ""The Green Mile"".
It ranks on my personal Top 50 movies.I give ""The Green Mile"" 5 / 5 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
One of the best films,"Good day to all! I want to share with you impressions about the film ""The Green Mile"" To be honest, for me this is one of the best films that have been filmed over many years. A film that does not have time and will be relevant at all times. This is a very complex and dramatic movie, from which tears will be drawn completely independent of you. Despite the fact that the film is very heavy, I have reviewed it many times and will look again and again to get the incomparable emotions from this film. The game of actors at the highest level, the horses fully revealed their heroes, while the movie is on, you completely immerse yourself in the world that the director opened for you, and you empathize and do not like the heroes of this film. The filing is very interesting. Not all of this world is as it might seem to us in the beginning.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
A Heartbreaking Journey: The Enduring Humanity of The Green Mile,"The Green Mile, directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novel, is an emotionally charged exploration of justice, compassion, and the supernatural. Set in a death row prison, the film follows the lives of the guards and their encounters with John Coffey, a mysterious inmate with extraordinary powers.What makes The Green Mile unforgettable is its delicate balance of deep emotional resonance and compelling storytelling. Tom Hanks delivers a powerful, nuanced performance as Paul Edgecomb, the prison guard whose moral compass is tested by the miraculous events around him. Alongside him, Michael Clarke Duncan's portrayal of John Coffey is nothing short of captivating, infusing the character with a raw innocence that tugs at the heartstrings.The film excels not only in its performances but in its ability to evoke profound questions about human nature and justice, all wrapped in a poignant narrative. Its pacing, direction, and stunning cinematography create a lasting emotional impact, making The Green Mile an unforgettable cinematic experience. It's a rare film that blends sorrow, hope, and redemption into a narrative that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Long in length but never makes you feel that.,"After watching the movie you cannot move on from it for quite some time. The story is unique and the concept really seems out of the world. Actors portraying their characters never make it feel like lacking.Once the movie catches your interest which it does in first 15 minutes, it never loses it. Throughout the movie we go through an emotional rollercoaster. It is worth the time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Wasn't as good as Shawshank,"The Green Mile was a very good movie. It seemed more of a Stephen King story than The Shawshank Redemption because of all of the magic and supernatural powers it had in it. Don't walk into this movie expecting to see a regular prison movie. That's The Shawshank Redemption. This is a spiritual fable that has 3 different stories in it..they are the following:1.) An innocent 7ft. tall black man on death row with magical healing powers. 2.) 4 kind prison guards and 1 sadistic one. 3.) 2 other unique prisoners: a man who grows to love and care for a wild mouse and a crazy, violent man named Billy The Kid.You wonder at first why are there so many different stories but it all fits together at the end. It has a happy ending to it. So happy that I cried tears of joy. While Shawshank was great from beginning to end, Green Mile starts to get good after the first half hour. Good movie, worth a watch, but still not as good as Shawshank. Not by a long shot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
A truly heart-wrenching and beautiful tale of the human spirit. A Flawless Film.,"While I still prefer Shawshank, this was ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. I knew it was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be THIS FREAKING GOOD. This movie is an absolute masterpiece, and one of the best I've ever seen. Here I am, a 19 year old sitting in my bedroom watching this on my laptop, literally BAWLING my eyes out. I have legitimately never cried more during a movie than this one. This movie teaches me that someday, we will all ""Walk the Mile"", and we might outlive our loved ones. That's why we should love each other during the short time we have. I am actually starting to tear up writing this review. This movie really struck a cord with me. Before today, the only flawless movie I had ever seen was The Shawshank Redemption. Today, that changes. The Green Mile is now the 2nd ever flawless movie I have seen in my lifetime. Pretty interesting how the only 2 flawless films ever (in my opinion) were both directed by Frank Darabont. If you haven't seen this movie, GO WATCH IT.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"Marvelous movie, 3+ hours, deserves all the praise it has received.","I saw ""The Green Mile"" on DVD and the extras, although brief, are interesting. I hadn't realized this was an adaptation of a Stephen King book. King himself said the screenplay was as ""perfectly written"" as he had ever seen.Made by the same ones who gave us the ""Shawshank Redemption"", this movie also set in a fictional prison in Louisiana is very realistic. In fact, the several execution by electric chair scenes had me tense up each time. The several stories are carefully interwoven, characters are developed wonderfully, and it is all brought together in the final 30 minutes. Tom Hanks is perfect as the death row ""supervisor"".I viewed it again in September 2023, after 23 years it was mostly fresh again. After watching many mediocre movies over the years I was struck by how good the acting was and how well-formed most of the characters are.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"Much, much, MUCH too long..","The first three times I caught this film on television, I was unaware that I had missed (at least) the first hour. (Hey, call me stupid, but this is a fact.) Given that, it became one of my favorite movies.On the 4th viewing, I saw the entire film from the beginning and... Oh, what a difference! This film does not need the first hour to be good. If, on my first viewing, I had begun at the beginning, I probably would not have watched it at all.My verdict: Hollywood screwed up.If you get a chance to see this film on the tube, I advise you to tune in one hour late. And enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
More than three hours of torture!,"This movie directed by Frank Darabont has to be the most overrated movie of the last two decades. The plot is shallow, unrealistic and above all absurd. Not just that the pretentious and so called emotional moments in the film aren't moving and touching, but they are also laughable and ridiculous. The scenes featuring the mouse (Mr. Jingles),Percy Wetmore and 'Wild Bill' Wharton reminded me of the cartoons I used to watch in my childhood. To put it simply, its a bad combination of mawkish sentimentalism and make beliefs. I don't care if the film is predictable but the pathetic attempts of audience manipulation and superficial treatment should keep this movie out of the top 250 movies in IMDb.Some of the scenes were too dragging, meaningless and hollow. Some others were too chaotic and deranged. Overall the film is a classic example of bad filmmaking. We cant really rate the actors as there is no scope of performance in such a poorly directed film.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Wonderful,"I had heard a lot about the movie and people would tell me its too long. So this week, I decided to rent it and see it. Wow!! It did not seem long at all. It was a wonderful movie..very well made. The actors were very convincing, the periodic settings seemed authentic....Over all a wonderful film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Better Than Shawshank,"This movie is an emotional rollercoaster. You get to know all the characters and realize that most of them, even the executioners, have kind hearts. When we first see the character of John Coffey, he seems quite large and scary, but we quickly realize that he is the most sweet human being with the most beautiful soul. We also realize he has a gift, which he always uses for the better. Both the middle and ending of this movie makes u sob and feel such deep sympathy for the characters. This film is arguably better than The Shawshank Redemption.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"A Wonderful Film, Critics be Darned","I found this film to be powerful, heart-wrenching, and simply everything I expected.  I have read the complete book (twice), and this film exceeded my expectations.  I didn't think it would generate such an emotional response after getting emotional while reading the book, but it did.  And it did for most of the people in the theater; I heard sniffling and the ruffle of tissues all over the room.  During both of my viewings.As for the movie's length, and the flak it's getting as a result, all I can say is that if the people who are complaining about the length of the film actually read the book, they'd understand that everything in the film was necessary to drive the story.  What's the problem with our world today? Have we reached the point where people lack the attention spans to not only shun literature, but also disapprove of films that are longer than two hours?This film tells a wonderful story.  The story development flows almost perfectly.  It has the perfect blend of humor and drama.  Everybody in the cast (and I mean everybody) did a superb job (Michael Clarke Duncan IS John Coffey, swear to God), and knowing exactly how everything would turn out did nothing to turn me away from being captivated by the whole film experience. If I had to find fault with something, it would have to be the ending, which seemed to be ""slapped together"" to tie things up (Of course, the ending of the book had the same feel, as well).  So I give it a 9/10.  Go see it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
You know the plot.,"I want to respond to the majority of comments made so far concerning the quality of ""The Green Mile"". The following is a list of comments I have read and felt deemed a response. I am not a movie critic, and I'm not a writer which means the following comments will be simple.1. This movie is too long. It is long. I did not feel it was too long. There have been movies that were excellently done and I have wondered why they cut it short. I didn't feel that way during this movie. It was just right.2. Too many characters are developed. I'd like to hear from those who said this which characters didn't need to be developed. Everyone played a role, everyone had a purpose, and everyone did a good job.3. It's too chaotic/Too many subplots. I'd like to hear from those who said this what they would have eliminated from the movie. We needed to see the old Tom Hanks in the beginning so he could tell his story. We needed all the steps in between to feel crushed when John Coffey is executed. We needed to see how the death of the girls unfolded. Nothing was out of place and nothing was extra. It's also worth mentioning that a complicated canvas of characters and events more closely resembles life. Perhaps it's time movies start doing this more often. If a Russian novelist can get awards for writing a painfully detailed story, why shouldn't a movie?4. The acting was subpar. Come on. Right. I don't want to be the one to say that crying during a scene means it was well done; that is certainly not correct. You cry during the Green Mile because you are in the movie. When someone acts badly, it's hard to suspend your disbelief. The acting was not goofy.5. The humor threw the rhythm of the movie off. 3 hours of serious is a lot of serious. Stephen King likes to throw humor into even his darkest of novels (and movies). It works in the horror stories, and it works here.6. What's the deal with this supernatural stuff? Hey, it's a cool addition. Probably it could have been written without the flies and healing, but why? After all, it is Stephen King.7. The Delecroix execution was too violent. And electrocution isn't? Hey, we live in a society where we kill people for being too bad. I'm not saying I agree or disagree with the ethics of it, but if they author was trying to make a point, he did it well. And again, I say: It's Stephen King. He likes the violence, and this was a nice way to get it in there.My final opinion, being the completely unqualified and inexperienced critic that I am, is: this movie is really good. The acting was precise, the unfolding of events was well orchestrated, the development of the plot was enjoyable, and most will not feel like it is too long. You will feel sick to you stomach, cry, laugh, get angry, and generally feel pleased that you spent your 3 hours watching this.Enjoy.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
An emotionally powerful experience,"While The Shawshank Redemption is widely called the best jail/prison movie ever made, The Green Mile is often compared to it and the 2 films can easily be seen as rivals. What's interesting is that both films were directed by the same person, Frank Darabont. However, there is something major which sets both of them apart. The Shawshank Redemption was mainly from the prisoners perspective. The Green Mile, on the other hand, is mainly focused on the prison guards perspective. I was very interested in seeing this movie because I was curious of what he was going to do with it. I was not disappointed when I saw it and I'm glad that I did.After an African American man is sent on death row after supposedly killing 2 young girls, the prisoners and prison guards are shocked when they realize that he has a miraculous gift. They soon start to think that he probably didn't commit the crime and he may be killed for something he didn't do.The best thing about The Green Mile is that it is an emotionally absorbing experience with well-developed characters that I cared for deeply. The movie lets us know that just because the prisoners did something bad once in their lives, they still have a charming and kinder side to them and they might not be as bad as most would expect a death row inmate to be. The movie uses this to make you care for the characters. And you know what, it does a great job at it. Scenes when they die are very sad because of the kinder side the gives to them. I have to give this movie credit for making me grow a connection to death row inmates.There are also characters that you really hate and want to see killed instead of ones you like. There is Wild Bill, a crazy and immature prisoner who acts rude to everyone. The movie did a great job making me hate his character. However, the character that I hated the most was Percy Wetmore. He treats all of the prisoners poorly and shows no respect to any of them. He is even hated by all of the prison guards. There were a few sadistic things he did which I felt were slightly exaggerated and over-the-top, but that's not to say that those actions didn't cause me to develop any sort of vendetta or hatred towards him. All in all, the movie does a great job with most of the main characters. There were some characters which I had a strong emotional attachment to, and there were other ones which I had a bitter hatred for.Another thing I really loved about the movie was its fantasy aspect. It made the movie very interesting and it made the ending kind of thought provoking. I can understand why someone might find it to be jarring, but I didn't find it to be that at all. I think that it fit just fine in the movie and it is one of the things which made John Coffey such a great character. It immediately made me become drawn to him and the film becomes much more interesting once he gets introduced. Also, the ending is thought provoking because it makes the viewer speculate why Paul is living so long. It begs the question whether Paul's gift of living longer is actually a gift or a punishment. It also makes me wonder how long he will live.In mine and many other people's opinions, John Coffey's death is the saddest movie death scene of all time. It was not only fleshed out very well, but it was also proved that John Coffey was innocent. This isn't the first film to have a wrongly convicted convict, but it is definitely the film which fleshed it out the most and made the nature of it hit the hardest. Also, the scene when he dies is very sad since it has numerous things in it which can make the viewer feel sad. It could be his last words, it could be the fact that Paul was hesitant to give the final order, it could be the part when he shakes his hand goodbye, or several other things which happen in it.Despite everything I said so far, the movie is not perfect. The issues in it mainly rely on its pacing and length. Its pacing flaws are most noticeable in the first act as it takes way too long for John's gift to be introduced as the movie deals with numerous sub-plots first and it takes way too long to introduce us to all of the characters. The movie introduces us as to how Percy loses his temper easily by having him break someone's fingers, it shows us a flashback of John being caught, it introduces us to the Warden and his wife, it shows the guards find a mouse and let Del keep it as a pet, it shows another execution, and many other scenes. Also, I felt like it sometimes took a long time for the movie to move along near the middle of it and some parts of it seemed bland. The pacing and length needed work, but that's my only major complaint with the film.Despite the pacing and length, The Green Mile was well worth my time. It was an emotionally absorbing experience with well-developed characters that I cared for greatly. This is the kind of a movie where you keep on rooting for a happy ending even though you know that it's probably going to have a tragic one. I also really liked the fantasy aspect to it, and it made the movie very interesting and the ending somewhat thought provoking and even more poignant. It's not going to be replacing The Shawshank Redemption anytime soon, but I still recommend it and I think that it is worth your time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"after all, not a word against the death penalty!","The simplification of characters, the eternal battle between the 'angels' and the evil that we don't want to see on the screen anymore and the utter professionalism of Hanks acting make this film pretentious and conventional. Well, Hanks insists on treating the condemned humanely, but not a word against the death penalty. Oh, Hanks, the patriotic American son that ""we"" love so much... of course, he doesn't want to take a minimum risk by pronouncing a single word with a political/radical connotation. They could have easily made a 90mins movie out of this 3hrs long vaudeville.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
An invitation to stop seeing life black and white,"The Green Mile is probably the most deceitful film I have ever seen. As someone who 1) was unfamiliar with Stephen King's novel and 2) had not seen any trailer or promotional footage before deciding to watch the film, I certainly didn't expect it to go in that direction.In retrospect, by looking at the length of the film and how the story unfolds, it becomes obvious it has literary influences, but I have to admit, I didn't notice it while watching it.The film touches on themes such as law and morality and invites us to look at the gray areas that lie between our black-and-white views of the world.What I enjoyed the most was Doug Hutchison's performance as Percy Wetmore. Writing a despicable character like that is already a difficult job; bringing it to life has to be a very difficult task to pull off, but Doug Hutchison passes with flying colors. While Michael Clarke Duncan was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for 8 different awards - winning 3 of them - Doug Hutchison received only one nomination, which he didn't end up winning. I don't pretend to say Michael Clarke Duncan's outstanding performance was not deserving of the recognition or that Doug Hutchison should have been nominated for a Black Reel Award. But I certainly wish he would have gotten more recognition.Needless to say, Frank Darabont did a fantastic job with this film, not only directing it but also producing it and adapting the screenplay. It's worth mentioning that Frank Darabont would go on to write, produce, and direct The Mist later on. This man definitively has a thing for Stephen King stories.The Green Mile, like other novel adaptions, can be a very heavy watch. The film relies a lot on dialogue and character building, plus at a running time of 189 minutes, it demands a lot of your attention, but ultimately it's worth the watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Doug Hutchison,"I gave this movie a 10/10. Not because of the seasoned Actors. But because of the talent that has never surpassed the novels and creative mind of Stephen King. His work is always a front row seat with my family.One Actor really stood out to me was Doug Hutchison. His role as Percy Wetmore deserved an award and at the very lease a Golden Globe Nomination. He was able to bring emotion, cruelty, sadisism to his character so well. Nobody on the earth could have done it better than Doug. His performance is one of the reasons that The Green Mile will never depreciate over the years and all of them to come. If you end up hating the villain after watching this movie then you know he did and excellent job.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

"A wacky, zany film","Rob Schneider Meryl Streep Funnyman Rob Schneider brings his wacky talents to the big screen in The Green Mile, the wacky misadventure of a down-and-out prison worker forced to become a male prostitute in order to pay off a debt.The story begins when Miles Green (Schneider) accidentally kills a prisoner in a wacky mishap. The prison demands that Miles pay $500.00, or face being fired. He is given two weeks to repay the debt.Miles realizes what he must do when he runs into a friend who operates a wacky prostitution ring in the prison. Miles Green renames himself ""Miles O'Smiles"" and begins offering himself as a gigolo. That's when the real wackiness begins, as Miles runs into one customer after another, each with some kind of bizarre, wacky disorder. One girl even has a wacky sleeping disease, where she falls asleep at random times! Hilarious! There's even a scene where they go bowling, and she falls asleep just as she's about to roll the ball, and she goes flying and well, it's just funny as heck. It's truly a wacky, wacky film.There has been lots of talk about The Green Mile sweeping the Oscars, and I agree. I have been a long-time fan of Schneider's, from this days at SNL when he did that character who said everybody's name funny (Tom! Tommy! Tom-arino!) to when he brought the Sly Stallone actioner Judge Dredd to life with his wackiness. But The Green Mile is a new level for him, and I for one and hoping we see a lot more Rob Schneider in the future.This is truly a wacky, wacky, wacky, zany film.

It could have been better,"The magic of the film is strong. Such a film, which uses supernatural power as the key narrative factor of the film, is destined to make the answer of many profound problems found through magic, not by human. From the perspective of supernatural forces, it is actually a simple redemption story. However, the director has extended too many themes, and there are no foucs among the several themes, which makes the film's original meaning of ""redemption"" chaotic and obscure. And the way of elaboration is a bit more contorted and contrived. The procrastinating rhythm and overly complex theme make the character, scene design, and macro structure of the film very superficial, rather than serving the theme. Therefore, although the topics discussed in the film are diverse and difficult, the deterrent effect on the audience is obviously insufficient.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Amazing movie,"This movie is truely great. Incredibly emotional, this is the definition of an emotional roller coaster. It is a comedy, but it is also a drama. A fantasy, but also a tragedy. It is impossible to lock this movie down to a genre, and that's what makes it better, and arguably the best movie of 1999, ahead of Fight Club and Matrix.
Despite its incredibly original theme and message, the green mile also has an amazing cast, with Tom Hanks playing one of his more underrated roles, while Michael Clarke Duncan reaches the height of his career playing the massive, but kind and gentle John Coffey, a character with an incredible story and who truly is the beating heart of the movie.
There are some issues that i have with this movie, mainly the run time, which feels extremly long, and also the character of Percy. Like the very existence of this character, who doesn't serve much of a purpose in a logical sense, and seems to only be there to bump up the movie's running time.
With that being said, the green mile is still an incredibly well made movie, and it gets a 9/10 from me",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

A Masterpiece With A Horrible Ending.,"The Green Mile is one the best masterpieces ever made. I saw it for the 3rd time today, but the 2nd time was 5 years ago.You see, as great of a movie this is, the ending is so tragic that after seeing it on TV in 2015, and once on DVD in 2018, I wondered if I could ever watch it again.However, I got a new DVD of it the other day, and I killed my afternoon today by watching this 3-hour movie. And I loved it more now than ever.The plot follows Paul Edgecomb, a death row officer played by Tom Hanks, who is in charge of the cells but also responsible for carrying out electric chair executions.One day, he receives an inmate named John Coffey (""like the drink, just not spelled the same""), a tall African American man on death row supposedly for killing and um...violating...2 young girls.But it turns out that John is a miracle worker, and he has the ability to heal living people with ailments by kissing them and ""taking"" their issue away from them, whether it be a tumor or a urinary tract infection.He's also innocent of his crime...but the problem is that the proof of such innocence is lacking.That's the plot in a nutshell, without spoiling too much.The Green Mile is successful in many ways. For starters, the acting is superb. Tom Hanks gives one of his best performances in this film, and actors like Micheal Clark Duncan, Micheal Jeter, and Doug Hutchinson as the sadistic Percy do great as well.Duncan's character, John Coffey, is also clearly a metaphor for Jesus- from his initials to his miracles, to the sacrifice that he makes at the end. As a Christian who loves movies, I think The Green Mile is a better at being a Christian movie than most Christian movies are as a result.The movie is also well paced. Even though the movie is exactly 3 hours long (minus the credits), it goes by fairly decent and there was never a moment that seemed unnecessary or too long. As I have seen from other reviews, others would disagree with me on that point, but my position still stands.The movie also has many effective dramatic scenes, such as the execution sequences. There is one where Percy (again, the sadistic one) is in charge of wetting a sponge used in the execution procedure- the wet sponge makes the electricity flow faster and thus kills the victim quicker.However, right smack in the middle of the movie, Percy decides to fake wetting the sponge and puts it on dry. This causes a gruesome result that is very hard to watch, and hard to shake off- you have been warned.There are other heart-wrenching scenes, such as, but not limited to, John's own execution. Scenes like this make The Green Mile one of the saddest movies I have ever seen.That said, there is also some humor here and there, which works great for a movie this melancholy. One example is after John heals Paul's urinary tract infection. Paul then has sex with his wife, and she makes John some cornbread to thank him for healing her husband.John smiles at this news and says: ""Oh, was the missus pleased?"" Paul replies: ""Yes, many times."" Humor like this lightens the mood when you know how the movie ends.This leads you to my biggest warning- as great of a movie The Green Mile is, it has one of the saddest and unjust endings ever. I won't spoil it for you, but the final execution scene had me grabbing tissues my first 2 times, and I came close this time around. And those emotions will linger long after the movie is over, and it's why I've delayed re-watching this movie for so long, even though I took it a little better this time around.If you support the death penalty, this movie will make you reconsider. Before my first viewing of the movie, I had never given my stance much thought. Afterwards, I was against it, knowing that such a horrible punishment happens to innocent people.The Green Mile is a hard watch, but it's a movie I think everyone should try to see at least once. With its powerful story, excellent acting, and a long-lasting effect, The Green Mile may end tragically, but it won't be forgotten very quickly. And that's the sign of a great movie.PS: On a quick note, American Beauty is a great movie, but The Green Mile should have gotten Best Picture for 1999 over that by a long shot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Full of clichés. Strange hidden ideology.,"I saw this movie yesterday and I must admit I found it very bad. It tries to show us something that could be real but it fails. There is absolutely no questioning about the validity of death penalty and the electric chair : they are only used to create a dramatic setting for the action (exactly the same way as the Vietnam war in ""Forrest Gump"" : things just happened there, nothing more... AMAZINGLY SUPERFICIAL !!!) In a way, this movie shows us the electrtic chair as being someting ""normal"" : il even has a nickname !! And we see the characters taking care of it as if their pride dependend on it (which is the case !)And what about the sexist ideology carried by the movie ? Men are working hard, women are cooking ... and all of them are good Christians, of course.And what about the general use of lies when it comes to save appearances : the lie about Mouseville, the lie about the brain cancer, the lie about who killed the girls ? (I mean : they just let an innocent being killed when they all knew he was innocent !!!) The movie shows us that when you lie, everything works fine : people live their lives in a cloud of bulls**t, but who cares ? Very Christian, indeed !And what about the bad guy Percy Whetmore (hum... ""Whetmore""...)? Full of clichés, stereotypical, so baaaaad it cannot be possible ! And of course, the man who fries on the chair is ... French !Movies like this one are not just pure entertainment. They are the vehicle of a certain point of view on life, justice, and what is Good and what is Bad. This is all hidden behind a nice little story full of drama and emotions. But of course, after three executions, the mouse is safe !",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

"A Tearjerker for sure, but a Manipulative One","Yes, I had a hard time holding back the tears.  But, when I left the theater I though to myself, ""what the heck were you getting all choked up about?"".The film purposely raises one's spirits to the max in one scene, and in the next beats the audience mercilessly with misty drama.  In fact, the entire movie consisted of this exhausting pattern of lift-you-up-then-beat-you-down techniques, and after reflecting back on the film, I felt very manipulated, almost cheated out of my tears.  There was no compelling character depth or sincerity of events that could be perceived as genuinely touching (and deserving of tears), only highly contrived sequences in which the film doesn't compel your emotions, it forces it out of you, even though there is no real substance under the surface melodrama.It's even more of a surprise that in a THREE HOUR film we learn so very, very little about any of the characters. Even Hanks' character is given very little motivation (why did he become a guard, why did he marry his wife, why is he so kind to the prisoners, and on).  And the supporting characters are given one-dimensional, cliched roles (the brute, the old-timer, the rookie, the sadist).Accordingly, the supposed center of this spiritual, modern Biblical tale, John Coffey, remains completely in the dark.  If the four guards are as compassionate as the film would have us believe, then why do none of the guards ever actually TALK to Coffey?  No one asks where he is from, or how he grew up, or how he found the girls--they just sort of talk about him while reveling in his miracles; how compassionate is that?The focus on the sadistic guard and the lunatic inmate were to heavy--the bonding between Edgecombe and Coffey needed more fleshing out.  It would seem that the mouse (a much overused metaphor in a film very, very concerned about contrasts) received more screen time than Coffey himself; and although this may parallel a certain theme within the picture, it works too harshly against the much needed character development.This movie yearns to be exhalted as a rich, spiritual journey, but in the end, after all the tears had been shed (or pummeled out), I felt empty and cheated.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
One Of The Greatest Movies Of All Time,"Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at ""the mile"" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is colored by this. Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan.It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camera-work is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvelous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation.All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Best movie ever!:),"The Green Mile is one of the best movies, ever made! Had an amazing story line, and every time i watch it i cry:) The actors really made this movie. It will go down in history as one of the most real, and heart touching movies ever:)I couldn't pick a favorite actor in this because they all were amazing! Every actor played their part amazingly. It would not have been the same with different actors. I have never seen a movie where every single part is played with the right emotion. It is one of my all time favorite movies, and i don't think anything could take its place, honestly. Its great for all ages, to parent discretion. I would recommend it to anyone.

Magnificent.,"People have been urging me to see this film for a long time. This film left me absolutely flabbergasted and completely inspired. I have no shame in admitting that I blubbed a bit, and, coming from the most cynical critic when it comes to tearjerkers, that's gotta make a good movie.Tom Hanks is wonderful. He inhabits the part fully and unselfishly, playing off Michael Clarke Duncan who in turn plays off Hanks. They steal every scene they're in and when they're together, pow. The characters seem to be very much akin to the characters of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men (I have mentioned this before in a review of American Beauty). Each is flawed but not all bad, or good but not all good. These characters can invoke both sympathy and hatred in the same damn scene and their actors do them credit.I'm not surprised that both Darabont and King have come out with yet another winner. I hope they team up again.I have given this movie a ten, simply because never have I been so emotionally taken with a film and I'm worried that the next film I see will disappoint me because of it. The Green Mile is one to be remembered.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
One of the great movies of all time.,"I saw this movie with my daughter when it first came out around Dec. 1999 and then went back to theaters twice more to see it again. I have since watched the video more times than I can remember. I am not a huge Stephen King fan, although I do like some of his works. But this story and movie has become virtually my number one of all-time. The Thomas Newman score is enchanting and I often replay the end credits just to hear his music once more. As someone previously noted, the casting was superb and when you watch other movies with these actors, you will equate and remember that you saw them in the Green Mile. There are scenes that still give me goose-bumps, and scenes that cause me to wipe my eyes afterward, and I am a 69 year old straight male. There is a saying that the time you spend fishing is not counted in your life-span. The same can be said for the times that you watch this movie. Frank Darabont has done a terrific job with the settings in various rooms of E block, just as he did with 'The Shawshank Redemption' completed 5 years earlier. Doug Hutchinson masterfully portrayed a character you immediately grew to despise, and you knew at some later point he would get his just desserts. Sam Rockwell could have also received a supporting actor nomination, as did the late Michael Clarke Duncan. If you have not already seen this movie, I recommended that you rent the DVD so that you can see it without commercial interruption, or editing to fit a time slot on regular TV.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"""The Green Mile is so long"" - You ain't kidding!","The Green Mile, as you already must know if you're here, is a story about Black Jesus (hey! I thought that was Everlast! =D), aka John Coffey (JC - get the hint? Well, the rest of the movie is even less subtle) played by Michael Clarke Duncan and everyman-type White Pontius Pilate (Paul Edgecomb here - surprising it's not Paul Pedgecomb) Tom Hanks - whose distinguishing feature, unfortunately for all of us is a often-showcased urinary infection (couldn't they make it like a sore shoulder or something?). As for the story, you pretty much already guessed it - you've heard of the Bible, right?Okay, you know that already, we established. You probably also know that Tom Hanks is a great actor. David Morse also is in a creepy way. Michael Clarke Duncan isn't, unfortunately. But Hey, I guess if the script calls for a giant, your choices are pretty limited?But all in all, the cast is good, and the interplay between them is also very good. That is not the problem.Well, then, you may ask, what is? Is there even one? Sorry to disappoint everyone, but, yes, there is - or are - two, in fact.One: I didn't think it was at all possible but this movie manages to me more over-dramatic self-important and pompous than Frank Darabont's previous effort - that way-overrated #2 movie in the world for-some-bizarre-inexplicable-reason Shawshank Redemption.Two: The Length. 3 hours plus. To me, that's just unnecessary. I mean yes, if a movie is good you don't really care how long it is, but when it's borderline like this movie is, that just goes to annoy you, the viewer.A side note - this movie scores the third greatest last line in movie history with the (I hope intentionally) bittersweetly too-true ""Sometimes the green mile can be so long.""  Good point, Tom, but actually, it always is - no matter how you watch it it still takes 188 minutes every time.Overall, I'll give it a 5 out of the 10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Masterpiece,"After watching The Shawshank Redemption , I decided to watch this Darabont movie and had very high expectations

A good film elevated by an incredible finale and a great cast,"The Green Mile is one of those movies that can connect with you very easily, you just have to let yourself get absorbed by its world. Sadly for me, no matter how hard I tried I simply couldn't be fully immersed in it.It doesn't have that much things going for it from the start. 3 hours is a long time and with this movie it feels like half an hour or more could've been cut, specially since the main conflict doesn't really start until almost an hour into the movie. Is at that moment that you'll either get completely sucked in or totally taken out of the film.The score by Thomas Newman isn't always on point and its not helped by the fact that movie is all over the place during two thirds of its runtime. Goes from almost a feel good movie, to pretty much a tragedy. The cinematography isn't that inspired and the editing may be a little to slow for some.Both Tom Hanks and the late Michael Clarke Duncan give knockout performances and are perfectly casted. Problem is, they're pretty much the only fleshed out characters in the movie. You cant really feel how it affects the people around them and that makes some of the performances during one of the final scenes difficult to buy. Its a story only about the two of them but the movie frequently tries to also make it about the world around them and end ups failing at both. That doesn't hurt the finale that much, which absolutely nails the message of the film and will keep you thinking about it for a while.Its predictable and the obvious religious theme may not be for everyone, but its still a very enjoyable movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Damn Good Yarn!,"When ever I pick a video with Tom Hanks I know I'm going to watch something that will move me in some way.  Aside from his talent, the man obviously has good judgement in the roles he chooses.Strange as it seems I had no prior knowledge of 'The Green Mile'. Somehow I managed to  miss the promotions and nobody had commented on it. I found myself in the video store desperately trying to find something different and I think I found it!I must confess I was unaware that this was the work of Steven King and was delighted with a more feeling approach from the man. I have at times found him very hard to read although I have enjoyed many of his movies. I do feel the man deserves enormous credit for what is essentially a damn good yarn!As the story unfolds we discover a bunch of guys doing their utmost to make the last days of the condemned prisoners in their care as humane as possible. Their biggest problem appears to be the sadistic nature of the latest recruit which is compounded by his connections to people in power.What evolves is a very moving picture touching on fantasy and emphasising the loopholes of the 30's judicial system.Hanks is as good as always and much like a golfer, at the end of the day only competing against his past performances.  Once again David Morse plays an excellent supporting role.  Michael Clarke Duncan shows himself worthy of great things to come and Doug Hutchinson makes a powerful appearance of the man we love to hate.  Credit too must go to Frank Darabont who turned a good story into a great movie.There are some horrific scenes which I thought my wife would hate, however all is justified in the telling of the story.The result is I'll be looking for the names above when I'm looking for movies and maybe give Steven King's books another look.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

"For some , the Green Mile is just very long","Great movie, Superb Performances, but leaves a lot desired in terms of the Shawshank effect. My opinions are not prejudiced because Tom Hanks happens to be my favorite actor for the past decade and a half plus but what he does with his acting is create a performance which makes me sit back and say "" Oh Boy, all what shades can he portray"". For e.g in one particular scene when he is showing the pains of urine infection, he makes it look nothing less than real itself. Coz some point of time, guess I had urine infection too and I know what is it. He is so real that he actually makes you believe that he is not Tom Hanks but Paul Edgecomb. The other good acts are by David ""Brutal"" Morse and who else but John Coffey who does give a stellar performance in front of a legend like Tom.The movie certainly deserved to be nominated for the best picture as it had an overall impact of a good team performance.Frank Darabont does an amazing job with the direction, guess but his magnum opus till date has been Shawshank Redemption. I guess when I compare both of them, what I find missing in ""The Green Mile"" is the sense of conviction in the story itself. Whereas in Shawshank we believe that something like that can happen to people, we think the miracles as shown in The Green Mile are definitely not possible. But then , Paul Edgecomb himself did not believe in them, didn't he.All in all, the pace of the movie may be slow, but it just holds you like a vice and never lets you go. Good humor and some stirring scenes add to the pace if it gets slow somewhere. I guess, the way the music in Shawshank uplifted our spirits, is not the same with The Green Mile, where the background music leaves a lot to be desired.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Moving and entertaining,"Any film that runs 188 minutes, (most of which is filmed on one set), that holds your interest and hooks you emotionally is certainly doing something right.

A terrific cast headed by Tom Hanks, with support by David Morse, Michael Jeter, Sam Rockwell and Michael Clarke Duncan make a winning team.Having firmly established the clear merits of ""The Green Mile"" it should be made equally clear, this is no way a classic. Its treatment of character is shamelessly stereotypical. The bad guys are rotten to the core, while the good guys are angels in disguise. This simplistic perception abounds; no character or storyline overcomes this basically shallow viewpoint.

For the longest time, I just decided to ignore it. Then, I saw that it was going to be on TV. So, I decided to watch it, since it would be free and I could turn it off if I hated it! I saw it, and I just felt underwhelmed at the end of the day. The story was boring and the acting was all over the place. This plot is based off a novel written by Stephen King. Now, I haven't read the novel, but if this movie is any indication, then it must be dull. Granted, not all the books that Stephen King has written are bad, some of them are decent. But, a lot of them are just boring and depressing, which is exactly what ""The Green Mile"" is. The storyline is, a death row corrections officer, played by Tom Hanks, witnesses supernatural events occur after a mysterious inmate named John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is brought to the penitentiary. Yep, it's about as stupid a plot as you can get. Did I mention that this film is over three hours? How in the world do you possibly need so much time to showcase a minuscule plot thread like this? Well, I suppose that you could argue that the extra time is necessary to express some realism of a lengthy prison sentence. A movie that does a much better job with that premise, is ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994). But, that's a whole different film review for another time. Unfortunately, in the case of ""The Green Mile"", it doesn't work here and it drags on way too long. Another thing, the execution of John Coffey didn't make me cry whatsoever, I just thought I'd let you guys know that right away. I've never cried watching a movie or a TV show, because it's all fiction at the end of the day. Now, that being said, over the years, I've heard a lot of people say that they always cry when they watch his death scene. But, his death is entirely pointless on his part, because he is proven innocent of the crime. It angered me more than anything, which is one of the worst things that any movie can do! Most of the characters are unlikeable and the overall story isn't that intriguing to me. As for the acting, it's just as big a letdown as the plot itself. The only ones who seem to be putting effort into their performances are Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, Bonnie Hunt and Sam Rockwell. Sadly, the the rest of the cast is just abysmal! The only good elements are the sets/locations, special effects, and the soundtrack. All of the sets/locations are great and give the movie a decent atmosphere. As far as special effects go, they are very well done, and still hold up today. Finally, the soundtrack is composed nicely and it really sets the tone for the thin plot thread. However, I honestly that the music is trying harder than every other element in this movie! Sadly, those three elements do not help this movie. Overall, ""The Green Mile"" is just a very unpleasant and overlong film. Still, I am glad I saw it, and I can see how some people would get emotional while watching it. But, the only emotions I felt were boredom and anger. I give this film a 3 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 6 out of 10 stars. A 3 out of 5 star rating is dividing mark where I differentiate a movie being good or bad. ""The Green Mile"" is a very marginal 3 out of 5/6 out of 10. I consider it to be a bad movie by my high standards, and I personally can't recommend it. Stay away from this film, unless you want three hours executed from your life! This movie will just waste your precious time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

The Green Mile,"""Edgecomb"" (Tom Hanks) is in charge of the prison officers who tend to the inmates on death row. He's a decent man who, with the help of his partner ""Howell"" (David Morse) tries to carry out his task as humanely as possible. Their team also numbers the truly odious ""Percy"" (Doug Hutchinson). He's an incompetent coward, but he also happens to be the nephew of the state governor, so tends to get away with his obnoxiousness towards the prisoners. That nasty behaviour becomes more pronounced when the giant ""Coffey"" (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives. Also newly arrived is a small mouse which befriends, much to the chagrin of ""Percy"", a fellow inmate (Harry Dean Stanton) and oddly enough it seems to help keep the peace as people come and go. Things take quite an intriguing turn when some physical contact between their gentle giant and ""Edgecomb"" seems to cure his liver complaint. As the officer realises that this man may well possess healing hands, he and his team begins to bond with him. Meantime, the ghastly little ""Percy"" screws up his first execution causing an effect straight out of a Wes Craven film and Sam Rockwell's psychopathic ""Wild Bill"" arrives to liven things up. It's actually Rockwell who steal this for me. His performance is viscerally effective and he really does commit to the role. It's over 3 hours long but the acting is almost perfect as these characters develop and the story unfolds reconciling the brutality of racism, crime and punishment with the attempts at humanity and decency applied by virtually everyone whose lives are touched by these scenarios - even amongst the staff who struggle at times to keep their own priorities in kilter. One of Stephen King's much better stories with depth to the personas, a good baddie to loathe and a message of redemption delivered subtly but powerfully.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

I am not going to spoil it as I think watching is better to find out what it's like yourself.I have always been a huge fan of Tom Hanks and his performance is just flawless, maybe one of the best I've seen made even better by the amazing supporting cast. A special mention has to be made about Michael Clarke Duncan (John Coffey) and also Michael Jeter (Edward Delecroix) on their supporting roles in the film loving them acting opposite Tom Hanks - sadly wishing they were both still alive with us to this day making more movies.Brutal Howell (David Morse) to see him playing a good guy but having that powerful screen presence to support the characters in the movie is mesmerising to watch.I also loved the overlooked probably forgotten Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper) and Harry Terwilliger ( Jeffrey DeMunn). Jan Edgecomb (Bonnie Hunt), Hal Moores (James Cromwell) All their supporting roles really help the film move along so brilliantly.The cruel prison guard Percy Whitmore (Doug Hutchison) and William Wharton' Billy the Kid' ( Sam Rockwell) give brilliant convincing scenes in the film as the main antagonists.

"Powerful, moving and compelling.","This is a cracking good movie.Set in 1930s America, it tells the story of John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), who is sentenced to death for the murder of a girl. He is sent to prison (death row) to await his date with the electric chair, and that is where the bulk of the film is set.In that claustrophobic space we get to know him, the prison staff and fellow inmates; not just get to know them, but get to love or loathe them as the real character of John Coffey is slowly revealed.If that setting seems a little gloomy, don't be put off. Although the prison environment is harsh, and there are some deeply disturbing scenes to deal with, ultimately this is a film about humanity, goodness, and indeed magical powers. John Coffey is, as you'll see, very special.The casting and the acting is spot on throughout, with each character thoroughly convincing. Michael Clarke Duncan is exceptional in his lead role, Tom Hanks and David Morse are excellent as the tough but humane Prison Officers, and all the supporting cast give memorable performances - perhaps none more so than Doug Hutchison, who's portrayal of the loathsome, sweaty Prison Officer Percy is superb.At a shade over 3 hours this is certainly a long film, but it is utterly engaging, deeply emotional and totally compelling.

"Not Shawshank, but still fabulous","I came into this movie with extremely high expectations.  Having seen Shawshank at least 30 times, it IS my absolute favorite movie, I anticipated another masterpiece from Darabont and I was pleased to see such a marvelous piece.  So it was three hours.  There have been other masterpieces of this length, like Braveheart and Gettysburg.  And unlike others, this movie takes its entire length and makes the most out of every scene and every minute. Also taking into consideration that a Stephen King novel is no short piece of work, I'm impressed they were able to consolidate the book into 3 hours anyway.What makes the movie are these.  First the cast is superlative.  We start with Tom Hanks, who in my opinion earned his Oscar in THIS film not Private Ryan.  His sidekick as it were is David Morse, who we know from his extremely different roles in The Rock and The Long Kiss Goodnight.  Cromwell was excellent, as well as Sinise, and Michael Clarke Duncan takes a huge turn from his normal tough-guy and bouncer routines to play the sympathetic John Coffey.  What I liked best was to see Barry Pepper and Sam Rockwell who've taken a drastic turn from their normal roles to play something entirely different.  Pepper and Hanks were in Ryan together if you remember, but I last remembered him from Enemy of the State.  Rockwell was in Box of Moonlight, and he goes from a happy go lucky slacker in a coonskin hat to a crazy psychopath whose past is darker than we first think.  This mix of top-billers, lesser-knowns and indies makes for an excellent batch of a cast that carries the film perfectly.Second of all, the music made it for me.  Thomas Newman writes the score, as he did for Shawshank.  The man knows how to capture mood so perfectly.  His quiet and remorseful piano in Shawshank built the sympathy for Dufresne that Darabont and Stephen King intended.  I particularly liked his xylophone like arrangement for the mouse in the movie.  I can't put a finger to which melody I liked best, but my emotions have always been dictated by the music and this score had me bawling.Thirdly, a solidly constructed atmosphere for the movie.  The depressed time of the period already adds a certain tone, but the dusty bright daylight of the outside world contrasted to the clean and unchanging condition of the Green Mile really demonstrate the isolation.And last of all the storyline is magnificent.  There are so many small allusions to catch.   I can't even really describe it, but there is so much to catch and ponder afterwards so I won't even bother trying to explain it all.I'm still partial to Shawshank, but this movie was a close second for me.  I don't recommend the weak of stomach see it.  But if you can bare the gore of Seven and want to see a quality film, I can't think of anything I'd rather recommend.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Highly Overrated,"I guess when you hear Frank Darabont is making a Stephen King prison-movie, you can't avoid comparison with the vastly superior Shawshank Redemption, but the fact is that the only thing combining theses two movies are those three things.Green Mile is a triumph in camera-work, direction and acting. The movies visual look is outstanding, and the actors deliver good performances. This is much courtesy to Darabont, since Shawshank also was well filmed and acted throughout. No complaints there.But when it comes to plot it seems Darabont is trying to get away with the same thing he did in Shawshank, mixing a lot of sentimental crap in between, to make the movie more appealing to mainstream audiences. Where Shawshank was one of the rare movies to be overly sentimental, profane and grim at the same time (I still don't get how he pulled it off), and still being touching and entertaining, The Green Mile fails to do so. On one hand there are the graphic disgusting executions, and the tasteless barbeque jokes, and then there's a huge endearing innocent guy who's healing everyone. That just doesn't work.There's probably more graphic violence in Green Mile than in Shawshank, but also more sentimentality, and besides there's a rather silly E.T wannabe subplot that's overshadowed by all of the other stuff going on. The result is a good-looking, entertaining, but empty movie.Darabont is probably trying to make a statement about the death-penalty, but it isn't working the way it's supposed to. Just by having extremely graphic electrocutions of sympathetic characters, and inmate psychos sneering at it, it doesn't make the viewer think it's wrong. I think i actually heard someone laugh at the ""barbeque-jokes"", and that proves that the movie didn't do what it was supposed to. In the ending scene it's more effective even though the electrocution is shown off-screen, but it is spoiled by excess sentimentality.The good part is that the movie isn't boring at all. It's very entertaining and the length doesn't seem to be a problem. Conclusion: to say it is an ultimate humanistic prison-epic is wrong, but to say that it's good, stylish entertainment is very close to the truth.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
"Great Cast And Acting Make This A Brilliant, Thought Provoking Movie","The Green Mile (directed by Frank Darabont) is a great movie with a stellar cast.Based on Stephen King's best seller, this is a modern masterpiece.

beautiful and tragic,"Anyone who has ever been to the pictures with me will tell you that I can't sit still for very long. I am having a Stephen King phase right now though, and my husband hadn't seen this one before (I had seen it once before) so we watched disc 1 one evening and disc 2 the next. It's 189 minutes – that's too long to sit in front of a screen. But of course it's based on a Stephen King six-part series, so there's a lot of story to get in.I love this kind of story. I'm a fan of magical realism and I'm a fan of what I shall term the ""Kingian coincidence"" where the characters in many of his stories are linked by a veeeeerrry unlikely chance event as they are towards the end of this story (not saying who – it's ""only"" about two and three quarter hours in, though).In short, it's about a gentle giant, John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, who is found guilty of the brutal rape and murder of two little girls and goes to Death Row, where the head of the guards is played by Tom Hanks. The opening of the story, the situation that gets John Coffey caught and arrested for murder reminds me so much of ""Of Mice and Men"", and coincidentally (or not?) one of the main actors from the film adaptation of that (the bloke off CSI: NY) has a small part in this as the careless lawyer who doesn't really bother to properly represent John Coffey because he is black.There's the typical list of characters, of the prisoners; an ashamed an sorrowful one, a comedy one, a bad-to-the-bone one, and John, the one you really don't think ought to be there. Most of the guards are all-round good chaps, but one of them is a slimy, evil, low-life that makes your skin crawl. You can probably guess that he gets his come-uppance.In his book ""On Writing"" his royal highness Stephen King tells us that he had originally named John something beginning with D, but renamed him something beginning with C because he believes if a character has the initials JC (like the world's most famous fictional character, Jesus Christ) then we will feel sorrier for him. Well, there is doubt from the start that he is guilty, for the viewers, at least. So, a black man in rural 1930s deep south America, accused of murder? I don't really need the initials to make me feel any sorrier for him.It's a beautiful and tragic story. I don't want to spoil the ending, but King said that while he was writing it, even he didn't know if John Coffey would die at the end. What a lovely way to write – then he gets to enjoy his own stories as much as we do.more reviews http://claiready.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

One Of The Best Book-To-Film Translations I Have Ever Seen,"A few weeks ago, I finished Stephen King's novel ""The Green Mile"" and realized that I was about the only person on the planet who had not seen the film adaptation. Upon viewing the 3-hour piece of work, I was amazed by the degree to which King's writing was able to be translated to the big screen (as opposed to, say, ""Hearts In Atlantis"", which left much to be desired).The plot of the film is exactly the same as that of the book, centering on a 1930s death row prison and the strange (paranormal?) events that transpired there. All the actors are dead-on in their interpretation of King's characters, such as the inspired Paul Edgecombe (Tom Hanks), the lunatic guard Percy Wetmore(Doug Hutchison), the even loony-er prisoner ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Sam Rockwell), and the hulking, meek inmate John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), from which the story really draws from.I won't give away any plot details here, but suffice it to say that pretty much everyone will enjoy this film. While the subject matter and language (the film IS set in a prison) rules out the kiddies, pretty much anybody else should find it to be an inspiring journey, as the movie explores the themes of death, love, and doing the noble deed in the face of great opposition.I don't say this for many book-film combinations, but in this case you may actually be better off in seeing the film, as the acting is so wonderful and the plot does not deviate from the novel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"

Donno if we need Three of these in the one flick, but there ya go, it IS set on Death row, the director has a point to get across, and it is Hollywood after all.It reminded  me a little of Phenomenon, if you took the Travolta character's abilities and put'em into use by the big black guy from Armageddon, you'd have it. There was a lotta heart in Duncan's performance, I was struck by how strong a presence he has, and how moving the healing scene outside the prison is as well.Hanks, Morse, and DeMunn are all pros, I always like seeing Morse esp. in whatever he's in. Very reliable. It's interesting to see how much work Stretch Armstrong is post-Babe, here he gives a fine turn as the warden.I thought that Sam Rockwell as the psycho chewed the scenery a bit much, but enjoyed seeing babyFace there Percy. I was shocked that he is almost 40 in the film, and played one of the psycho killers in 'A Time to Kill'. Quite a stretch.Bonnie Hunt and the sickly Warden's wife both turn in fine performances, and both are also aged alot more by makeup than they really are, esp Hunt, who is two years older than me.There are a couple things wrong-it is too long, I think that the middle execution scene was Not really necessary; and I thought that the finale with the old guy(Dabs Greer, who played the preacher on Little House all those years)narrating his life's turn was a little stretched out.But overall, moving, insightful, unique, well-made, hard to sit through a couple places.Kudos also to Mike Jeter and the Mouse too.

There's a great story here (actually a number of stories, intricately woven together into a whole.) There are some fantastic performances. Tom Hanks was good as always, although I didn't think he quite lived up to his Oscar winning performances in ""Forrest Gump"" or ""Philadelphia."" Michael Clarke Duncan perfectly captured the character of the mysterious John Coffey. Was he a child murderer or not? That question will be answered in the movie. But there are still more questions about him that are (appropriately, I think) left to the viewers' imagination. Is he a human with special healing powers or is he some sort of supernatural being - an angel, perhaps? We don't know. But stealing the show I thought was Doug Hutchison as the sadistic prison guard Percy Wetmore. He fits the (admittedly unfair) stereotype of a prison guard: a pathetic little loser who makes himself feel like a man by abusing inmates. Hutchison was excellent.So if the story and performances are great, why do I say that the movie is only on the edge of greatness? To be quite honest, I can't quite put my finger on it but something here just didn't quite work for me. I found my attention wandering from time to time. True, it's a very long movie (well over three hours) but it wasn't really the length. Maybe there just seemed to be a lot of extraneous detail that seemed to obscure the main focus of the movie, which should have remained on Coffey throughout. Maybe it was the setting of the movie as a flashback. (I found the beginning and ending in the nursing home totally unnecessary, and would have liked the focus to be simply on the Green Mile.) I'm not sure what it was, but it just didn't quite make the grade to a great movie for me. Very good, but not quite great, although it's worth noting that Stephen King was apparently very pleased with this adaptation of his book. (It also provides a good primer in the use of an electric chair, and some graphic depictions of the results of its use.)7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Hell and Heaven meet on Death Row,"I'm pretty sure you did not wait for this commentary to find out about this masterpiece. And I'm not so sure you'll ever get to this if you're like me. That is after a few pages I usually don't have that much time I want to consecrate to more reading even if I'd like to. This being said, and what follow not said as well as I'd like to put it after reading other's brilliant and well deserved commentaries. All the same I'd like to add:""Please do yourself a favor and give it a go, you won't regret it"" From the mousse to the giant they're all so good. They're all exceptional. The length of the movie may be much for some, It was fine for me. It certainly isn't a quick snack, it's a main meal! Just one thing, I had some ""plumbing"" problems and I can assure you I was not fit for the fire brigade, but again I was not Tom Hank, Still I wonder how he managed...the distance.

"Good Movie, but way too long.","It is a great story with good acting throughout but it drags on too long. It is obviously a piece of anti-death penalty crap and the gruesome execution of Eduard Delacroix was not necessary. In fact the excruciating detailing of the execution routines could have been and should have been edited out as surplusage. My feeling is the director was so smitten with his work he left little to the cutting room floor. There was much attention to the period detail except a large roll of cellophane tape, which did not exist during the depression years, was used to tape a mouth closed. It also seemed strange that there were so few men on death row at a time when many more people were sentenced to death than are now, although executions were carried out much more swiftly in those days.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
absolute waste of time,"oh my God..the worst piece of infantile garbage I ever sat through...considering the expectations I had, I was just so let down...there are so many prison movies better than this (and NO, Shawshank, while a great movie, is not even the best)...the emotions manipulated by this film left me cold, a little nauseated, and I would have shut the movie off about 2/3 of the way through had I not been asked to watch this film by a few friends...I think Tom Hanks is one of the most overused actors (next to Harrison Ford) ever...I am probably one of the very few viewers out there who has despised anything associated with Stephen King....NEVER overestimate the intelligence of the American public....",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Surprisingly impressed,"I agree with the multiply repeated positive comments by others. However, what seems apparent is that people have missed the _humour_ of the film. e.g. Percy's end is belly-laugh material, and the knowing looks on faces when taboo topics are being talked about is definitely snigger-worthy. (In particular the 'praise Jesus miracle' of Paul's (Hanks') cure.)The framing at the end was too long, the moral of the tale doesn't need to be said three times. However, the other 3 hours was perfectly paced.There was no need for as many special effects as there were. In the olden days we were happy with bulbs just blowing, why do they need to give off pyrotechnics as they blow?There's something in this film for everyone apart from the impatient. If you don't like it, then take a look at yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Awesome,I really like this movie and I have seen this movie like 5times I think.,6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Average,A low B- film that wants you to think it's special.  With it'sepic length and supposedly moving story line.  Decent acting.Hanks back to playing a decent fella instead of a fully realizedcharacter like in Saving Private Ryan.  Barely worth the trip.Way too much on the modern passion play.,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Cinematic mastery of a not-so-masterful King story.,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend it, and the director/writer/producer did a fine job.The main complaints of critics was that the film is too long. Poppycock I say, a great movie is a great movie no matter the length. The film never sags or gets boring. I never found myself disconnecting from the film to check my watch. I was caught up in the film and forgot about the passage of time-- the mark of a true cinematic experience.The only negative thing I have to say about this film is that unlike Shawshank Redemption, in which the director/screenwriter took a Stephen King short story and created a truly transcendent experience, the Green Mile is one of King's hokier recent stories (originally sold *by the chapter* if you can believe it), and in the end King lets us down gently with a somewhat unspectacular climax.However, if you think that ""Shawshank"" is one of the best films of modern times as I do, then you'll enjoy this film. And if you haven't seen Shawshank, watch it instead-- or watch it after you see Green Mile, and save the best for last.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
A Macabre Yet Thoughtful Journey,"While The Green Mile may take its time to unfold, it's far from a bad film. Its deliberate pacing allows the story to build emotional depth, giving viewers the chance to connect with its richly drawn characters and weighty themes.At times, the film ventures into macabre territory, exploring the grim realities of death row and the darker sides of human nature. Yet, these moments are balanced by a profound sense of hope, compassion, and the supernatural, making the story both unsettling and uplifting in equal measure.Superbly acted by a stellar cast, led by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, The Green Mile is also a well-made film, with careful attention to detail in its direction, set design, and storytelling. This is not a movie for those seeking fast-paced thrills, but for those willing to let it unfold at its own pace, The Green Mile reveals itself to be a touching and thoughtful story that lingers long after the credits roll.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
This is one mile worth walking,"There's only one thing wrong with ""The Green Mile"" . . . its Oscar-baiting. All the thunderous music, slow-motion camera work and exploding lights get a little tiresome.  Taken as a whole, this a pretty petty complaint when put up against all that is good in this film.  It's a testament to how mesmerizing the movie is when the main character states, nearly 3 hours into the film, ""sometimes the Green Mile can seem so long,"" and no one in the audience even lets out a snicker.  This movie moves so fast, I actually wish they would have taken another 30 minutes to include a portion of the novel they omitted (it was one of my favorite subplots).  When you find yourself thinking three hours wasn't quite long enough, you know you've got something great on your hands.  This is one mile worth walking.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
An Oscar Beggar,"Almost every scene and every shot in this film is stylized to conform to Academy standards. (Un)fortunately, these are not my standards. I must give credit though to Hutchison and Duncan for their performances and generally to the character development. It's a pretty much accurate adaptation of the novel but when it had to divert, it headed directly to audience sentimental exploitation. So I'm neither shocked nor amazed by this movie, although I might consider it a good rental. It's nice fiction after all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Magnificent!,"Frank Darabont made a movie that's even better than The Shawshank Redemption:incredible! The acting is great,the music too and it looks nice too. The story isn't that original,but the ending wasn't very predictable,I thought. In two words:PURE BEAUTY!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Absolutely Amazing,"One of the best films not only of this year, but of this decade.  From top to bottom, an excellent film worthy of Oscar consideration...  And if Michael Clarke Duncan doesn't receive at least a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, something is wrong with the system.  He gave the most moving and quietly powerful performances of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
A powerful and emotional film,"The Green Mile a very effective, powerful and well performed movie. Tom Hanks is good as always but this is one of the rare films he has been in where he did not give the movie's best performance, that belonged to Michael Clark Dunkan's performance as a mysterious person on death row that has the power to heal. This movie is all very well crafted and well paced. This movie isn't perfect though. Racism didn't seem to be an issue at all which is kind of strange it being the 1930s. I can't quite call this film a masterpiece because in some ways it's kind of sketchy. Still it's powerful and deep. I give it an 8 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
Good--but not anxious to walk that mile again,"The Green Mile was well-made I thought, but it was too cruel and manipulative for my tastes. Darabont doesnt spread it on as thick as Spielberg though--I give him credit for that.I didnt mind the tacked on ending either--but i wonder if anyone else noticed that it is very similar to the ending of the Asphynx?Anyway--the movie's heart was in the right place.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Fantasy"
