I had forgotten how awesome this is.,"I saw this when it first came out, and like many things, it was relegated to the past. I just had the occasion to rewatch it and I was enthralled from start to finish, almost like it was my first time seeing it. This movie is smartly written and paced. The twists are good and unless you are paying close attention, will fool you. This is Hartnett's best performance. In reality though, how can any movie starring the likes of Freeman, Kingsley, and Willis be bad? If you have never seen this movie, I urge you to watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"witty, fast fasted, stylishly interesting","I've never been motivated to leave a review here based on reading others, but the slamming of LNS is beyond accepting. The movie has a style that may, if fact, be borrowed from many other sources, but when it's on the screen, it feels complete as its' own. While the connections are not as surprising as some may say, they are certainly not spelled out for the viewer.The dialog is a bit kitchy, but there in lies the movies' charm. Reviewers stuck on the believability factor of such dialog seem to be limiting themselves to one cine-style that we'd be limiting ourselves to only 5% (I'm making up that number) of accessible films.LNS is a fun thinking mans' thriller that is witty, fast fasted, stylishly interesting and ENTERTAINING!!! That's what I want out of a movie, entertainment.... for those who are looking for reality, read the papers, watch CNN, take a walk in somebody else's' neighborhood. For those who like slick mysteries with interesting dialog rent or buy Lucky Number Sleven",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Lucky Number Slevin An Impressive Action Crime Thriller,"Lucky Number Slevin is an impressive action crime thriller with some flaws but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Director Paul McGuigan is admirable in making this movie about a guy named Slevin who after a case of mistake identity finds himself caught in the middle of a war between two rival crime bosses known as The Rabbi and The Boss. Josh Hartnett is good as Slevin who may know more about his situation than he's letting on or maybe not. Hartnett proves to be effective in the role. Morgan Freeman is great as The Boss but he isn't given much to do. The same can go for Ben Kinsgley as The Rabbi but he like Freeman still make the best of their villain roles. The rest of the cast including Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci, and Bruce Willis as a hit-man are solid as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The few action sequences are well executed and the intricate but not too complicated plot keeps your interest. Despite some flaws with character development, this movie was better than expected. Overall Lucky Number Sleven is a good action crime thriller with an interesting premise and exceptional performances by the cast who making it a movie worth the time to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Ten years later and I still love seeing this film,"Much like Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest (1959) Slevin tells the story about an average man (Josh Hartnett) who gets caught in an intricate and equally deadly web involving rival gangsters (Freeman, Kinsgley), a shady detective (Tucci), a world-renowned hit-man (Willis) and an irresistible girl-next-door type (Liu).I first saw this film when it was released on DVD. The sad part of it being that it was in the Wal-Mart discount bin, A display that everyone knows is filled with either really old movies or really bad ones. Being equipped with a five-dollar bill and no knowledge of the movie, I decided to give it a shot.Fast forward a few hours later, and I was taken aback by what I had just watched. Lucky Number Slevin completely took me for a ride.The movie starts off in an isolated airport terminal, with a wheelchair bound Bruce Willis telling a bystander a story about a horrific crime that took place years before. The story of the past crime deserves your attention as it will set up the rest of the movie and the events that unfold.There are a lot of elements that make this movie a joy to watch.First off, the acting talent. Hartnett didn't play his typical teenage heartthrob role, Freeman played a cold-blooded gangster opposite of Kingsley's conflicted Rabbi gangster, Willis did his thing and blew stuff up and Tucci played a hard-boiled detective with a shady past. And then there's Lucy Liu.Secondly, the direction. Paul McGuigan used his trademark style and perfectly blended action with suspense, mystery and the right amount of wit. Anyone who isn't familiar with his work should take a few days and binge watch BBC's Sherlock as he has been the one to helm a majority of the episodes.Lastly, the writing. Jason Smilovic, who has done only television before and after this film, really knew what he wanted to accomplish with a premise that's been played out. He successfully wrote a complex tale that includes the the twists and turns one would expect in a movie about mistaken identity. He was also able to pull off writing an ending that comes full circle without confusing the audience.In summation, Lucky Number Slevin teaches an old dog new tricks. The acting style of Hartnett is greatly complimented by two Oscar winners (Freeman, Kinsgley). Stylish action scenes don't seem over the top and aren't used as a filler (cough Michael Bay cough) and lastly the ending, while dark, will surprise and please the audience.IMDb gave Lucky Number Slevin a 7.8 out of 10. I'll agree with their score but why not just give it an 8? While it may have won the praise of critics, it was given a limited release that didn't allow the film to be properly recognized.If you haven't seen this movie before I highly recommend you do, it's a blast. This movie is definitely worth your time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Stanley Tucci, and Lucy Liu did an excellent job in this movie.

Connecting the Dots,"Like any sweet, short story about murder and revenge, ""LNS"" likes to connect the dots. It's a healthy principle in screen writing (and in the writing of any sort of story) as long as one knows how to achieve a desired effect. And the desired effect is generally the long lasting effect.LNS is a cool little joint of a movie, studded with stars galore. Which, of course, makes it a pleasurable view. Or at least for me it always does; how else could you define a film with Bruce Willis, Ben Kingsly and (the ever present, if I may say so) Morgan Freeman? Yeah, sure, stars generally ruin movies by being a part of them. But that's only the case if the movie tries to be a serious lesson of morale and virtue. Which LNS does not.And that's why it's cool. A very well conceived popcorn flick, which connects all the dots in their eternal shallowness in the way it should. Nothing too fancy, nothing too subtle. Just enough for a good time. That is, if you enjoy having a good time without thinking too much about it and if you don't let yourself distracted by the twinkling bloody frames.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
MacGuffins,"Lucky Number Slevin  no, that's not a typo  will easily be dismissed as Tarantino-esquire. Starring Josh Hartnett as the unlucky title character, the film has more twists and turns than a high-tech roller-coaster, but it's just as much fun (and almost as immediately forgettable).Directed with breakneck technique by Paul McGuigan from a clever though highly implausible script by Jason Slimovic, the film is cast, with one minor exception, impeccably. It marks the first role that justifies Josh Hartnett's hype, and bestows Lucy Liu the most normal  and incandescent  part of her career. It's a bonus that they have palpable on-screen chemistry, as well as great foils in the guise of Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman (though Ben Kingsley's high-strung performance as The Rabbi is a miscalculation). The film itself is stylized  written in high gumshoe/screwball mode, with a guided tour of ugly wallpapers throughout history as part of its hard-boiled milieu  though the actors' convictions root the topsy-turvy narrative in recognizable human terrain.At its best, Lucky Number Slevin has the feel of a minor John Huston caper directed, with prankish glee, by Brian DePalma. It's a blood-revenge thriller with no depth, though there are reservoirs of feeling in Hartnett's and Liu's performances, as well as wit. Liu seems to the screwball manor born. And Hartnett prances around for nearly 30 minutes of screen time in nothing more than a long purple towel and a quizzical expression. He's such a game actor that his performance is both a put-on and homage to the long line of Macguffins in film noir. With, of course, a twist.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Why people don't like this movie is beyond me...,"The subject says it all...This is a good, fast paced thriller... It would have been a really good thriller if it were not for the graphic scenes at the start of the movie, but once you get through that and a little bit of the confusion, this movie picks up very well...I don't want to mention any thing about the story, I think there is enough mentioned already at the plot summary and that's all you need to know.But trust me, do not believe people that say this is a bad movie... it is better than the many garbage movies that come out nowadays.. the acting and suspense is solid across the board. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are good, but the trump has to be Josh Harnett. He was good.Like I said, the only bad point of this movie are the graphic scenes at the start..

Mindless fun,"I went to see this in theaters when it first came out. It must have been 2006. It was a lot of fun and not too much of a disappointment because well, let's just say I was not expecting much. Interesting characters galore, fun lines, not much in the way of story. Let's say it tries to be something it's not, and can't quite pull it off, but the actors and great performances given herein more than make up for it in total. It is funny and witty and great to watch again and again like Smokin Aces and such fare. Pulp Fiction it ain't, and it missed that mark for sure but let's be honest, few films can ever live up the the very high standard Mr. Tarantino set.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"A welcome surprise, Slevin has appeared as if from nowhere.","Bruce Willis, Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci and Josh Hartnett fill a cast line up every bit as impressive as say, Sin City. Leaving behind the sour taste of Wicker Park, Scottish McGuigan follows the likes of his own Gangster Number 1 with this incredibly cool, at times funny thriller that has somehow sneaked into the cinemas without much of a fuss. Supporting cast includes a very welcome cameo from a Jackie Brown star and a bunch of UK actors imitating their US counterpart's accents to perfection. The pairing of Sir Ben and Freeman alone is worth the price of admission, but this is Hartnett(as Slevin)'s film and perhaps it should not be too surprising that he carries it off effectively. In fact, none of the cast really put a foot wrong and even Lucy Liu is pretty adorable (against type if you believe the all the press).Despite a reasonably confusing series of opening events, Slevin is essentially a straight forward, neat black comedy of errors(mistaken identity for one). The dialogue is at times razor sharp and the action is well shot. The body count climbs steadily as the movie progresses at a cracking pace that never becomes dull. Slevin is thematically similar to a few other choice stories, but like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang - Slevin should be enjoyed more for the ride and the audience should try not to guess ahead of the plot and let it unfold naturally. There will still be some surprises appearing even for the most avid film fans but like so many thrillers Slevin could be ruined from word of mouth. If it weren't for the warm, familiar feel of similar films, this little gem would be rated higher. Unfairly dismissed by some as confusing, wrongly compared to the legendary Usual Suspects - it's a league apart from the mess that was Revolver and doesn't outstay a welcome.Oh, and Willis gets to call someone a 'f*** head'. Great stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Decent, but not flawless","Lucky Number Slevin is a cool movie with very nicely stylized filming and editing. The story vaguely reminds us of The Big Lewbowski. Both movies featuring a protagonist that doesn't seem to care much about the people he's dealing with, but that just wants to sort his stuff out. Be it a rug, or much bigger stuff, like in this movie.The story stays entertaining and interesting and everything is finished up decently in the end. However, I can't help but being left with some questions about some characters' behavior; making it feel like some of it was just for the sake of being able to keep the story going.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Wow!  Great Noir Caper Flick,"2006 Sundance Film Festival From the opening scene in Lucky Number Slevin, you will be straining to keep up. People are getting killed left and right, and it's never clear until the end of the movie how they are all connected. But you know it fits somehow and Scottish director Paul McGuigan (Wicker Park) manages to keep you guessing while firmly grabbing your attention and holding it with hardly a second to take a breath.In the film noir tradition, but with the intense and graphic violence of the Lock Stock and Layer Cake genre, Slevin is really a caper movie, and frankly reminded me more of The Sting than anything else. It dances nimbly from grisly stomach-churning action to clever and light-hearted banter. This could only be accomplished by a truly incredible cast, led by Josh Hartnett in an outstanding performance, great work by Lucy Liu, Bruce Willis doing his thing, and supported by the always excellent Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. There's even a little time for Stanley Tucci.Liu plays Lindsay, the next-door-neighbor/natural sleuth/coroner/love interest who discovers Slevin in her neighbor Nick's apartment. They mystery that immediately engages her is what happened to Nick, who never shows up. However, plenty of people do show up, mistaking Slevin for Nick, and before long he is neck deep in murder contracts, called debts and warring gang factions. Hartnett plays the role to perfection. I've never seen him this good. He is both convincing and empathetic as a glib, fearless victim of mistaken identity, yet filled with confidence that he can make his plan work.This is a terrific film, assuming you can stomach the bloody violence. The pieces fit neatly together (well, I have one bone to pick with the scriptwriter, but it would be revealing too much to share it). I highly recommend Lucky Number Slevin.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
""" Danger can arise from any Bad Dog, but mostly from the one you created ""","Our story began in the mind of writer Jason Smilovic and later directed well in the movie called "" Lucky Number Slevin "" by Paul McGuigan. It relates the story apparently initiated through mistaken identity. A traveler visiting a friend accepts an invitation to stay at an apartment in another city. Once there however, he meets Lindsey (Lucy Liu) a sexy next door neighbor, is slugged and mugged in broad daylight just before he is kidnapped and threatened with death if he doesn't pay a great debt and do a favor for The 'Boss', a local Godfather (Morgan Freeman). However, he also realizes, in order to fulfill the command, he must kill a total stranger for 'The Rabbi' a rival Godfather (Ben Kingsley). The reason for the duel threat dates back some twenty years and involves a professional Hit-man named Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis). The film is briefly confusing and further muddled if the audience doesn't pay close attention to the interesting players. Although a serious feature, the inclusion of dark comedy makes for a black situation which is flavored with fast action and hard hitting excitement. Josh Hartnett, plays Slevin Kelevra and holds his own against the heavyweight stars of the movie. All in all, an unexpected and wonderful movie recommended for the thinking audience. The result, . . . a Classic in the making. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Not bad, but not as clever as it thinks it is.","I pretty much went into this film with little by way of expectations  the reviews I remembered suggested that it wasn't all that good. However, I was pleasantly surprised by what I got. Sure, the all star cast were maybe on cruise control (although Hartnett and (particularly) Liu were moderately sparkling) and maybe the 'twist' was blatantly telegraphed ahead, and maybe there was nothing new, and maybe the attempt to justify one of the murders is a little shaky (as the protagonist could not have known what we learn  it was a murder of expedience. Watch out for it), and maybe it wasn't half as clever as it thought it was, but sometimes a movie can just be a movie without pretensions to being art, and can be no less enjoyable for that. This is a decent little film which may not be anyone's favourite film of all time but at least it isn't Speed 2. And that, of course, is a very good thing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Nice one Bruce. And the rest.,"Impressively cast, well acted, funny and cleverly written dark comedy that is definitely worth a look. Keeping company with legends such as Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Bruce Willis (who has been taking more and more great roles recently), Josh Hartnett takes the lead in the title role and plays it well. Freeman and Kingsley are as ever faultless and brilliant. Willis is fantastic in this kind of role. The dark, understated, non-action-blockbuster, big cast thrillers suit him well. Keep it up Bruce. To top off this top-notcher, Lucy Lui is looking gorgeous in her role as the love interest. I look forward to watching more films by Paul McGuigan, a director I'd previously been unaware of.

people I don't care about doing things I don't care about for reasons I don't want to know about,"No spoilers for this review.

He's too plain white bread in a sea of crazy wacky characters. He needs more presence of his own. This is a fast talking twisty complicated convoluted story.

Bruce Willis plays Bruce Willis and Josh Hartnett is adequate. For strange reasons I've never been that taken by Lucy Liu and Lucky Number Slevin doesn't change things for me.

Josh Harnett  vs  The New Trend,"""Lucky Number Slevin"" feels like the thesis of a promising film student from the P T Anderson/ Quentin Tarantino school of smart ass film-making. To tell you the truth, I'm getting a bit too tired of this clever, oh so clever style of narration. The dialog, coming out of Freeman and Kingsley mouth is as fun as it is meaningless. Absurd without being Ionesco absurd. Absurd but self consciously so. After a little while you're way ahead of the characters - not plot wise naturally, but style wise. You know is going to be one of those movies trying to be those other movies. That in itself makes the experience rather frustrating. Thank God for Josh Harnett. He is an actor that manages to remind you of all those greats icons of the past and at the same time he's an original. The fact that I could actually see this movie again just to look at him, makes me think he'll be a huge star. The kind of star the people remember and loves, generation after generation. I wish he manages to find his Elia Kazan.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"""Lucky Number Slevin"" is like a puzzle however when you put all the pieces together it seems all too easy.","I was supposed to see ""Lucky Number Slevin"" a week before it was released in theaters at the Philadelphia Film Festival but oddly enough the night of the screening I couldn't attend because the film was sold out. After that night, I wanted to see ""Slevin"" but for some reason I never got around to seeing it. So today finally I decided to head to the theater and see what this ""Lucky Number Slevin"" was all about.""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a movie about mistaken identity in which Slevin (Josh Harnett) gets mixed up in a war involving two of New York's biggest crime bosses. The crime bosses are the Rabbi played by Ben Kingsley and the Boss played by Morgan Freeman who as I am sure you already guessed are arch rivals. Unfortunately for Slevin, he is now in the middle of this mess and has to find a way out of it before he ends up dead. A somewhat clever crime thriller ensuesComing out of ""Lucky Number Slevin"" earlier today, I really didn't know how to feel about it. So like most movies that I don't know what to think of after I see them, I decided to think about the film and then read some viewpoints on the film. By doing this I have come to the following conclusion, there were several aspects of this film that I really enjoyed and some that I did not.So what worked and what didn't work you may ask? First off, I felt that most of the characters were all very interesting and well crafted especially Goodkat, the Boss, and the Rabbi. I also have to admit that this film was very suspenseful and kept its audience pretty much engaged throughout its entire running time. However, the first 20 minutes of this movie before Josh Harnett's character came into the film was the best and most interesting part of the film. Also if you actually pay close attention to the first 20 minutes of this film you will be able to figure out the entire movie which I am not sure is a good thing or a bad thing at this point.The dialogue in this film for the most part was very poor. I feel that the writer Jason Smilovic was trying too hard to be creative. The whole back and forth dialogue of ""Why do they call him the Rabbi? Because he is a Rabbi"" was rather lame. I think Mr. Smilovic wanted it to come off as funny and clever but instead it just seemed really stupid. This is just one example of the silly back and forth dialogue used but there is a lot more of it all of which I feel is unnecessary and dumb.Also I think Lucy Liu's character was pointless. I think they just threw her in as a love interest because she really didn't seem to play an important part at all. With that being said, the ending which involved Lucy Liu was way too typical and mainstream. I felt if the movie ended just a few minutes earlier, it would have been a lot better or if the ending didn't seem like such a Hollywood ending it would have been better as well.Lastly, if you really think about the film, it tries to hard to be clever. Thinking back a lot of this film is just too ironic for its own good. It's like the pieces of the puzzle go together too easily. I don't want to spoil this movie for anyone but if you keep your brain on during it or really think about it afterwards you will understand what I am saying. Both the writer and the director think that they are doing something very clever with ""Slevin"" but looking back, it wasn't really as clever as I think they intended the film to be.Many will say this movie is like ""the Usual Suspects"", ""Snatch"", and ""Pulp Fiction"" and I would have to agree with that to a degree. The differences is those films especially ""Pulp Fiction"" are truly unique and very clever, where ""Lucky Number Slevin"" when all is said and done is just a good movie that will be forgotten by most in a few years. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie because it is entertaining and is somewhat clever; however the movie has its share of flaws but then again most movies do especially with crime thrillers.In the end, I was expected a lot from ""Lucky Number Slevin"" and I can't help but feel a little disappointed by it. As I already said, I think this movie tried to be a little too clever for its own good and that wound up hurting it. Plus, the fact that everything just came together so nicely made the film a little bit too typical. But when all is said and done, ""Slevin"" is what it is, a somewhat clever crime thriller with decent performances and a pretty decent storyline. I remained entertained throughout the entire running time and while I wasn't blown away in the end, I was satisfied nonetheless.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Revenge Is a Dish Best Served Cold,"In New York, when the unlucky newcomer Slevin (Josh Hartnett) arrives in the apartment of his friend Nick Fisher for a leisure time, he is mistakenly taken as being his friend, who debts money to two powerful bosses of the criminal world.

Many readers may not be familiarized with his name, but he is an excellent young director. The story and the screenplay have many plot points in the end and pays a great homage to Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"".

Not bad but writers need to try harder,"The twist and reveal plot is definitely entertaining but all in all, it feels like a lesser effort trying to ape non-linear action-thriller hits like Pulp Fiction, Lock Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels, etc. The way this film reveals important pieces of the puzzle through flashbacks is inferior to the above examples because they feel more like 'the butler did it' cop-outs instead of integral story moments... again, these are signs of a not-so-well thought out script.Another element that isn't strong enough to warrant a 'keeper' rating of 7 or better: weak dialogue. It's all very mundane and nothing really makes you feel the characters are interesting individuals with their own motivations. Nothing really dark or menacing to drive up the tension (the set-up murder was OPERATIC in the victims' hysteria and emotional), and hardly any comedic moments, except those meant to play off Mr Slevin's ""I'm a nice guy, why are you doing this to me?"" schmuck facade.This one does better than the other try-hard movie in my book - THE BIG HIT - purely because the director and actors are more confident and capable.

"Fun, if a tad predictable","This suffers somewhat in comparison to Brick, which I watched for the second time right before I saw Slevin. Like Brick, it's a noir / crime flick that attempts stylized dialogue. The dialogue in Slevin succeeds at being clever and entertaining. Unfortunately, the film itself never feels as weighty as Brick. It shoots only for coolness, where Brick has more of a soul. Still, that doesn't mean that Slevin is worthless. Far from it. It's actually very entertaining. Josh Hartnett makes up for his terrible 2006 performance in The Black Dahlia. He's very good here; people who don't believe he has talent should see this. Lucy Liu is gorgeous, and she delivers her dialogue with appropriate slickness. A lot of the pleasure comes from her and Hartnett simply interacting. Bruce Willis, Stanely Tucci, Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman are all good, too. The twisty story is fairly predictable. It's still fun, though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Stylish Post-Modern MovieWitty, Violent, and Fun","Reading Reviews from Film Critics and Bloggers, 99% of these ""Clever"" Cinematic Connoisseurs will ""Proudly"" and Loudly Name Drop Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994), ""The Usual Suspects"" (1995) and then Go On and On about these Landmark Movies and how this one is a Pretentious Imitation.If You look up the Definition of ""Classic"", somewhere in there it will say ""inspires imitation"". Is it so Bad, then that the Writer and Director were Inspired and set out to Craft a Film of Their Own. Well, deal with it, They did, and it's a pretty Good Imitation.With an All-Star Cast and an ""Artsy"" Delivery there is much to be Admired and the Movie never fails to be Watchable as We travel down the Path forged by Better Films and the Entertainment Value is Solid. The Movie moves along with many Pop Culture References and Snappy Comebacks (more often than not resulting in an uncomfortable retaliation for the wise-cracking Protagonist).Sure, this thing might be Guilty of Trying Very Hard to Reflect Current Trends but it mostly Succeeds in making it an Above Average entry in the Neo-Noir Genre and if You can put Your Cynicism aside and just Enjoy the Ride it will most Likely be a Fun Time at the Movies where Style, Violence, Twists, and Talky Characters Reside.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Dark Humor Amidst Mob Wars,"Lucky Number Slevin is a wild, genre-bending experience that keeps you guessing from start to finish. The story follows Slevin, a guy with a seriously unlucky streak who finds himself in the middle of a mob war between two big-shot crime bosses.The cast is stacked with talent, with Josh Hartnett playing our seemingly hapless protagonist, and Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, and Ben Kingsley as the bigwig mob bosses pulling the strings. Each actor brings their A-game to the table, adding layers to a script that's as intricate as my well-crafted, sarcastic one-liners.But what sets Lucky Number Slevin apart is its non-linear narrative, jumping back and forth in time like it's playing a game of temporal hopscotch. The film's stylish visuals and snappy dialogue create a noir-ish atmosphere that's both dark and mysterious. As the plot unravels, you find yourself questioning everything and everyone. The suspense builds, and just when you think you've got it all figured out, the movie throws another curveball your way. It's like a chess game where you're constantly trying to anticipate the next move, only to realize you're playing against a grandmaster.Despite the convoluted storyline, Lucky Number Slevin manages to maintain a dark sense of humor throughout. The witty banter and clever dialogue add a touch of levity to the otherwise intense and intricate plot. It's a cinematic puzzle that will leave your brain doing mental gymnastics with a healthy dose of dark comedy, making it a unique and entertaining ride for crime thriller fans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
starts intriguing,"This movie starts out intriguing and confusing. You wonder what is going on. You suspect it is a crap movie but the directing and acting are good. First class talent, none of which is wasted. A pleasure to watch the actors perform. Such subtle nuance of performance. So, just a crap script?There is occasional humor. You begin to think it is drifting into comedy.Then comes the revelation. The cold, hard cruel revelation. Not expected. The humor is forgotten. The revelation is blinding and hard to take. The script turns out not to be crap, but brilliant.....It's not a feel good movie, but it is worth watching to the end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Stinging.,"A case of mistaken identity throws seemingly ordinary man Josh Hartnett between two ruthless New York City crime bosses (the always priceless Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley). Now he has to dodge police detective Stanley Tucci and shady hit-man Bruce Willis while starting a hot love affair with the super-sexy Lucy Liu. But in a picture like this you know that nothing is quite as it seems as a dizzying final act turns the very foundation of the entire production on its ear and gives the audience a wickedly twisted conclusion that will make earlier trivial situations come to the forefront. Amazingly slick and well-crafted mind-bender that toes the line of obscurity throughout its early parts and then finally finds its way late and becomes a nice little success. Hartnett continues to impress when given the right material (like he had in ""Black Hawk Down"") and the other mainstays are generally constant guarantees. Patience and attention to small details will help you greatly in this flawed, but highly ambitious teaser that finds its legs and runs strong as it progresses. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Entertaining,"This movie has humour (not hilarious), good(not impressive) acting and a story to tell. Action is limited but present and most of the characters are almost interesting. One flaw is ""OBVIOUS"" though; in order to be unpredictable they have created too many twists and it shows. (Honestly, i will be really shocked if one of these days a movie is not mutilated by trying to say ""SURPRISE..., WE GOT YOU! DIDN'T WE?"". That was the weak part of the story. Still the film manages to remain enjoyable, i relate this to potential.

Gem of a film...,"A brilliant, quirky, stylish and stylised crime thriller conundrum of a film with more than a nod to Tarantino and a terrific cast putting in first class performances. Hartnett is fantastic, the chemistry with co star Lucy Lui electric, Willis brilliant as the cold hard assassin, Kingsley and Freeman typically strong performances as the two warring crime bosses, Tucci the cop with a past etc - from start to finish everyone faultless... Yes it's violent but no more than is pretty much the norm these days. It's fast paced, never really slows, twists and turns and unfolds it's story near faultlessly - I loved this film when it came out and never tire of a rewatch every now and then. Always thought there was a great actor within Hartnett - this film proves it, Shame we don't see more of him, and shame that in this day and age of franchises that they didn't run this to a sequel, or indeed sequels.

Surprisingly good.,"The title just screamed bad movie, and I passed this movie by when it first came out. I recently watched it and was pleasantly surprised. While this movie has a high body count and a bit of action, it's really a dark comedy. If you are watching for the action you are watching for all the wrong reasons.Poor Slevin has a really bad day that just keeps getting worse. His apartment is condemned, he catches his girlfriend cheating, gets mugged, and goes to stay with a friend. He is then mistaken by 2 different mob bosses for his friend and hilarity ensues from there. The director could have taken the movie as an action flick and the script would have worked well, but instead focused on the comedic aspects as Slevin just tries to stay alive as his day gets increasingly worse being caught between 2 mobster bosses with deep grudges against each other.The ending you kind of figure out about 3/4ths through the movie, at least I did, but there was never any suspense about it. Just a lot of good laughs as the inevitable end rolls out. I'd rated the movie higher if the director hadn't tried to switch to a serious movie at the very end of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Like an American Guy Ritchie film,"And, when I say 'like an American Guy Richie film' I mean one of his good ones, not Swept Away. Lucky Number Slevin follows the tale of a young man, oddly enough who goes by the name 'Slevin.' Upon arriving in New York he's mistaken for someone else and ends up getting caught in a life or death feud between two rival mob bosses (both wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley). Throw into the mix a hit-man (Bruce Willis) who you don't know which side he's on and Lucy Lui as the love interest and you have the recipe for a half decent film.Like made famous more in British gangster films, there are plenty of shady characters along the way (you know most will end up on the wrong end of a gun sooner or later), plus even more twists and turns so you don't know who's double-crossing who. However, luckily there aren't so many plot twists here that the conclusion will leave you scratching your head and having to look the end up on the internet (as I found myself doing with Guy Ritchie's 'Revolver').All in all, Lucky Number Slevin is a good, solid entry into the gangster genres. It may never quite attain the dizzy heights of Goodfellas etc, but it's definitely worth a watch it you're a fan of the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Slevin vs. Suspects,"(one quick thing when watching: don't make the same huge mistake Roger Ebert did and expect Lucky Number Slevin to be a serious movie, the triviality of the characters is meant to be that way)Almost every thriller is set up so you know there is a twist coming. What makes a thriller stand out is when you forget it's a thriller. Fight Club is just an epic fighting movie. Memento makes you concerned with figuring out what's going on, much like he is trying to do. The Usual Suspects has you guessing at how the boat incident came to be and who Keyser Soze is. All of them make you forget you're watching a thriller, and just leave you concerned with what is happening instead of what will end up happening. Lucky Number Slevin does this brilliantly. With one of the best scripts I've ever heard (the film style and transitions are just as poetic), a very unique and entertaining set up for a story, and a constant introduction of interesting characters, it makes you forget why any of it is related to the opening scenes. Whether or not you love the movie, you must respect what a masterpiece it is, the amount of thought that went into every line and transition is impressive and if you consider yourself a critic in any sense you won't be let down.Now as far as Lucky Number Slevin being compared to The Usual Suspects, I think Slevin trumps. If any comparison is to be made, it's that Slevin fixed all the problems with Suspects. In the first five minutes I knew who the mastermind was because they showed him and had him talk, one of the most obvious things I've ever seen. Slevin doesn't do that, only one face is shown and that's because he is telling the story. Also, Suspects doesn't have anything really unique to it, the structure isn't that special, and besides a few good quotes it can't compare to Slevin. Slevin and Suspects are completely different, and I would never think judge one from the other. If you want to see a pioneer for thrillers, see Suspects. If you want to experience a script, story, and film style come together virtually flawlessly, see Slevin.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Underrated--a flawed but very enjoyable overlooked movie...,"I'm not sure I heard a single good thing about this movie when it first came out. When I finally happened to catch it on cable, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.With the exception of his brief role in the opening of 'Sin City,' I generally find Josh Hartnett to be a pretty bland and unexceptional presence on screen. But he's incredibly charming, fun, and likable in this movie and it makes me wish he would take on more of these kind of roles and material in the future. He really shines and shows some genuine star potential here. He pulls off some tricky and fast-paced dialogue banter with humor and ease and manages to hold his own very well while on screen with big-hitters like Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, and Bruce Willis.The twists, turns, and reveals in the movie, particularly towards the end, start to feel a little forced and contrived. Entire sections of the movie lack focus and urgency in the story telling. But the overall tone and vibe of the movie is so breezy and genuinely fun, it's easy to overlook these flaws and just go along for the ride. As long as you go into this movie with moderate expectations, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. And whether you're a Josh Hartnett fan or not (and I'm generally not), this is easily some of his best work and the only time I've ever seen him bring any real charm, fun, personality, and/or something special to a role.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Excellent Thriller,"Because of mistaken identity Slevin (Hartnett) gets caught in the middle of a war between 2-crimelord rivals (Freeman and Kingsley). This can't be good.This is one you have to stay with and watch everything because the things you may miss will show up later on and you will be lost. This is a little short on action, but the story itself and the acting make up for that. This throws everything at you and you think you know what is going on because everything makes sense. You might say this is a larger variation of the Kansas City Shuffle as Goodkat (Willis) likes to point out. Have I said too much? I don't think so. This will rank as a classic along with Pulp Fiction, and Sin City and yes, The Usual Suspects. The cinematography isn't as good as in the movies just mentioned but it is good nevertheless.The acting and dialogue all around is excellent. You will enjoy the New Jersey almost Brooklynese accent coming out of Ben Kingsley (The Rabbi). You are amazed because you still remember Kingsley as Gandhi and how could this be? As for Josh Hartnett, I still say he looks like a young Tommy Lee Jones and acts like him too. Good job. I have new respect for Lucy Liu. She really is good, and I fell in love. As for Willis and Freeman (The Boss) what more can be said about them? They are perfect.This is an excellent cast along with a very good supporting cast giving us an excellent thriller.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Bad Clumps,"I did not enjoy this, which is a rare thing among so-called con movies.The idea in con movies is that there is a game among certain players, at least including the writer and the viewer. Sometimes there are on screen detectives and discoverers as well. We have those here in Tucci's detective and the ""girl next door."" And then there are the marks. When you have all these folks as discoverers of the real story, there are all sorts of opportunities for us to be fooled. Its the detective genre with multiple facets.In order to be effective, you have to have some things be very ""readable"" and others unexpected and novel. In this case, you have at least 5 cons, possibly seven. But they simply aren't fun. I think it is in part because they aren't different enough from each other. More important is the apparent rule that when you have several ""semantic distances"" (that is: the distance between discoverer and the discovery), they all have to be the same. Lest you think this is something impossible to see or measure.In this case, all the cons are of similar types (bad) and different semantic distances (also bad).""Old Boy"" despite its other flaws, got this part right, the distance part.

funny but too similar to other previous movies,"Too many things seen in other previous movies; the cast is definitely over the average but this revenge thriller is on the whole a little bit too forced, its dialogs sometimes too obscure. Could say it's kinda disposable flick, a lot of analogies to Quentin Tarantino's productions. By the way Quentin looks like a genius by comparison; to sum up might it recycles too much (also has some Guy Ritchie's atmospheres), although a movie starring Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley, along with Bruce Willis, must have something interesting.

Not as bad as some say...,"I think this film has got some rather harsh reviews from some sources, claiming it is not as clever as it thinks it is and so on. I've also heard it being compared to the similar film of last year revolver, but I haven't seen this one yet so I cant comment on this.I saw this movie last week, and I must say cant really remember a lot of it (which isn't really a good sign). What I can remember is the cast performances were actually quite good. John Hartnett made a good job of keeping the main character funny and interesting. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley both played their crime boss parts well. If nothing else, Lucy Lui is very nice to look at, and although it was obviously not his best performance ever, Bruce Willis did a good job of playing a world class assassin who is more involved in the stories events then you might first think.I cant really remember anything at all about the soundtrack, editing or direction apart from the fact there was nothing we really haven't seen before, as most of the films appeal lies in the cast and complex plot.I think Lucky Number Slevin is just another case of a decent crime-mystery thriller which we have seen pulled off in better ways before. You could certainly find worse ways of spending a few hours, and make no mistake, this film is a lot better then most Hollywood action-thrillers that spoon feed the plot to you, and leave you to just turn your brain off.If you really want to see a perfectly crafted crime thriller that will have you guessing the plot till the end, you may want to rather watch something like L.A Confidential, or the brilliant Usual Suspects.

"Well done, this one is a tremendously entertaining jewel!","I seldomly give a 10 because perfection is rare. But I can find no flaw in this film, the flaws (which to me occur most often and get on my nerves the most) being: a) stupid plot / dialogs / motives b) predictability c) plot holes and d) not developing a universe which makes you suspense your disbelief.On the contrary, this film was intelligent, suspenseful, sometimes funny and  which is most important  breathtakingly entertaining. The acting was great, the lead actors were excellent, I was most impressed with Hartnett, whom up until this movie I had in the goofy teenage actor starring in simple minded comedies drawer  not anymore! He has earned his merits to be considered a great / serious actor in my point of view.The characters were great too, for example: bodyguards and henchmen share the same characteristics and ""modus operandi"" in every movie but this film manages to give some fresh air even to accepted and universal standards. Stylistic devices add the icing on the cake: Great angles, comparisons, repetitions and (outstanding!) the overall frame structure which is revealed in the end (I don't want to give away spoilers but you'll know what I mean when you watch it) which enriches the movie with a substantially satisfying moral essence.All in all: fantastic.

Who cares?,"Lucky Number Slevin starts out innocently enough. Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis as Bruce Willis) introduces the film with some snappy lines, smoothly finds itself in an exposition with some more witty dialogue from Slevin (Josh Hartnett) and the slightly obnoxious Lindsey (Lucy Liu), a couple of gangsters break in and threaten Slevin - with clever style.If that sounds condescending, it should. Lucky Number Slevin is clearly a product of the Pulp Fiction generation, and like its brethren, it lacks absolutely everything that made Pulp Fiction appealing in the first place. Characters toss off pop culture-enhanced monologues, regardless of actual character. Toss motivations out the window, these gangsters are classy! Even worse, the pop culture references are so forced, so unnecessary, just so... bad (Slevin and Lindsey's discussion on James Bond is the worst thing I've heard at the movies this year).The direction is horribly confused. It is comical? Is it serious? There is no clarity in what the atmosphere is supposed to convey, so you can't connect to the situations. Well, that and the fact that Slevin also has some particularly dreadful pacing, culminating in a seemingly hour-long plot twist revelation, where the twist is revealed by detailing every little thing about the story. Scenes are repeated. There are nauseating jump-cuts. You learn more about the story than you care to know. Hell, you know more about the story than you do about the actual plot progression, if there was any at the endpoint. And that's how it ends. It just does.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Wrong Time. Wrong Place. Wrong Number.,"In New York, when the unlucky newcomer Slevin arrives in the apartment of his friend Nick Fisher for a leisure time, he is mistakenly taken as being his friend, who debts money to two powerful bosses of the criminal world. He is pressed by The Boss to kill the gay son of The Rabbi, as a payback for the death of The Boss's son and pay off $33,000 to The Rabbi. Nick's next door neighbor, Lindsay, who works in the morgue, tries to help Slevin. Meanwhile, a mysterious man is secretly plotting to kill Slevin and Slevin is under constant surveillance by the relentless Detective Brikowski.From the first five minutes of the film, about five people die but you're not so sure. Mainly, you're not so sure of anything because this film is trying to be clever, trying to run you into false conclusions. On top of that, the film goes in a fast pace, so you will have to keep up (I didn't, though).This film will keep your attention from top to bottom. If you're one of those people trying to look for a thriller that tries to keep you guessing until the end, you will like this movie. If you're a mainstream audience member, then you should watch another movie.Some might say this film tries too hard to be clever like a ""Pulp Fiction"" kind of way and that it succumbs to a convoluted plot. Others might think this movie works the way it tries to be and the way it turned out. I loved this film, by the way. I love how the film plays out and tries to keep you guessing until the end.What I also liked on top of that are the performances by these great actors and actress. Apart from Josh Hartnett and Bruce Willis, the performance by Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are really good. I also liked Lucy Liu's character as a fast talking, intelligent person.If you are looking for a film other than a film that spoon feeds you, # Slevin should be on the top of your list of intelligent and ingenious thrillers.

"Entertaining, but kind of flat.","Lucky Number Slevin tells the story of a man named Slevin Kalvera, friend to a man named Nick Fisher. One day Slevin is at Nick's apartment waiting for him when two gangsters show up informing him that he owes ""The Boss"" all kinds of money. No matter how much he explains that he's not Nick Fisher, ""The Boss"" won't let up. He wants Slevin to kill a rival gangster's son. Unfortunately, this rival gangster, ""The Rabbi"", wants something from Fisher as well. Throw into the mix a legendary hit-man and a curious girl next door, and you're well on your way to discovering the mystery behind the movie.The first thing that threw me off about Lucky Number Slevin was how misleading the trailer was. The trailer made it look like a happy, purely for entertainment popcorn flick, but it ended up being a gangster drama. The writing was really good. I enjoyed listening to the characters talking back and forth because the dialogue was so snappy and precise. I had to laugh at how great it was. The movie contains a fair amount of action, and as things unfold leading up to the ending, it's fun to try and piece the puzzle together. However, at the same time the plot is kind of flat and underdeveloped. I don't really know how to explain it. It's a contradiction. Cool things happen throughout the movie, but the plot isn't that deep. The movie starts, some cool twists and turns occur, and it ends with no character development or anything.The performances are pretty good. Ben Kinglsey, Morgan Freeman, and Bruce Willis are good no matter what role they're in, and they're all great here, although Bruce Willis didn't really have a whole lot to do in the movie. It was nice to see Morgan Freeman play a real bad guy for once (unless you choose to count Hard Rain and Shawshank Redemption, where he plays a bank robber and a murderer). Josh Hartnett was pretty good as Slevin. I'm not a huge Lucy Liu fan, so she wasn't very thrilling.Overall, this is good for one viewing, because it has some great twists and turns and a good ending, and some really good performances.

"Not At All What You're Expecting, ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a Modern Classic","""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a film I'd only known about in name for years. I'd wanted to see it for years, but because I had no idea what it was about, I never took the time to see it. Besides Bruce Willis being in it, I had no background information to go off of when I rented it.The film is about Slevin, a normal everyday guy who goes to visit his friend Nick Fisher in New York. When Slevin is mistaken for Nick by two rival gangsters, the Boss and the Rabbi, he has a double ultimatum issued: to get $33,000 dollars for the Rabbi, and to kill the Rabbi's son for the Boss. With the help of Nick's neighbour Lindsay, her and Slevin try to figure out what all is happening and how to get Slevin out of his predicaments. That's about as far as I can get into the plot without spoiling the hell out of this movie. Believe me, this is one of those flicks where if I spoiled it, you'd hate me forever.Josh Hartnett plays Slevin. You instantly like this guy. He's a relatable, funny, wise ass, down-on-his-luck guy. Everything he says is either funny or very intelligent. One of my favorite tidbits is when Slevin questions how the Rabbi can be a religious man and a gangster, without conflicting his religion. It's little bits like this that really make you like his character.The rest of the cast is also great. Morgan Freeman plays the Boss. I don't even know what to say, it's Morgan Freeman being awesome, what more do you want? Ben Kingsley plays the Rabbi. I've never been a big fan of Kinsley, especially of late, but I thought he was great in this film. He does the Jewish accent perfectly and it sets him apart from practically every other part he's ever played, where I always think of him as ""that British guy"". As for Lucy Liu, she's kind of just there, but her character is still very likable. When she starts talking Bond trivia, that's when I was in nerd heaven. Seriously, if I ever meet a chick who knows every actor who ever played Ernst Stavro Blofeld, I'll marry her on the spot.""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a film that was obviously inspired by Quentin Tarantino's work, mainly ""Pulp Fiction"". It has all the makings of a Tarantino film: complicated, intelligent and fast dialogue used to discuss such simple topics, constant references to classic cinema, non-linearism, and characters overlapping into each other's stories. It's a great formula that I wished was used a bit more often, but I'm glad it's saved for films that really deserve to use it.""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a great film. With some Tarantino-esque flare and some great characters, you'll definitely enjoy this, especially if ""Pulp Fiction"" is up on your list of 'Best Crime Films Ever', in which case, this movie will probably join that list.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A very good Crime Mystery,"Rating-8/10Lucky Number Slevin is a film that contains a bunch of elements that a gangster film needs, and also a dash of comedy that brings it all well together. With a big cast of familiar faces and performances to match really, I really would recommend this, if not only to prove the critics wrong who don't like this film. I felt this film was safely very good, and here is why below.The story is serious at most times but also doesn't mind being comedic and this makes it much more fun as you really get more interested in the plot. It starts to get complicated towards the end but in a good way actually as the whole mystery and shocks that go on are revealed in a simple and easy way. It contains fun moments too, unpredictable and throws a few curveballs it just makes a very good piece of entertainment.Joh Hartnell in the main role is good, maybe not the best that could have been done of this role but he works it well, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley as the two mob bosses are good as well but yet again they never seem to do the role as well as it COULD be done, although it is steady going by all three. I did however think Lucy Liu fitted her role very well and portrayed a character that you didn't know much about really.It is written well and the script is the probably the strongest thing about this entire project. Directed well too the more technical side of this deals it's strongest cards and is why I rate as I have, the sets though are dizzying and never seem to fit what is going on, or any serious note the film is trying to find, but they don't ruin this films credibility.Apart from the sets the main problem with the movie is that It wraps itself around itself in a sense and becomes very confusing at times, mostly is isn't but it happens at certain parts which niggle down it's rating. I said about the acting which I did say wasn't bad but what I will say is that Bruce Willis completely wastes his talent in this with a bad performance that somehow never fits in with this piece.Those who like a good old action and mysterious plot should enjoy this as that is exactly what it turns out to be by the end and can be hugely enjoyable. It isn't the best of gangster film but could serve to please a fan of that type of film with it's two rival crime families, although the comedy may take some gangster film fans away from this one.Overall I give this an 8/10, it is a Safely Very Good movie but maybe not quite enough to be rated as Great. With this you seriously have to ignore the critics who don't like this because it is hugely enjoyable if you just watch it straight, enjoy the curves it throws at you and you will pleased by it hugely, If you start to look into this well then you may feel it isn't quite up to scratch with others like this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Re-watched and it's brilliant,"I've had this film in my collection for years and just rewatched it - it really is a gem. I fail to see how anyone gives it less than a 6.

The Ol' Kansas City Shuffle,"Wow, this is a great movie. No one should be surprised that this movie is so great because it has great, great actors involved. This is a wonderful Mystery movie with lots and lots of twists and turns. You really will not guess what happens next. This movie is just a huge puzzle that slowly gets put together, but it's like the puzzle is getting put together with pieces missing. Then by the end when those missing pieces are revealed, it's just amazing. The dialogue in this film is absolutely incredible. You can feel the emotion pouring from every scene. The greatest scene in this movie is at the end with Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley. These two guys are such great actors; this movie is worth watching just to see this one scene. Not that all the other scenes aren't great, but this one is in a class all its own. Everyone should see this movie for all the great acting. Here's a little on the major actors in the film: Slevin(Josh Hartnett): I'm not a huge fan of Hartnett, but it seems as though this role was tailor made for him. I honestly don't believe they could have picked a better person to play Slevin. Hartnett's personality and charisma fit this role really well.Mr. Goodkat(Bruce Willis): It just seems that Bruce Willis plays an excellent hit-man. When he gets into these hit-man roles, you can just look at him and see a stone cold killer. I wonder if he has ever really killed a man? It sure seems like it in this film. He seems like an old pro when he's got that look in his eye like he wants to kill you just for the fun of it. Great casting choice.Brikowski(Stanley Tucci): Brikowski is the lead detective in this film. Brikowski is quite eccentric and a little obsessive compulsive. He has to have control of everything; he can't stand for something to out of his control. Tucci was a great choice because he seems like a guy who always need to have order and control in his life.Lindsey(Lucy Liu): The girl next door. Adds a little comic relief to the film, but also kind of holds the film together as well. I really don't think this movie would have been as good without this character. Lucy Liu fits the role well because she has the spunky, peppy personality just like Lindsey.The Boss(Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi(Sir Ben Kingsley): It's freaking Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. Any role they play is gold. Enough said.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Totally Surprised Me!!!!,"This film took me by surprise. It is an excellent movie with a compelling story, wonderful acting, and brilliant direction. I have not seen this intense a movie since The Departed.Josh Hartnett is excellent in this film. One of the best performances I have seen him in. Sir Ben Kingsley is terrific as well. The character he portrays is outstanding. Lucy Lu seems somewhat annoying although that can be said about her character more than herself. Morgan Freeman and Stanley Tucci deliver good performances but overall, I think Bruce Willis came out on top. I will be using the nickname Goodkat for a long time to come. His character is terrific and no-one but Willis could play that character the way Willis does. He has such a serious and laid back attitude for such a deadly assassin.The story sucks you in brilliantly. Just like The Departed, I was compelled more and more to continue to watch. The story had grasped hold of me and I could not stop watching. Of course, more and more became revealed which built it up for a shocking turn of events (if you did not see it coming). Don't try to guess ahead of the film, watch in unfold and enjoy where it is going.There is plenty of action in this film. Bruce Willis shows us again why he is a brilliant action star and why he is a natural born on-screen killer. I also had a fond liking of the music in this film. The opening sketch is now one of my all time favorites.I really don't know how to describe this movie except as Outstanding. Paul McGuigan has created a masterpiece in my opinion. The only thing I can suggest is watch it! You won't regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Pretty good, but too clever for it's own good","Although I only had caught TV spots and screen-shots from Lucky Number Slevin, I avoided watching the trailer like the plague. It looked interesting enough, with a great cast, so I didn't want to ruin it. After managing to see it, I'm glad that I missed the trailer, but still a little disappointed with the final result.After a short interlude (of which I will not spoil), we are introduced to Slevin (Josh Hartnett). He's in a bathrobe, has a broken nose and has just gotten into New York. He's there to meet with his friend Nick Fisher, whose apartment Slevin is in, but no trace of Fisher. After some knocking, Lindsey (Lucy Liu) enters the picture, a neighbour who is looking for Nick, but just decides to flirt with the stranger instead. After she leaves, he gets another knock, and its the goons of a local crime boss aptly named, The Boss (Morgan Freeman).After taking the smart-ass Slevin into their car in the bathrobe, and breaking his nose some more, he meets with The Boss, and is informed of a rather large debt Fisher owes. The Boss doesn't seem to care that Slevin is not Fisher, but offers him a way out of the debt, by killing the son of another crime boss, The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley as he is credited in the credits). Slevin agrees, only to return home and be picked up by The Rabbi's boys. After he meets with The Rabbi, he finds out Fisher has another large debt to pay, and The Rabbi only gives him a few hours to get it to him.Still following? Need I even mention Bruce Willis' random hit-man character Mr. Goodkat who keeps popping around every corner, or Stanley Tucci's Detective Brikowski who is hot on the trail of Slevin? The film just seems to tie more and more characters to this one confusing plot line, and it seems like the addition of Liu was simply just to try and make sense of the whole thing, while proving as a mere somewhat good love interest for Hartnett.The film isn't too hard to follow, but as the story keeps rolling around and around to its conclusion where anything that seems a tad bit coincidental, or just does not seem clear, is completely crystal clear to that point that it becomes a little too clever for its own good. Things are all tied together (some for little to no reason), no plot point is left unturned (even the ones that make absolutely no sense until later, even then staying ludicrous), and in the end, it just becomes a nice tight little package. You cannot argue with this unfortunately, but for a movie like this, it ties the package way too tight. The film needs to breathe, and unfortunately, the film's plot line will not allow for it.If the substance is a little shifty, the style makes up for it. The cinematography is topnotch, and the colours are just fabulous. The film is totally anti-noir, but it takes the concept of film-noir, and adds colour to it. Sets are well photographed, and the costumes all match excellently. Hartnett's consistent nose injuries are also of note, as they contrast to the backgrounds wonderfully. The cast's main players are all very good, for as long or as small their roles are. The film's plot line may seem murky, but the dialogue is great. The delivery of the script's lines are all great, and all the witty smart ass quips are nailed to a tee (even though some of the conversations go around and around and around to the point of being like a conversation with David Caruso).It's not that Slevin is a bad movie. It's a great movie that is just too clever for it's own good. A little bit of touch-ups here and there to the plot would make the movie so much more better. It's an exercise in the reasoning of why tying everything up by the end, just does not always work.7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One Of the greatest twist action movies i've seen,"This movie is given less credit then it deserves. not to talk about the rewards i think it should receive, it is so well edited, the cast is really really great, i think this is the first time i saw Josh Hartnnent in a great performance. Bruce Willis is the psycho sociopath hit-man, and the twist at the end is not expected, at list not for me. i really tried to avoid seeing this movie, because i read the plot and it seemed stupid as hell, but the movie came out wonderful. so if you're interested, you want something to keep you stuck into the screen for about 2 hours, watch it. seriously, one of the best action movies i've seen in a very very long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Lucky Number,"A fast pace thriller that often has you struggling to keep as you try and figure out how everything is connected Slevin is well worth the price of admission despite having gone over without much of a fuss. It deserved much more attention for it's quality writing and sleek well shot action not to mention the impressive line up of quality actors. Pairing Morgan Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman is enough to leave you dazzled and that's leaving out Bruce Willis who gets to play something a bit outside his usual realm. For a film that revolves mainly around a case of mistaken identity the plot is not as simple as it sounds and from the very opening leaves you wondering how it's all going to work out. With good action, a healthy dose of violence, and a dash of black comedy Slevin is an underrated film which doesn't disappoint and deserves more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Surprisingly excellent,"Found this without knowing much about it, and it was a huge and very pleasant surprise... I loved it!I'd say it's best described as a hybrid noir-thriller / comedy, as there are many humorous moments woven throughout. It uses many ""classic"" film components... red herrings, mistaken identities, voice overs and flashbacks, yet doesn't seem like anything you've seen before.Slevin (Josh Hartnett) finds himself thrust into the middle of an ongoing war between rival crime lords (Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman... those two alone are worth the price of admission) and has to navigate out the other side. No spoilers here, but the script is rich and witty, the plot thickens with twists, and a full and satisfying story is told. The entire cast shines... and the cinematography and editing are excellent.

"The more complicated, the better...","Nope, it doesn't work this way. This movie has an incredibly complicated plot, so convoluted I couldn't figure it out with all the help in the world, but I don't even care what it was all about. There probably was some logic somewhere, but when everything has to be literally explained through voice-over in the end, there must be something wrong.A well-made con movie can be a perfect time-waster, like KISS KISS BANG BANG, but that one had smart dialog, amazing chemistry between the leads, credible romance and a plot that DID make sense, qualities not to be found in this film. For starters, what's with the main character of Slevin, a completely annoying wise-ass, played by the ever more annoying Josh Hartnett, and what about the dialog? None of it is funny, or in the least interesting, or plot-related. Cut out ninety percent and you won't miss a thing. Cut out ninety percent, and this movie wouldn't have seen the light of day in the first place.It's painful to see Bruce Willis in such a ridiculous role like this, as a silent assassin, a man of few words, who ghouls around through every frame. I want the wise-cracking Bruce Willis back. I don't want to see him as some kind of set piece for a wise-ass punk like John McDuigan masquerading as a director. Stanley Tucci is given absolutely nothing to do with a lousy part as some New York detective, with a hard-on for Slevin for no obvious reasons.

Lucky Number Slevin,"Lucky Number Slevin has a cast to die for. It has not just A-list actors, but good A-list actors who are all at the top of their game. It is therefore not unreasonable to expect great things from them. For the most part this is a very accomplished thriller, but it just lacks that extra something to go the extra mile.It could actually be the cast themselves. Josh Hartnett is good in the title role of Slevin, a man from out of town who, after an episode of mistaken identities, finds himself under pressure to pay a lot of money to two rival kingpins. However, the other cast members  Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci, even Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley  feel like they're operating on autopilot. They never seem to be stretching themselves to deliver something truly great.Part of this also stems form the dialogue; you can tell that this wants to be a Quentin Tarantino/Guy Ritchie film with sharp dialogue and witty pop-culture references. It doesn't work as well as it should though (although I do find that even Tarantino can start to sound pretentious after a point), and a lot of the dialogue feels forced, although it's clearly meant to be smooth and sound natural.It really isn't all bad though. These negative points are actually relatively small, all things considered, and don't ruin the enjoyment of the film; they are more niggles than outright irritants. The film is actually very stylish, and its retro-70s look does wonders as it gives the film a fresh feel, certainly making it stand out from the usual run-of-the-mill thrillers. Also Lucy Liu is brilliant as the only innocent character present, whose riffs with Slevin are fun and gives the film a certain lightness to it; a real bonus as it is otherwise a very cold film.As with many films of this kind, we know everything will not be as it seems to be, and Lucky Number Slevin is no exception. Its inevitable plot twist feels a little contrived  it's not nearly as clever as it likes to think it is  and the payoff is not as worthy as we deserve by this point, but it is the journey that matters most and it is, for the most part, very enjoyable. However, one cannot help but feel that, with the presence of such a great cast that could have been made of this  it seems to be trying too hard to impress, rather than being a lot more natural and trust in the quality of the actors it's got.Rated: 7/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Before Its Time,"There's a game people sometimes play to start a conversation when they're bored or at a party. I believe it is called Deserted Island. Where you're asked the question...""if you're stranded on a deserted island and you can only bring 3 movies that you'll have to watch over and over again for the rest of your life which 3 movies would they be?""
This has always been on my list since the first time I watched it back when it originally came out.I feel like the casting was perfect. And now, almost 20 years later since it debuted, those casting choices not only still hold up, but most are considered iconic actors now. Morgan Freemon and Sir Ben Kingsley as rival mob bosses. Just typing that sentence felt legendary. Lol. If a movie was released today with those two cast, it would be considered a must see. Bruce Willis as, and I quote.. a ""World Class Assassin F&$k Head"". Stanley Tucci as the lead detective. He released this movie the same year he did Devil Wears Prada. And his career went to new heights after that. Obviously Josh Harnett in the lead role. And then the CROWN JEWEL... Lucy Lui. I was 25 years old when this movie was released. But because of this movie... If I was on a deserted island and I had to pick just ONE actress to bring with me to spend the rest of my life with.... Lucy Lui, you need to pack your bags girl, because you're coming with me. Haha. She absolutely drips with sex appeal throughout this movie.Even some of the actors in smaller roles are recognizable. Corey Stoll who plays Darrin Cross / MODOK in Marvel's Ant-Man and the congressman in House of Cards is a Jewish BodyGuard for the Rabbi complete with accent. And Sam Jaeger from The Handmades Tales and every other detective role in the world plays the patsy for the Kansas City Shuffle.Needless to say, with that much talent, the movie is amazing. And I can honestly say that I'm not one that often gets sucked into the wardrobe or visual aspects of a movie, but in this movie, that part shines the most. Whoever was in charge of wardrobe... they should have an Oscar sitting on their shelf at home for this movie. I was wearing Argyle sweaters for a year after this came out.

"Style Over Substance, But an Entertaining Ride!","OK, so ""Lucky Number Slevin"" falls easily into the Tarantino/""Pulp Fiction"" mold, from it's graphic violence and plot twists, to the off-beat humor and quirky characterizations. And it won't take long to guess what the big 'secret' is that holds everything together (although it is intriguing to see who fits where in the scheme of things). Saying all this, however, I really enjoyed ""Slevin""!A lot of the entertainment of the film comes from first-rate actors obviously enjoying themselves. Trapped in a case of mistaken identity, Josh Hartnett, sporting a broken nose and lack of wardrobe in the early part of the film, takes every mishap and disaster with such aplomb that it's easy to see why mob bosses Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley look at him in stunned bewilderment (remember the gangster in the Marx Brothers' ""Monkey Business"" hiring the totally whacked-out Groucho and Company as shipboard bodyguards? Hartnett has that same ""Are we on the same page?"" attitude). Even more fun is the relationship between Hartnett and neighbor Lucy Lui (who has never been cuter or more energetic). When she walks into his 'borrowed' apartment, sees him naked, leaves, then pops back in, hoping to catch ""the next show"", you KNOW there is chemistry! And when was the last time you saw verbal sexual foreplay consisting of obscure James Bond trivia? That scene has such a Kevin Smith 'feel' to it that I looked for his name as a screenwriter!Bruce Willis is also fun, as a very smug hit man (he seems nearly 'typed' as a hit man or cop, these days). Stanley Tucci, Danny Aiello, and ""Forrest Gump's"" Mykelti Williamson also shine (it was nice seeing Aiello and Williamson, who I haven't seen much of, of late).Certainly, the ultimate 'pay-off' lacks the 'punch' of ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Memento"", or ""Go"", but it does reveal a compassion that is surprising, considering the body count!Taken as a whole, Paul McGuigan's jaunt into 'Tarantino Land' is stylishly diverting!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
You'll be glued to your seat from minute 1 to minute 109,"I just watched Lucky Number Slevin and at first I admit that I was watching, but it seemed like one of those confusing movies I'd never get, but my mom said to just sit tight and wait for the great ending, and everything just made sense from there and it turned into one of the best thrillers I have seen in years! It was very funny because this movie reminded me so much of North By Northwest, and they even mentioned that in the middle of the movie! I mean, what's not to love about this movie?Basically it starts off as your typical mob type of movie, a murder here, a murder there, but that leads into the main plot that takes us to Josh Hartnett, who plays Slevin. Slevin is staying with a friend and gets taken away when he is mistaken for being Nick Fisher, the friend he's staying with, and he's been asked to not only kill a mobster boss's rival, another mobster boss's son, but he owes the mobster boss, the man who's son he's going to kill, $33,000 and must get it in 48 hours. He and the girl across the hall he's fallen for try to figure out what is going on and keep landing back to a man called Smith, played by Willis. Surprise twists and turns take it from there.This is a very exciting movie, I would highly recommend this movie for anyone.

Snatch meets the Usual Suspects - and what a great result!,"Don't be thrown off by the terrible title and tagline - Lucky Number Slevin is much less gratuitous action movie and much more of a clever thinking than it wants to let on. The latest installment in the ""Usual Suspects syndrome"" of thrillers, Slevin subscribes to the ""plot twist every thirty seconds"" theory in order to keep its audience guessing. As such, we spend most of the film continually left in the dark, but rest assured that it (mostly)all comes together and makes sense in the end.The script, penned by screenwriter Jason Smilovic, makes it very clear that it is trying hard to be incessantly clever - and it actually succeeds for the most part, blending a dark humour (having warring mob bosses have their headquarters across the street from one another) with the suspense, action and continual audience confusion, as Slevin has to make his way out of more and more perplexing situations and constant cases of mistaken identity. Director Paul McGuigan indeed seems to have taken quite a bit of influence from such films as Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, early Tarantino movies and of course, Brian Singer's classic thriller The Usual Suspects, but it comes together as a savory, well made and very clever film.The wonderful cast are what take the given material, and take it from very good to excellent. Josh Hartnett gives a satisfying performance in the lead as the constantly hassled Slevin. But it's the supporting cast which really bring the film to life, with wonderful and often hilarious performances. Bruce Willis is a strong and mysterious presence as infamous assassin Goodkat, and although it may seem that each of his appearances seems to make less sense than the last time his purpose finally is revealed. Lucy Liu is adorable, bubbly and very funny, finally a love interest who actually captures our interests and never comes across as clichéd or pointless. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley supply class aplenty to the film, and of course both give excellent performances as would be expected. Stanley Tucci is also a wonderful addition to the film as determined detective Brikowski.Overall, Slevin is actually one of the most interesting and entertaining films of this year so far - suspenseful, cryptic, often very funny, and oh so clever. Be warned that director Paul McGuigan certainly doesn't skimp on the blood and violence, especially right at the film's opening, as if to catch our attention with a bang. But the script and concept are very intelligently done, even if they do occasionally stumble on drawing the line between clever and just plain confusing. Despite this, Slevin is a wonderful and very entertaining movie, one definitely worth seeing!-8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Excellent story,"This movie had a brilliant story. The way the whole thing came together was very nice. Josh Hartnett plays his role well- let me digress for a second. This is only the third movie I've seen Hartnett in and my question is: Does he have sex in every movie he's in? Hollywood Homicide, 40 days, and now Lucky Number Slevin. Is it in his contract or something? - OK back to the point. The movie kept me guessing the entire time as to what was the objective of it all.

Freeman and Willis rarely do anything that's a flop so I can't imagine them both being in a movie and it not being good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"It is a cross between, 'The Jackal' and 'The Usual Suspects'.","In 'Lucky Number Slevin' Josh Hartnett plays Slevin, a guy who has just run into some bad luck. He has lost his job, his apartment is being condemned, his girlfriend is cheating on him and he gets mugged. But that is nothing compared to what is about to happen. When he goes to visit a friend in New York, he is the victim of mistaken identity. Not one, but two powerful crime lords think he is Nick, the guy that owes each of them a lot of money. Slevin has to do what he is told or else. But things are not always what they seem.This movie is awesome. It is a cross between, 'The Jackal' and 'The Usual Suspects'. Everyone is casted very well in their respectable roles. Ben Kingsley is particularly good as a Rabbi/crime boss. I was really impressed with Lucy Liu as the sweet, innocent 'Nancy Drew' role.

"As Bad As Heist, Maybe Worse","Almost immediately after starting this movie I ran to the PC to see if this was written by Mamet (Heist). Same stupid cliché-ridden dialogue and melodramatic stereotypes. Disclaimer: I'm generation-X, so maybe I'm expecting some redeeming qualities to come out in the protagonists, however noir this film is supposed to be.So I started wondering, was it the director or writer's fault? I looked up Ganguin and he did Gangster No. 1 which I believe I rented once. It was kind of cool for a video-quality movie. But maybe I thought so because it represented a different criminal subculture than I have been exposed to, which is 70's UK.So it must be the writing, which is usually the case when the thought of the line on paper jumps out at you with the energy of wet, blurred ink.Save your money. Save the shrinking feeling you'll feel for the stellar actors -- I mean Kingsley-Freeman-Willis! Good grief. This movie must have cost $30M just for the cast! I had the same sinking feeling when I sympathized with Devito-Hackman over Heist.Hartnett is the only one whose character was entertaining, and that still wasn't enough to save this film. Why was it entertaining? I don't want to waste any more neurons on this film, but I think he had the least ridiculous lines and he has interesting character which seems to come through unfiltered in his parts.This only got a nomination for sound editing with that cast and beautiful sets.

How it escaped my radar is a mystery as it has some of my favorite stars and some surprising performances.First, Lucy Liu (Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Charlie's Angels) gave what I consider the best performance of her career. She was absolutely adorable and really made this film entertaining.Her performance, combined with Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor, Black Hawk Down), someone I never paid any attention to in the past, made me think that this was something of a comedy. Harnett played the mistaken identity to perfection and was cool and funny.You always had to wonder what was going on with Bruce Willis in the shadows. It was driving me nuts. But then the direction changes and you know it is not a comedy but a revenge movie and your jaw drops at the cleverness with which this film was made.Big Kudos to director Paul McGuigan, an unknown to me, but who is working on a film version of one of my favorite old TV shows, The Equalizer; and to writer Jason Smilovic.With those already mentioned and Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Stanley Tucci, this film is worth everyone's time and a must see.

Saved by the ending,"At first I found this film hard going and I was even getting a little bored with it.I thought that it was trying too hard to be clever and it seemed to be going nowhere.I have to say though that the last 30 minutes or so of the film saved it from a lower mark out of 10.I won't give anything away about the plot,but it is all explained very nicely at the end and in a clever way that makes sense of all that went before.Josh Hartnett is fine in the lead role and Morgan Freeman is his usual reliable self,though I have seen him better.Ben Kingsley(I'm sorry,SIR Ben Kingsley...give me a break!!)is hit and miss as a Jewish gangster and Lucy Liu talks so fast at first the I couldn't tell what she was harping on about half the time.She does get better though.Bruce Willis does a solid job in a role that doesn't really push him.If you decide to watch this movie and are struggling a bit to care about any of the characters,stick with it.It is just about worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The comparisons Tarantino and the like immediately got me thinking though, Im no fan of Tarantino but I've seen enough of his movies to know that even though he trys to do something different every time his movies are actually quite predicable, further comparisons to other great movies had me convinced that this movie is not as brilliant as it seems but is in fact blend of many vintage wines (or malts) and such efforts are usually quite futile, yet I was hooked so I lowered my expectations and rented the movie.The movie starts of brilliantly but when the first sequence is over you already know that this is a significant part of the movie (as the filmmakers makers want you to know), however even the less die-hard movie goers will easily be able to predict the final outcome of the movie, and have a very good idea about the flow of the movie just based on this sequence, I'm sure the filmmakers didn't take that into account while making the movie.The movie has Tarantino-ish flow about it, in fact most of the elements are inspired from other brilliant films:-1)The warring gang bosses are as old as the hills.2)Playing them against each other is just as old (spagetti westerns).3)Bruce Willis is a cool assassin (need i say more).4)A movie that starts with one event and culminates into another.Sound familiar these concepts are just some of the concepts that have been used in this movie and have been the premise of many super-hit/ cult favourites etc etc of our times.Like I said such mixing of vintages has generally resulted in disaster (AVP) but in this case surprisingly the end result is actually quite pleasing in fact the movie borders on brilliant for the most part, HOWEVER PREDICTABILITY ENSURES THAT THIS MOVIE EASILY FALLS SHORT OF BRILLIANT, and Hollywood's obsession of love to has a strong part to play in this department.The acting is brilliant all around, the effort to be cool in every scene which is the greatest acting flaw in many such movies (Samuel L Jackson prime candidate in many of his latest movies) is not noticed here.It has however become annoying to Bruce Willis in the same cool and silent role, I don't think id want to see him in a similar role again.The cinematography and editing is again top notch and matches up to many other brilliant works.The background score is hardly felt and hardly needed.On all technical aspects this movie is nearly flawless ( initially i wasn't to happy with the casting of Lucy Lu but I've changed my mind since).There are a couple of minor plot holes but these are insignificant.There is a constant feeling of humour in this film, much like the Protagonist's are experiencing despite the graveness of the situation (this is something i always identify with and enjoy so i may be biased).In the end you cant help feeling that even though you enjoyed the blend (movie) there were really nothing new about it, all the flavours were known to you, you knew what to expect, and the after taste (climax) which is what this movie is all about is almost lost because you are so familiar with it.This is a rare case of a great blend (Black Label?) and for that it will be cherished.A must watch if you are a fan of Tarantino, Westerns, Crime, Bruce Willis or any other concept or actor involved with this film.+s a rare great blend, flawless technically, superb acting, good humour.+/s great blend but blend nevertheless, does the effort show (i don't think so).-s predictable, never really hits you, why does it always have to involve love.total 8/10 (in absolute terms its more like a 7/7.5 but really I expected less plus I always enjoy humour in grave situations hence the higher rating)",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Average,"I have no doubt that the filmmakers had great expectations about their creation. They may have thought they were delivering a new ""Pulp Fiction"". And I'm not making just a random reference here, since ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a classic example of the disaster Tarantino's success has brought in cinema. Every year, dozens young filmmakers come out with a straight recipe of copying the Tarantino's filmic universe (that is, if we accept the existence of such a universe after a very short  so far- career of the man). However, in this particular film we shouldn't blame only the director, Paul McGuigan, who had after all warned us for his limited potentialities since his previous film ""Wicker Park"", where one could easily see the absence of a personal style and his tendency in stumbling in front of weak choices from the scriptwriter. Once again, a great deal of responsibility for this hollow film should be ""recognized"" to Jason Smilovic, who wrote the screenplay. When Tarantino made the choice of using everyday dialogue and scenes that until the dawn of the 90's the rest filmmakers would leave out without any second thoughts, he made it with a certainty. The certainty that was given to him, first of all from his wide ranged knowledge on cinema, and also from his contact with literature  more particularly with contemporary American novels from which he has borrowed his famous narrative techniques and devices. And this fertile dialogue of mediums, combined with Tarantino's intelligence, created a very distinctive signature, both on the grounds of subject and style. And ""Lucky Number Slevin"" lacks all these.Someone could argue that McGuigan also starts a dialogue with cinema - Tarantino's cinema. But it's more than obvious that he hasn't got neither the talent nor the knowledge needed, so he just copies. The characters speak in between their troubles about their favorite films or about super heroes (sounds familiar?). And when we are presented with original lines, they aren't much superior than this: ""I'm a world class hit-man"", Bruce Willis says in one of the worst moments of his career. And that's too bad, because of the excellent cast including Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley, who little can do to save this mess. As leading actor, Josh Hartnett who also starred in ""Wicker Park"" and who Hollywood systematically promotes with no obvious reason, not even after this film (waiting for ""Black Dahlia"" from master Brian DePalma). So, ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is indeed a well made film, but one made by craftsmen. But cinema is art, not craft, and more than a hundred years after its birth, it shouldn't feel the need to prove it.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Where Did This Terrific Little Film Come From?,"This stylish and fiendishly entertaining puzzle movie stars Josh Hartnett, usually an actor I find it easy to dislike, giving a surprisingly good performance as Slevin, a laid-back drifter type who shows up at his friend's apartment to hang out for a few weeks and finds himself the target of two rival crime lords when he's mistaken for his friend. The plot twists and turns -- it's one of those movies where the whole point is the trick ending, but in this case (unlike so many movies of a similar ilk) the rest of the script is so well written that the ending, when it comes, actually feels like a payoff rather than a cheat.Director Paul McGuigan gives the whole film a tone to match the character of Slevin. Everything is loose and cool -- even the violent scenes (and there are some pretty graphic ones) come and go without ruffling too many feathers. Hartnett gets solid support from Bruce Willis, that king of dead-pan crime films, and Lucy Liu, who seems somewhat less comfortable in her role as a chatty his girl Friday, and who gets disappointingly little to do. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley play the crime lords. It's refreshing to see Freeman break away from his wizened sage roles, and Kingsley is strong as always, even if his accent is unidentifiable.But the ultimate star of this film is the production design. Just keep your eye on the sets and decor, that add a fun house sense of disorientation to this diamond-in-the-rough of a movie.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great though thoroughly predictable,"Let us continue under no misconception, this is a good movie. If your the kind of moviegoer that eats up stuff like Boondock Saints or Pulp Fiction then this is a movie for you, stylish, violent, well written, there is very little else one could hope to garner from it. The story is not all that and a bag of cheese, there are holes, and though I very much like the story and all it's little twists, I saw almost each and every one of them coming. This movie almost seems made to be predictable, it is however thoroughly enjoyable. The story is at times tragic and most of the time funny. It's told in a bass ackwards kinda way. The acting is top notch, Lucy Liu is okay, beautiful as always though hers is a very simplistic part. Morgan is as always hypnotizing, even as a bad guy you can't help but be drawn to him. Kingsley is wonderful as the Rabbi. And though both of them turn in somewhat deadpan subdued performances Hartnet and Willis are both amazing, especially Willis who wears conviction in his eyes in every scene. The film is oddly directed, it has a very cool feel to it, my only gripe is that it has a very sullen feel to it, it should mind you people are dying and the film acts accordingly, but it just seems that as all is revealed things should move faster, not just crawl along. Overall it's great movie to get a bunch of friends together and go see, very enjoyable, it's not Sin City, but it's a worthy follow up for both Hartnet and Willis, both of whom won't be in #2",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Amazing film from McGuigan, 3 thumbs up","Everything about this crime/film noir/comic adaptation by Paul McGuigan is what its supposed to be. Don't be mislead by the IMDb rating of 7.8... it should be higher. I liked this film way more than even Sin City (one of my favorites) or 300 (which i rated at 9/10). This film was directed very well, written superbly by Smilovic and shot very well stylistically by Peter Sova. I thought Hartnett was good in the lead but the standouts were Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley as mob bosses from two rival families (blacks and jews), and also Bruce Willis as hit-man, Mr. Goodkat. Lucy Liu was also surprisingly not annoying here. THis film is one of my instant favorites.--- IMDb Rating-- 7.8, my rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Decent lightweight thriller,"I've got to admit that I always enjoy a well put together little thriller, and while Lucky Number Slevin is far from brilliant; it's a constantly entertaining and quirky little thriller that managers to keep you guessing while delivering a lot to have a good laugh at. The quirky comedy styling is what really makes the film what it is, as Jason Smilovic's screenplay revels in its one-liners, which receive good feedback from the casual nature of the screenplay, which manages to stay relaxed in spite of the high number of plot twists. The film sets itself up very well through a barrage of seemingly unconnected events that prove to have a greater significance later on. Towards the start, we see Bruce Willis' cold assassin break the neck of a stranger in a waiting area, a number of people killed and, most importantly, a man named Slevin that arrives at his friend's flat after a barrage of bad luck. He soon hooks up with the girl next door, before being dragged off in his towel to see the local mob boss, who having mistaken him for his friend; requests a favour for the money owed to him.The film takes obvious influence from the many 'cool' crime flicks, headlined by the films of Quentin Tarantino. That being said, Paul McGuigan's film appears to realise that it is, in fact, lightweight fluff and this is an asset for the movie as it never tries to be too deep and allows it audience just to have fun with the audacious plot. The film does well in lulling its audience into a false sense of security, as every time we think we know what is going on; the rug is pulled from under, and there's another twist to enjoy. Sometimes this can be annoying, but since Lucky Number Slevin is so irrelevant in its plot and execution, it's more fun to simply believe everything that is thrown at you and enjoy the ride. The film benefits from a good cast of well known stars. Josh Hartnett is good in the 'good looking guy' role, while Lucy Liu is cute enough as the girl next door. Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley sleepwalk through their respective roles, and the central cast is rounded off a cool turn from Bruce Willis as a sinister hit-man. Overall, I'm pretty sure I won't remember Slevin for long; but it's good while you're watching it, and provides decent entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
good gangsta flick,"this is one of the best movies that i have seen recently. first of all Bruce Willis did a stand up job, Morgan freeman, thumbs up, Stanley tucci, very well also. Lucy liu, very nice, sir Ben Kingsley good job also, but an outstanding job to josh hartnett, the movie was kick butt all the way, the use of mixing the scenes up ala Quentin Tarantino, and reservoir dogs, would make him very proud. the plot line was excellent. the movie did give away anything too quickly it mixed the scenes just about right the whole way through. it's basically a case of mistaken identity, and a man that has the worst luck of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, he has not one but two gangsters after him plus a hit-man , and the police tailing him, there is a classic scene between freeman and Kingsley that is not to be missed , all in all i really can't find anything wrong with the movie at all, the was the perfect mix of crime, comedy, action, mystery, you name it this movie has it..",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Pretentious,"Now here is a movie that thinks it is so much smarter than it really is.It is awfully splintered, the entire first half hour is more a collage of events than it is a film. Very confusing to figure out what all is about. And the last 40 Minutes are spend in flashbacks telling us the ingenious scheme of the movie and how clever it is, but it's not, seen it all before. Highly predictable and therefore very unsatisfying. I really disliked this disruptive storytelling throughout the film.There is some comedy, although it eventually is a rather dark movie about vengeance. Josh Hartnett delivers a good performance, Freeman and Kingsley are more routine than inspired and Bruce Willis has a very thankless role that could (should) have been filled by someone else. Lucy Liu is very charming as usual.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Mediocre,"I saw this movie during a brief stay in London, approaching it with guarded skepticism, given that the mud season is when Hollywood ushers its ""second tier"" to the markets. The beginning of the movie is promising enough; the opening scene is loaded with atmosphere and brutality, and is followed by some effective set up scenes that outline the plot. That plot, however, turns out to be weak, contrived and predictable. I emphasize the last point, because with a little imagination, the viewer can frame the entire story within twenty minutes of the opener. Not a good sign for a film that relies on twists to entertain its audience.The weak plot is not the only indictment against this movie. In a deliberate effort to mimic the ""cool"" of that famous auteur (you know who) of the nineties, the movie relies heavily on irreverent dialogue and subtle pop culture references. Derivative can work - plenty of others have taken the same tact with some success - but in this case it does not. Virtually all of the dialogue is mere filler; there isn't a single memorable line in the movie. The characters, in an obvious nod to Reservoir Dogs, are referred to by (not so) clever nicknames. This attempt at garnering cachet is fitting, because none of these characters amount to more than the vapid stereotypes that such nicknames inform them to be.That's not necessarily terrible, because a great actor can make such contrivances work. Incidentally, there are certainly plenty of recognizable actors in this film. The problem is, the pieces don't fit, and at no point in the movie are you left with the impression that anyone is trying very hard. Morgan Freeman in particular seems perfectly content to continue the ten year campaign against his acting reputation. On the flipside, Lucy Liu does a credible job as the love interest of someone ten years younger than her, and Bruce Willis is certainly wooden enough for the part of a stoic assassin.This movie isn't beyond redemption. I didn't walk out of the theatre, and you can kind of enjoy it, so long as you're content to space out for the duration. Its got plenty of flash, but not much else. Its an effectively meaningless exercise and nothing about it changes my impression of spring movies. Just not very good.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Ignore Bad Reviews,"We all have different likes & tastes in all things & movies are no different. While you can understand that many movies can run the gamut in terms. of ratings they may receive & there are of course some others that are either the ""you're either gonna love it or hate"" with no middle ground. There is also those movies that you know for a fact were just so well made, with good-great actors/acting, same with that plot/storyline & production etc...The type of movies you can't comprehend how & why anyone could see the same film & knock it down & give it-not only a negative review-but a paltry one.Lucky Number Slevin is exactly the last one where I can't bring myself to a persons mindset to dismiss the movie as bad. It had a feel of old Hollywood classic dressed up for modern times. ""The Big Sleep"" remains to this day my favorite movie & the 40-50's were the golden errror Noire & then it kinda became a lost art. ChinaTown was a breath of fresh air & a nice throw back in the back 70's followed by Two Jakes, but since there really hasn't been many really good ones to enjoy.This movie had a little of everything. Its no slapstick but the writing was so clever that I found myself laughing throughout. The chemistry between Lucy Liu & Josh Harnett was fantastic. Tom Cruise & Brad Pitt get a lot of attention for being two of the best actors in Hollywood but I mean c'non, Morgan Freeman & Ben Kingsley? Easily two of the greatest actors in history, not only of this era. Bruce Willis isnt given the credit he deserves for his acting as he's always solid in his roles too. Add in the rest of the supporting cast with people like Stanley Tucci & the acting was elite. The story was great & so well put together it had you on toes the entire movie trying to figure out where it was going. You prob will think you have small idea like I did, but you don't know exactly and I was surprised at a few turns. A lot of action isn't needed in a film like this because it's so wel put together & written. Just subtle word play in the dialogue between the character's allowed the movie to shine even more.I honestly believe there are 2 people who write really poor reviews on movies like ""Lucky Number Seven"". Movies that are so good, it's as if 95 outta 100 people will give it between 7-10. Yet somehow you will have 1 outta every 20 reviews that are negative & it really makes zero sense.There are 2 kinda of people who seems to hand out a paltry review to movies that so clearly don't deserve em.1. Are the people who come across as Uber-intellectuals as if they are students mastering in film studies & are trying too hard to impress their professor. They pick apart a movie to the point where they are circumcising the mosquito for all intensive purposes, and over analyze everything & rip perfectly logical story lines & plots. There is no way you can watch ""Lucky Number Slevin"" & rate it lower than 6 if you're being completely fair & objective. I know we all have different likes & tastes but not the point where we can't all see that movie isn't bad.2. Are the people who seem like nothing makes em happy. They seem miserable bout everything. Ya know the type of people who complain about their coffee whether it's too hot, or too cold, or has too much sugar.they complain about temperature in a restaurant or that their food is too cold. They'll even complain about birthday or Christmas gifts they receive. It's unreal & everyone knows someone like this cuz there seems to be 1 outta every 20. Nothing ever makes them hapoy & they need to complain about everything to try to fill an empty void in their life but all the complaining in the world & that void can & will never be filled.I'm not saying everyone has to agree. Far from it, our differences is what makes us individuals. I'm just sayin that no way should any1 come away with seeing a movie like ""Lucky number Slevin"" end give it a negative review let alone a horrible one. It's not cuz I know everything or that the final rating of a movie starts & ends with me. No, I'm just saying when you see these stupid random reviews with 2,3 or 4 stars it's like cmon. We have all seen horrible movies & understand what one looks like. Those are the movies that deserve a 2 or a 3 unless it really is so bad you actually were tempted to shut it off. I see some 1 stats and it infuriates me. Cuz we all know it's coming outta a place of laziness or just plain hate. It's not from a place of seriously considering everything the movie had to offer & if it feel short in other areas fine but don't tell me it deserves a 1. Y'all need to be better then that.

I forgot how enjoyable this film is,It's been years since I've seen this amazing story driven experience and I bought on Blu-Ray not long ago gladly. I love a lot of roles with Josh Harnett I must say this is one of his best! Every cast member is worth watching with witty dialogue something funny or just a very good story to tell. Around a decade ago I owned this I should've kept it but surely glad I have it again. Kinda odd how Slevin wears a towel for a good portion in some ways satire.

"Superficial but slick, engaging and fun regardless","Slevin arrive in town and stops at his friend Nick's. Meeting his perky neighbour Lindsey, Slevin relates how he had his wallet stolen within minutes of arriving in town, an act which also involved getting his nose broken. While waiting for Nick, Slevin is picked up by two goons looking for Nick who have decided that he is indeed the man he claims not to be. He is taken to The Boss who decides he is Nick and thus owes him $96k  a debt he will cancel if ""Nick"" kills the son of rival mobster The Rabbi. Later Slevin is also picked up by The Rabbi's men and taken to see him and so Slevin finds himself drawn into a game between the two bosses with a shadowy killer in the background.With the terrible (in my opinion) title, I didn't have great hopes for this but heard reasonably good things about it so one tired evening I decided to veg in front of it. From the deceptively slow opening, the film picks up with a good pace and energy that continues for the majority of the film. Ironically the film slows a little in the second half but by this point the energy has done its work and the plot developments have replaced them as the main hook. This is not to suggest that the plot is deep but it certainly is not, instead it is slick and fun. It helps if you can take your style with a hefty dose of violence but most modern viewers will get off on this updating of noir staples (dialogue, girls, twists, crime bosses) and delivers in a fresh-feeling package. The final sections (the reveal) are clunkier than the fresh majority would suggest.The direction suits the material and is done in a manner that brings out well, with McGuigan uses his camera and editors well, not to mention the cool set design and visual construct of the whole affair. Smilovic deserves credit as writer as his dialogue is fun and sparky while also building a nice solid mystery. Hartnett is great for the most part but when required to have depth in the later stages I found him a bit lacking. His time spent in a towel perhaps explains why my girlfriend enjoyed the film more than I did. Willis is a stiff presence but then that is the point and he does that well. Liu is wonderfully bubbly and I found her sexy and cool in contrast to her usual cold and unattractive performances  the film asks her to do little but she is fun. Freeman and Kingsley (sorry, ""Sir"" Kingsley) are both class and quality support. The support cast features some nice touches from Tucci, Williamson and Missick.Overall then a very enjoyable caper film based on a good story that is good in the telling rather than the detail, with sparky dialogue and slick delivery. It is very superficial and will put off some for this reason but if you get caught up in the pace and energy earlier on it is actually a fresh and enjoyable, albeit in a modern and violent manner.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Last Man Standing meets The Jackal and The Usual Suspects,"I might have said too much already in the title. The thing is that the plot of this movie can't be told without spoiling it. What I can tell you is that the recipe for the movie is bring good actors and use a non conventional twisting plot to make them shine. It worked for The Usual Suspects and it works for this one.If it weren't for the mellowed down ending, I would have given this film an 8. It is a good police thriller, with a tendency for over verbalization, but not too annoying, and thus worth watching. Bruce Willis doesn't save the day, that's also a plus, while Josh Hartnett plays his role well. There are a lot of known actors in the movie, with ""Oh, I know this guy/chick"" moments all the time, but that doesn't mean they all have significant roles. My biggest disappointment was that both Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman had unimportant, clichéd playing.Conclusion: it's worth seeing, yet be warned that it uses fast talking and a lot of US cultural references in order to make the actors look better than their roles. If your English and love for movies are not very good, watch it with a good translation, none of that ""I'm 10 and I think I can translate movies by using an automated translator program"" crap.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"It all started with a ""Sure Shot"" at the racetrack","(There are Spoilers) Clever elaborate but a bit complicated crime drama/thriller that covers a span of over two decades which is the time it took for everyone involved in a bloody massacre after a fixed race, at the Aqueduct Race Track in Queens NY, to come full circle. Back in the fall of 1979 Max a degenerate gambler desperate for money gets the word from a race-track tipster and close friend of his Uncle Sol,a big-time New York horse player that the number seven horse in the tenth race at Aqueduct that afternoon has been fixed, or secretly drugged, to win the race. Max then goes to his local bookie, Roth, to bet $20,000.00 on #7 on the nose. Leading all trough the stretch the number seven horse suddenly collapses and dies just before he hit's the finish line! With Max now broke and Roth in hot water with the mob for taking his bet both their lives on the line if they doesn't pay up.This is a story that a Mr. Goodkat tells a total stranger at the almost deserted airport lounge before he, in what looks like to make a point, murders him. This sets up a chain of events that has the murdered mans, a petty gambler named Fisher, friend Slevin come to visit him after he's been forced out of his place by the city marshal. Slevin is mistaken for Fisher when he goes to his apartment and is roughed up by two hoods sent there by The Boss to pick up a $96,000.00 gambling debt that the deceased Fisher owes him.Slevin not being able to convince The Boss that he isn't Fisher and at the same time not having the money to pay the head gangster back is forced to make a deal with him. Slevin agrees to knock off the gay son, Yitzchok, of The Boss' chief rival for control of the crime syndicate in the city The Rabbi. Slevin is later apprehended by two of The Rabbi's hoods and brought to his mid-town Manhattan penthouse. there he's told that not only is he in debt to The Boss for $96,000.00 but also to him for another $33,000.00! This has the unlucky Selvin now stuck between a rock and a hard place with his life not being worth a plug nickel!We keep seeing Goodkat, who turns out to be a top-notch hit-man for hire, pop up all throughout the movie not really knowing just what his connection is with The Boss and The Rabbi as well as the confused and bewildered Slevin. Everyone involved in this strange arraignment have one thing in common that in the end ties all the looses ends in the movie together; the what's now mythical fixed tenth race at Aqueduct some twenty five years ago!A lot like ""The Usual Suspects"" the movie ""Lucky Number Slevin"" has a storyline that has a number of different characters from the police mobsters bookies and local horse players woven into it that takes a while to unravel itself. Slevin at first comes across as an innocent and unlucky dupe, and victim of circumstances, who's caught up with things that he has no control off. But as the movie reveals more and more of it's secrets you somehow begin to realize that he's not the person that you at first thought that he was.The connection between Slevin and the two hoodlums, The Boss & The Rabbi, is also not as accidental as it seems. You start to notice that he's setting up the two for something but why and for what? Slevin also has a connection with the mysterious hit-man Goodkat who's beginning to look more like the one that's possibly behind this entire grand and murderous plan.The film stretches the creditability of it's story a lot by everything going off almost without a hitch with the exception of Slevin's live-in girlfriend Lindsey which in the end turned out to be very lucky for her. Unlike in the 1995 block-buster and highly popular ""The Usual Subjects"" the surprise ending, that took over 15 minutes, didn't leave it's audience up in the air thinking that they were watching and listening to a sloppy and made story, by the person telling it, just in order to be shocked or confused by it. The surprise ending in ""Lucky Number Slevin"" was a lot more believable and and at the same time shocking then you would have expected it to be and has you going back to see the movie again to spot all the missed clues that you at first overlooked.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Probably one of Hartnetts best films, alongside a brilliant cast of actors.","Lucky Number Slevin is directed by newish director Paul McGuigan. This is his third film since Wicker Park and The Acid House, alongside some programs he worked on for television, this movie boasts to be one of his best yet. Paul alongside a quite large list of top class actors/actresses, manage to create this absolute gem of a film, with a magnificent plot and twist to keep the viewer entertained until the movie has finished.The first half of the film is quite humorous; mostly every character is introduced, and the scene has been set, Slevin (Hartnett) has been thrown into a case of mistaken identity. Slevin is visited by two rival gangs, one led by The Boss (Freeman) the other by the Rabbi (Kingsley), and assuming Slevin is someone called Nick Fisher. Nick Fisher is a regular gambler who has a lot of money in the minus column; therefore Slevin is blamed for this. There is a story set also for the two gangs, they both live across the street from one another, both The Boss and The Rabbi are prisoner to their own home, fearing what one man will do to the other. The Bosses son is assassinated, so the finger is clearly pointed at The Rabbi.When Slevin comes to meet the boss, Slevin owes The Boss, $96,000 and of course Slevin would have trouble coming up with the money so The Boss sets down a proposition, for Slevin to assassinate The Rabbi's son ""Yitzchok the Fairy"", as a retaliation. After this meeting Slevin is collected once again but this time by the Rabbi's men, and then being told he owes The Rabbi a significant amount of money. Slevin now has a choice, if he doesn't kill the Rabbi's son then either way The Boss or The Rabbi will get to him first so he decides he will say yes to The Bosses offer. As somewhat unreal the story set in the first half seems, all of Slevin's choices lead up to the fantastic climax of the movie.The whole movie is made with a sense of style, dark humour and wit and a feeling that you are in touch with the actors playing the roles. It's how the characters interact, especially the chemistry between Hartnett and Liu, the love story behind it all is heart warming and pleasant, it isn't soppy it's more... friendly. Goodkat (Willis) plays a vital role on the sideline, apart from him being a world class assassin his part in the movie isn't truly revealed until the plot twist is.Everything in this movie works, though it may well borrow certain aspects from other movies. People sometimes call the twist the ""Usual Suspects Effect"", for it having a similar plot twist, though don't be fooled, it's not an easy thing to figure out unless you happen to be extremely observant. It's the little things that count in this movie, the love for the characters, the sudden change between a humorous first half into a dark and gritty second half, I can almost guarantee you will be entertained. Josh Hartnett fits the role of Slevin better than anyone of the other young talent around in Hollywood, Affleck or Damon would have probably ruined the role since Hartnett has that cockiness about him, along with the right sense of charm that makes Slevin who he is. Lucy Liu, who plays Lindsey, plays a clever and funny ""Girl Next Door"" character, which is almost in a way like a female version of Slevin.The film boasts an amazing soundtrack, which after listening to it for a few hours is very impressive. They soundtrack really shows the mood of the film, the first half of the album being very much more upbeat and slightly jazzy, the second half being much more minor, using more strings and with a slightly more inspirational sound.Conclusion  McGuigan is sure to be one of the next big people in movie making, everything about the film just works, as well as the big talent that's on screen at one time. In my own personal opinion its one of my most favourite films of all time, though of course this movie isn't to everyone's tastes purely due to the familiarity it has to other films, but there is something unique about Lucky Number Slevin, something that stands out above the movies today, a real gem of a film. It has to be viewed to be believed, and is definitely a movie you have to see ""Before You Die"".-Fin",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
two movies in one,"Hitchcock was the master of the tone change in a film, wrong-footing his audience into thinking they were watching one genre before revealing another. It is a hard trick to pull-off these days, with trailers giving so much away and information overload wherever you look. So it was a delight one night to turn on the TV and come across this film that I had never heard of.I came damn close to switching the thing off halfway through. The goofy hoods, quick-fire comments, and lame put-downs had me labeling this an under-realized student film. Then it all turns around. Josh Hartnett puts in quite a performance here; his split personality role had me hating his smarmy bonhomie at the beginning, but crying in sympathy at the end.And I say no more for fear of spoilers. See it cold, and enjoy the journey. For the first 20 minutes I thought ""What are this cast doing in this movie?"" More fool me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Not the flick for me!,"The pickings were slim when we (2 ""50ish"" women) tried to choose a movie to see this evening, and LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN won by process of elimination. While I can't claim to hate the movie, I found the plot to be convoluted and the guts and gore a bit overdone. Our fellow movie watchers were laughing at many scenes in which the humor somehow escaped me. Dare I say that this movie really wasn't much of a ""chic flick""? (Fellow feminists, Mea culpa!) I think my husband will definitely love this one when it comes to cable, which I imagine will happen soon...I read one comment that compared this movie to PULP FICTION, an opinion I definitely don't share.

Kudos for Lucky Number Slevin,"I was very impressed with the directing/producing of this film. The soundtrack and wall paper were all part of this delightfully dark comedy featuring a large celebrity cast. Although the file does have a slightly older story line; with the new scenery, the not so serious quirky undertones and laugh-out-loud jokes it was very easily pulled off.If I had paid to see this movie, I would still feel the same....it is definitely worth the cost of a ticket and a soda.....skip the $6 popcorn and if you must have candy, purchase at a discount.And I just happened to notice Morgan Freeman is getting way to thin.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Kansas City Shuffle,"Let me get this out of the way first. Wow! I mean this movie blew my mind!The Wrong Man (if you live in Australia), or Lucky Number Slevin (if you live in the states) is a thriller starring Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Sir Ben Kingsley, Lucy Liu and Stanley Tucci. Directed by Paul McGuigan, The Wrong Man was released in 2006 and seemed to miss Australian cinemas all together and came here direct to DVD. Now normally, that indicates that the film will be a bit of a waste of time. But in actual fact, this is far from the truth. With an all star cast and well known director, The Wrong Man is one to definitely watch.The story revolves around ""The Kansas City Shuffle"", explained by Bruce Willis' character, which is ""When everybody looks right, you go left."" The story is a well crafted thriller, that provides a breath of fresh air from most Hollywood films as the writer didn't presume that his audience is stupid. This film makes you think and just when you think you have the story figured out, the story takes a sharp twist and sucker punches you where you least expected it to. The story is a Kansas City Shuffle in itself.The Wrong Man is a real credit to the screenwriter's talent, Paul McGuigan's ability to direct films and the cast's ability to act unlike most others in Hollywood can.To say that this film is awesome doesn't even begin to explain it.When you're next at your local video rental store and can't find anything to watch, I strongly recommend that you go to the Thriller section and hire The Wrong Man/Lucky Number Slevin.Find the review and more at:http://ingloriousfiction.tumblr.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
poor mans lock stock,"Don't get me wrong, this film is not the worst I've ever seen. It is fast paced and nicely shot, but they are about the only real positives I can draw. The current rating of 7.8 out of 10 is as ridiculous as the storyline.The plot, in my opinion, is too far-fetched and does not really build suspense or keep you guessing. I think a lot of people have voted highly for this film because the story is all unravelled at the very end, and because it surprises you a bit, you think 'ooh, that was clever', but it really isn't. A good film will give you a few clues along the way to keep you thinking, but this didn't provide a single snippet.Another major flaw, in my opinion, is that none of the characters are convincing (or intimidating) gangsters, and 2 rival gangs in opposing buildings. No. Great gangster films are based on characters that you can imagine existing and running a racket. Once you have got the characters in place, you can run away a bit with the story - a bit like 'Snatch', 'Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels' or even 'Pulp Fiction'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Excellent brain-teaser,"Been meaning to see this film for a while now and it was definitely worth the wait to see it on DVD cos i'm deaf and need the subtitles.As much I respected Josh Harnett but I was feeling a bit doubtful(was very good in Black Hawk Down though) as to whether he'll do the job in 'Lucky Number Slevin'. Fortunately, everything he did in the film was right on the mark.

Lucky Number Slevin is Worth it,"I really don't get where the other critic is coming from. It's actually nothing like Tarantino. If you know anything about his films, you would know that he actually is more of a time line director. I saw Lucky Number Slevin at Sundance Film Festival. It was by far the best movie there. It was in the premiere category with Thank You for Smoking and Little Miss Sunshine, so it definitely has strength. I laughed at this comment about Tarantino, because everyone knows that Quentin's first film, Reservoir Dogs, a favorite of mine actually, debuted at Sundance. I don't know where he is coming from, but I do know that this movie deserves all 10 stars. I recommend it, hell I'd pay for the movie ticket for this guy to see it again.

"Pretentiously awful, Hartnett deserves better","""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a fast paced comedy thriller about a case of mistaken identity. Slevin (Josh Hartnett) takes a shower at his friend Nick Fisher's apartment just as two rival New York mafia bosses (Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsly) send their thugs to collect on Fisher's gambling debt. Downside for Slevin is that both bosses are being controlled by assassin extraordinaire Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis). And from there, wackiness ensues.""Slevin"" provides good laughs and an intricate plot with a surprise ending. Though to the film's detriment, director Paul McGuigan and writer Jason Smilovic tell us the ""surprise ending"" in the first 10 minutes, so you spend the rest of the film thinking about how they're going to reveal the ending, rather than concentrating on the movie (maybe that's a good thing). One would think they would have learned from the mistakes of M. Night Shyamalan.McGuigan lets the ""mistaken identity"" theme creep out into real life. Though, McGuigan is trying to be mistaken for someone else. Actually, two other people: Quentin Tarantino and Bryan Singer. McGuigan grew up idolizing Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" and Singer's ""The Usual Suspects,"" so he tries out his best impersonations of both and puts out what comes across as a sloppy fusion of the two.But the cast keeps the audience's attention well enough to distract us from the cliché ridden plot. Hartnett is trying to grow up beyond the ""boy toy"" image he was known for in his earlier years, by taking a darker role. I found him to be entertaining and he should keep taking these quirky roles.Lucy Liu plays the love interest of Slevin, and however noir-ish this film tries to be, she is no Femme Fatale, and is there more for comedy than anything else. Though in keeping with the theme of the movie, mistaken identity, this is a Lucy Liu we haven't seen before. While she still doesn't bring anything to the proverbial acting table, she does come off as a lot less annoying then she does in say everything else she's been in.Freeman finally took a role which isn't God, or a wise old man or something like that. And he doesn't have to narrate, like he did in his past 7000 films. But he does seem uninterested in the role and this film. Willis plays the puppeteer assassin with a heart of gold, though like Freeman, he seems a bit removed from the film.Again, here comes that recurring theme of mistaken identity. It's rough to see these two actors, both of whom I am a fan, take a walk on this. They seemed distracted, like the film was a waste of their time. It's not what I expect from these two. Fortunately they both have projects looming on the horizon that would return them to their more lively selves.With so much talent and an interesting story, I really wanted to like this movie. I did, honestly. But the laziness of everybody involved (with the exception of Hartnett, who did his best with what he was given) dragged it down.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Glossy to look at but never stays with you after the credits roll,"Reviewed June 2011Someone has watched a lot of Guy Ritchie's movies but couldn't make one in the same league. My rating is purely for entertainment value where the pace is quick and is occasionally funny. But if you take this movie as a whole, well it is full of holes.It is a story of mistaken identity where a guy is thought to be in debt to the two most powerful men in the city and is pushed around to make them some favors and is also closely followed by the police.It tries to exude style out of every frame while killing, getting killed, scared, angry etc etc. The performances were so flat even with the talent available just for the same reason mentioned earlier as Arnold Schwarzenegger could've played every role in the movie and could've pulled it off. The story was complicated to great lengths and the non-linear screenplay adds to the trouble of making it even more. It also has that revelatory end that unfolds in a way the Scooby Doo writers will be very proud of. The story is left for extreme coincidence and perfect execution of a plan that was hatched long long ago.Finally, it is just another case of style over content. Glossy to look at but never stays with you after the credits roll.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
IMHO Most Underrated film of all time.,"I was honestly in disbelief when I found that this film was not in the top 250 with a low, low rating of 7.8. This is almost certainly my favourite film of this genre easily contending with the likes of Snatch, L4yer Cake, Brick etc.It is essentially perfect.Any close analysis would give away certain features of the film because everything is linked; it features countless nuances, being endlessly intricate. The best thing about this film is that it subverts expectations: it does not conform to any one genre and it will always have you on the edge of the seat, assuming of course you pay attention and give it the respect it deserves. Organised crime, love, relationships, comedy; this movie has it all and I would heartily recommend it to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
It's OK if you like that sort of thing,"Lucky Number Slevin (2006), directed by Paul McGuigan, is a crime movie where nothing is what it seems to be. Josh Hartnett plays Slevin Kelevra, who gets off a bus, gets mugged, ends up at a friend's apartment, meets Lindsey (Lucy Liu), and gets kidnapped. That all happens in the first ten minutes of the film, so none of this constitutes a spoiler. As the movie progresses, we're introduced to Morgan Freeman as The Boss, Sir Ben Kingsley as the Rabbi, and Bruce Willis as the professional assassin, Mr. Goodkat.Most of the movie involves people thinking that Slevin is someone else, demanding money from Slevin, threatening his life, and punching him in the stomach to emphasize the seriousness of their demands. Slevin responds with James Bond-like quips. Lucy Liu's character is--I believe--described as a ""coroner."" I think they mean that she's a pathologist, although I don't think she'd be living in her modest apartment if she were an M.D. Anyway, she's as cute and witty as can be, so no one notices or cares.The film didn't deliver much, considering the star power invested in it. Still, it wasn't boring, the acting was professional, and it worked well on the small screen. It's OK if you like that sort of thing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A Nutshell Review: Luck Number SLevin,"YES! For most parts in the first half of the movie, that's just how the dialogue is gonna get, in some of the banter between characters. However, fret not, the movie is extremely engaging, but only if you hang in there and keep the faith. There are plenty of moments where scenes are just seemingly disparate, but knowing that this is Hollywood, by the time the movie ends, it'll just about explain everything to you as it lays the cards on the table.Josh Hartnett plays Slevin Kelevra, a man who thought his day could get no better when he lost his job, and got home finding his girlfriend tripping over and another man bending over her, doggy styled. He takes flight and is supposed to meet a friend, but ended up at the wrong place at the wrong time.Soon enough, he gets unwittingly embroiled in a deadly game of hired guns, between two of the largest crime bosses in town, known as The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley), in gangs formed between racial lines. He's caught in Catch-22, Hobson's Choice and Murphy's Law situations all rolled into one, as engineered by a professional killer called Goodkat (Bruce Willis), and his only consolation in all this madness, is a chirpy neighbour Lindsey (Lucy Liu).It's a snappy, snazzy movie with a very slick plot, and I'll not discuss any more of the movie, the premise, nor the themes, otherwise it'll be a dead giveaway. Suffice to say that I'm quite impressed by the way the movie unfolded, and how the editing kept certain key scenes under wraps. However, it is difficult to stop eagle-eyed viewers whose brains are working in overdrive, to figure out the entire plot before the midway mark.The cast provided this movie with the additional power of attraction. Josh Hartnett is sure to draw in his female admirers, and both Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley bring some regality into the picture even though they're playing veteran rival crime bosses. Bruce Willis seemed to be taking on more supporting characters, but still stereotyped back into the usual cop, or killer roles, though his Goodkat character here is uber-cool.One of the must watch movies of next week, full of genuine fun! Be sure to catch it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""Slevin"" is more talk than action, but it surely entertains","""Lucky Number Slevin"" comes out firing, but instead of bullets, you get a barrage of witty lines. While the movie is not dismissible, it certainly doesn't measure up with its other smooth-talking crime movie counterparts and would be better served up with some more action and less conversation as Elvis would put it.""Slevin"" rolls deep with a killer cast. If Hartnett, Willis and Liu weren't enough to bring in viewers and impress them, Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley help add more intrigue where the plot often meanders. Only Kinglsey could make a rabbi-turned-mob boss character seem interesting and not simply laughable. After all, if you're going to make a film that's more about the exchange of words than punches, you'd best have the right people delivering them.""Slevin"" isn't devoid of appropriate gun-wielding fare, it simply opts for only showing characters pulling guns, people dropping and then cutting to the next scene. There isn't even enough time to think about suspense. There seems to be a ""say something witty or die"" attitude in the script. McGuigan's fast-paced directing style accommodates this motto nicely. There are a lot of interesting shots and the constant use with varying length flashbacks seem more effective than redundant.Basically, the film takes too much time trying to outsmart you plot-wise or smooth-talk you to death, either that or it simply pulls the trigger so it can smooth-talk again. enough so that it can't really become anything special or more than entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Move along, REALLY nothing to see here!","So, where do I start when describing how bad this film is? I'll start by talking of its good points. Somehow an amazing cast was put together and, for the most part, they make the best of what they have got.So ends the good points. And onto the bad.Have you seen Yojimbo? Or its remakes, A Fistful of Dollars and Last Man Standing? Have you seen the Usual Suspects? Have you seen Snatch? Yes? Then you really don't need to see this film.As far as the story is concerned, this film is basically Yojimbo, with elements ripped off from the other two aforementioned films, just not done as well. It is made apparent early on that we have some twists in store at the end, but any film-savvy viewer should be able to guess these by the end of reel two.But, you can forgive a bad story if it is supported by a great script.Oh, dear.Unfortunately, it seems the writer has watched a lot of noirs in preparation, but really hasn't the talent to back it up. If you are masochistic enough to want to watch this film, here is an example of the type of dialogue you're going to ""enjoy"" (I must stress, this is not actual dialogue from the film, merely an example of the style of dialogue):.Person A: So, how are you feeling today?.Person B: How am I feeling today?.Person A: Yeah, how are you you feeling today?.Person B: I'm feeling fine.Person A: You're feeling fine?.Person B: Yeah, I'm feeling fine.This, and other padding-out techniques (for a great example, watch the scene where the Rabbi's henchmen pick up Slevin for the first time), makes me think that the first draft of the script must have come in around sixty pages. Then the writer panicked and what we're seeing is the second draft. If, after listening to this repetitive, irritating nonsense for ten minutes, you don't want to choke the living crap out of the writer and director, you're a better man than me.Add all this to cinematography that seems to have been put together by a 5-year-old with ADD and you have one of the most irritating films put out this year (I know it's early, but I think this is a safe bet).How they managed to pull this cast together, I don't know. And you would have thought Willis would have steered clear, regardless of the quality, as he was the lead in Last Man Standing, a much better telling of this type of story. And seeing Mykelti Williamson and Stanley Tucci take the roles they have in this movie just makes me want to cry. These are two highly underutilised actors who deserve a lot better.Take the above ingredients, sprinkle with continuity errors, and you have the recipe for one bad movie (and that's bad-bad, not good-bad).Avoid.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One of the best films i've seen recently,"OK, so it is the summer of 2007, as a movie lover you would expect me to be at the cinema watching one of this years summer blockbusters that people have been going on about for a fair amount of time. However, aside from the fact that I've already seen all this years summer blockbusters (excluding Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix which isn't yet out), you have to realise that this summers films haven't quite been as good as we expected.So this evening, i sat down, turned of Sky Movies Premiere and watched Lucky Number Slevin. I'll be honest, i really thought this film was gunna be bad, which was the main reason i hadn't bought this film on DVD or even watched it in the cinema last year. But for the first time this summer i was truly blown away by a film, and this one wasn't even a summer blockbuster.This film us truly phenomenal. Its pacing is fairly quick and it always keeps you interested. The characters are all brilliantly played, especially Slevin by Josh Hartnett. He is a truly great character and really well acted. His small, one liners will really make you laugh, but when you see him being a lil' bit serious, he is serious. The story of this film takes many twists and turns and through the whole film you will sit there trying to think of what could happen next and what he twists are going to be. The killings are brilliantly done, perhaps even Tarintino-esquire.I highly recommend that this summer, if your bored of the rubbish summer blockbusters and you haven't seen this film before, maybe you should, cos its just brilliant and one of the best films i have seen in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Make Yourself Lucky, and Go Watch Slevin","Lucky Number Slevin is witty, funny, entertaining, with amazing performances and excellent dialog.Slevin Kelvara (Josh Hartnett) is not the luckiest guy in the world.He just lost his job, his apartment, and caught his girlfriend cheating. If that's not enough, two rival crime bosses, The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley), both think Slevin is someone else and start looking for him. And when a world-class assassin, Mr. GoodKat (Bruce Willis), shows up in New York for the first time in two decades, a police detective (Stanley Tucci) starts to wonder what's going on.We didn't have a mistaken identity thriller in quite some time, and fortunately, Slevin was a worthy addition to the genre. Jason Smilovic's script was witty, sharp, and full of twists and turns to keep the viewer interested. The dialog was very funny, and I loved the word playing between Slevin, The Boss, and The Rabbi. My only complaint with the story was that some key plot elements could be predicted way too early in the film. Anyway, that didn't stop me from enjoying the show.Technically, the film is great. The sets, cinematography, costumes, and soundtrack are all top notch. Director Paul McGuigan, clearly influenced by Tarantino, was very good. He really knew how to switch smoothly between dark and funny scenes. He could use more editing though, as the ""explanation"" scenes near the end were longer than they should have even. But maybe he had to do that, because the story was somewhat complex.I was very impressed by the acting in the film. Each actor was original in his own way. Freeman, finally playing against type (When was the last time he was a baddie?), was menacing. Willis, totally comfortable with taking a back seat this time, was funny and cool. Kingsley was able to overcome his recent duds and gave an amazing performance. His accent cracked me up several times. But the real surprise here is Harnett. After his, ummm, not so good performances in Pearl Harbor, Halloween H20, and 40 Days and 40 nights, he shines in Slevin. He was likable, without losing the character's edge. I really wish he works with McGuigan again in the near future.So, I'd definitely recommend Slevin. It was the best thriller I've seen in quite some time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

confusing in the beginning but all makes sense at the end,"This is one of those films that is reminiscent of a Tartino film.

They go to his apartment and a guy is there but says he is not Nick, but his name is Slevin. He conveniently was mugged and has no ID. The hot neighbor, Lindsey, comes over and Slevin tells her he is a friend of Nick's and Nick asked him to meet him there.So, Slevin talks to the Rabbi and the Boss and they want him to do something to harm the other because they are enemies. Later on we meet Mr. Goodkat whom is an killer, but who is he working for. Soon, we learn Slevin's true identity and his connection to Mr. Goodkat and why he wanted to meet the Rabbi and the Boss.

huh? oh yeah it all makes sense now.,"Although this movie leaves viewers in the dark for about 2 hours, it all makes sense in the last five minutes and leaves you completely satisfied.

Right away, you begin to feel for the characters, although they all end up dead in the first half hour. After this, we meet the real characters. Slevin (Josh Hartnett), is a seemingly harmless guy who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Lindsey (Lucy Liu) is a quirky neighbor we're initially annoyed with but learn to love. The two rival mafia leaders are The Boss (Morgan Freeman), named because he's the boss, and The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley), because, of course, he's a rabbi. ALthough it starts out bloody, ""Slevin"" is actually pretty hilarious, and confusing, but ultimately satisfying. Throughout, the characters interact seemingly randomly, but smoothly, sarcastically, and often in a way that makes you laugh out loud.

Awful and Infantile writing/directing/acting,"I went to see this movie cause I like a good assassin flick. I checked its rating and it was above 7 so it seemed OK. However I will be less fool hearty next time around. I didn't factor in that the film is still fresh and that its current rating is not a true representation of the movie watching populous. This is the movie writing debut of Jason Smilovic. He comes from a glorious position of writing for 'Karn Sisco', a bad TV show. And that is what this movie resembles most, TV quality writing with so many one/two liners it makes me sick. The writer makes many references to good films in the movie via characters referencing them themselves, which shows he fancies himself a film buff, but too bad he cannot write a good film himself. Over all, half the dialogue was unnecessary and is there just for show. I felt like I was watching Gilmore Girls. WAY too much banter. The plot itself is an elaborate 'revenge fantasy' type movie. With so many twists that by the end you stop caring about them. There is fad growing in movies today where producers think twists=good. Too many movies have this elaborate plot where you think something is going to happen and when it doesn't the movie takes all this time to explain how they 'fooled you' in flash backs(ie. see it wasn't really him, he was over here so he didn't die and then.......). The directing was not very effective either. The movie relied on editing effects that would wow the hip-hop generation who are easily amused with fast motion photography, different filters and stupid little cgi trickery. Furthermore, I hate Josh Hartnett, I didn't know it till today, but I do. What an awful actor. He belongs on TV where he will fit in better. His 'acting'is especially awful when put alongside Ben Kingsly and Morgan Freeman. He is just awwwwwwful. I am sure the movie is OK for those who will like anything with guns in it, but I am not so simple(minded). Mostly I am just mad that I was duped. I should have known better. Usually I trust my instincts but I didn't even use them this time. Poorly conceived and poorly executed sophomoric crap.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
This film is worth seeing....,"Having read the main review of this film on the site, it becomes apparent that the person who wrote the review had no clue whatsoever what it was on about.OK, yes, it is obvious we are going to get some twists, and i had worked out the major twist fairly early on into the film, HOWEVER, this film still kept me grossly entertained for the entire length, and i felt like i had just sat down to watch it when it ended (NOT that its a short film, its almost 2 hours long).That said, it is worth going to see this film if you like anything to do with gangsters, thrillers, mysteries, crime, mob movies, hit-man movies, anything along those lines...The acting was superb, even my mother has seen this film and she detests violence (which there is a good amount of, although its not overly gory, which is a plus, think Scarface style, you know whats happening but you don't actually see it!) and she thought that it was brilliant.OK, so, all the above mentioned, just go and see it.You wont be disappointed, unless your one of those critics who rips apart every aspect of the film so that the enjoyment is sucked out of it, yet you give a film like Harry Potter good ratings??!?!?!?!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The best movie of 2006,"I agree with the member that said this was the best movie of 2006. It has everything. First of all, it's a gangster movie, which for me, starts it off at about a 6 or 7 before I even see it. With Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, and Ben Kingsley in it, well, need I say more? You know there's going to be great acting. There are a few twists, but nothing that's going to have you saying ""what the hell happened"" at the end of the movie. The surprise ending is fully explained (which at my age is always a plus). The movie is very reminiscent of one of the classic independent films of all time, ""Usual Suspects"". I told EVERYBODY about it. Don't miss it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An absolutely incredible film.,"When I checked the ratings, I couldn't believe ""Lucky Number Slevin"" only got a 7.4. This one was of the best movies I've seen in a long long time, and definitely one of the best scripts written in the past five years. With amazing plot twists and enthralling performances by Hartnett, Kingsley, Freeman, Liu, and Willis, I would definitely recommend this well thought out and incredibly put together film to anyone.The beginning of the film is slightly confusing, but comes together at the end incredibly. I must say, I didn't see the end coming whatsoever. The violence was absolutely perfect- not over dramatic, and every bit of it was necessary with the perfect amount of gore.Monologues from Kigsley and Freeman spice up the dialog, and Hartnett plays a very good, witty, smart-ass character. I couldn't have picked anyone better for any of the roles. Definitely see this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"not bad, but don't compare it to the usual suspects","I saw this movie a few weeks ago & its not bad, but not great either. What surprised me is IMDb's recommendation 'if-you-liked-this-movie you-will-also-like' The Usual Suspects. huh? This movie *does not compare* to The Usual Suspects. TUS was a standing ovation, chills-down-the-spine, watch-it-several-times movie, and incredibly impressive. I had Slevin figured out 30 minutes into it, and I am no Sherlock Holmes. Its like comparing Star Wars to Tron: same genre, different league. Entirely. I also expected better from Kingsley, Freeman & Willis. Maybe it was the direction/tor. I don't have high expectations for Lucy Lui or Josh Hartnet, so not real surprised there.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
In A Word:  Brilliant,"I've just finished watching this movie on DVD.

I would advise anybody interested in seeing this movie NOT to, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES read any spoilers for this film. It would totally ruin the whole thing and deprive you of a movie experience which would be hard to match in any film you have seen or are ever likely to see.Sit through it, watch it, and see before your very eyes a fantastic and fascinating plot slowly reveal itself in what must be the very best movie I have seen for quite a few years.

what its about and what i thought,"the film's about a guy who gets caught up between the warfare of 2 major bosses placed right opposite each other in the middle of the city. (josh) is sent by bodyguards to meet each of the two bosses individually, being told to get their money, which he knows nothing about. in the middle of it all he finds his way into falling in love with a girl living across the hall (lucy). and so, while he has 2 bosses on his back, he has to get the money as well as doing other jobs. but you eventually find out everything is not as it seems...i enjoyed this movie very much and kept me well entertained. i couldn't watch it again or repeatedly because there is A lot of talking and not much action, and i do not need to retake in all the speech. it is a very clever and well set-up film. make sure that when watch it, you can keep up with every thing that goes on. overall an interesting film and i liked the cast in it, which made it more interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good acting,"Wnated to say that Morgan Freemans and Josh Hartnetts acting was terrific, and the dialog was superb. Clatchy and seriously at a innocent way. The way the express themselves, criticize the current language system. you gotta to give the them a hand. More from where that came from! The story itself has twists, the dialog itself has twists, and you can't really find anything that is disturbing you except the fact that you liked the movie, even though you didn't catch it from the beginning. But lighten up sunshine cause the movie will grow all the way from the beginning till the end.

not just one twist,"I like movies with a twist and i don't like plain shooting and killing. To be honest, my friend rented this movie and i knew that it was something like low action that i don't like. Than i sat down and at the end i couldn't believe how stupid i was. The movie is hell good. In the beginning its gonna be a bit confusing, you're left to think why something is shown or why it happened but at the end all the pieces of the puzzle come together and you get a darn big puzzle with a twist following another twist, and another. Don't be scared by the many twists, the director did a great job to picture it so good that you definitely wont get confused. The acting is also very good, i always knew that Ben Kingsley was good, but he made himself many new fans with this one and seeing Morgan Freeman as one of the bad guys- its pretty new. While were on that, i don't think that this movie has good guys at all. Believe me, whatever you expect, you'll get more. See it even if you don't like twisted endings.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Sort of Lucky,"Let me first say that I liked this film overall, it just left me feeling empty. It may have been because I guessed the ending about half of the way through or it could have been the poor man's Tarantino style of editing and dialogue (which isn't all bad). I liked all of the actors in the film (even Sir Ben, although I can't look him straight in the eye anymore after Bloodrayne)and I thought everyone gave solid performances. But for some reason, I just didn't feel satisfied at the end of the movie. If you enjoy ""gangster"" or Tarantino inspired movies, this one is worth seeing in a theater, otherwise you may want to wait until the DVD comes out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Great Movie and Lucy Liu is Awesome,"This movie is great for several reasons. It has a few tricks in its bag, but its not a one watch wonder. The action, the comedy, and that lock stock style of character coolness makes this movie worth watching over and over again. The movie has lots of star-power which is often bad thing, but this is one of those movies where you feel like the stars were cast very well and they're doing the movie b/c they like it versus to make the big bucks.Also, before this movie, I've never been a particularly big Lucy Liu fan. I've only ever seen her in either serious or corny fighting movies. In this movie, she is intelligent, quirky, cute and ultimately comes across as having a great personality. I personally think this type of role plays to her strengths more so than the other movies I have seen her in. Hopefully, in the future she gets an opportunity to be more than a corny or essentially mute Asian action figure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A psycho/drama chess game predicated on mayhem and murder,"The first part of this film runs so quickly and so loosely without good direction that it is a relief when things start to fall into place midway through the meandering plot. Part of the problem is that there are a hand full of people who directed this film. I had the impression that the people who directed and produced this film spent a lot of time over coffee with computer software testing over and over again the logistics of their story line. The gratuitous violence and sex in Lucky Number Slevin is the crazy glue that keeps the flashback scenes from seeming completely without relevant content. The merits of the film are artistic expression; the acting and other technical aspects of film are very good. I was entertained most of the two hours I watched the film; if you can hack brains being splattered everywhere several times throughout the movie, and like a suspense/thriller this is the movie for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Does a good job of what it's trying to do.,"stars: Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Lucy Lui, Kevin Chamberlain, Oliver Davis, Robert Forester and Danny Aiello.This is one of those films that REALLY tries hard to put in snappy and funny dialog like Pulp Fiction did, and they do that in this film and it mostly works. The performances in this film were all really good, especially Ben Kingsley in a role as a Rabbi mobster and Stanley Tucci as the corrupt FBI man. The problem with the film is that it is unfolded in a confusing way where you don't know exactly what is happening until it is explained at the end of the film. It might annoy you, which it did to me, but I enjoyed just watching these guys perform. The plot (or what you are lead to believe is the plot) is that hit-man Mr. Goodkat (Willis) kills a man named Nick, and Slevin (Hartnett) happened to be staying at Nick's place and is called in by two mobsters both that hate each other (Freeman and Kingsley) that believe he is Nick and they want him to pay him money that Nick owes them and kill each other's loved ones. Meanwhile Slevin meets Nick's neighbor Lindsey (Lui) and is being watched by FBI agent Brikowski (Tucci). The plot unfolds about 50 zillion secrets and twists and turns along the way which I won't reveal, so go see it. I recommend it! My rating-3/4 stars. 105 mins.

"A little slow, but really unpredictable","Pretty much cut and dry on this review. This movie took awhile to get through, but it had big actors, and a wicked storyline, so that helped. Without giving away any spoilers, I'll just say this movie definitely has twists and turns and keeps you wondering what the hell is going on. But it's good that it eventually makes sense and it all comes together and you're like ""Oh I finally get it!"" lol So it has many twists and turns in the plot, which is good so it doesn't get stale fast. But it does take awhile to get through all those twists and turns. So my overall review summary - lots of twists and turns, storyline keeps ya guessing, but only con is that the whole film runs a little slow to get through.

Pulp Suspects: The Usual Fiction,"John Hartnett secures the record for Longest Period of Time Wearing a Towel and Nothing Else in ""Lucky Number Slevin,"" a groan-inducing title for a groan-inducing movie. After what seemed like at least a good half-decade of hibernation, yet another hack filmmaker has emerged from the bushes and taken his suck-pump to dredge the remaining puddles of silt at the bottom of the now-drained Tarantino Lake; Jason Smilovic penned this too-familiar tale of criminals with oh-so-enigmatic names (The Boss, The Rabbi, Slevin) speaking in a torrent of pop-culture clichés (James Bond, Norman Rockwell, Andy Griffith, and Alfred Hitchcock get shout-outs), involved in some oh-so-wacky, oh-so-ironic, oh-so-postmodern shenanigans, and director Paul McGuigan put the frantically-edited mess up on screen for all to see. When you notice the missed beats in the dialog between Bruce Willis (whose persistent smirk seems to be holding back laughter) and another character during the opening scene, it doesn't bode well for the remainder of the film...and ""Slevin"" just gets progressively worse. The characters are a collection of pretentiously self-aware ciphers, and following the plot is pointless, since the film uses the LAST 30 MINUTES to tell us what the hell is going on (via dialog and flashbacks where--yup--information that was withheld is now revealed!), because its structure is so tediously contrived. In any other case, ""Slevin""'s unusually excellent cast would (at least somewhat) redeem the film, but veterans like Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, and Willis seem to be going through the motions of a flat, unmemorable script; meanwhile, Lucy Liu and Josh Hartnett radiate youthful cuteness, but precious little sympathy. Actually, the one smidgen of talent on display in ""Slevin"" might be McGuigan's ability to squander a cast most directors would kill for--now THAT is a true achievement. For those who have never seen a good crime thriller and would like to look 'hip' and 'with it,' have a ball with ""Lucky Number Slevin""; the rest of us will be re-watching ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Pulp Fiction.""",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Violent, compromising and brilliant performances from Josh Hartnett and Bruce Willis. Their performances keep you on your seat waiting for their next move or action and of course in your head you calculate the result of it.A brilliant film in many aspects, in my view overseen as a film that should have earned more praise and awards.

"Interesting thriller, but not as smart as it thinks it is",This is a wannabe Hitchcockian thriller which mostly works. The setup is intriguing with the hapless Josh Hartnett apparently being set up to commit a murder. The film is rather violent and some of the gory scenes feel unnecessary. Bruce Willis has a brief role and is alright. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are decent but both feel a trifle wasted. The plot twists occasionally feel too clever by half. However Lucy Liu is excellent in a brief role and has great chemistry with Hartnett. We can sense how the story is going to end halfway through the film. It's still watchable but should have been better.Overall 6/10,,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Deserves an Eleven,"Wow! After bypassing this selection for so long, it was a wonderful delight to discover it to be now one of my top favorite movies of all time. The super stellar cast of headliners are all at their best, and outstanding performances are delivered by the supporting cast as well. Lucy Liu is a 10 all by herself and is primally delightful in this film. With Josh Hartnett's amazing lead, this is a work of perfect casting; hard to imaging how it could've been any better. The reveal comes slowly, and Hartnett carries it along perfectly, with enough action, intrigue and humor to remain engaging through all the twists and turns which are all entertainingly presented. The plot delivery was maximized by the screenplay technique with flashbacks, etc. Definitely a collector's item, worthy of multiple viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Slightly disappointed,"For some reason, this movie didn't click with me. The movie is one of the most inventive thrillers of recent years. And yet...The reason could be Josh hartnett. I don't think I have been so underwhelmed with a performance of a leading man in a good thriller. Maybe he lacked the potential to be a proper leading man. His cool,composed style is maybe out of place in this movie. He doesn't have the screen presence to perform this role which is somewhat intense. He has a bored look on his face all the time.The basic plot line is as follows : Slevin Kelevra(Josh Hartnett) is a man who is mistaken for his friend Nick fisher and gets caught between two mob bosses, The Boss(Morgan freeman) and The Rabbi(Ben Kingsley) who are intent on wiping out each other. In a complicated storyline, a hit-man simply named as Good cat(Bruce willis) is also involved in this mess. There is also a girl Lindsay(Lucy Liu) who helps Slevin make some sense of the whole thing. Unfortunately Lucy liu's role is quite short and I feel she was underutilised in this movie.One thing I loved about this movie is the way the director finally closes all the loose ends at the end. The movie flows smoothly with a dark style of humor and an energetic screenplay. That is one of the strengths of the movie and might be the reason for the high rating this movie has. Bruce willis' performance is another one which is a strong point. He plays the regular tough guy role that he is famous for and he does that to perfection. Morgan Freeman is somewhat wasted in this role and his abilities could have been put to better use. Still, he does well enough to give the right edge to the bad guy character. Ben Kingsley, again, is much more capable. Still, I hope both these actors would do better in choosing their roles.Does it have replay value? Maybe not because there aren't many memorable scenes and the humor is somewhat forced in many scenes(especially the scenes with the two black hit men at the beginning). Or maybe Josh Hartnett does not have the ability to deliver the lines right for this kind of humor. Whatever it is, the humor doesn't seem natural and the natural British style humour isn't anywhere to be seen(which I expected because the director is British).Overall a good thriller but somewhat disappointed because my expectations were sky high for this one. The twist was very good and for that I applaud the director because it doesn't seem like a cop out. Instead it seems like an intelligent end and doesn't have many plot holes in it. It is a thriller for an intelligent audience. But Josh hartnett's performance is a downer and the revenge theme has been done in many movies. But this gives a new twist to it and a fresh approach to the thriller genre. But don't expect a classic or anything.Overall rating 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Absolutely worth being called a gangster movie,"I found Lucky Number Slevin more fun watching when I WAS DONE watching. Do you understand? Well, I have a hard time understanding too.During the movie, it is hard finding out what the motives are of Slevin and what his purpose is in the whole film. During that quest, you get rewarded by the outstanding performances of Willis, Freeman and Kingsley. They are absolutely superb and really enjoyable to watch. Their henchmen look a bit like the crooks from the famous Snatch movies, although with less character and not the same amount of humor.I didn't expect actress Lucy Liu to be so good in this type of movie. Perhaps I still imagine her as an 'Angel', but she really contributed to this movie.When I was watching the movie, I'd rate it a seven. But at the end, when the purpose and main motive of the main character became clear, I was shocked! Positively, of course. When I was done watching, I immediately knew the movies was worth a big fat eight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Slick and enjoyable, but a little too clever for its own good","This very slick, fast-moving crime thriller from Paul McGuigan actually has a very simple revenge story at its core, but writer Jason Smilovic seems to have worked hard at making it as convoluted as possible. Like a pair of seasoned hustlers, though, McGuigan distracts us with flashy visuals a la Guy Ritchie while Smilovic keeps us wrong-footed with his dense, fast-talking dialogue that appears to owe more than a little to Tarantino at times.Josh Hartnett is engaging enough as Slevin, an amiable young man who finds himself mistaken by a couple of gangsters (Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley, both good) for his friend Nick Fisher, who just happens to be into Freeman for $96,000. Freeman is willing to settle the debt, however, if Fisher/Slevin is willing to bump off Kingsley. From this simple strand things take off in increasingly convoluted circles as Slevin finds unexpected  and incredibly fortunate, when you think about it  assistance from police coroner Lucy Liu who lives in the flat opposite Fisher. And while all this is going on a melancholic Bruce Willis lurks in the background in one of his sillier wigs.This is one of those roller-coaster rides that barely slows long enough for you to draw breath, so determined is it to keep you guessing throughout its running time. For the most part, it's good  if over-derivative  fun, as long as you don't take it too seriously. But by its last reel it was straining to maintain its credibility as it pulled off its umpteenth twist. In fact, this is one of those films that's so deliberately convoluted that you can't prevent yourself from picking over it afterwards to find out where the inevitable plot holes are. And there are so many of these twists to be straightened out that it takes Smilovic a good fifteen minutes to unravel them all and that has got to be too long because, for my money, the truly clever films are those that, while they may be as convoluted as this, can be explained with a single devastating revelation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Not what I was looking for........BETTER,"When I saw the ads for this movie I thought it was going to be another whimsical dark crime comedy like Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrles. Wow I was wrong, not only was the dialog witty fast paced and smart, but it kept you constantly guessing. It is a very well conceived plot with great development that makes you think for yourself. There's twists turns, intense drama that makes you hate, and few good laughs, but all around one of the best crime/ thriller movies I've seen. I highly recommend this film. Anyone with a brain can enjoy the fast script and hidden quirks. Not to mention excellent performances by everyone in the cast, each character is fresh and different and they all have their quirks. Also an acting shout out to Josh Hartnett, his performance in Hollywood Homocide was pretty pathetic but this definitely made up for it and makes me think he is capable of being more than a pretty boy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Pretentious drivel...,"Zero stars.This movie is the equivalent of the high school dork that returns from summer break with a slick new wardrobe, a cool car and looks the part of belonging to the in crowd.

There is nothing creative about it and the script alone is enough to sink the entire enterprise. If you like predictable, totally improbable and contrived plot elements that scream of filmmakers trying to prove that they are smarter than you, then they are, and the stupor you walk around in at all times will not be disturbed by this dim bulb of a train wreck.Save your money.

He may be luckier than you think,"The title of this film had put me off seeing it, also the fact that Josh Hartnett is the lead didn't do it much favours. I don't have much against the guy but he seems to make every character he plays turn into Josh Hartnett and that is why it seems that he brings out a movie every few years or so. Saying that, once this film got going he had drawn me into his character rather well and I actually believed I was watching a guy with the weirdest name, Slevin and not Josh Hartnett.The film is based around mistake identity. Slevin has come into town after losing his job, flat and girlfriend all in one day. He has come to New York to stay with his friend Nick Fisher, such a good friend that when he arrives he isn't there and still hasn't returned the following morning, leaving Slevin to make himself at home. Slevin then meets Nick's neighbour Lindsey (Liu), who instantly falls for Slevin's charm, and I'm sure manhood considering she gets a complete eyeful with him only wearing a bath towel. Moments after she leaves another knock at the door produces two heavies, both of whom work for the Boss (Freeman) and have orders to bring in Nick Fisher. Despite not being Fisher, Slevin has no way of proving otherwise and is dragged in front of the Boss who is demanding the ninety-six thousand that he/Fisher owes him, or kill his arch nemesis, the Rabi (Kingsley)'s son to wipe off his debt. Slevin leaves to ponder and almost instantly is dragged in front of the Rabi, who also believes he is Nick Fisher. Nick Fisher happens to owe the Rabi thirty three thousand and Slevin has forty eight hours to pay up. What to do next?The narrative is very jumpy and the story twists and turns throughout and you find yourself guessing and then second guessing what is going to happen to this poor guy, who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He must somehow come up with a plan to worm his way out as he is no killer and has no money to his name. I won't let you in on anymore as you won't know which way this film is going and it will have you confused until the very end, where every little seed of detail falls into place, and I have to say it works bloody well.The cast is full of A-List stars and not one of them disappoints. As well as the leads we are treated to a bit of Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci, both of whom are very good in their roles. It isn't only the plot that takes surprising turns, it is also each character, all of which seem to have a trick up their sleeve at some point and all the actors present their tricks with surprise and intrigue. It is a thinker and if you are not really watching you will become confused.It isn't a crime thriller, more of a dark comedy. The first half is very quirky and the dialogue is sharp and snappy and some of the best pieces of dialogue I've heard in a while, all delivered with great punch from each actor, including Hartnett. It was a film that had me thinking but also had me laughing. What more can you ask for?One minor fault I have with it however is the lack of direction shown in a few very poor shots. There are also a few jump cuts which make very little sense and there wasn't much point of them. At times they make you notice several continuity problems and to be fair they needn't have done it. So for me the choice of shots and some of the editing does let it down but the acting, story and dialogue do make up for that. The first half is quirky, showing some poor filmmaking and the second half becomes dark, a complete change of tone, and shows some great filmmaking, especially in the editing. It is like two different films and both were very good.Let it all sink in and laugh along and I tell you, you won't be disappointed.4 / 5TolliCheck out my blog: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Smart, engaging thriller with clever twists.","A stellar cast usually augurs well and Lucky Number Slevin does not disappoint. The leads are all excellent and the story intrigues as it builds. Even if one can grasp the main twist before the end there is still a challenge to put all the pieces of the puzzle together and that is a big part of the fun. One of the best films of the genre I have seen, it is dark and funny, very well written and acted and gives a wonderfully satisfying and neatly wrapped up conclusion. Some reviewers liken it to The Usual Suspects and there are one or two similarities including the explanatory flashbacks, but they are generally quite different. Nevertheless Lucky Number Slevin is almost as good as The Usual Suspects - and that is saying something.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Excellent Mystery Noir!,"Lucky Number Slevin is a fantastic mystery thriller starring Josh Hartnett who plays the unfortunate Slevin Kelevra, an enigmatic smug yet lovable protagonist, who gets mixed into a colossal misunderstanding of identity placing him in debt with to rival gang lords for a combined $129,000 or an alternative of 1 gang land murder and $33,000. This leads Slevin on a brutal journey laced with dark wit from one plot twist to the next. Cinematographer Peter Sova really captured the essence of the 1950's mystery noir with the use of granulated filters during flashback sequences as an almost homage to past films. To add to this effect Screenwriter Jason Smilovic peppers in some clever back and forth between characters that keep the audience intrigued as they unveil plot twist after another which is actually addressed to as a ""Kansas city shuffle."" The film has a powerhouse cast (Josh Hartnett, Lucy Lu, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Sir Ben Kingsley and even Stanley Tucci) that really bring this project together. Also pay attention for Director's Paul McGuigan use of juxtapositions throughout the film. This was truly a triumph for all those involved!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Decent but not as great as its rating,"Lucky Number Slevin takes a familiar take upon past better films such as Pulp Fiction. Involving an intricate, multilayered story structure constructed around a case of mistaken identity, ""Lucky Number Slevin,"" boosted as it is by a former A-list ensemble cast and a heavy dose of intrigue, crosses the unfortunate line between clever and pretentious, rendering itself tiresome long before its heavily built-up denouement. Screenwriter Jason Smilovic's dialogue, which fills characters' mouths with fast-paced exchanges and protracted analogies, has been described in production notes as the film's ""heightened language."" And while purposefully stylized and unnatural, the affected speech that becomes the pic's hallmark serves to distract from, rather than enhance, the genuinely gripping labyrinth of twists and turns.At the center of ""Lucky Number Slevin's"" maelstrom is the eponymous Slevin (Josh Hartnett), whose run of bad luck hits an all-time high the moment he arrives in New York City to stay with his friend Nick (Sam Jaegar). Finding his old buddy's apartment empty, Slevin decides to settle in while awaiting Nick's eventual return. Slevin subsequently is abducted by a set of bodyguards and taken to the penthouse of The Boss (Morgan Freeman), who thinks that Slevin is Nick. It seems that Nick owes The Boss, and The Boss plans to cash in by having Nick -- who is really, of course, poor Slevin -- off the son of a rival. If Nick/Slevin doesn't agree to the deed, he will be the one killed. Returned to the apartment, Slevin is nabbed by a second set of thugs.Delivered to the penthouse suite of The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley), located directly across the street from The Boss' abode, Slevin is once again thought to be Nick, who is also deep in debt to The Rabbi. Sworn enemies with The Boss, The Rabbi also gives Nick/Slevin the choice to destroy his nemesis or else die himself. Complicating matters is the fact that Slevin is being tracked by a mysterious assassin named Goodkat (Bruce Willis), who is somehow manipulating the not-so coincidental circumstances, as well as an NYC detective (Stanley Tucci) investigating the two crime bosses. Slevin's sole confidant in this muddle is Nick's perky and adventurous neighbor Lindsey (Lucy Liu), whose involvement with her newfound friend takes an intimate turn.=== As a rewatch 07/13/18' Lucky Number Slevin is quite an interesting watch with a lot of things happening. The film is quite a good mystery type dark comedy thriller and did enjoy it on another watch. Though can still see the flaws within the film that could have made it better.As we watch the ending unfold and see how everything truly was, a lot of it was predictable in a way though still entertaining. A main reason was due to Josh Hartnett's performance. For a character that was put in many ""coincidences"" within the film, he didn't play it as someone who was worried or in too deep of situations. He played it cool throughout as if he knew he was never fully in danger. Somewhat confusing in the end with many plot twists though also engaging. Rating changed from 5 to 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Refreshing and enervating,"With Josh Hartnett, Morgan Freeman, Sir Ben Kingsley, Bruce Willis, and Lucy Liu this movie attains a star-studded Sin City-like cast. The amount of experience and talent is bombarding when you look at the level of acting of these magnificent people.This movie is very revolutionary. It's not your ordinary genre- biased movie, but something new. The storyline, which appears quite overwhelming at first works out perfectly throughout the movie. I've always loved non-chronological movies, and this film pulls it off wonderfully.What struck me the most was the Tarantino-esk dialogues in this movie. Particularly these dialogues drew me to the screen and kept me engaged the entire movie. When i'm done watching and I have no idea how much time has passed, a movie has done its job.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Lucky # indeed, The world needs more movies like this!","I thought that this movie was absolutely brilliant. I went in just expecting an average action movie, maybe with a bit of humor as well (judging from the trailer). What i got was something completely different. In the best way possible.The whole movie all the way had me engrossed entirely in the film. There were twists and turns galore. The entire time your watching you think you can predict things that are going to be revealed later. The results are completely different and mezmerizing. At least in my case i got surprise after surprise. Bruce Willis was the show stealer as World Class Assassin Mr. Goodkat. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley were brilliant as always. Not to mention, surprisingly, Josh Hartnett hasn't been this good since i can remember. He was great.So if your looking for a movie with twists and turns galore, great action sequences, witty dialogue, and is a film you'll have in your mind for weeks to come. All i could think about after watching it is how much i wanted to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A delightful cat's cradle of a movie,"Everything is connected, what more can I say? Pay close attention and watch the Kansas City Shuffle take shape, twisted thread by twisted thread.This is a movie buff's, cult sort of movie, not an ordinary Joe's six-pack and bag of chips sort. The sets are ugly. They have found some of the world's most horrifying wallpapers and room dividers for a thank-God-never-was sort of 70's yuck! feeling. I think the set designer should get a prize for extravagant awfulness. Excellent actors who bring warmth and depth to precisely limited roles. The dialogue is laden with clues and irony. ""It's what they called back then a drugstore handicap."" Whole movie right there, but you won't notice until 3 am in the morning of the night you watched it. The sort of movie you watch a second, third and fourth time with increasing pleasure as you see how it all fits together.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
More or less hits the mark; Hartnett a surprise,"Poor Slevin Kelevra (Josh Hartnett). He's just lost his girlfriend and his job, and when he jets to New York to stay with a friend for a while, he finds himself mistaken for his now-missing friend by the heads of two crime syndicates, each of whom wants to use Slevin for their own nefarious purposes.On the one hand, there's The Boss (Morgan Freeman). Seems Nick, Slevin's missing bud, owes The Boss a lot of money. The Boss knows Slevin's not Nick, but what can he do? Slevin's just in the wrong place (Nick's apartment) at the wrong time (the present). The Boss also knows Slevin has no money, so he offers to forgive Nick's debt to Slevin (i.e., not kill Slevin, which is important) if Slevin does a little favor for him. That favor, of course, is killing the son of The Boss's biggest enemy, The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley).The Rabbi, meanwhile, tells Slevin that Nick owes him money, too, and he gives Slevin a short time to come up with the cash. So now Slevin has to come up with hundreds of thousands of dollars and kill someone. Good thing he's not alone; Nick's neighbor, the vivacious Lindsey (Lucy Liu), concerned about Nick's absence, helps Slevin investigate and contemplate. Also thrown into the mix is a double-dealing hit man named Goodkat (Bruce Willis); no filme noirish movie would be complete without one.The movie feels a little perplexing for the first three-quarters, but then all of a sudden Things Make Sense. And not in a contrived, force-fed sense, either; it all falls into place. That's one of the debits of the movie, though; there aren't loose ends, there aren't endless possibilities, there aren't nebulous motives, and so forth. It's all too blunt, too black-and-white without even a hint of gray sneaking in from the side.Hartnett's not bad at all, though, which surprised me a great deal. I've always thought of him as a squinty-eyed dim bulb, frankly. He just seemed like a Big Dumb Guy, kind of like Ben Affleck. But Hartnett turns in a pretty amiable performance in the lead role, although the role was written as a little too glib for my tastes. (Slevin's nonchalant, unserious attitude seems more off-putting and distracting than colorful, even if it's partially explained later on.) Praise should go to an able supporting cast, especially the adorable Liu and the trenchant Freeman. Stanley Tucci, who plays a detective trying to sort out the mess, is also superb as always, as is Kingsley. Even Willis, who by now can do these roles in his sleep, manages to inject some life into his rather low-key scenes.All in all, the movie - despite its cumbersome title - is a bit better than I expected. The plot is fairly solid and believable, and the movie is well cast, even in the key role of the titular Slevin.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Watch it as soon as you can,"This is very interesting movie. Initially it may look a bit confusing, but pay close attention and you would thank me at the end.One guy with a towel is found in a room and is found by many odd characters one by one, first a sexy Chinese chick, then two Luda Chris, and one The Boss villain, then two Sabbath boy, followed by cool Mr. Torah. Like a shadow we see everywhere this Mr. Wills. Two bookkeepers are dead back to back and the guy in towel is getting punch all the time, still manages to smile at the cleavage of little miss Chinatown.Wait, he looks like some Nick Fisher (so fishy!!) to everyone and got some lucrative offer to kill and on top of that to pay huge greens (to two different boss, thank God!).Man, quite s story.

Blew my mind...,"So much so I watched it again the next night because I knew I had missed a lot of good stuff.Clever, stunning, unexpected, great actors, terrific script writing, dynamic.One of my favourite movies ever.I always love Lucy Liu.

Engaging and Entertaining,"This movie is undeniably very entertaining. The main reasons are the cast, their as always great acting (referring to Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingley), the gripping story line and the entertaining couple - Josh and Lucy Liu. In short cast was just perfect. I found Lucy Liu too cute in the movie and that also made those not so relevant scenes watchable.The plot was not all surprising - the climax I mean. I found it a little disappointing at first but with the Lucy Liu part embedded to it - it turned out fine. The Prologue gives the hint to what might have happened between Bruce Willis and Josh but nevertheless the story was definitely exciting.I liked Slevin a lot.

too much hipster dialog,"In this movie that tries so hard to be ""cleverer than thou"", Josh Hartnett as Slevin leads a cast of actors who all speak in pretty much the same voice. That voice, of course, being the faux-hip Tarantino-light, 'hipster wit' that writer Jason Smilovic unwisely chooses to imbue them with. As the disappointing, yet not unforeseen, outcome of that is one is always keenly aware that one's watching a movie. In that I mean that because the writer is too busy trying to be hip and clever, tat I never was drawn into the film whatsoever and even found it to be a tad on the annoying side. Perhaps I'm being too tough on the film as the tale of mistaken identity, mob hits, and the twists and turns therein is serviceable enough, if on the highly derivative side. and Bruce Willis is, as always, highly watchable. But as a whole the film fizzles out in a sea of pomposity.My Grade: D+Eye Candy: Jennifer Miller bares her breasts..or does she? hmmmDVD Extras: Audio commentary by director Paul McGuigan; Second commentary with actor Josh Hartnett, actress Lucy Liu, and writer Jason Smilovi; 13 minute making-of featurette; deleted scenes; Alternate ending; Theatrical trailer; and Trailers for ""Kill shot"", ""The Protector"", ""Pulse"", ""Clerks 2"", and ""Scary Movie 4""",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Quite a movie...,"Of course I knew about this 2006 movie, but oddly enough I never actually got around to watching it. At least not before now in 2024. I got the chance to watch it, as I was sitting through the back catalogue of Bruce Willis movies.And as it turned out, I had actually been missing out on a rather enjoyable movie here. Writer Jason Smilovic put together quite a unique and entertaining script. It was a nicely constructed storyline, that was carried not only by the narrative, but also by an interesting character gallery. And the plot twist was quite brilliant. So I will say that spending 110 minutes on watching ""Lucky Number Slevin"" was time well spent.The cast ensemble in the movie is quite great, with the likes of Josh Hartnett, Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Lucy Liu, Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci, Danny Aiello and Corey Stoll. Needless to say that the acting performances in the movie were quite good.There is a good amount of action sequences throughout the course of the movie, and they are nicely executed on the screen, adding to the overall enjoyment of the movie.If you haven't already seen this 2006 movie, then you certainly should do so, should you get the chance. I was genuinely and wholeheartedly entertained throughout the course of the entire movie.My rating of director Paul McGuigan's 2006 movie ""Lucky Number Slevin"" lands on an eight out of ten stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Great Cast, Incredible Ending, Weak Middle",This is a very under-the-radar film and it should have gotten way more attention than it did when it was released. The cast is star-studded and felt perfect for each character. I enjoyed the beginning to set the movie's tone; the ending is absolutely incredible without spoiling it. They were able to tie the film together perfectly in the end. Maybe a slight nitpick with the ending about the final mini-twist but it didn't ruin the closure. My biggest gripe was with the middle. There were too many times when the film felt like it was dragging on and slowing the pace. It is a nearly 2-hour movie and could be cut to 90 minutes if they planned it carefully but I never felt bored of the film either. 4/5 stars.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Well worth a watch!,"The first 30 minutes of this movie I must admit I didn't care for that much. The problem was the script is a little too quirky, it was just trying to be far too clever. The characters come across as a little smarmy and I found myself starting to dislike most of them, if not all.The second act turns the movie around for me, it becomes a much better film, good character development helps you begin to care about the lead in the movie played well by Josh Hartnett. Lucy Lui also turns in a very strong performance even tho a little under used. The mighty Morgan Freeman and equally strong Ben Kingsley are also not used to their full potential but both bring in a credible effort.The final acts the most enjoyable part of the movie in my opinion, You find most of these types of movies usually struggle to tie all the lose ends together at the end in a satisfying way. This film certainly does not, the way every thing is rounded off is very pleasing to watch even if its slightly predictable.Overall a very enjoyable film. Terrible title which I think will put a lot of people off going to see it, but well worth a viewing if your looking for something a wee bit different and you want to give the brain a bit of a workout.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Fun but Uneven,"A victim of mistaken identity, a man finds himself in the position of committing a murder or being killed by underworld figures. The plot has similarities to ""North by Northwest,"" a fact that is even mentioned in this movie. The first half of the film is quite good, with break-neck pacing and witty dialog propelling the story forward, although it is not clear what is going on. Then the plot turns dark as the loose ends are tied and the big pictures starts to become clear; the film also starts to become less fun at this point. There are good performances from Hartnett, Liu, Freeman, Kingsley, and Willis. Well-made but a bit too clever for its own good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

It's like Alfred Hitchcock came back from the grave to direct an other masterpiece!,"Last night I saw this movie for the first time and wasn't expecting too much of it.

The story and dialog is so well written and the great cast of actors makes it all so much better. It's like Alfred Hitchcock came back from the grave to direct an other masterpiece.

Think of Ocean's Eleven, Payback, Donnie Brasco, Casino, Goodfellas and few of the less famous ones, mix it all together and you are pretty much there.However, in my view, this recipe worked well here. The movie's ""universe"" is well constructed, the story is stringently told in a way that keeps you enjoying what you are watching, and the overall atmosphere and coolness is entertaining, not embarrassing.Also, the guys have done a good job in casting the characters. Bruce Willis is playing pretty much the same guy as in The Whole Nine Yards and The Jackal - which is a good thing in my view, because he is pretty good in these roles. Josh Hartnett is a (surprisingly) credible lead, Lucy Liu is lovely as always if you go for Asian girls, and I just like to see Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley being the cool bad guys (they have played this numerous times before, too). Even the supporting characters are fun to watch.In short, not the most original movie of all times, but a pretty save bet for a good time seeing guys at work who know what they do (again...)",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A superb stylised film!,"I saw Lucky Number Slevin in the cinema and now have the DVD. This film is probably one of the most enjoyable films I have seen all year. The film has style, story and acting. Even though it has had many critical slating's I don't think it actually deserved them. The film is beautifully shot with artistic style and stylised costumes and sets. The music adds to this style successfully. The acting is also superb. Freeman and Kingsley make an excellent performance that is widely different to anything they have done before. Willis is excellent as the super intense Mr Goodkat. Liu is also very good at adding comedy to the film. However the best cast member was Josh Hartnett who played both the comic and noir lead convinceingly. The story is the film's greatest strength with a clever plot that keeps you guessing. Although you can guess the ultimate ending about ten minutes in, how you get to that point is tough to work out.

What a waste of time,"Slevin(Hartnett, in the one good performance of his career so far) has just moved into his friend Nick's apartment when he is mistaken for him, by two rival gangs, both of whom want to collect ""his"" debt to them. One of them, The Rabbi(Kingsley, who ""tought he taw a puttytat"") wants the cash within 48 hours, the other, The Boss(Freeman, who speaks in an incredibly repetitive manner) wants him to knock off(why not hire a complete stranger to kill someone protected by ex-Mossad agents, and who you want to make sure die?) the gay son of the other one, in revenge for his own offspring's recent murder. Unbeknownst to him, Mr. Goodkat(Willis, cool as ever... and yes, the names in this were thought up in about five minutes), the world-class assassin, is in town, and when he's around, people end up dead. So, with the aid of his new neighbour(Liu) he tries to figure out how to deal with all of this. Confused? You don't know the half of it. The tale is actually rather straightforward(and not particularly memorable), once you're told what's going on. It would be fantastic if that occurred more than ten minutes before the end of the excruciating 1 hour, 45 minute running time. Do we need to be able to tell what's going on(and I mean at all, there's nearly nothing in this where you know what is happening, who someone is, why which whatever, and we're given no reason to care) other than retroactively? Perhaps not. In fact, that idea could open up exciting new avenues in storytelling. Obviously, however, we will need something else to justify spending 90 minutes on something that is then explained in a sixth of that time. The lead? Nope, can't be it. We know literally nothing about him, and only find out anything, yeah, you guessed it.Ah, it must be dialog? No, it's a strain on anyone's patience, with lines that try extremely hard at being clever and fall flat on their face. Not only that, there is so much straight meaningless babble in this that you'll miss several of the few actually relevant lines. The slang makes parts difficult to understand, and it's too goofy to take seriously, or for it to establish an environment. Humor? It's terrible, there's maybe one joke(the puns and plays on words are cringe-inducing) that isn't overdone. Frankly, this is quirky(characters, situations, etc.) and contains one twist after another just for the sake of it. Do those qualities pass for interesting traits, and something well-plotted, respectively? Have we forgotten that fiction, mystery and otherwise, is other things than surprising the audience(as this does in every scene, where we literally typically do not know what's going on)? Keeping you guessing is easy(especially when plausibility is not on your list of priorities, as is the case here; there are holes in this, if one even wants to bother exploring it), getting you involved is not, and this puts all of its effort in the former, forgetting the latter even exists. Not only did I not want to learn more about anyone in this, I downright wanted them to be shot, just so they would *shut up*. The stylized cinematography and editing earns this one star above average, on account of there being next to nothing entertaining, enjoyable or engaging in this. There is a bit of bloody, violent, disturbing content, sexuality, nudity(and it puts a lot of energy towards offending several ethnicities, orientations and faiths), and strong language in this. The DVD comes with two commentary tracks(#1: director Paul McGuigan(informational and technical, some will find it dull). #2: Lucy, Josh, and the screenwriter(amusing enough, and it gives background)), a decent making of(13 minutes), 2 unforgivably awful deleted scenes(11 minutes total, if it will feel like ten times that), trailers(this, The Squid and the Whale, 16 Blocks, She's the Man, Arthur and the Minimoys, Stormbreaker, Crazy in Love) and an alternate ending(1 minute). I recommend this to people who need nothing other than to not be aware of what's going on to like something. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"The Boss: Why did you think I was him?    Slevin: I didn't, I thought he was you.","Seen very soon after a belated watching of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, with the eminently substantial Crash (2006) in between, this movie had to earn its place amongst the most valuable cine-memories for almost 8 people on a depressing February Wednesday in a little town on a tiny island off the coast of a small country that has, let's face it, seen better days. And earn it did! Having only seen Josh Hartnett in Black Hawk Down, I was confident of an adequate performance in what I had been led to believe by the local press -(one edition PER WEEK)- was going to have to be a 'word of mouth' success if it were to make the big-time.The pick of a bad bunch, (I thought), we decided to see it because we could get an Orange Wednesday half-pricer, at the same time checking-out how Bruce Willis is doing these days. (Incidentally, a couple of elderly ladies in front of us had got their money back after ten minutes of The Producers because they didn't like the language. They chose this instead).Obviously not a star vehicle for Bruce, what a jolt to the system to find an intelligent, funny, sharp, fresh, offbeat and exhilarating performance by him and by all involved! The opening scene reminds us that nobody does it better than Bruce, even with his vest covered and a nerdy side parting in his hair. He's the backbone of the movie, even though you sense from early-on it ain't gonna be an easy ride. Josh underplays his role just enough to send a message out that there is always a bright young thing snapping behind the heels of every established star who can carry a movie on their own. Lucy Liu, showing a strong but sympathetic personality, is engaging, and here is evidence of that old chemistry Hollywood wastes so much time and dollars trying to invent!Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman must have come aboard on the strength of the team already proposed, and a script that leaps off the screen. You could be forgiven for having thought it was all too damned cool for itself, if it hadn't been so thoroughly enjoyable and commendable at every twist and turn. Once every couple of years, you see a bit-part performance that defines the word 'breakthough', and I've yet to find out the name of the black guy (Elvis' buddy), with the teeth, who steals the first scene he's in and invokes an underlying regret that you don't see much more of him. The progress of the plot is many-layered, and the drive of the main character reveals itself through the eyes of an innocent-abroad. I was telling myself this is the sort of movie Hitchock would have been making were he still alive (107 next August), when Ben Kingsley made much the same point. Josh's hotel room is dressed in unfashionable retro, not so much an attempt to remember the good old days as remind us that neglect in updating decor gives off a smell of decay that doesn't need Odourvision to make it potent in an auditorium.You can't help thinking Tarantino, though this didn't have the 'gloss' of Pulp Fiction, the coldness of Reservoir Dogs, or the inconsequential dialogue of either. Yet, the cool is there, and like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang it advertises that really good movies don't have to have Superheroes and Extraspecial Effects. I suspect audiences twig the plot a little earlier than desired by the director, but ENJOY for goodness sake, the film's not trying to make a point! In fact, credit to Paul McGuigan, for holding back from a handful of more traditional twists, and for keeping himself under control to finish this effort with superb standards in look, sound and feel. Special credit to Jason Smilovic fresh from television writing for an ambitious debut into the world of quality features.Josh Hartnett follows this with The Blue Dahlia, a Brian De Pamla/James Ellroy concoction, hopefully launching himself thereafter successfully into the role of Chet Baker as The Prince of Cool.

My Review,Thought that this was okay...it goes through highs and lows of being really really engrossing and then into a bit of a lull. I may be slightly biased towards the duller side however I think that Josh Hartnet is an appalling actor and he spoilers every movie that he's in. I'm also not keen on Lucy Lu so this probably isn't the best movie choice for me anyhow.In saying that Bruce Willis manages to get both the crap actors through this movie and it keeps you watching even if it is a tad predictable...I'm not someone who saw the Sixth Sense twist coming but believe me I saw this one in the making after the first 25 mins. Don't get me wrong though this is a decent enough movie and is definitely worth watching at least once.,6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A Surprise...of the Good Kind!,"Reviewing films encourages following the opinions of fellow reviewers whose thoughts nail movies dead center: often reading reviews by certain reviewers encourages or discourages this reviewer regarding a controversial film. Reading some thoughts about how particularly disappointing this film almost precludes watching it: happily a coincidence encouraged viewing such a film that for this viewer was fascinating and satisfying.The production crew of this thriller worked overtime to make a style: the film is filled with metaphorical circles in the wallpaper, the decor, the steps, the room designs - each pointing a sturdy finger to the story's meaning from the very beginning. But along the way the writing and pacing of this high-octane film zoom past the eye with twists, turns, interlocked relationships, and character development that waits for the end for the payoff. To say more would probably alter the good chase fun the movie provides in its ending.The film is one of the bloodiest and goriest of the season, but it all serves the purpose of exposing crime at its pinnacle. The good guys are difficult to separate from the bad guys in this case of mistaken identity that spurs mayhem. But the cast is at all times stylishly active: Josh Harnett, Lucy Liu, Danny Aiello, Morgan Freeman, Sir Ben Kingsley, Stanley Tucci, Kevin Chamberlin, Dorian Missick, Mykelti Williamson, and of course Bruce Willis. There are some holes in the plot but the action is so well paced that they are inconsequential, and for this viewer the end justifies the means.

"This is what ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" should have been",Kay well Slevin is having a very very bad day. He goes down on his luck and eventually is pulled into a gang war that he isn't even supposed to be remotely involved in. To top that a very high profile assassin is involved. What will happen to our hero? Will his bad luck last forever? I like thing simple at times but then again there are times when a movie's complexity impresses me. This is a movie that has a very complex plot and nothing is as it seems. The acting is very nice and it is always nice to see some of the big names like Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis strut their stuff in this film. If you are really into the action I apologize as it is mostly talk and speculation but still it is a very good movie and there are still plenty of bodies that pile up. If you would like a clever movie then this would be a good one to see.,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"In one word, Good.","If you're looking for depth, or surprises, this may not live up to its billing. However, not to shoot it down too fast, I found this an enjoyable and entertaining film, with some good performances in an unexceptional script.Full of twists and turns, you'd expect to be kept guessing right to the end, but aside from perhaps some more minor details, most will have it figured out well before the ending sequences.Overall though, it was a fun film, with plenty of good lines, especially between josh hartnett and lucy liu, who brightened up the film no end.I'd recommend it as a good film if you don't want anything taxing, just want something to sit back and enjoy.

Horrible. Absolutely Insulting.,"This film is crammed with too much hipster language. Perhaps it's being used as a device to camouflage a very poor film. It's trying so hard to be witty and funny, but fails miserably. The sex and violence were very graphic and not in an artistic way. It certainly didn't help the story and just seemed to be stuffed in everywhere to fill plot holes.Lucy Lu needs an acting lesson and the script was written by someone who must have just read the book ""Writing Monologues for Dummies."" How someone could enjoy this film is beyond me. If there was a sequel to Pulp Fiction that was made by a third-rate writer and director with ADHD, Slevin is what would have been produced.I'm not going into the boring and predictable plot here. I'm just going to highlight two points.1) Any film where the characters start quoting/summarizing plots from classic films is trying to ride on the coat tales of greatness. In this mediocre film, Slevin (the main character) compares his life to Jimmy Stewart in Hitchcock's North by Northwest in a long, stupid monologue.2) Have you ever seen The Simpson's episode where Lisa discovers she's a vegetarian and insists on a veggie meal in the cafeteria? To squash her opinion, the school shows a Troy McClure video that promotes eating meat and claims that anyone who is a vegetarian is a moron. Lisa exclaims at the end of the film ""Are you really going to swallow this tripe?"" to the other students. The teacher responds by asking the student to help themselves to some tripe that was donated by the meat council. This class digs in.Considering the high ratings on IMDb, I suppose a lot of people swallow this tripe. It's sad. Very very sad....",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
This movie desperately wants to be Pulp Fiction,"I went into this movie not knowing anything about it, not even the broadest details of the plot. It didn't take long to figure out the entire plot, including the ""twists"". I really didn't like the constant ""why is he called the Rabbi/why is he called the Boss"", ""Because he's a rabbi/ because he's the boss"" schtick. This is what passes for 'hip' dialogue these days. I did not like this movie at all, it offered no surprises, and even good acting couldn't save this movie from being predictable. I didn't come to that conclusion until the end though, as I kept giving the movie the benefit of the doubt, thinking ""oh that's too obvious, there has to be more to it than that"". Well, there wasn't, the movie ended exactly as I had predicted it would 10 minutes into watching it. If you're good at guessing games, pass this one by.

Good but not Great,"I doubt if the even the filmmakers of Lucky Number Slevin know how to summarise it...The film is self-conscious of this though, and from the beginning we are implicitly informed that a clear and taught plot is not where we are to search for this film's purpose, its substance, it raison d'etre. Stylistically, Lucky Number Slevin is a joy...still, it would constitute no loss to the potential viewer if he were to forgo a trip to the large screen for this...wait for DVD.

You simply have to see this film.,"The phrase ""Must see movie"" is over used these days. It seems everything is a ""summer blockbuster"" or ""greatest movie ever"". Normally they lie. This time, they do not.From the first flickering shot of a phone ringing, you know this movie will make you think and it does not disappoint. For the blood lovers, there are enough bullets flying around to keep you happy. For the guys, there's Lucy Liu on fine form as a bouncy and too cute girl. For the girls there's Josh Hartnett in a towel.I won't say anything about the actually movie because everything should be a surprise. You simply have to see it. Like Memento, Seven, Sixth Sense, this is a movie that you have to see to appreciate and to understand why everyone is raving about it.Unfortunately, like the other good films I just mentioned, this isn't one you can see again and again. At its heart, it is a mystery and once you know the truth it just doesn't have the same impact.See it at the cinema, come out looking overwhelmed and saying ""Damn that was a good movie"" and if anyone even starts blurting out the ending, head-butt them quickly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
There is a thing called 'too much'.,"I had no idea what this movie was about when my boyfriend dragged me along to see it in the theater yesterday. While I enjoyed the movie, I have to make a quick comment on how the movie was explained to death during the last 20 minutes or so. The explanation was not needed (except Lucy Liu's character and the cop and who he is and how he fits in). It would be highly sufficient, and the movie would actually be better if the audience were left to figure things out for themselves. A good movie is a movie who leaves some things unsaid.Other than that, go see it for good entertainment. Don't expect to be blown away in any way, because the plot is nothing new, but still worth mentioning as a decent movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
OK of its kind,"SLEVIN is a gimmicky crime drama about gambling and payback that depends much too heavily on a twist ending. It also has all the earmarks of an independent production, yet it stars some pretty damned big names in relatively small roles, including Bruce Willis as a hit man and Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman as rival crime bosses. Your tolerance for the film may depend on your tolerance for Josh Hartnett in the lead role as a loser mistaken for someone else. He wasn't bad, although it is hard to watch the kid without thinking of lookalike Ashton Kutcher and PUNK'D. If you can hang in to the end, you may be pleasantly surprised by the turn of events.

Totally Predictable and Disappointing,"I was quite excited at the prospect. #1. I love gangster movies and #2. it has a cast with impressive CV's.

Josh Hartnett is flat and unconvincing, Lucy Lui gives it a try but she's just annoying. The supporting cast were reliable but it was just wrong to hear substandard lines coming out of the mouths of likes of Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley.

Entertainment at it's best,"Lucky Number Slevin is a film that only comes around once in a long while. The writing is original and snappy, and humor works at times when you think it wouldn't. The characters, although not all of them are original, are each entertaining in their own ways. The cast gives great performances. While most people talk about how bad of an actor Hartnett is, he gives a very good portrayal of a man stuck in the middle of a mistaken identity crisis. Lucy Liu, for once, is enthusiastic in a good way and adds her own attitude to her character. Morgan Freeman, as usual, is very good, as is Sir Ben. Bruce Willis, even with his strange hairdo, does a very good job in perhaps his most intimidating role. Although the plot seems a bit confusing at some times, it all comes together when, of course, the twist ending is revealed. All in all, Lucky Number Slevin is humorous and thrilling, and for anyone who likes crime films that have originality and attitude, this is a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A seemingly classic case of mistaken identity quickly becomes dangerous and deadly.,"Josh Hartnett (Slevin) stars in this dramatic (yet comical at times) film noir. A host of other big names fill the bill including Morgan Freeman as The Boss (because he's the boss), Sir Ben Kingsley as The Rabbi (because he's a rabbi), Bruce Willis as Mr. GoodKat (the professional assassin), and the beautiful Lucy Liu (girl next door) as the female lead.A smart-mouthed Slevin finds himself in the middle of a war between two crime bosses, The Boss and The Rabbi, but Selvin's 'I'm-not-the- guy-you're-looking-for' bit gets lost in translation to all except the flirtatious Lindsey (Liu), who offers him help.Throughout this fast paced movie the viewer will be totally captivated, yet a bit oblivious to the significance of some of the characters and key events. The film's conclusion, however, proves that very few things are what they seem. The creative writing of Jason Smilovic and Tarantino-esquire directing of Paul McGuigan turn this 'drama' into a refreshingly witty and intense thriller.Along with its energetic soundtrack (including 1964 Stax Classic, After Laughter Comes Tears by Wendy Rene) and eye-catching production design, moviegoers will love Lucky Number Slevin's enigmatic essence and quirky humor.It is dreadfully bloody, incredibly sexy, very funny, and EXTREMELY clever.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
plenty of eye candy in this one!,"I liked it. I didn't think it was trying to be overly cool, and the dialog was amusing. I mean, I go to movies just to be entertained so it worked for me.The best part of this film was the characters. I forgot Ben Kingsley was Ben Kingsley, and even Morgan Freeman, who is such an engaging person in himself always exuding integrity, goes beyond that and conveys a kind of weakness or hypocrisy which really made it feel like a different character for him. Bruce Willis was phenomenally elegant, and Josh Harnett - well, he doesn't really need to do much to be very amusing but I liked his delivery even though some called it smug.People are ripping this movie a new one because it emulates other films, but the thing that carried it for me was the acting and the characterizations.

kind of like eating leftovers,"Director Paul McGuigan, who previously set the plague upon the world that was the Josh Harnett vehicle ""Wicker Park"", returns with an entirely new bag of tricks with ""Lucky Number Slevin"". The oddly named film fulfills the basic requirements of a crime thriller, providing equal amounts twists as turns, and leaves the audience grappling at straws up until the very end. On the surface this is all very familiar territory, which has been going especially strong since Quentin Tarantino burst on the scene in the early '90s, reviving the genre.Most of what came after Tarantino's arrival (specifically ""Pulp Fiction"") was below par, hackneyed, and at times little more than hero worship pointed at that director himself. McGuigan takes ""Lucky Number Slevin"" in more of a ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" direction, as it allows intrigue and crime to occur in a world familiar with the same film catalog as those staring at the screen. It's this sort of self-conscious film-making that makes this one really work, even if the whole mess comes off as a filmic casserole.It tells the continually unraveling story of Slevin, a man who finds himself caught in an extreme case of mistaken identity that leads him deep into the crime world of New York City which is headed by two warring isolationistic crime bosses. There's a lot of strong acting talent involved here, including a surprisingly effective performance by Lucy Liu, who tends to be an awkward fit in many of her roles.The story is predictably complex, and at times indiscernible, as it continues to unravel in interesting, entertaining, and surprisingly tidy ways. There's a palpable energy to the whole thing that makes it an exciting, if quickly forgotten experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Watch the trailer, not the movie","Thee are a couple of good one-liners in this movie--they are in the trailer, so you can save your $8. For the rest, it's one of the most irritatingly stupid films I've ever seen.The basic problems are: 1) Really, really annoying main character. He gets punched around a good deal in the movie, but he's so snotty that I actually started rooting for the thugs to beat him up after about 20 minutes. The writer probably thought he was adorably brash, and I imagine a few 14-year-old girls will agree, since he does spend a lot of time wearing a towel.2) Insulting the audience's intelligence. Many plot elements are predictable, but instead of supplying the viewer with just enough information to put things together, the movie provides extra hints, followed by tedious explanations from the characters, topped off with a replay of scenes from earlier in the movie, just in case you had nodded off for a critical scene. This is _The Usual Suspects_ remade for people with the attention span of Beavis and Butthead.3) Completely depraved.

Josh Hartnett as a hapless maverick in this twisting suspenser that is not to be missed.,"What a find. You've got Josh Hartnett as a hapless maverick in this twisting suspenser that is not to be missed: if you liked ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Confidence"", you're gonna absolutely love ""Lucky # Slevin"". It grabs your attention right away, keeps you engaged, has you completely hooked and then puts you away with a climax you couldn't see coming without a crystal ball -- though, in hindsight, the foreshadowing was right there for you. The supporting cast kills. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are wonderful as cold-blooded crime lords. Lucy Liu continues to show strong range Hartnett's perky, impromptu gumshoe of a love interest (they must be paying her the ranch to mark time as one of those lead bimbos in the ""Charley's Angels"" franchise) .

From beginning to end just brilliantly executed...,"A movie I first saw upon its release early last year, but one I've managed to once again view thanks to the brilliance that is the DVD. If you've yet to see this little gem I suggest you do, immediately, as it was certainly one of the most enjoyable films I had the pleasure of watching in 2006.Super performances (particularly Hartnett, Lui and Kingsly), great and initially slow burning plot and intriguing character interaction (the Hartnett Lui chemistry was palpable, surprising and came across, most importantly, as completely natural and 100% genuine) are the glue that hold this movie together, as well as being one of the many strong magnetic forces behind a film I just couldn't take my eyes off.The driving force of the film, however, is it's superb script. Funny, witty and as sharp as a razor blade. Every single word and phrase is strategically placed for maximum effect, whether that be with its habitual dry and sardonic mutterings throughout or the moments in which it harks back to archetypes and or conventions of crime capers from yesteryear. The script and its dialogue provide nothing particularly groundbreaking, but it does an exceptional job of developing characters, tear away any feeling of apathy one may initially have toward the primary protagonists, creating the plot's undercurrents and providing the dark comedic aspect that the movie is built upon.I could delve deeper into my analysis of the flick and hark on relentlessly about cinematography, editing, music, specific performances and so forth, but time is currently at a premium and life, I'm told, is very short. So, if you really care to find out, be sure to pick up a copy of this now. You will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

- Film facts,"For the film geeks, I got some interesting facts about this film...On promotional material for the film, Ben Kingsley's credit included his honorary title. At first, the actor was singled out for some criticism as they usual are, from professional credits especially. It transpired that this was a mistake by a studio executive, who was unfamiliar with the British honors system. The movie's violence and style earned it comparisons with the work of director Quentin Tarantino.In Australia the film's release title is ""The Wrong Man"". This is the title of a 1956 Alfred Hitchcock film in which the lead character has a case of mistaken identity, a theme which many Hitchcock films as well as Lucky Number Slevin share. In fact the main character's plight in ""North by Northwest"" is referenced in the movie as being similar to Slevin's. The film shares many similarities with Akira Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"", where a samurai plays two rival criminals against each other. Yojimbo was remade as Walter Hill's ""Last Man Standing"" which also stars Bruce Willis in prohibition-era America. Bruce Willis' character Mr. Goodkat is also referred to as Smith, perhaps as an allusion to Willis' character in Last Man Standing, John Smith.

Fun but overplayed at times....,"I REALLY wanted to like this movie. In fact I shouldn't say I didn't like Lucky Number Slevin, because I did. Instead I should say I expected better after reading the reviews and watching the trailer for it. A couple of key elements hold Lucky Number Slevin together so we will start with those. The script is amazing. The writing and dialog between characters is very well written and is on par with this year's ""V for Vendetta"" (which also had a very well-written script). Josh Hartnett and Lucy Liu played much better than expected and earn some credit in my book since I haven't seen them impress me much in the past. Also, the chemistry between Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley was outstanding and the scenes they were in were masterfully written. With that said there are to many flaws present to give this movie higher than a 6. First and foremost is Bruce Willis. It seems to me he is a hit and miss kind of guy. He hit big with Sin City and missed big with Lucky Number Slevin. Though his dialog was nice, he didn't portray his role the way I think it was written and instead acted bland and boring. Realizing that assassins most likely aren't the most dramatic people on earth, I bring forth the idea that he is supposed to be some sneaky ghost of a man. He is supposed to be creepy and slide in the shadows, and Bruce Willis just didn't pull off that vibe to me. Also, the ""twist"" in the movie wasn't all that good and seemed like a generic way to end the film. Also I was surprised IMDb didn't put a main genre of this as comedy, since most of it was obviously intended to be comedic. In fact, most of it is comedic up until the last 20 minutes or so. It tries to be something sneaky like the usual suspects, but just fails to enthrall me. It takes itself like the best movie this year, when really I'd rather watch Slither. Good effort by the screenplay writer though and Josh Hartnett deserves his props for sure. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Predictably Unpredictable,"This movie did many things good, but failed to do one thing right. Many people compared this movie to 'Snatch' or 'Pulp Fiction', but it fails to compare to either of them. Both of those movies have twists, like this one does, but those twists are less predictable and more entertaining. Both of those movies followed different intersecting plot lines, but the lines were so vividly different that when they did intersect they had violent and entertaining reactions. Sleven had one plot line that jumped around a bit. I was expecting more. With every twist I was mildly amused but not fully entertained.This was worth the money, and worth the time. Considereing what was out in theaters at the time, it was the best choice.What I would have changed: Throw in Christopher Walken as one of the bosses, and a villain that isn't a pawn. Someone like Kevin Spacey would have done nicely. Cut Ben Kingsley and you've got a movie. Nothing against Kingsley.

"""Lucky Number Slevin"" - Critics vs. Audience","Paul McGuigan's ""Lucky Number Slevin,"" starring Josh Hartnett, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Bruce Willis, and Lucy Liu, was awarded Best Film at the 2006 Milan International Film Festival. Internet Movie Database user BigStuff2020 reports, ""I was lucky enough to have seen this at a screening back in December, and the entire theater started to applaud at the conclusion of the film."" You'd think that the critics would have liked it, too. But no.""'Lucky Number Slevin' is a crime thriller-plus-con job that might be too slick and clever for its own good,"" according to Hollywood Reporter's Kirk Honneycutt. ""The movie risks alienating its audience initially with a welter of confusing story lines, dead bodies and random characters.""So the movie's beginning is problematic.""The performances are juicy,"" says Rolling Stone's Peter Travers. ""But the convoluted ain't-I-clever script by Jason Smilovic has a cheat ending that makes you want to do a little torturing yourself.""So the movie's ending is problematic. And the script is too clever.Stephen Holden of the NY Times characterizes Slevin as a failed Pulp Fiction wannabe. ""From its sly, amused performances to its surreal comic book gloss to its artfully nervous camera-work 'Lucky Number Slevin' sustains the blasé tone and look of a smart-aleck thriller that buries its heart under layers of attitude. When the movie makes a belated stab at sincerity in the closing scenes, it's too little, too late.""So the ending is not only a cheat, it's disappointing as well. And the movie is too darn artful.Unkindest cut of all, Roger Ebert gave Slevin a thumping thumbs-down. ""'Lucky Number Slevin' is too clever by half. It's the worst kind of con: It tells us it's a con early on, so we don't even have the consolation of being led down the garden path.""So the beginning is also problematic because it gives the audience a hint as to what the movie is really about.Ebert goes on: ""'Lucky Number Slevin' goes to some pains to make it clear it is only an exercise in style.""Why ""only""? What's the matter with an exercise in style?Ebert sure exercises his own style: ""Here we are looking at a crime mystery involving warring hoodlums and beautiful neighbors and a confused guy from out of town and a gunman and a cop, and the movie knows we're deluded and they're all just conceits. It's smarter than we are. Well, it must be, because it got us to watch it.""""Just conceits."" Ebert is smart enough to know that ""conceit"" is a literary-criticism term meaning, ""an elaborate, usually intellectually ingenious poetic comparison or image."" And of course he's accusing the movie-makers of conceit, too. Too clever by half. But, again, why ""just""? And if literary ingenuity is okay for a film critic, why is it out of place in a film?Ebert continues grinding the unlucky Slevin under his thumb: ""When a movie makes it clear that its characters are going through a charade for the amusement of the director (and when the characters themselves make it clear they all but know they are actors in a movie), I get restless: They're having such a good time with each other, why do they need me? Then when there's a level of trickery even beyond the apparent foolery -- reader, I feel like they're yanking my chain.""Wow. Actors, director, smarty-pants script writer  the whole merciless gang - yanking Roger's chain.As for me, I'm reminded of a Shakespeare article, ""'Hamlet,' Mirror for the Critics."" Its point was that criticism of a work reveals at least as much about the critics as it does about the work. Critics are a literary lot, perhaps vain of their own cleverness. Along comes a movie that reminds them of that common failing  We all think we're smart, right? And out come the knives, ready to carve that turkey in the mirror.I enjoyed ""Lucky Number Slevin.""

Good,"Dysfunctional families live in decaying shacks, without money or food. Violent dogs are barking everywhere. The only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationship between the leads. This is essentially a straightforward black comedy of errors. The body count climbs steadily as the movie progresses. Unfairly dismissed by some as confusing. The main characteristic of the film is the gloomy atmosphere, emphasizing the desolate hopelessness.

Thrilling detective movie,"Lucky Number Slevin is a thrilling detective movie is unlike any other I've seen. It will keep you guessing (as all detective movies do) but with such finesse and suspense which will keep you on the edge of your seat till the very end. The writing, directing and acting are excellent all around. As the main characters, Lucy Liu, Josh Hartnett and Bruce Willis turn in super performances. Although their roles are smaller, but important, Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman turn in the excellent performances expected of them. Likewise, the supporting character actors turn in very good performances. Except for a few minor flaws in the writing (deliberate, perhaps?), the plot, the pace, the drama, the relief are excellent. The photography of lower east side Manhattan as well as the towering, breathtaking, high rise, penthouse views of the super rich will be especially appreciated by New Yorkers and expatriates.

"Forget ""sub-par"" man. This is GREAT!","This movie was excellent! I usually guess endings of movies, but I was completely blown away by this one! Everything just came together so perfectly by the end of the movie. I was honestly blown away! I loved everything about this movie from the twists and turns to the ending line of Bruce Willis to Lucy Lu in general, to the patterned wallpaper displayed across every set. The dialogue was fast-paced and so was the action: i did not loose interest! Overall, You NEED to see this movie. I just want to hug everyone who was involved in making this movie.

"Courageous,  Audacious, Brash!","In the end the story is pretty basic, there isn't so much originality. Even the way the story is told is not something that has never-been- before-seen. What is amazing is the confidence and deftness with which we are steered through this tale.This confirms that it's not just the story but how you tell it- suspense, puzzles, loopholes that later become closed, mysteries that become solved...a masterful telling of a forgettable story and after seeing Wicker Park, i can say Paul McGuigan is a talent that can only get better.Bruce Willis- I can see why Shyamalan respects him so much...he embodies a character and makes it his own. Every other performance will always pale in comparison to his though Hartnett gets top marks for trying. Sir Ben is always like a ghost-actor in that he blends so well with his character that you don't see him only his character (he made such a believable Rabbi!) and Freeman's laid back style is ever so strong. Lucy Liu has come of age as an actress- top marks for interpreting such a surreal role.The cinematography is the most wonderful thing about this film, one scene literally took my breath away! and the camera angles are worked with such scientific precision. Some of the decor has to be commented upon as it blended so well with the story and I can truly say 10 out of 10 for lighting which was always enough and never too much.The story was courageous, audacious and brash and this is partly why this film could be pulled off not to mention the first rate cast! Altogether, a great Directing effort and a film worthy of Slevin out of ten.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
An underrated gem.,"I love it dearly. Witty, hilarious and incredibly compelling with top-notch performances from the entire cast. I had never been a fan of Josh Hartnett before seeing this film, but he perfectly creates this character and has my eyes glued to him the entire film. The twist is a jaw-dropper and really had me stunned. The entire story has this breezy, slick feel to it that's unlike anything I've ever seen in a film and is something I adore watching over and over.

Great Screenplay,"I've been studying screen writing by tearing apart screenplays while watching the movies. This is a terrific screenplay. It is almost too intricate at times because if you miss some of the dialogue you might miss part of the story. The only weakness it had was that I knew something was up with the Slevin character not being who he said he was because some of the dialogue wasn't logical (he wasn't behaving like someone who was terrified for his life). But that could be overlooked due to the great sets, acting, tempo, twists, and humor. Writing serious scenes with humorous dialogue is an art and I hope we see more movie scripts from Jason Smilovic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Tries too hard,"This is a film that has some style and isn't all bad by any means, but in the end it comes out looking like a mish mash of several Cohen Brothers films and The Usual Suspects. The cast do 'ok' but really everything about the film falls just short of being anywhere near that league.The script is lively in places, but tedious and too 'clever' in others, and much the same could be said for the storyline. The direction and sets are sometimes impressive, but somehow fail to create any really convincing atmosphere or suspense.I knew nothing about this film before watching it, but very early on its shortcomings were pretty clear. The 'tying up' of all the loose ends takes rather a long time, and doesn't leave enough mystery (and anyway by then none of it comes as any surprise).Better than your average dumb shoot'em up, but in the end it's a pale imitation of much better films.(Oh, and the plot is full of holes, but i'll be generous and say that most films of this type rely on a decent amount of disbelief suspension!)",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

One for the 'short bus',"Here we have a so-called thriller that tells us exactly what the conclusion will be in the first few minutes of the movie, and then painfully and tediously crawls to that conclusion as if some how we are supposed to be surprised.Worse, near the end, the director forces us to sit through the longest and most unnecessary explanation scene any movie of this genre has ever had. In words of one syllable, spoken loudly and slowly, the director provides a denouement longer than the combined length of all such scenes found in the complete collection of Scooby Doo cartoons. However, unlike the kids cartoon, 'Slevin' offers no intrigue or unexpected twists.Now, in the film 'Click', we know the very ending from early in the film as well, but that forms part of the purpose of the movie, because it is the journey that matters, and the lessons learnt by the 'hero' along the way. It is impossible to offer the same explanation for 'Slevin'.Instead, 'Slevin' offers sets that are pretty at first, but soon become tedious through absolute repetition. 'Slevin' offers dialogue that seems passable at first as a (very) poor man's attempt at 'clever', but soon becomes extremely tedious through very mechanical over use. Worse, unlike 'revenge' movies of the 70's that would often use very similar plots, the body of the movie contains no gratuitous thriller action. Watching paint dry would give you more of a thrill.To be honest, the beginning of the film convinced me that I was watching some kind of clever joke, with the transparent nature of the plot serving to set up the real story. I was left speechless by the end.Willis, Freeman and Kingsley are every bit as bad as one might expect in this kind of production. Hartnett and Liu are pleasing eye candy, but nothing else. The minor characters are VERY minor characters, though a couple, Missick and Williamson, come closest to some 'Tarantino'-style fun. Beyond the sets, the film is 'amateur hour' to the max.Will you like this movie? If 'Layer Cake' was a winner for you, go for it. If, on the other hand, 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' floated your boat, stay well away. I rate this film 3 only because it was quite easy on the eye.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Excellent and what's more, intelligent suspense movie.","Lucky Number Slevin  A case of mistaken identity lands Slevin (Josh Hartnett) into the middle of a war being plotted by two of the city's most rival crime bosses: The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley) and The Boss (Morgan Freeman). Slevin is under constant surveillance by relentless Detective Brikowski (Stanley Tucci) as well as the infamous assassin Goodkat (Bruce Willis) and finds himself having to hatch his own ingenious plot to get them before they get him.Wow! This is quite the clever movie. One of the things that attracted me was the dialogue. It is quirky, brainy and quick-witted. Josh Hartnett, who I enjoyed in the widely ignored Hollywood Homicide, delightfully displays this verbal black belt in karate that sadly does not extend to his physical fighting skills. He gets the crap beaten out of him quite frequently. He keeps the movie going with charm and our sympathy for his being in such a crappy situation. Anymore about him would be spoilers, but suffice to say it's very entertaining. Lucy Liu plays his love interest. Her scenes with him are about 10 times as entertaining as the entirety of Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. Though that doesn't say much at all, I grew to care about their relationship.Another thing I was quite grateful for was the presence of Morgan Freeman. His sultry voice is, for once, not acting as narrator or warm support to the lead. He plays one of the villains, and does so with silky menace. I was also glad to see Ben Kingsley in something of quality for a change. After Thunderbirds, Species and (ugh) BloodRayne, I thought he'd finally given up on doing anything worthy of his skills. He didn't have anything too too challenging to do, but I enjoyed his little monologue near the end. Bruce Willis is. Bruce Willis. If you like the persona he brings in his films (I enjoyed his young cop a little more than his old cop) this is it with a heavy mystique added. To be fair, he was a wild card and was completely unpredictable.Of course, completely unpredictable could be the name of this movie. Without revealing anything I can tell you that almost everything said and done comes out of left field. The story is so good and the exposition is skillfully prepared, (by director Paul McGuigan) so the lags are minimal and any confusion felt is momentary. If you like your suspense..suspenseful, than this is for you. My only real critique is that I can't imagine anyone would want to see the movie more than once. Also, if you're looking for any depth or greater meaning, aside form its layers, there is none. But it's an entertaining and what's more, intelligent movie. And that deserves notice.Lucky Number Slevin gets an B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
outstanding dark comedy,"""Slevin out of ten rating"" LOL WOW! I had never heard of this flick until it came on PPV and being a huge Morgan Freeman fan (my wife a Bruce Willis fan) we tuned in to watch. It was a superb offering, humorous, yet with a death toll that I'm sure rivals Scarface...and a twisting, turning storyline that is (IMO) very difficult to predict, but not to difficult to rationalize or follow as it unfolds. Pay close attention to the small flashback details as it allows a quicker clarity...BUT don't be upset if you miss some as they will all converge and focus at the climax of this very well written story...it's got one heck of a cast that lives up to or surpass usual expectations...I never cared much for Lucy Lui until watching this flick...What can you say about Morgan or Ben (That's SIR Ben...LOL) they are perfect for their respective roles. Josh plays his part to unbelievable excellence and Bruce, well he's Bruce, but justly so as Goodkat...gotta love him! Tucci is very convincing as a not so goody two shoes NYC cop and a very funny crew of henchmen with odd quirks that make them adorable in a macabre sense. This is the best movie I have seen in quite some time, especially considering the notoriety (or lack of)...I give it 2 thumbs up (your nose so your soda doesn't spray out your nostrils as the dark humor emits from the screen)",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Could of been so much better.,Lucky Number Slevin started off well with its mysterious beginning but as the film went on it took a big fall and didn't maintain its intriguing and slightly suspenseful storyline. The film became somewhat comedic which ruined the mysterious and thriller situation going on. Sometime later though the film was back on track and was hitting its peak. As the story unfolded and came away from the comedic side Lucky Number Slevin pulled it back with its fantastic twists and outcomes.This film could of been so much better if it didn't have that dip in performance but overall Lucky Number Slevin was a good film and definitely worth a watch.,6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"An exeptionally great movie, which is sadly not always recognized as such.","Lucky Number Slevin is definitely one of my favorite movies. It just has it all.Though I am not really familiar with the work of Paul McGuichan, he really impressed me with this movie. Besides all the mystery, excitement, bloodshed and action, there is also time for romance and subtle humor.The acting in the movie is superb. A mysterious Josh Hartnett and a playful and sexy Lucy Liu both demonstrate truly powerful acting performances which pull you into the movie and never let you go. Take those two for the leading roles, and complete the cast with celebrated actors like Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci and Ben Kingsley, and you have all the acting talent needed to make a truly great movie.Lucky Number Slevin is an amazingly intelligent movie that really keeps you guessing until it reaches its final parts. I have to say that it became a little confusing at some point, but when the movie evolves further, everything becomes perfectly clear. What a plot twist this movie has.

Unlucky at the Races,"Directed by Paul McGuigan and, ""Set in the New York underworld, where nothing is as it seems,"" according to the studio's official description, ""When down-on-his-luck Slevin (Josh Hartnett) stumbles into a running feud between the city's most feared crime bosses (Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley), he ignites an all-out war. Tracked by a mysterious assassin (Bruce Willis) and distracted by his flirtatious neighbor (Lucy Liu), Slevin must try to cheat death by turning the tables on the gangsters.""Here is a violent avenging gangsters-type drama, done in the non-linear style.Comparing itself (in promotional materials) to ""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Usual Suspects"", and ""North by Northwest""; this is a well written and produced film, which seeks to be much more than a copy. And, it almost works. Nicely shot, and creatively pieced together, the main revelation is satisfying; but, the film overextends with additional tricky contrivances. Admirers of Mr. Hartnett's sexy physique will enjoy seeing him spend much time wearing only a towel.

Don't let the title turn you off.,"The law of retaliation. It's the primary law that New York crime bosses live by, at least according to Lucky Number Slevin. Unfortunately for Josh ""Squinty-Eyed"" Hartnett, a case of mistaken identity drags him right into the middle of this law in motion.""Lucky Number Slevin? Come on, Johnny! That's the stupidest title ever! And Josh 'Wooden Boy' Hartnett?"" I know, I know. I thought the exact same thing when I originally heard the title. ""What kind of lame attempt at being clever through the use of a silly pun is this?"" I thought to myself. But the title actually makes sense within the context of the film. To say anymore would reveal too much of a major plot element, but it's a moment where you'll say, ""Ah, I get it now. OK, that's not so bad."" And seriously, I want you to use that exact quote so I don't look silly.""Too late!"" Gee, thanks. As for Hartnett, I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a charter member of his fan club. I typically hold him as the standard bearer when I need a reference point for listless, unemotional acting. But the guy gives it his sarcastic best here and delivers the most likable character I've seen him portray.It doesn't hurt that he's surrounded by a strong cast of actors playing a variety of entertaining, eccentric characters. Lucy Liu is cute and inquisitive. Bruce Willis is a hit-man who you truly believe is a stone cold killer. Morgan Freeman dares the audience to still like him considering the fact that he's a crime boss. And Ben Kingsley, after a huge slump of horrific movies (A Sound of Thunder, BloodRayne) finally gets quality material to work with.As much as I enjoyed the quirky characters, what really won me over is the movie's slightly complex and somewhat unpredictable plot. Following the nonlinear storytelling of Lock Stock-era Ritchie, Slevin sets up the basic premise and then the audience watches as the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. You may be able to figure out where everything is headed by the halfway point, but it's still fun to watch how it gets there.You may also be able to find a plot hole or two if you look hard enough, but I enjoyed the film too much to worry about such silly nitpicking. If you're one of those spoilsports who brings your industrial-sized nitpicker to every movie with you just so you can find things to complain about then just stay home and let everybody else watch it in peace.I can understand the argument that some of the dialogue feels a little contrived in an effort to appear clever, but it didn't bother me. I can recognize the humor in lines such as, ""Tell it to the one-legged man so he can bump it down the road,"" and character reactions to quotes like this reveal that it isn't written to be pretentious, just knowingly different.If you're looking for a recent comparison then I'd say Slevin has a similar feel to 2005's highly entertaining Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Though Slevin isn't as consistently funny, it employs a similar dark comedy style and I think it has the better story and more satisfying ending of the two.If you're not easily offended then you might want to check out Lucky Number Slevin. Be warned: there are a couple of quick, gratuitous sex scenes at the beginning of the movie that feel thrown in just for the sake of pleasing the ""perverted male"" demographic, but as far as style goes we need more movies like this that put forth a little extra effort to be cooler, more clever, and smarter than their peers.THE GISTIf you like movies with quirky characters and a complicated plot that requires you to willingly keep everything straight in your head as you follow along then Lucky Number Slevin certainly will entertain.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Where righting a wrong could mean doing wrong, even when you're right","Is this a thrilling comedy or a comedic thriller?There's a good cast here, with Freeman, Kingsley, Tucci and Willis doing their thing and in their usually competent manner. And, there's Josh Hartnett (whom I'd seen before in Black Hawk Down and Sin City) who takes on the role of Slevin  the wrong man in this narrative.Which is -- when all I said and done  a pure spoof of the gangster/crime genre and can be reviewed sensibly only from that perspective. But, it's not as bad or as good (depending upon your own point of view) as those spoofs that Leslie Nielsen (The Naked Gun etc) does in his sleep, practically.Quite simply, the story is stupendously stupid but, along the way, there are some very witty lines, some delicious ironic twists, and the usual run of bloody murders. So, it's all a lot of ""good"" fun, despite the rising body count and the almost total amorality of the characters  the exception being Lindsey (Lucy Liu) who tags along with Slevin and his problems. However, take away the comedy, change the narrative slightly, and you'd have a viable comparison to other recent gangster movies -- e.g. The Departed (2006), for one -- and a film noir contender. What a pity it wasn't done that way; it would have been a more gripping and more believable story  instead of a black comedy that was trying to be serious.Hence, as presented, the story is simply a framework upon which to hang different traps, pitfalls, and surprises for the delight (or frustration) of most viewers. Frankly, I nearly fell asleep in the first forty minutes (well, it was very late at night too, when I watched this one) and only perked up when the first surprise popped up. Sorry  can't say what it is, because that would spoil it for you, and the rest of the story. Bummer, huh?The production is slick  but I think it was done on the cheap (no crashed cars, trains, planes, etc and a minimum of sets)  the filming is competent, but the editing is a bit jerky. I loved the dialog, the verbal jousting, the innuendo and the lies that keep you guessing  or just totally confused. Whatever...Is it worth watching? Yes, simply to see how a lot of good actors make a bundle of money having a lot of fun. And, you might have a bit of fun along the way also.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Derivative and boring,"The dialogue was laughably bad, and the acting (from some of the best in the biz) was sub-par for the most part. I recognize this is a ""thriller"" and that doesn't always mean good dialogue, but there were far too many lengthy pseudo-intellectual scenes with no action to excuse bad dialogue. Oh, and of course, a chess game--the universal symbol for a complex sub-plot. I did enjoy Hartnett's character, but when I can see the end coming from a mile away it really takes a lot out of the movie for me. The ending was far too much like The Usual Suspects without being nearly as surprising or complex. If you see it free, like I did, it's not that bad, but don't waste money on it.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Something old, something new:  thoroughly entertaining","""So here's an audience's dilemma,"" a Hollywood Reporter piece on this movie goes. ""You know you've been had, but do you like it -- or not?"" 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Usual Suspects' obviously influenced the young Jason Smilovic. In his late teens when they appeared, he wrote the screenplay for 'Lucky Number Slevin' at twenty-three. He no doubt did know he'd been 'had' when he saw those and knew he 'liked it' -- well enough to want to do something in the same vein -- with a strong dash of gangster noir -- and stir his influences into a spicy stew that anticipates the bizarrely baroque plotting and heavy body counts of Park Chan-wook's Korean revenge fests.Maybe neither Jason Smilovic, nor Guy Richie acolyte Paul McGuigan, who directed, is quite as clever or as richly inventive as Tarantino or Park, but this movie brings together a cast that was as well entertained as we are. Does being conned really matter? Is it really ever any other way with crime stories that take the trouble to keep us guessing to the end? Is 'Pulp Fiction' anything but a complicated (and bizarrely silly) puzzle with amusing dialogue? Isn't 'The Usual Suspects' one of the biggest movie con jobs of recent memory? And don't a lot of the most classic noirs explain everything in frenzied talky dialogue at the end, just like this movie? In 'Lucky Number Slevin,' we're definitely misled from the earliest scenes in which we think we know what's going on. And before it's over, we're going to have to re-view some flashbacks and learn that they didn't play out the way we'd been led to believe the first time.Slevin is a story of mistaken identity (Slevin, Josh Hartnett, who people take for a shifty pal of his whose flat he's borrowing) and two warring crime lords The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley) holed up in facing towers. Slevin comes to stay at the big city flat of his pal; first, though, you've got this guy in a wheelchair, Bruce Willis with hair and porkpie hat, talking to a young man in an empty airport waiting area. He's talking about something called the ""Kansas City switch."" This movie is nothing but guys telling tricky tales like this, half joke, half explanation of stuff we haven't felt the need to have explained -- yet. McGuigan used Josh pretty well before in Wicker Park, but that didn't quite come off; it was an adaptation from a French movie that lost in translation. This time Josh is great, bumbling, bold, and charming, and adding a new edge to his smooth if limited repertoire of styles. This movie lets the ""victim"" (if he is that; who knows?) and the ""sleuth,"" Lindsey (Lucy Liu), Josh's friend's neighbor and a ditsy but lovable coroner, have a real romance going on and takes the time to develop that romance both in and out of bed, a nice change from recent movies that are so intense about their nasty business that their sweetness gets short shrift.So Slevin, Josh, gets mugged on the way from the airport to his friend's flat. Next he's in a towel, slung very low on his hips to show off his long torso, nursing a smashed-in nose and entertaining Lucy Liu, who's come over for a cup of sugar and stays on for sleuthing and romance -- because he gets his nose broken again by some of The Boss's goons, and Lucy Liu tries to figure out what's going on. What we learn is that The Rabbi has had The Boss's son killed by a professional assassin called Mr. Goodcat (Willis) and now The Boss wants to kill The Fairy (Yitzchok, Michael Rubenfeld), The Rabbi's son, and make Josh do it, because he thinks Josh is his shifty pal, who owes both gang lords a lot of money.Josh, that is Slevin, handles himself with such aplomb when dragged around in nothing but the towel, that you wonder. He says he has a condition that makes him never worry about anything. He's witty, and completely unafraid. His character is one of Smilovic's greatest achievements and a feather in the cap for Hartnett, whose light comedic skills seen in things like 'The Virgin Suicides' and 'Blow Dry' needed this extra dash of ultra-violence to give them punch. Lucy Liu is quite equal to his panache and adds a bright improvisatory flutter to her character.Freeman and Kingsley give intense, hammy performances that only actors of their caliber could carry off. Willis is adept though his part hasn't the range of his Butch in Pulp Fiction. Stanley Tucci comes into play as Brikowski, member of a cop team watching the gangsters who intervenes to try to find out who Slevin is. Who is this guy? They have no record of him. He doesn't exist for them.It's impossible to describe the story from there on, because that's when the surprises really begin. Like all shaggy dog-con job crime stories, this one goes way back in time, and the guy in the wheelchair in the airport waiting room in Scene One alluded to something twenty years ago.Contributing significantly to 'Lucky Number Slevin's' smooth style are the flashy camera moves of cinematographer Peter Sova and psychedelic interiors by François Seguin that underline the hall-of-mirrors nature of the plot.There may not be enough depth of conception or structure to make this the kind of cult movie you watch over and over to dissect; you'll watch it again, if you like it, for the zingy dialogue. Despite its unabashedly derivative nature, it has fresh twists, most notably its peculiar combination of revenge and romance. Hot or cold, revenge is always sweet but usually comes at a severe price. Not this time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Gambling, a Most Dangerous Pastime","Do you know those kinds of movies where you laugh but you want to do more than laugh, you're excited but you want to jump up and scream about it, you're surprised but you want to just tell everyone in the theater about how surprised you are, and it's so clever that you want to remember every single line so that you can hastily tell all of your friends the best scenes? This is the epitome of that movie. Its script is possibly one of the wittiest ever written. Its story is so tightly knit and full of perfect twists and surprises that the director so gracefully and steadily adjusts extremes in moods for, and the dialogue is so inspired and hilarious, so witty that David Mamet has finally run up against his true competition. The dialogue is so funny because of how literal and nitpicky the characters are with each other, so no matter what situation they may be in, they can suddenly happen into some silly semantics argument. The dialogue is full of clever non sequiturs and human notices and details that it blows most of the silly, pseudo-clever dialogue from other crime films in this vein. It's that type of script that, instead of making you think of who has influenced the work, makes you think that the writer has gone beyond a simple influence and created a style all his own.The direction of the film, while most people will surely say it's inspired by Tarantino, is very inventive and elegant, a bit reminiscent of De Palma if anybody, and the work of someone who is very much a master of mood swings, as the tone of the film swoops and shifts but never throws the movie out of balance for one second. Another thing that's very original and quirky about Lucky Number Slevin is that it is a field day for all minorities: There are black gangsters at war with Jewish gangsters, the boss of which has a gay son, there's an Asian heroine, and something for every other one. It goes out of its way to go against the grain but appeal greatly to gangster fans with expectations.The cast delivers some of the most absorbing and distinguished performances of their careers, especially Lucy Liu, who plays a character the filmmakers must've pathologically cast a completely contrary actress for, playing an eccentric, chipper kook, almost a cartoon, rather than the cold and intimidating dominatrix that's been the staple of her career. Male fanatics of the crime genre, of which there are many, won't be able to resist the idea of Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley both playing crime bosses in the same movie, and Bruce Willis playing assassin may be a bit deja vu-inducing but it cannot get tiring. I've never seen Josh Hartnett so entertaining, enjoying every second he has on screen.Lucky Number Slevin is a must-see for any fan of movies. It's a melting pot of pleasure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Slix Stlars,"Enteraining caper tries to pull a Usual Suspects, but comes across being a little suspect itself. While the movie flies along with assured direction, highlighted by the great cast and peppered with insightful dialog, Slevin definitely is the forerunner for this year's hip crime flick for the uninitiated. For all of it's witty reinvention , Slevin at times comes across as silly, shallow, and quite naive. Although one should suspend disbelief and just go along for the ride with a movie of this nature, too many ""revelatory"" moments in the film's final act sort of bog down the flow, trying a little too hard to shove that shock factor down our throats. Cast is fine, although they rarely achieve anything past the fundamentally cartoonish nature of these larger the life characters, an all too often used move in the world of threateningly entertaining capers catering to the young and hip. Make no mistake, Slevin is a good time to be had, especially if one is in the mood for a watered down Tarantino kind of night, but all of the hype surrounding the plot twists, while at it's best wickedly entertaining, does not really get past the self-importance, and slightly forced hip factor this fun movie sets out to capture.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Blood with doses of black humor,"Wow.This movie was smart, a brilliant script with lots of dose of black humor and with lots of blood like Tarantino movies.If you liked wicker pack you will love this movie as for me its even better.I like the direction of the film you can see some innovations and surely the director is experimenting more with the camera. Bruce Willis is excellent as the hit-man and gives a class to the film.I don't think that the film would be so good without him as he does make the perfect hit-man.Harnett is excellent, you can see that he is very talented and manage to confuse as until the last minute.Lucy Liu is a great actress I would love to see her more and in this film she is adorable.

Dire wannabe Tarantino/Ritchie  rubbish,"Please don't watch this film - its terrible! Doubtless, the very simple-minded will love this ""thriller"" which all begins to unravel when a horse ridiculously pulls up for no apparent reason in a race-flashback sequence. When we're introduced to Hartnetts character the film thinks its a smart-ass goofball comedy, but tries to switch into a serious Guy Ritchie style caper with the most ridiculous plot twists and turns you could imagine. By the time they're revealed you'll have stopped caring anyway. Stupid boring dialogue, unfunny gags, so much borderline plagiarism it's ridiculous. It's a relief that some influential critics from some esteemed organizations (BBC, The Guardian etc.) have highlighted how weak this film is.Now allow me to elaborate on my 'wannabe Tarantino/Ritchie' and 'borderlne plagiarism' comments with some examples; the business of the watch passed from father to son (Pulp Fiction), the inconsequential dialogue referencing other films (Pulp Fiction), the James Bond dialogue and Connery impersonations (Trainspotting), the casting of Bruce Willis and Robert Forster (Pulp Fiction & Jackie Brown), Willis shoots with handguns in both hands (Reservoir Dogs), the comic pairs of hit men (Pulp Fiction, Snatch, Lock Stock...), victims shot through a car windscreen (Reservoir Dogs). I could go on. Its a fair point that even Tarantino borrows from other films but not as clumsily as in this case. Director McGuigan and writer Smilovic should be banned from making movies forever. So much about this film that makes no sense at all. It really is utter nonsense. The amount of rubbish they try to make you believe is insulting. If you'd like to see a more intelligent crime piece, many TV channels show Scooby-Doo re-runs. I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this but now I can save others. You can too.

A Lucky Pick,"I had some free time on my hands today, so I decided to hit the theater. I was in the mood to laugh at something, and was split between watching The Benchwarmers or Lucky Number Slevin. According to their trailers, they're both comedies. Being that Lucky Number Slevin had gun-play in its trailer and The Bench Warmers had Rob Schneider, I chose Lucky Number Slevin. Lucky for me.Lucky Number Slevin was one of the best films I've seen in a long time. It had action, comedy, drama, suspense, and lots and lots of thrills. At first, I thought I was watching a dark comedy but soon realized it was much more. The story focuses on this guy named Slevin who happens to be REALLY funny, but unfortunately has the worst luck ever. After losing his job and his girlfriend, Slevin (Josh Hartnett) decides to visit his friend Nick Fisher in New York. Upon arriving, he's mistaken for Nick, who happens to owe a lot of money to 2 rival crime mob bosses, The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley).After being roughed up by both The Boss's and The Rabbi's goons and forced to do favors for both bosses in order to pay off Nick's debts, Slevin finds himself under constant surveillance by a relentless Detective named Brikowski (Stanley Tucci) and unknowingly manipulated by a world class assassin simply known as Goodkat (Bruce Willis). Caught in the middle of a mob war and hounded by the police and a deadly assassin, Slevin soon comes to the realization that he'll have to do some pretty horrible things if he wishes to stay alive and out of a jail cell, especially if he ever wants to see Nick's neighbor Lindsey (Lucy Liu) again, who he meets amongst the chaos and falls deeply in love with.From a dark comedy, to a suspenseful thriller, the transition goes quite smoothly, especially if you pay attention to the beginning of the film. The story has many twists and turns and can be predictable at times, but it's actually for the better. If it had turned out any differently, the ending wouldn't be as powerfully moving. Besides the story, the acting and the camera work are excellent. The entire cast is incredible, as well as the writer and director. My only complaint with the film was a blooper involving a gunshot which at first was loud and then, when shown the second time later on, was silenced due to a silencer on the gun. Other than that, every thing else involving the production was perfect. To sum it up, the film was very gory, very realistic, and basically, very well executed all around.As for the story, it's really great and to sum it up, it's a well written dark comedy that quickly turns into a suspenseful thriller. For fear of completely ruining the film's awesome story for you guys, I can't say much more, except that the film goes from a suspenseful thriller to something else, something much darker. The ending will have you in tears, with a big smile on your face and desperately hoping for a sequel. For fans of gangster films, spy flicks, and crime stories this film is for you. It has it all, interesting characters that will make you laugh as well as cry and action and suspense that'll have you on the edge of your seat. However, even if you're not a huge action, suspense, thriller fan, you'll find Lucky Number Slevin's story heartfelt and quite heartwarming, not to mention very funny at times. The bottom line, for fans of good film and for anyone else who wants to be entertained for 2 hours, Lucky Number Slevin is your lucky number.GO AND SEE THIS FILM, NOW!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Chaos, surprise, great cast, great movie!","In one year, only two or three movies can be truly marked as 10 out of 10. So you wait and you wait for them, watching countless others, some good, and some bad. But all that waiting is worth it when you stumble upon this kind of movies. Like Lucky Number Slevin. Yes, this is truly and sincerely a 10 out of 10 piece. Saw it twice in a row tonight, that's how great it is.It's not just the great acting, the seemingly chaotic plot which turns me and the almost total impossibility of predicting what will happen next. No. It's not only that. There's even more to it. There are surprises. What's bigger and better than an unpredictable movie? A surprising movie! And this one certainly is surprising.The soundtrack is also good and fits the movie very well. And in the end, when things start to fit together you get that excellent satisfaction feeling, which is however even then, shadowed by the prospect of the gruesome ending. But enough said, since I refuse to get in the action of the movie. You will have to discover that by yourself because I simply cannot bare to deprive you of such pleasure!

I liked it... good cast list.,"LUCKY NUMBER SLEVINIt was quite good. All the way through the film, it seems Levin is in the wrong place at the wrong time. He is quite possibly the unluckiest person in the world... He loses his job, his house gets renovated, he finds his girlfriend in bed with another man, he gets mugged, his friend goes missing, he gets kidnapped as he is mistaken for his friend and is told he owes a gangster $95,000... then he gets kidnapped again and finds out he has to pay another gangster $35,000... all in one day!What a bad day or is it?This film stars Josh Hartnett as Slevin. He meets a girl who wants to help him and she is played by Lucy Liu. The gang bosses are played by Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. There is also a hit-man in the movie played by Bruce Willis. The whole cast is very good. Everyone does a great job... But I have to say, my favourite character is a guy named Sloe. Sloe is a meathead played by Mykelti Williamson. He was not in the movie much, but when he was on screen, he was so funny.There are some funny moments in the film and some twists that I was not expecting. But then there were some twists that I saw coming a mile away.This film is entertaining all the way through... and well worth a watch if you have not seen it.I will give it 7 out of 10.Disagree?

"High octane action, sleek script, but not quite Tarantino","There's really nothing much to complain about when it comes to this film. It's absolutely, unfailingly entertaining and rewarding by the minute. With great action scenes, high tension, an intricate and clever plot, great dialogue and a superb all-star cast that includes Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett, Lucy Liu, Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman and Stanley Tucci, Lucky Number Slevin is a true pleasure, and for fans of directors Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, it's practically too good to miss.Therein lies the film's problem  it tries a bit too hard to imitate Tarantino and to a lesser extent Ritchie as well, and in the process it loses something of its own voice. It seems that McGuigan actively tried to create a cult film, and to a certain extent he gets the job done; Lucky Number Slevin has some very memorable characters and some highly quotable lines of dialogue. In the end, though, it's just not quite memorable enough to carry that weight. It's a very impressive directorial debut, no doubt, but it has neither the soul of Reservoir Dogs nor the energy of Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels. In trying too hard to be cool and sleek McGuigan forgot that he has a voice of his own, and the film lacks a bit in soul and feel.Still, it's lots of fun, and certainly stands on par with a lesser Tarantino work  True Romance (Tarantino's script) immediately comes to mind. Lucky Number Slevin doesn't have the spark, the inventiveness and the cultural awareness that make Tarantino great and unique, but it never gets dull, and never loses its perfect pace. The storyline may be far-fetched but it works, and the twist ending is both surprising and satisfying; and killer performances from three key figures  Willis, Freeman and Kingsley  make the fast, tongue-in-cheek, witty dialogue an extreme pleasure. Lucky Number Slevin is not to be taken all too seriously  it's basically a crime thriller, to be taken more or less at face value, and despite the constant Tarantino comparisons it has nothing of the cultural and artistic statement of Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill. For fans of the genre though, and for anyone looking for an evening of pure entertainment, you can't miss with this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"loved this film, fantastic display offering extremes of both emotions, made me laugh and cry- fantastic","I really enjoyed this film. Indeed, I thought it was a brilliant mix of several recent (and not so recent) films which didn't quite cut it, as they did not contain or offer the scope that this film manages to achieve.The film begins with a fantastic contrast, the juxtaposition of some wonderfully graphic and deliberately hard-hitting violent scenes, which are very well filmed and definitely succeed in starting the film with a shock; contrasted with a fantastic cocky humour on the part of Slevin (Josh Hartnett), which sets the tone for this character throughout the film. I found myself recalling the almost poetic and semi-philosophical attitude and tone prevalent in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, which I loved; in the character of Slevin (unfortunately kkbb lacks the substance that Lucky Number Slevin has in abundance). The graphic murders are carried out wonderfully, and can almost provoke tears, and definitely leave a lump in the throat of the hardiest movie-goer, making Munich look positively tame. However, a few moments later your spirits are uplifted by literally laugh-out-loud humour. This film is also exceptionally stylish, sticking loyally to one 'look' throughout, in a fashion that reminded me of The Aviator. Far from that film's early Technicolour glory, Lucky Number Slevin is a fantastic display of seventies retro- at one point I was unsure if it was indeed set in the seventies, it could be, however this is simply the style of the film, one of the chicest displays of cinematic fireworks I have ever seen.Throughout the plot, there are some elements which one may have to consider artistic licence. At several points I began to think that maybe one or two details in the storyline would not come to play quite as they did in 'cinemaland', however provided one is willing to allow a degree of artistic licence to this film, often simply to the extent of offering it the benefit of the doubt, it becomes a masterpiece. Well developed and thought out characters, especially Josh Hartnett's, manage to pull off the sometimes spurious plot line with ease.Throughout, especially at the beginning, there are various scenes which do not particularly link to the action taking place, which leave the viewer feeling dazed and unsure of their relevance- however, this all becomes clear, when the storyline is explained towards the end, clearly illustrating what has happened and how the scenes the viewer saw all link together in a truly ingenious fashion. Revelations towards the end totally change the way we look at several of the main characters: good guys become bad guys, the innocent bystander becomes the premeditated assassin, the premeditated assassin becomes the charitable old man, and our perceptions of love and hate within this film are turned on their head, all executed ingeniously within a very stylish, emotive and humorous backdrop. Loved it. A high eight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Leisurely paced, smart, off-the-wall thriller","I was initially wary of this movie because of the awful trailer that made it look like an unoriginal clone of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". Why are American trailers so damn formulaic? They rarely capture the tone, feel or sensibility of what they're selling. The ""Inside Man"" trailer missed the boat also. It did not capture the feel of the movie. It's like everything is being jammed into a template that some idiot once thought had value.""Lucky Number Slevin"", at least tonally, has more in common with Bryan Singer's ""The Usual Suspects"" than a Guy Ritchie film. It has a deceivingly languid pace as it sets up its protagonist (Josh Hartnett) and introduces the enigmatic Goodkat (Bruce Willis), surely one of the silver screen's most memorable denizens of late. The plot, which I won't detail here (nothing more boring than a long plot synopsis!), involves an ongoing feud between Ben Kingsley's ""The Rabbi"" and Morgan Freeman's ""The Boss"". Hartnett is sucked into their feud and is forced to use his wits to extract himself. Lucy Liu, looking mighty sexy and playing a coroner, offers him assistance and a warm vagina.Naturally, nothing ends up being what it first appears, so that's the beauty of the exercise. Director Paul McGuigan, who helmed ""Gangster Number One"", brings a wry style and pitch to the drama, and, working with a really fine score by Joshua Ralph, creates a cinematic jigsaw that feels finely nurtured. The action scenes are swift and gloriously bloody, the performers all have fun (Kingsley is a standout), and the relentless plot revelations, though predictable in a genre context, never feel lazy.The film did not perform any great feats at the box office, and I'd like to attribute some blame for that to the studio's trailer department. Dropping yet another fast-paced, graphic-heavy, ear-splitting piece of crap on the unsuspecting public didn't do this leisurely paced, smart, off-the-wall, unexpectedly dry thriller any favors.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Weak plot and characters,"I'm not really sure what all the hype is about this movie. Sure it has a fantastic cast, but everyone is phoning in their performances on a weak script and cashing their checks.The whole Boss/Rabbi feud isn't fully vested and it's explanation is weak. No one explains how they came into power in the first place, a nagging itch that's never scratched. The James Bond references were ridiculous and unnecessary. Lucy Liu seemed to think that talking fast is the same as actually acting out her part. The cop's involvement with the Boss and the Rabbi is never fleshed out either.Bottom line: this movie plays up the sadness and intensity in the beginning and expects us to get sucked into the revenge theme without giving us motive for anyone but Slevin. This feels like just the summary instead of an actual film.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Pretty enjoyable I thought,"OK, so this isn't a downright classic movie, but I felt it was pretty enjoyable. I was a little hesitant in seeing this flick and the main reason for that was Josh Harnett being the leading man, but he surprised me in being quite strong in that role.Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsly are obviously great in the supporting roles as the feuding gangsters while Bruce Willis is the usual stone face monotone voice guy he is in most of his movies now.I think that this movie will attract a lot of criticism due to the obvious fact that it thinks that it thinks it is a lot more clever than it actually is. A lot of comparisons have already been made to Revolver and this is probably a weaker film as it is not as clever.Overall though, I enjoyed this and would recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Smooth,"Yet another one of those hypercool crime movies, this one's variation is that it actually has a good plot, apart from something happens somewhere and then all the story lines intertwine. They still decided to keep the whole talking in one-liners thing though, and it's not working out here. Neither does the obligatory pseudo-philosophy. I can't say it's all that poorly written, but it just seems really out of place for some reason. Perhaps I'm just sick of directors trying to be Tarantino and having people talk in a way nobody talks. Then again, it could be the unconvincing delivery, Josh Hartnett is no well, he's not much of anyone. When Morgan Freeman gets his podium for a pointless monologue, it just sucks less. No need to be negative though, this movie is still quite good. The pace is pretty smooth, for once I even enjoyed the camera going everywhere because it fit the atmosphere. And as I said, the plot is really good and not that easy to figure out, which surprised me. It's one of the better attempts.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Quite possibly one of the most complete and finest movies ever made...,".. and I mean that. I remember watching the previews for this movie and expecting some sort of crime caper in the spirit of the movie, ""Confidence"". How wrong I was. This is a movie for those who loved flicks like, ""The Usual Suspects"". Yea. It's beyond THAT good.The film centers around two mob bosses (Morgan Freeman as 'the Boss') and Ben Kingsley as 'the Rabbi), a world class hit-man (Willis), a New York City Cop (Tucci), a cute/talkative neighbor (Lucy Lui), and an unlucky loser named Slevin (Hartnett in his best performance to date).I am not going to go into it anymore than this. I could go on and on about reason's why, but to be flat honest I would be doing you a disservice. I will never understand Hollywood and why films of this standard are NEVER properly recognized. Like I stated in the opening, I think it was marketed ALL wrong. Kinda of like True Romance when it first came out, it just didn't find it's audience in theaters because like always the wrong people are telling us what we want to watch.This is easily one of the best movie going experiences I have ever had. It's one of those that you watch as soon as its over. I swear goes right back to the start and you watch it again.

Lucy Liu and Josh Hartnett,"They seem like somewhat of an unlikely pair. Obviously, he looked slightly younger than her when they met. But despite that, both acted good in the movie. But I can't say the exact same for the plot.I enjoyed some of the twists, although the last two or three I kind of expected as I slowly pieced together the beginning scenes and made sense of it for the rest of the movie. It took a little bit of time for it to sink in for what was going on. Many films, when they try this sort of thing, usually don't tie everything together. But this one did.However, the camera-work was kind of weak. The somewhat constant skipping ahead slightly during the scene was slightly bothersome at some times. Plus, I kind of wished the characters were developed more.I was glad with the deaths that were inflicted and all the killings seemed thought-out. The music throughout the movie was not on far with what was happening sometimes and that got to me a little.Overall, its not a bad film. If you don't mind piecing together a movie with deaths like this, then its your cup of tea. The music, direction, and camera-work were not as great as they could be. As a result, it doesn't get the grade it could have got with a better director. The director was just bad. ""B-""",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
There was a time...,"Paul McGuigan is an enormously talented man. His film before ""Lucky Number Slevin"", ""Wicker Park"" was jumping around in style and intensity; and in everything: performances, camera use, intelligent writing. These three things in special repeat themselves in ""Lucky Number Slevin"", where McGuigan got some really professional actors that couldn't do much (Ben Kingsley and Stanley Tucci) and others that had a blast (Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis). But it's difficult to sit down and appreciate performances in this film; it goes faster than ""Wicker Park"".Again, the director brought Josh Hartnett for the main role, and again he puts the young actor in the wrong place at the wrong time. To say that ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a story about a guy in that situation above mentioned would be fair enough; because telling the rest is spoiling it for the viewer. At times, you can't take your eyes off of the screen, but there were moments where I honestly felt a little tired.It would be unfair to blame Jason Smilovic's script for this, but he throws a lot of things in and the movie is just above one hundred minutes. And I've been thinking if the movie would have been better with more detail and pauses so we could really understand and study the characters, but I say noBecause this is how McGuigan works, and here Peter Sova's cinematography and Andrew Hulme's edition are better than ever; with challenging close ups, imaginative shots, beautiful quick cuts and a solid use of flashbacks.The movie requires flashbacks because it's a mess, but it's a nice mess. An intelligent mess with avoidance (and also mocking) of the clichés all the way through, with intelligent movie references and an unexpected resolution you only see coming when you have to. Is it too intelligent for its own good? I really don't know, because it doesn't just put a lot of words and some action so we get distracted; it focuses completely on the words and conversations of the characters. Yes, we don't remember some characters and they're not really developed, but the script asks questions about things we've seen some minutes agoIt goes back on the story; it wants to know if we're really paying attention.I never stopped paying attention because of what I said before, because McGuigan's way of capturing a city's feeling, because of J. Ralph's exhilarating score and also because the actors' faces. Morgan Freeman's face demands attention and, believe it, also does Josh Hartnett's. Both of them take the film to high levels, while Bruce Willis makes a great narrator but a not so great player in person. In other words, it's his voice and not his face that demands attention.The good thing is that you want to see the movie again when it's over, because you feel like you've missed a lot; just like it happened to me with ""Wicker Park"", which was a remakeThis is an original. The good thing is that you'll never forget about something called ""The Kansas City Shuffle"". The bad thing is that Paul McGuigan can make a great movie, but ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is not it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Hitchcock, Tarantino, Besson and Ritchie at a bar after 2 a.m.","I got the impression the film was a homage to Alfred Hitchock's work, when I saw the trailer to ""Lucky Number Slevin"". When I saw the film, I was right, but it also had some dashes of Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and Luc Besson, making it a fun, crackerjack crime drama.A series of violent killings starts the ball rolling, then calms down to a tale, told by a ""quiet before the storm"" hit-man, Mr. Goodkat (a dapper Bruce Willis) to a non-assuming fellow in an airport terminal. The tale involves the execution of a middle-lower class family (wife, husband, son) after the father makes a bad bet on a racing horse.Fast forward to Slevin (handsome Josh Hartnett, who rescues himself from the future acting troupe of the CW network), a jobless, robbery victim slacker who's visiting his friend in New York City. The friend's missing, but Slevin rests his laurels in his bud's apartment. Problem: Slevin's mistaken for the friend by two warring crime lords, the Boss (Oscar holder Morgan Freeman, who plays against type) and the Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley, another Oscar holder, who acts a wiser version of his Don Logan role from ""Sexy Beast""). Thinking he's ""Nick Fisher"", both men want cash from Slevin or else, but things here aren't straight-forward, let alone the truth.Director Paul McGuigan (he worked with Hartnett on ""Wicker Park"") has fun with the script by Jason Smilovic (the TV shows ""Karen Sisco"" and ""Kidnapped""), noting that events of a mystery are better solved when not looking at them too closely, taking some steps back. Some have said the film's too clever for its' own good, trying to be another ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""The Usual Suspects"", but with expendable fare like ""Step Up"" and ""John Tucker Must Die"" infesting movie houses, ""Slevin"" has to be clever to separate itself from the muck.The cast is game, especially the spunky Lucy Liu as a good-hearted medical examiner who befriends Slevin. It's so nice to see her in a non-Kung Fu role (yet ""Kill Bill vol. 1"" was fun), she's a goddess in black, high-heeled boots and a sweater and she shows potential to be in a Kevin Smith comedy.Other cast members include Stanley Tucci (The Devil Wears Prada, Big Night) as a hard-boiled cop; Mykelti T. Williamson (Forrest Gump, ATL) as one of the Boss's goons; Danny Aiello (Do The Right Thing, 29th Street) as a bookie and Robert Forster (Jackie Brown, Alligator) as another cop who solves the mystery from afar. I can't tell you about the conclusion. It's too good for words.In a medium filled with computer-animated bubblegum jars and shallow adolescent mirrors that amaze the moronity of moviegoers, ""Slevin"" is nicely and unashamedly smart and adult, hearkening back to the films from the 1930s to the 1970s. Make this film your lucky number.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Yeah,This was good. I like Josh Hartnett's character. The story goes along. Gets boring by the end. It was fun to watch the ending twist.I think this was one of Josh Harnett's best characters.

Well worth watching,"Well... This must be one of the funniest ""what-just-happened?!?!"" movies that I've seen lately... It begins somewhat confusing and for about half of the movie lenght it's kept that way... Slevin keeps getting mistaken with some other guy and getting himself punched around due to his big-mouth (""I suppose your mouth got you that nose...""). Then there are two characters that will have you raising your eyebrow: The Boss (Morgan Freeman), that first shows up in front of a dumbfounded Slevin, talking some nonsense about Shmoo, and the Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley), that is, YOU GUESSED IT, a Rabbi... Yeah.. and also a gangster... The cherry on top of the cream (those wacky characters) is Slevin's/Nick's somewhat crazy neighbour (Lucy Liu), that seems like a ""Lucy Liu-type"" Ally McBeal, always nervous, fast talking and intent on solving the ""Big Mystery""... Well... If I kept going on, I'd eventually spoil the movie, one way or another, so let me rest here...Oh... and by the way, the soundtrack and filming is absolutely wonderful... The songs seem to fit in with the scenes' mood and the way these scenes are filmed give precisely the feeling the director wants us to feel: fast paced, if it was meant to fast paced; calm, descriptive, if it's a story-telling sequence...Hope this was somewhat useful to you; it's my first review...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Good but not GREAT. Early Summer Movie.,"7.5 out of 10 I thought this movie was good but not great. In the beginning it kicks off a little strange. Your thrown for a loop and if you reach down for some popcorn you could miss a crucial part of the movie.The acting in the movie was good, I mean typical. There weren't very many diverse, difficult, emotional roles to play. There is just your typical movie villains / mob bosses / assassins that you would see in any other movie, only that they are well know expensive ones (ie. Bruce Willis).The movie does have a twist here and there and eventually all the turmoil makes sense but the twist doesn't leave you speechless like an M. Night Shamalan movie would. It is predictably unpredictable as like most new movies out there. I think I might dip back into my old VHS's again to find something great to watch.

An amazing movie for those who pay attention and can follow it.,"I have watched this movie more times than I can count and it is fantastic. The first watch is a special experience for anyone that enjoys a good twist in their movies.

Movie with cinephile conversations,"I enjoy re-watching movies, half-forgotten, since somewhere in the middle of the screen time, my heart sometimes gets stuck with a sweet presentiment - a memory, and this very nerve-teasing uncertainty gives the viewing a special charm.
Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman are busy in their typical roles. Lucy Liu looks pacifying in her schoolgirl skirt as she sits in the kitchen and painstakingly spreads another peanut butter sandwich, gracefully constructing various detective hypotheses - apparently, it was after this role that Lucy Liu was taken to unravel the puzzles for the position of Dr. Watson in the series ""Elementary"".

One of the most mind boggling plots in film history,"Without a doubt, Lucky Number Slevin is one of the most complex movies ever. This is both good and bad. On the plus side, it absorbs and enthrals you. With so many twists, it is very hard to get your mind around what is actually happening. On the other hand, this is a film that is far too complicated to be a classic - it tries too hard to confuse the audience, and you come out at the end in a daze as to what the conclusion was. If you are someone who likes to watch movies where you don't have to think about what's happening, steer clear of this one. On a more positive note, the film is packed with stars giving five star performances. Josh Hartnett is very well appointed as Slevin, Lucy Liu is in inspired form as his sidekick, while Bruce Willis is in uber-cool mode as the Goodkat. He is the best character in the movie, and the scene in which he shoots two guards coming through a fake wall is sensational. Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley did well in their roles also. Overall, a good film with some great scenes - but not a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Genuinely entertaining movie,"I saw about 3 previews for this movie on TV before it came out and i debated whether to go see it because it looked like one of those movies that could be pretty good but just as easily been really bad.

The story lines were very well done, the acting was pretty good and it was just a good story. I also like movies with a particular style, like when you know that someone made it their own, like tarantinos movies, and jim jarmusch's movies. And i felt a great amount of special style in this movie. I really hope this director continues to make his movies his way.Lucky Number Slevin was just an all around enjoyable movie to watch, and you'll definitely find yourself watching it more than once.

A Brilliant Display of Plot and Direction,"Lucky Number Slevin, directed by Paul McGuigan and written by Jason Smilovic, is a compelling crime thriller that blends elements of dark humor, intense action, and clever twists. The film stands out not only for its intricate, often unpredictable plot but also for its smart direction, which keeps the audience engaged and continually guessing. The movie is a masterclass in balancing a complex narrative with visual storytelling, and its success can be attributed to both the sharp screenplay and the meticulous direction.The Plot: A Maze of Twists and Turns
The plot of Lucky Number Slevin is a puzzle, a masterwork of misdirection and intricate layers. The film opens with an unassuming protagonist, Slevin Kelevra (played by Josh Hartnett), who finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Mistakenly identified as a man named ""Kenny,"" Slevin becomes entangled in a violent mob war between two powerful crime lords: the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley) and the Boss (Morgan Freeman). In a world full of deception, betrayal, and revenge, Slevin quickly realizes that survival requires him to outwit everyone around him.The genius of the plot lies in its complexity and how it presents characters and events in a way that forces the audience to constantly reassess their understanding of what's happening. Early on, viewers are given the sense that they are in control, able to predict where the story is going. But as the narrative unfolds, with each reveal and twist, those assumptions are turned upside down. What initially appears to be a straightforward tale of a man caught in a mob conflict evolves into something far more intricate, with themes of fate, justice, and vengeance at its core.Jason Smilovic's screenplay is exceptional in how it interweaves various plot points, creating a narrative that demands the audience's full attention. Nothing is as it seems in Lucky Number Slevin. The unexpected developments and clever misdirection keep the viewer on the edge of their seat, making the eventual reveal deeply satisfying.Direction: A Stylish, Precise Approach
Paul McGuigan's direction plays a vital role in translating Smilovic's script into a compelling cinematic experience. McGuigan manages to create a visual style that complements the film's tone-sleek, stylish, and laced with a sense of foreboding. The pacing is another strength of the direction. McGuigan doesn't rush through the events; instead, he allows the tension to build gradually, creating a palpable atmosphere of suspense. The director's choice of framing and use of color contributes to the film's sense of intrigue, giving it a noir-like aesthetic that complements the morally ambiguous world the characters inhabit.The film also plays with the concept of perspective. McGuigan uses editing and camera angles to reflect the shifting nature of the plot. There are moments when the audience sees things from Slevin's point of view, emphasizing his confusion and sense of being out of control, and moments where the camera seems to omnisciently observe the larger web of lies and deception. This blending of perspectives allows the film to mirror its own central theme: that nothing is ever truly what it seems.Another crucial element of McGuigan's direction is his ability to handle the film's dark humor. The script is full of witty one-liners, clever dialogue, and moments of absurdity, but McGuigan ensures these moments don't undercut the seriousness of the narrative. Instead, they offer a welcome breather from the tension and add depth to the characters. This tonal balance-between suspense and humor, between lighthearted moments and dark, grim undertones-is difficult to achieve, but McGuigan does so with ease.The performances are also worth noting. Josh Hartnett, in the lead role, delivers a standout performance as Slevin. His portrayal of a man forced into a dangerous situation is both relatable and captivating. Meanwhile, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley bring gravitas to their roles as the two warring mob bosses, creating characters that are as menacing as they are enigmatic. The supporting cast, which includes Bruce Willis as a mysterious hitman, further enhances the film's appeal, with each actor contributing to the overall sense of intrigue and unpredictability.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"""It is never late to revenge ten years later""","Actually, the secret behind the story is not so hard to guess. So it is not very impressive to me. However, maybe the last thing I can talk about is the story. All the gang films have the same feature I mean almost all, there will be always a guy who can draw nobody's eyes putting the trigger, and every time they will plot a perfect revenge plan, of course some of them will fail. The reason why I said the story is not good enough is because I guess the whole trick the boy plays, the only thing I missed is Bruce Willice is on his side. After that I made my mind clear and found that actually the guy Bruce plays can be anyone, even he can stand on the opposite side against the boy, it is acceptable. If the plot was like that we can just watch one more gun fight. However when I took a second thinking about it I found I destroyed the integrity of the story. Here we go, if it is not Bruce, Selvin would not get a chance meeting the boss of the gangs, so he cannot get close to his foes. So thinking like this everything makes sense.I don't know why, it is just a feeling that something is not perfect, I mean I cannot find where making me feel that this film is not a perfect one. Usually, when i saw a master piece, I can feel a strong exciting making me emotional even feel shivering or burst into tears sometime. But for this one it just finished nothing special nothing familiar happened. Also I found the leading actress is totally unnecessary in this movie, maybe without her we can feel more tense moment which I think can make this film better. Anyway, actors in the movie did a good job, also they are all very famous. One more thing this is still a creative story although I got almost everything before the truth told.

Lucky Number Slevin - A Review,"A fantastic fast paced movie which has more twists and turns than the usual thriller. Newcomers to Josh Hartnett will not be disappointed as he comes across as a truly multi faceted actor of some note. Bruce Willis puts in the usual moody brooding role he is so good at,but in this instance adds a little more with his hit-man with a heart character. And Lucy Liu puts in a great performance as the wacky but very sexy neighbour with a Columbo type brain who's always got a theory. The plot is fast and furious but unravels at just the right time to keep you more than interested.This is not the film for you if you watch movies in two or more sittings, but its well worth sticking with.

Lucky Number Slevin (2006),"One word (OK, two) to describe this film: ""super convenient"". Everyone is way too connected and all events are way too convenient, with the twists being over the top and just not making sense even more. The twist in the ending is simply stupid, unlikeable and sugary, existing to please the audience. There's also a strong feel of everything being staged on the scene, the sense of the very script. And of course there are many usual tropes and predictable events, during the watching I was saying what will be coming next - and there it was, like I said.It's still a quality Hollywood movie: great filming, great acting, and especially the great editing. It's also not dragging, despite being almost a two hour movie. By the time it was over I thought the movie was about 56 min in and there's something more.However, nevermind the tired tropes and ridiculous twists, the most surprising thing about this movie is the inclusion of O Yujki Conjugate track in the soundtrack which has about five songs. OYC it's an obscure ambient British band and how their track ended up in a Hollywood movie with first class actors is truly a mystery, especially considering the low number of music tracks used.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Please, enough already!!","I, as a real fan of almost all genres of movies (except for horrors, and stupid teen comedies), I am sick of hearing why you people give your negative, pessimistic reviews of movies you most likely knew in advance, that you would not like anyway. You start watching the movie with a darn pessimistic screwed up attitude, thinking that Tarantino is the damn greatest director, and if he is not making the movie, it will definitely suck!!! You don't have to tell me that I am darn close on this. I have close friends that are that way, and they, as well as you all, have your right to your opinion. But some of you, really like to shove your opinions down the throats of others, for you believe your words are gospel. In this movie, you have not 1, not 2, but 3 of the greatest actors in this world. Morgan Freeman by far, is one of the most respected actors of Hollywood. That man can sit in front of 200,000 general people, and read a local phone book, and he will have every one of their undivided attention. Sir Bill Kingsley, to me is very underrated. You need to see, ""Searching for Bobby Fisher"" if that is you can watch it, there is no nudity, nor stupid comedy, such as someone running into a bus on a bicycle, or a bunch of wet T-shirt bimbos running around. Then, of course there is Bruce Willis. I need not to say much about the man, that darn near all red blooded Americans know already. Then there is the very up, and coming Josh Hartnett. I imagine all hormonal females loved the towel thing. The part I admired the most -- had to be the part played by Lucy Liu. I was not a big fan of Lucy Liu, until I seen her play this part. Why? I don't care for the roles she had played previously; which were almost all Miss Betsy Badass........so damn passé of today.....yawn. In Lucky # Slevin, she plays a human female, with real emotions. She was cute, warm, funny, and entertaining. Next, was Stanley Tucci. Great act from him, as always. Now the part I am really burned up on, is the person(s) who stated the movie was predictable... First off, let me guess you are fan of Tarantino, right? Next, let me see............ You work in the carnivals guessing the weight of people, and you are damn good at.........let me see, the government has contacted you on numerous occasions to help them, because you can predict anything, right? Stupid, right? Just like you saying this movie was predictable. I have not found anyone personally yet, who has not given this movie anything lower than a 6/10. I as a real fan of movies, not of just one genre, not of just one, or two directors/producers/writers/actors, not of just nudity, not of just action, not of just violence, not of just car chases, etc., etc., etc.. I am a FAN, a BUFF. I will see a movie for what it is worth, not because I want to sound cool, by being pessimistic. Maybe you really feel that way, then again... maybe you don't. But, to me, and everyone I personally know, this was a great movie.... mind you, not perfect, not even close, but damn good. That is why I am giving this movie, with a terrific cast, good script, and set. A movie that kept you guessing--- an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Lucky Number Slevin,"Because my personality is incredibly rooted in the Type A persuasion and I like to theme my month's viewing schedule, I don't get as much time for rewatches as I would like. When the opportunity arose to include Lucky Number Slevin on one of my monthly lists, I took it. I watched Lucky Number Slevin shortly after its 2006 release and was impressed by it, I was so impressed by it that I introduced it to some friends and family members after my first viewing. It's always interesting to see when 10 years elapses if one still enjoys a film as much as they did soon after its release, all the more reason I'm disappointed I don't have more time for rewatches, alas, there are so many films to see. A star-studded cast including Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, and Ben Kingsley lead an intensely gripping mystery in which every piece of filmed action is pivotal to the story. Paul McGuigan directs an engaging story told in an energetic way creating a story that necessitates watching until the final moment.While waiting at an airport, a mysterious figure tells a stranger the story of a fixed horse race in the mid-70's that resulted in the deaths of a family. The story is centered around the idea of a Kansas City Shuffle in which attention is drawn to one thing while deceit is happening in the other direction. Meanwhile, present-day the sons of two feuding mob bosses are shot down, as well as two bookies. Happening simultaneously, a young man named Slevin has sought refuge in his friend's apartment after finding out that his girlfriend has cheated on him. Caught immediately in a web of mistaken identity, Slevin realizes he has borrowed the apartment of a friend who owes several powerful people large amounts of money. Acquiescing to the needs of each mob boss in hopes of keeping himself alive, Slevin puts himself into some dangerous situations. The stakes are heightened when Slevin meets and falls in love with a chatty neighbor who works as a coroner. Soon, Slevin is being watched or followed from three different angles leaving the audience to determine what link exists connecting all the pieces.I was thrilled to learn that this film was every bit as exciting and engrossing as it was the first time I watched it, nearly 10 years ago. There are few things I appreciate more than a story that comes together so seamlessly with every single thing that was filmed having a place in the narrative. Lucky Number Slevin employs a stellar cast to bring together the brilliant story line. Flashbacks were used often in Lucky Number Slevin and were done in a unique and engaging way. Films like Lucky Number Slevin prove that mystery as a genre is alive and well, still maintaining a place in today's cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Guy Ritchie style Hollywood film...,"...which is strange seeing it was directed by a Brit. Lucky Number Slevin is much like a Guy Ritchie, having both his strengths and weaknesses.Slevin Kelevra (Josh Hartnett) is an unlucky man; he ends up staying in his friend's apartment when his identity is mistaken. He is plunged into the world of gangsterism, with two rival gangsters believing he has debts to pay. One, The Boss (Morgan Freeman) is willing to clear the debt, if Slevin can kill the Fairy (Christopher Maxwell Kramer), the son of his rival. The other gangster, The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley) orders that Slevin pay back a debt of $33,000. Slevin also has to battle the threat of an ruthless assassin, Smith/Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis): the assassin who does the job that no else wants. Slevin's only ally in his mission is his friend's neighbour Lindsey (the lovely Lucy Liu). She helps him investigate, but doesn't want him to loose his moral compass.Paul McGuigan offers a very stylist form of direction, with a lot of directorial tricks, and impressive visuals. McGuigan shows that he can direct an action sequence, and keeps the film going at a fast pace, not allowing the audience too much time to thing. McGuigan also has a good cast of experienced actors, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Bruce Willis all offer good performances, particularly Freeman. Stanley Tucci also offers a decent performance in his small role, and McGuigan gets out better performance from Josh Hartnett, who is often just a bland pretty boy, and Lucy Liu, who offers a quirky, youngish performance.The problem with the film is the script by Jason Smilovic. He is clearly a man who thinks he is more clever then he really is. He gives the audience an overly complex plot which he didn't need to and philosophy conversations that were not wanted or needed. By making the film with a more convoluted plot and storyline Smilovic ends up leaving his script full of holes. His story has some similarities to Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, where a man has to pay a large debt and have to pay back some vicious gangsters in a short space of time. He also shares Guy Ritchie problem of putting too much in a film, when less is more. That's what happened in most of Ritchie's mockery gangster film. The tone and style of the film was also similar to Smokin' Aces, a not a good film at all.

"Sit down, grab a reese's & enjoy a movie!","I saw this at a screening with my lady, and not only were we pleasantly surprised at the sights, sounds and quirks of the cast (Hartnett, Freeman, Kingsley, Liu, Tucci & Willis)---but the direction is STRONG.I'm always interested in solving a movie before its ending, but the way Sleven uses its characters, score, cinematography, wardrobe & design...you should just allow yourself to enjoy the story for 2 hours. I've been one of those people that think Bruce Willis seems to do his best work with a gun (Moonlighting & Blind Date being exceptions), but he turns in a pretty understated, wry performance. Morgan Freeman & Sir Ben Kingsley always keep your attention---WHEW! Lucy Liu is very quirky and mischievous as a neighbor that drops in on Josh Hartnett. I don't understand why he gets a bad rap from people (HATERS IN THE HOUSE!), I'm an African-American male and I've always found his work pretty solid (O, Hollywood Homicide, Wicker Park, etc.). The director, Paul McGuigan even spoke after the screening and found his body of work comparable to Willem Dafoe---high compliments & Mr. McGuigan's aura is not typical of usual Hollywood b.s. (PRAISE Scotland FOR KEEPING HIM ON EVEN GROUND:) Also watch a funny cameo from Mykelti Williamson WHO DESERVES MORE RESPECT FOR BEING AN EXCELLENT ACTOR!From the opening of the movie, you are not bored. Funny, very violent and you'll crave peanut butter & want to get some funky wallpaper.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
What can be said...?,"Watching Lucky Number Slevin is a lot like being forced to hang out with that kid from high school who thought he was ""cool"" but his attempts at it only made him look ridiculous. The writing would have been original if it were made back in 1994, but now the overly witty lines mixed with pop culture references is just old and tired. My guess is they knew the story wasn't very strong so they decided to load it up with big name stars, who have all done much better work. And the big 20 minute ""let's clear it all up"" montage at the end is just the worst. If you want a crime thriller, see ""Running Scared"" and leave this one alone.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
great flick,"Wow. What a great flick. I had read some reviews of this and was intrigued by the cast.Started out a bit slow, but Hartnett did a great job and frankly any movie with Morgan Freeman in it can't be all bad.To me this was a cross between Pulp Fiction, Snatch and Reservoir Dogs. Bruce Willis was superb as usual, playing a very subdued character. Reminded me a lot of his character in The Sixth Sense. In fact, I think they used the same wardrobe and hairdresser.Very cool noir sorta flick. Confusing to be sure, but rest assured it all ties together nicely with multiple twists and turns. Sure, some of them are expected, but some catch you going ""oooohhhhh"".Mykelti Williamson has a nice little role.I give this movie an 8 out of 10. Hartnett was superb and I almost forgive him for Pearl Harbor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
In The Fashion of other Greats,"This movie is truly one of the great movies of the last decade. I cannot remember a time when I went to a movie without knowing much of what it was about and left the theatre mesmerized. This is movie that plays on the viewer wits and dares them to keep up. In the end for those who are too slow the plot is finally revealed. I wished the last would have been left up to us to decipher, but in the end the movie is great. I personally would put it into my top 25 list. It is a mixture of Hitchkock's North By Northwest, Terentino's Pulp Fiction, and Singer's The Usual Suspects. But don't get me wrong, it does not exceed any of these films. But this is a work of art to be talked about in the same perspective.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

dreadful nonsense,"One of the worst films of this or any other year. Main problem is the casting with Josh Hartnett once again unable to carry the show, he must be very popular with some audience who can overlook acting ability in favour of bland skinny boy looks. Lucy Liu puts in another one note dismal performance. So it all rests on the older members of the cast who unfortunately cannot step up to the plate. Its all very slickly put on the screen but how many times do I need to see Bruce Willis play this sort of a role and Ben Kingsleys pent up rage? Hopefully not many more times. Its all up to the denouement which is the icing on this cake that failed to rise.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Awesome movie!!!!!,"This is truly one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It is funny, stylish, has great acting, great plot, script and twists. It is the perfect thriller. Even when you think you have it all figured out you're proved wrong. The movie pieces together so smoothly it is unbelievable and here you think you got it figured but you don't. Brice Willis of course never fails to deliver a great performance and he masterfully does here. Easily one of his best movies in a long time.

A surprisingly good film...,"I have to admit that when I went to see this movie, I thought it was going to be funny and witty, since that's what all the TV spots said about it. But truth be told, this movie is flat-out amazing despite the minor amounts of humor. Josh Hartnett's character is very convincing as a man mistaken for someone else. The dialogue in the movie can range anywhere from witty to heartbreaking, but at all times it's pretty much fast-paced and keeps the story moving along well. The best aspect of this movie is probably that the characters are by no means flat; even the cruelest ones seem to have a bit of a soft spot. The plot line of the movie isn't laid out within the first five minutes by one character's dramatic monologue (as in some other less substantial films); you figure it out as you go, and even in the last few minutes of the movie you're still guessing. That's what keeps everyone entertained.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Slevin gets caught up in a gang war,"Lucky number Slevin was a refreshing gangster movie with a great cast. Whenever you put Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, and Lucy Lui in the same movie your in for a treat. The performances are very good and the plot only adds to the excitement. Hartnett plays his obnoxious care-free character very well and Bruce Willis is cast well in his assassin role and once again comes through with a great performance. Lucy Lui provides a refreshing personality in the movie and as always Morgan Freeman play ""the boss"" beautifully. Ben Kingsley may not be the most convincing rabbi, but he too plays his part well. The plot makes many twists and turns, some expected, but many surprising, and it's only in the last ten minutes when you finally realize what is going on.

Entertaining,"With a lot of Bruce Willis's films, you can rely on his entertainment value. This movie is, happily, one of those times.

I expect more out of this movie.,"I saw this movie last night and I was a little disappointed. The movie is about Josh Harnett who everyone believes his Nick Fisher. Nick Fisher is a man who owes a lot of money to Morgan Freeman and The Rabi played by Ben Kingsley. Bruce Willis is the hit-man in the movie. Lucy Liu is the girl next door who Josh Harnett falls in love with. I been waiting for this movie to come out in theaters for a while I the waiting wasn't worth it. I thought this movie would be like the classics pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown but I was wrong. The movie didn't suck it was funny some parts, had a little action, but it was missing something. I do have to say the ending is amazing and will blow you away. The ending is amazing and it makes the movie a little better. Overall I give this movie 5 out of 10 stars, would I recommend it to others, maybe if your bored or just want to relax a see an average movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"""Slevin"" delivers in all the right places","I've had to watch this film three times to be prepared to write this review, because the nuances are far too numerous to catch in one viewing. There are any number of praises I could give ""Lucky Number Slevin"" right from the beginning.Director Paul McGuigan seems to have come out of nowhere, having only a handful of unimpressive and unnoticed films under his belt before ""Slevin."" The film's pacing is deliberate and unapologetic, but at no point does it feel rushed. McGuigan takes time and does a beautiful job letting the plot's secrets unfold, at no expense to the stylishness of the characters or the freshness of the dialogue. He gives the audience's intelligence credit, always only giving just enough information without being vague.Cynics have labeled green screen-writer Jason Smilovic's script for the movie as ""Tarantino-esque"" but in fact the product is quite different. While Tarantino's dialogue shifts smoothly between being almost excessively cool and shockingly graphic, Smilovic remains down-to-earth and realistic. At the same time, he writes rich, fascinating characters, most of whom seem to have been cast perfectly from some higher power.Lucy Liu is completely adorable in a role which only faintly gives off the aroma of Natalie Portman's in ""Garden State."" Stanley Tucci is solid as usual as the dirty cop, and Bruce Willis continues to impress me with the interesting film choices he makes, turning in an excellent performance as the mysterious assassin. Josh Hartnett is everything you could want in a leading man; don't be fooled by the boyish good looks, the man can act, and he is perfectly suited for this role.The real show-stealers, however are Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley as the rival gang lords. Initially I was skeptical about Freeman as a villain, because ever since ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" he has been type-cast as a kindly grandfather-like figure. I was pleasantly surprised though. He retains his genial quality but at the same time you can sense a menacing streak within his character. Kingsley is a joy to behold as well, and when the two veteran actors finally share the screen, it's as if you're watching a stage-play.It's hard to find anything wrong with this film. Its genre is so ambiguous that you truly find yourself having no idea what comes next, and it is a breath of fresh air. The score by composer J. Ralph sets the tone beautifully and Peter Sova's cinematography is on par with if not beyond that of Conrad Hall (""American Beauty,"" ""Road to Perdition""). Frankly, there is something in this movie for everyone, and unless strong violence makes you squeamish, I strongly recommend it to any film-lover.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
This movie has great wallpaper!,"Congratulations to Suzanne Cloutier and Normand Robitaille on set design - they added great elements of style to this movie. (I don't think I've ever noticed wallpaper in a movie until seeing this one. I find that interesting.) The two penthouse office/apartment sets were amazing. Beyond the sets, this was a finely done movie, in general. The story, although a bit predictable, was one of the better suspense stories I've seen. The music and camera work added a great deal to the overall style, as well. I can see in the current day of action thrillers why this did not get quite as much attention as some; but, it is most definitely memorable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
The Best Movie Surprise of 2006 for me!,"Plot: A Movie about a Horse Race bet gone wrong. A man named Slevin (Josh Hartnett) in the wrong place, at the wrong time. Gets caught in a game with 2 mob bosses (Morgan Freeman plays ""The Boss & Ben Kingsley plays The Rabbi) that use to control everything together in the past and now they have a job for him to do for both. In the mix of this mess he meets a girl (Lucy Liu). Little does he know he is being played by Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis) or is he! My Spiel: This movie totally blew me away. After watching this I started it over again and watched it again thinking how amazing and how proud I was for purchasing this by looking at the cover. This is easily my favorite movie of 2006. There is really nothing you can say bad about this movie. The story and how it all comes together was simple & amazingly done to perfection. Even consists of one hell of a cast from Josh Hartnett, Moran Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Bruce Willis, Lucy Liu, and Stanley Tucci. I don't want to rune any of the story, but I urge anyone to see this movie. It's truly a shame if anyone doesn't like this movie because they didn't get it, Which I have heard.Lucky Number Slevin (2006) Review: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Darkly Entertaining In Spite Of Itself...,"Thanks in no small part to the juggernaut that was THE USUAL SUSPECTS, the crime film genre developed a whole new subset of 'wisenheimer', noirish capers dripping with as much irony and faux-witty sarcasm as blood and brains, (as in on the wall, not as in the smart kind.) Many of these movies nearly break their own arms patting themselves on the back for their smug cleverness. Common attributes are: low-life gangsters with funny names, people on the wrong side of the tracks who talk sometimes as if they've read too much Sartre or Shakespeare, and double-jointed plot twists that always have that ""Keyser Soze""-style 'GOTCHA!' at the end.Into the fray, along with films like CRANK, SHOOT 'EM UP and the more superior LAYER CAKE, comes LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN. Only I'm not going to trash it, number one - because in spite of all the tough-guys-with-a-twist trappings, it's still an admirable little film, and number two - I have a bias I must admit to here. The author of the screenplay, Jason Smilovic, was one of the creative forces behind KAREN SISCO, one of the best detective shows never to be given the chance that it truly deserved, and he gets instant brownie points from me for that reason alone.SLEVIN, in case you were in a coma and missed the oft-shown trailers when this hit theaters, is one of those 'mistaken identity' scenarios. Slevin (Josh Hartnett) is a poor shlub who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Breezing into town to help a buddy out with a business deal that's not going so well, he finds out how bad things REALLY are when, mistaken for his friend Nick, Slevin becomes embroiled in a deadly game of ""an eye for an eye"" going on between two major underworld players: The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and his former compadre turned bitter enemy, The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley). Interested parties include Nick's neighbor and intermittent girlfriend, Lindsey (Lucy Liu in a role that's a far cry from her usual stuff, and a DECENT role at that!), a not-so-honorable cop (Stanley Tucci) and the mysterious ""Mr. Goodkat"" (Bruce Willis), a pro hit-man so badass that nobody even knows what he looks like.Of course, in the same vein as THE USUAL SUSPECTS, nothing is at all what it seems - not the characters or even the plot itself, yet if you've seen enough of these things, you will know where this is going before it even reaches the halfway mark. At least director Paul McGuigan is savvy enough to just let his cast do their thing, which they do very well, (Freeman plays far too few villains, so this is a treat, and Kingsley will never rival his work in SEXY BEAST, but he keeps it low-key here. And Willis shows why he's becoming such an in-demand specialist in quick but memorable cameos.)Hartnett does a pretty good job shouldering the lead role, though he sometimes seems so glib and clueless, you get a secret sense of satisfaction as various thugs and members of law enforcement smack him around at the moments that you'd actually like to. (There's a reason for his ""WTF"" attitude, but it's a spoiler, so you'll have to watch the movie to find out where it comes from.)All-in-all, I've spent more time watching much worse movies. LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN is hardly the next ""USUAL SUSPECTS"" or ""FARGO"", but it'll do on a TV-sluggish Saturday night.And just for any KAREN SISCO fans out there - keep your eyes peeled for a VIP cameo at the end by one of that show's most endearing players.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
One of my Favorite movies,"If you are thinking of watching this...DON'T READ ANY SPOILERSI found this movie a while after it was out. Never saw a trailer or heard anything from anyone. In my opinion that is the absolute best way to watch this movie because i cannot figure out how to describe this movie without ruining the experience. Instead, I'll try to describe the type of people who might like this movie and if that's you, then stop reading and just watch it.You might like this movie if any of this fits you. if you like crime and or mystery genre. if you can't stand missing the first 5 minutes of a movie. if you like movies that keep you guessing and trying to figure out whats going on. if you like movies/shows like Snatch, Oceans 11, Leverage. if you like one liners and entertaining dialog. if you rewind movies you watch at home because you are worried you might miss plot developments.if your into that stuff go watch the movie.if your still reading this then maybe its not for you. I'll try to get further in depth without revealing anything about my rating and likes/dislikes here. I know dialog is both a con for some reviewers and a pro for others. it is true that at some times its a little too witty in the sense that nobody really talks like that 24/7. I, however, am on the side of pro. i love the one liners. a specific one told by Hartnett i find particularly memorable because no matter how many times i think about it, i would arrive at the same answer every time. I also feel it keeps those scenes interesting enough to hold the viewers attention without being too interesting/funny as to completely derail the tone of the scenes. Pacing to me is another thing i like. For me it was perfect, it never shifts scenes too early that i haven't picked up what i was meant to understand, but also fast enough that i don't have time to process it and start devising my own conclusions. Its that small gap between acknowledging the situation and comprehending the situation. For me this movie hits it perfectly, again and again the whole movie and it makes for a great ending. and last is the plot twist/big conclusion style. I am a big fan of these types of movies. Most movies, however. in order to pull off a big finish. they need to throw in a lot of beginning chaos. the bigger the finish, the more chaotic the beginning. That leaves the average person confused and some times irritated. I know many who do not like this style of movie because of this. Lucky Number Slevin, however, manages to keep a big finish without making the viewers feel lost. viewers just feel like their riding shot gun to this extremely unfortunate persons life and to me that makes this movie great. that fact that you don't have to feel confused to get that wow factor.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"No spoilers needed, this is the most predictable movie in recent years","First off, let me announce that even fans of this film agree that it contains the worst interior decoration/wallpaper in the history of the cinema.Now, after the first 15 minutes of the film (entirely pointless because Bruce Willis tells a man a story for 15 minutes and then kills him (WTF?!!!)), it becomes evident as to the tone and direction of the film. But after half of it goes by it becomes morbid and overly violent; a polar of it's first half. That's a no-no.The acting makes this to be a kitschy dark comedy but it eventually transpires into a bloody mess that was evident from the start (literally, I knew where it was going to end 20 minutes into it). No sympathy for any of the characters is acquired because they do not ask for any. Also, the lack of a linear storytelling style destroys all hope of a ""proper"" catharsis. Or even a remotely satisfying ending.I hated almost every minute of this film and if you want to see a ""real"" revenge film watch South Korea's ""Oldboy"" or even QT's ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"".D.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Incredible,"Yes, incredible is right because this movie was individual, smart, funny and downright...incredible. OK, so Josh Hartnet, one for the ladies maybe, but he doesn't fail to impress as the supposedly arrogant and lippy Unlucky Slevin, who, by an unfortunate twist in fate, ends up in the middle of war being plotted by two violent gang lords; The Boss and The Rabbi - the excellent Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley.Lucy Liu is also at her best as 'the girl next door', whose zany hyperactive behaviour offers amusement and, my new word, lovability. Slevin, despite his dark secret, unwittingly falls for her innocent charm, which seems to erase any thoughts of his dangerous predicament.And there is, as promised, Bruce Willis; who captures the essence of a hardened 'world-class assassin' called Mr. Goodkat. The character is expertly presented by the often stereotyped Willis, who leaves behind his macho, hard-talking, gun-blasting vigilante-like Die Hard - whom this character could very well have imitated - and creates the subtle, quiet-spoken hit-man who's cooler that the North Pole.The plot is also a highlight, with so many amazing twists that the story becomes more enjoyable as it continues. Couple this with the amazing cinematography - flashback scenes mingled with present time situation, and a healthy use of vibrant colour and patterns - and you have one heck of a film which delights in it's own intelligence, and is unjustly criticised because of it.In an age where films are beginning to dumb down for the supposedly stupid audience, i think everyone should stand up and applaud a very versatile, funny and often moving story of mistaken identity in which the viewer is never left feeling like they got the simplest version of events.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Sparkling film for movie lovers!,"This film definitely exists in a world of its own. A hyper-reality, if you will. The characters always know what to say, resulting in a constant stream of witty banter that verges on annoying but never quite gets there. The big untouchable bosses have just two henchmen each, which unless I missed some big, poignant statement, that's just silly. Still, it was like an amusement park ride you knew was going to take a turn, you could see the turn up ahead, but what you cannot see is the drop, loops, and rises that come after that turn. I came along for the ride and enjoyed it thoroughly. I recommend this film to anyone who can pay close attention to a fast pace world and suspend disbelief.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

"Stupid, stupid, stupid","I love most movies. I am often said to be in favor of even bad movies. This particular movie (not a film) was unbelievably horrible. Just plain stupid. It was a trite, contrived plot, with two super egos, with matching fantasy penthouse apartments, who have a grudge match which our character, Slevin, becomes involved with. Basically they used tried and true techniques for making a movie, so it seemed like a movie, but the story, the script, the plot was unbelievably stupid! Just drek, a waste of time, a total Hollywood mind F$#K.This movie was meant to be important and deep and it was just plain idiotic. I rarely give negative reviews, in fact this might be my first, but I cannot recommend this film. As the Principal in Billy Madison said ""everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to you."" I hate to quote Adam Sandler, but that quote is the only one I can think of. You feel betrayed and dumber after watching this film. It takes part of your soul with it, as you watch, sucking out your intelligence.This is a horrible waste of time of a movie.

Excellent,"Brilliant. I saw this late last night with my Dad. I was expecting the usual shoot 'em up thriller but I was pleasantly surprised with the intricate plot; it was something completely different. The best writing since Italian Job and Ocean's Eleven. The plot focuses on details and it is incredibly well thought out. The audience is led in one direction and the outcome is the complete opposite; expect the unexpected. Each member of the cast fits his or her role perfectly. Josh Hartnett masters the role of Sleven. The whole thing is a guessing game. The beginning of the film leaves random loose ends but the smallest of details seem to fall into place by the end of the film. Don't think too hard and don't try to figure it all out in the beginning; it will ruin the enjoyment of the entire film. If you don't catch this movie now, you'll be kicking yourself when you stumble over it in a movie store and have to watch it on your small TV screen.

But if you love action, suspense, humor, action violence, and everything that goes along with it, you're in luck. You will like this movie if you liked ""Fight Club"" and ""V for Vendetta"".

It has just enough humor and romance for a great date movie, just enough action adventure for a guys night, enough fun and Josh Hartnet for a ladies night out. It's just a movie made for any and everyone over 17 that would love to appreciate a movie!

SLevin Reasons Why This Film is Disappointing,"1. The script is not as clever as it wants to be. The script is an Elmore Leonard wannabe. It tries to have slick, snappy dialog, but always falls short of the real thing. The basic story is okay, but some of the twists are more contrived than they need to be.2. The directing is not as slick as it wants to be. Last month's ""Running Scared"" was a similar type of film and was done much better. ""Lucky Number SLeven"" is crude by comparison.3. Great cast, but little screen time. Sir Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman are great, but they are not in the film enough. Bruce Willis is not given much to do but smirk. Stanley Tucci has a small, thankless role. Lucy Lui is great and has the luxury of being the only female character in the film.4. Josh Hartnett ruins every film he is in, and this is no exception. The movie producers must have thought if they got some really good actors for this film, nobody would notice how bad Josh Hartnett is, but it's the opposite. Having good actors only intensifies how bad Josh Hartnett really is.5. This film is designed to be a ""guy flick,"" but we see Josh Hartnett in a towel for half the film while Lucy Lui is fully clothed. By doing that, they do not really appeal to anybody.6. The music sucks and is not memorable.7. Josh Hartnett ruins every film he is in. I couldn't think of any other reasons, so I thought I would overstate the obvious. It's too bad, because this film had potential, but they really screwed it up. Even so, it will probably make a decent rental.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Best Movie Of The Year So Far,"I have to say, I went to see the Hills Have Eyes, but ended up seeing this instead. It had a good cast, but I had an inkling it would be atrocious. Man Alive, How wrong was I!? The previous reviewer (yes Claire from Brighton, that's you!) must have been blind and deaf because I found it exceptionally difficult to pick a fault in the film. Fast, Witty and funny dialogue really make the 2 hours fly in. The plot, granted, was confusing in the middle, but everything came together perfectly towards the end. Perfect casting throughout, Liu and Freeman and Kingsley all give some fine performances, Hartnett suits being the protagonist with all odds against him and Bruce Willis breaks from the mould of playing the same character in every damn film he's in, so he gets points for that. Brilliant ending and opening as well.So please, don't pay any attention to the negative reviews, this film is excellent, and you really get more than you paid for.Go Now.NOW!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
I love great movies and I love this!,"I've seen some negative reviews on this movie and I don't understand why. From start to finish it had me intrigued, laughing and on the edge of my seat. It has the feel of a Guy Ritchie film because there are some brutal and humorous scenes in it.The chemistry between Harnett & Lui is fantastic. In fact, all the actors do a fine job and the cast were wonderfully chosen. Bruce Willis particularly impressed me playing a heartless, world-class assassin.Watch out for some very subtle hints in certain scenes, which you may or may not get, but either way I am confident you will be satisfied come the end of this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
best this year so far,"What a movie! like a strange cross between usual suspects/ lock stock and layer cake. and a great cast too. Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett and Lucy Liu looking sooo cute, playing an innocent girl, no kicking or punching just being cute. The whole cast is great, really played with gusto.It is a case of mistaken identity, Josh Harnett is in NY visiting a pal of his and is taken away by one mob boss then when he gets home another one grabs him. So he has to think of things fast to stay alive. more twists and turns than the Alton Towers Corkscrew.Just minted, but stay focused or you may miss sommit",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
You think you figured it out from start ??,"Yes, ladies and gents, its here, this could be one of the best thriller/action movie of this year . Yeah, at first glance of the actors list, you might think, hey Bruce Willis is playing in this, so it must be another boom/bang action movie, but you are wrong, you might think this if you only saw him in 2 movies, that is the Die Hard, Die Hard 2.Well it is not a rambo style action movie, nor kill bill style. It is the kind of movie that makes you spin in the chair when you are watching it. It never gets boring, it always keeps you entertained, thats what matters.There are a few clichés in this story, but besides that it is great.You think you know whats going to happen at the end, from the start of the movie ??

just when I was about to give up going to the theater......,"Lucky Number Slevin is an excellent film. The directing, cinematography, acting, wardrobe, props, and script was excellent. It was created how films should be created. Bruce Willis has yet to let me down in any of his films. I wonder why the critics would give this film a B and v for vendetta and A...Backwards. This film had me thinking and beyond that, it was shot wonderfully. Morgan Freeman obviously chooses his films. This is another A performance in his collection. Ben Kingsley did an excellent job as well. I was emotionally attached to the characters and the way everything was so suavely done, two thumbs up.

"It might have worked, just...","While many of this film's components were well chosen, and the script kept the story rolling at a reasonable clip - the casting of Mr. Hartnett in a critical role ruined the entire enterprise.

Carrot Top might have been a better choice if the producers hadn't been trolling for - uh- I don't know WTF motivated the Josh call. Moist pre-teens? There was PEARL HARBOR. Hello.

"Surprising, amusing,  very good!","I went to see this movie because, well to honest there wasn't much else playing, but I was very surprised. This movie amazed me, it's a really smart movie, I love how the end unfolds. It's funny, a bit strange, well very strange actually but still I really liked it. All the characters are very intriguing and especially Lucy Liu's character was just fun to watch, this strange funny young woman, you just have to like her. The fact Josh Hartnett's character never really worries how bad this troubles get (and they get pretty bad) is just so different and fun.If you like movies where you have to think but can still really have fun, go see this movie.

horseplay,"Lucky#Slevin is about a bad men who do bad things. It's good to see mobsters get it, they should all be put out of our misery. The movie smacks of The Jackal with Willis playing a soulless hit man. Freeman and Kingsley playing mob kingpins. Hartnet and Liu playing innocent bystanders. The film starts out in 1979 with a hit on an inconsequential gambler and his family. Later you find out what that's all about, but its not too hard to guess. Excellent cast and acting. A couple of rough editing sequences and cheesy dialog make this almost a dark comedy. The game is the Kansas City Shuffle and the twists are OK although not too surprising.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Not perfect, but a refreshing change","Kudos to Paul McGuigan for directing one of the finest slight-of-hand movies of the year. A second viewing of this flick made me realize how painstakingly obvious the major plot elements were, but my initial viewing had me constantly scratching my head.McGuigan includes a couple of scenes early in the movie that would ordinarily not be missed if they were omitted. However, their inclusion leaves the viewer wondering what importance they have. After a viewing of the movie, one realizes that these scenes' only importance was to make one wonder what their importance was.Add to this outstanding slight of hand the terrific acting by an ensemble of truly outstanding performers. Morgan Freeman gives a riveting performance, as does Josh Hartnett. Bruce Willis, a man who I thought was a great actor mired in a myriad of terrible films, finally finds a film that gives his acting prowess justice. Lucy Liu and Ben Kingsley round out a cast that leaves little to be desired.The movies one weakness is simply the fact that when we add up all of the elements, it is simply a theme that has been done over and over again. So, with a poor score given to originality, the rest of the aspects of this film really round it out. Not a must see, but any devout movie goer will not be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
very impressing movie,"Congratulations to Mr Smilovic and Mr Mc Guigan. It's not an easy plot but they made a terrific work. I guess that even a simple mind understands the movie. However I wouldn't choose Bruce Willis for Goodkat. The only scene where I recognize Bruce Willis talent's is the first one. I believe also that there is a mistake in the plot. At the restaurant scene, why does Detective Brikowski say that he doesn't know who's the lady with Slevin? He knows her from the morgue! Nevertheless this is a very impressing movie that takes this genre to another level. Why does the comments have to be with 10 lines at least? Whatever!

A Poor Movie,"Do not let this all-star cast charm you into seeing what I believe to be a poor movie of this kind. Morgan Freeman's undertaking of a New York City crime boss is unconvincingly played and even the likes of Lucy Lui give an embarrassing attempt of acting. By including a 'Charlie's Angel' in the cast and a great actor, who we have seen playing better roles in characters on the other side of the law, is this really such a surprise?With edited camera shots whilst the conversation is in a continuous flow, the directing in many parts is over-elaborate and greatly confusing. Scripting also leaves a lot to be desired. Dialogue ranges from short, sweet, but never really to the point, to long profuse sentences that fail in any attempt to create humour.To give this film credit, the last 20 minutes is one of the best endings I have seen in a movie of this genre, comparable to the likes of The Usual Suspects. The story ends with all corners covered so that no member of the audience is lost in its revealing climax, which is very cleverly written. This finale certainly awoke me from what I was beginning to believe would be a complete disaster.One must ask themselves whether or not 85 minutes of filming mumbo jumbo is worth the wait for 20 minutes of one truly great ending. It is a chance I took, but one which I am unlikely to take again.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

This movie should easily be in the top 250.,"Usually a 7.8 average is good for IMDb users, but not for me. This movie is beyond amazing. The acting, the premise, the plot: everything. Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, and Ben Kingsley all give 100% performances. Lucy Liu and Stanley Tucci were also very good considering I've rarely seen them in any movies like Lucky Number Slevin.While some may say you can easily figure out the plot from the beginning, I did not. But even if you can, it still keeps you glued to the screen. The ending, especially, is arguably one of the best endings in any movie I have ever seen (very close to The Mist).I have never seen Kiss Kiss Bang Bang or The Usual Suspects, which is odd because I am a huge movie buff, but really, this movie is absolutely outstanding. I suggest it to anybody.Even if you hated the movie, I can guarantee the ending/the last half hour will leave you speechless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The whole cast was great including Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett, Morgan Freeman, and Ben Kingsley. Hell it came close to Pulp Fiction but not that close.

Yes, Morgan Freeman. This movie was good. There were many twists. The diatribe between Josh Harnett and Lucy Liu was a little bit annoying. After you accept that Josh's accent and nose are not going away, you can enjoy this movie. This is another one of those revenge driven movies. Mr. Goodcat stole the show. The best scene was when he did the Kentucky Shuffle or something like that. Just amazing! I loved the ruthlessness that Bruce Willis put into his character.

From the snippy interactions with Lucy Liu, all the way through to the can't-believe-I-didn't-see-that-coming finale,this snappy piece is more then deserving of box office success, although it is no giant-budget hardcore thinker, it will leave you with a pleasant aftertaste.

How people can LIKE this film is BEYOND me.,"Ben Ghandi Kingsley as crimeboss no.1, Morgan Shawshank Freeman as crime boss no.2, Lucy Cockeyed Lui as the most annoying character in cinema history (Shia Lebeof not inc), Bruce same old same old Willis as the ""play them against each other"" gangster role. Anyone starting to see a problem with the cast. Anyone who has seen any of them play their previous roles can appreciate THESE ARE NOT THE RIGHT CHARACTERS to a gangland drama.I half expect Kingsley to come out with some ""lets make peace"" metaphor when he starts ordering the executions, and Freeman to start narrating some penguin march when he starts threatening in such a mediocre unbelievable manner, I can imagine all 4 of them laughing all the way to the bank as they took the producers money for a half arsed job. The 4 of them should know better than to take on such a cliché script with ""I wannabe gangster"" written all over it.The violence is so unbelievable, the fight scenes seem comical, the film set looks cardboard, everything from the clothes down to the props just looks so out of place. It was painful to watch it for more than 30 mins. Its almost like they tried a Sin City type of atmosphere by using cheap sets and unrealistic acting roles.

well...,"Wow! I came out of this movie with the sensation that I had just seen 4 or 5 movies all at once - that's how good I thought it was! This movie has just about everything in it - the cliché sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll probably describes it best - without being too over the top, or hard to follow. As the story was moving along, you were able to put together the little pieces that eventually led you to the end and you had that 'aha' moment when you are able to figure something out that was staring you in the face all along. I especially like the witty dialog, I think Lucy Liu played her character really great, and while the movie was a bit explicit in some of the violence it made the movie what it was. Also the way the story moved along reminded me of my other favorites Josh Hartness movie ""wicker park"" because it keeps you guessing as to what is gonna happen at the end.

Hartnett in a Towel and a Smile Trumps Alarming Body Count for Noir Entertainment,"""Lucky Number Slevin"" at first seems like a humorous noir tribute a la ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" of mistaken identity before it harshly turns into ""V for Vendetta"".Telegraphed by a long prologue with the incredibly adorable kid from ""E. R."" with the crinkly eyes Oliver Davis, the first half of the film is dominated by the simply wonderful chemistry between a dryly laconic Josh Hartnett (with the crinkly eyes), quite attractively draped in a very low rise towel for at least a third of the film, and Lucy Liu in her best role since TV's ""Ally McBeal"". I'm not just biased that Liu grew up just down Queens Boulevard and went to the same high school as my son to admire that she plays an unusually smart cookie for a genre film, who is always thinking while she's volubly flirting, even while distracted by what's under that towel. I would certainly look forward to the two co-starring as a talky team again, even as he towers over her by over a foot. When the screen goes black as they hit the sack, with not even an old Movie Code fireplace or wind-blowing curtains in sight, director Paul McGuigan uses how much we want to see them together to cleverly distract us in the story when they have a cute morning-after.Morgan Freeman is ever wily, especially in arch monologues, but Sir Ben Kingsley grinds the film to a halt as ""The Rabbi"". Though he was so scary in ""Sexy Beast"", he was similarly miscast in HBO's ""Mrs. Harris"" as a Jewish heavy, his ""Rabbi"" here is not just ludicrous in accent, plot and Talmudic rationalizations (it's usually British mysteries that enjoy the visual comedy of Hassidic criminals), but just seems like a desperate stretch to avoid the usual Italian or Russian mobster clichés.Stanley Tucci doesn't get to play cop often and he sure seems to be enjoying gritty here. Mykelti Williams is almost unrecognizable, playing closer to his ""Forrest Gump"" character than his usual more recent wise acre cops. Robert Forster is a marvelous raconteur in a cameo monologue.While bread crumbs are left throughout the film, especially through nagging little disrupters that at first seem like debut feature writer Jason Smilovic's script or continuity errors but turn out to be clues, the tone of the film changed quite abruptly as the bodies piled up, particularly those of characters we'd gotten to know. The audience fell into an uneasy silence, partly because you could literally hear people concentrating to follow the sudden plot twists. The ending, however, is surprisingly less cynical than usual for the genre. But then Hartnett's smile could melt any cynic.While the cool opening credits recall classic Saul Bass, it doesn't live up to other film references, including Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" and various Bond movies. The discussion of L'il Abner's ""Schmoo"" seems too ""Pulp Fiction"" pop-culture referential, but I certainly will remember this film's definition of a Kansas City Shuffle if it's referred to in a future film.The production design of each character's apartment and entrance hallways is amusingly garish, looking like Britain in the mod-'60's. Some of the exterior shots do seem too obviously set in the fictional NYC of the other Bruce Willis with guns movie this year ""16 Blocks"" that is really in Canada (odd that in promotional interviews the cast said they shot the film in Montreal whereas all the credits acknowledge Toronto and other places in Ontario).The original trailer kept the mystery twists, but unfortunately the more recent ad campaign is giving too much away.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
This Film Is Nobodys Lucky Number!,"Really poor effort. Terrible direction, dialogue, acting, screenplay, wasted talent in Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman. Bruce Willis must be desperate for parts these days too. The fast editing in this film is real teenage hormone stuff, meaningless. The violence is not effective, again its all fast editing to cover up a low budget. The supporting actors are not that good but they don't need to be for this rubbish. The dialogue continues to irritate with the Chinese girl who whitters and twitters on throughout the film, even Ben Kingsley's at it. The film tries to be funny but I guarantee you won't leave the cinema hall laughing. I couldn't get out quick enough. I really don't want to say much more about this film because I'm getting bored just thinking about it. Oh yeah, should mention the meaningless James Bond homage dialogue with the Chinese girl and Slevin, whats that all about.

Witty,"I loved the look of this film. The entire film was given a 70's look even in present day scenes. Josh Hartnett plays the laid back, sarcastic, go with the flow Slevin very well. As always Bruce Willis plays the hard ass great. The rest of the cast including Lucy Liu and academy award winning actors Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley also gives great performances. This film is sleek and witty, and a welcoming/refreshing change from the crap that's been churned out of Hollywood the past few months. I'm not saying there haven't been any other good movies; just that they are few and far between. The only real gripe I have with the movie is that the movie is a mystery movie, but in the end the audience is given every single piece of information so that no thinking was actually necessary. Audience members could have been catatonic throughout the first half of the movie and still came out with the same knowledge as those who avidly paid attention the entire time. Even though the film had a twist (which was predictable) I felt the makers of this film should have given a little credit to the audience and left a little to the imagination. That's my long but not so significant gripe about this movie. Other than that it's a great movie and its better to watch than Scary Movie 4.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Lucky enough to watch it,"""Lucky Number Slevin""The cast was excellent, with Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Lucy Lui, Morgan Freeman and the great Sir Ben Kingsley. It's not everyday you watch a film with names this huge sharing the same screen. After watching the trailer, the movie looked like some kind of action spoof and that put me off big time. But then my sister told me it was good so I gave it go. Little did I know I would later call this the second best film of the year 2006. (After V for Vendetta) This film totally shocked me. It started off a little silly and confusing, with Hartnett coming across as a hapless unlucky joker but it all started to make sense. And it got interesting real quick then I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. The narrative was illustrated beautifully, set in 70's well I think anyway, that's what the flower covered wallpaper was telling me. Also Set in New York City, a case of mistaken identity lands Slevin (Josh Hartnett) in the middle of a war being plotted by two of the city's most rival crime bosses. At first I thought the film was going to waste my time but I stuck with it because I always watch an entire movie before I murder it in a review. Anyway the acting was brilliant. Bruce Willis who is not one of my favourites was haunting as a stalking assassin. The best I've seen him perform. Lucy Lui was good as was Freeman and Kingsley. The old guys delivered like always. But Josh Hartnett who I have never really been a fan of was great as Slevin. He was bloody convincing as an unlucky sucker and equally convincing as a vengeful son looking for payback. Not to mention he has seriously improved in the looks department. (My other sister noticed that first!) The movie was quick, slick, The twist in the end was wicked. I was loving it! The whole structure of this movie, the narrative, the camera shots, and the fragmented visuals all worked like magic. It was realistic, it was clever and it was different. The acting was great, the storyline was unique. One of the first scenes in the movie where Willis breaks some guy's neck was awesome; it was really clever how it made sense in the end. The only flaws I could see in this classic is that the film was less spoof -ish and they could have set a more serious tone, they could have developed the gangster's character more; they never seemed dangerous to me; instead comical. Also the start was a little slow and dull. But Hey! A film like this can afford a few flaws it was that GREAT!Witty, stylish, thrilling, full of action. ""Lucky number Slevin"" has it all and more.

The dialogs is fast paced, and I could see that not everyone in the theater could keep up, but those who did had hearty laughs, and could truly appreciate the film. The picture is graphic, violent, but not distasteful. Bruce Willis proves that he is truly a great actor, and this film begins to show that despite his aging, you can see signs of his Pulp Fiction days. Harttnet demonstrates his range as the movie progresses. Lucy Liu is gorgeous, and witty. Everything is tied up at the end, there is not one stone unturned. The story is complete and perfect.

the rabbi says 'brilliant'.,"I was hesitant on seeing this after its poor box office opening. After a formulaic start, I began to yawn as I half expected a cross between snatch and the noirish 'payback'. Then Ms. Liu arrived and became the icing on the cake. Her quick witted vernacular made me squirm with delight as she, for the first time, did not try and steal the scenes. Her chemistry with Josh was incredible. My only disagreement with this film is its style...they tried doing too many ways of delivering scenes...slow motion, jumpcuts, grainy, etc. They should've kept it consistent, one style for the present tense, one for the story build-up and one for the flashbacks and extended scenes. And the tone...the first half was light and funny while the second half was moody and dark (i liked the second half more)...it almost felt like the shift in 'snatch' when brad pitt's trailer park was burned. It didn't quite sit well.All in all, the performances were great and the film was more entertaining than the lot that's flooded our mutliplexes as of late.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Amazing indeed,"It's just...so perfect...it start's a little bit funny and keeps going like that and it ends dramatic, I saw hundred of movies and I didn't expect that. I think the movie is made in such a matter that it keeps you wondering what is going to be next and makes you forget about the little things: why did he kill the dumb guy when he was a professional killer? why when the gun was pointed to the kid's head it showed the bloddy house's background? why don't things add up?it's at half...who is the real Slevin?and so on...it is so absorbing that makes you forget...and I usually anticipate a lot. I think Slevin was given a role that is really matching with Bruce Willis's roles in other movies...ironic, funny and bad...especially tricky. All in one...what a hit. And where do we put that the Kansas City Shuffle was on us this whole time! Hat's off to the producer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"From curiously amusing to downright brilliant, this movie has it all","Lucky Number Slevin starts off a bit slow, jumping from one scene to another in a seemingly incoherent fashion. It soon picks up the pace as Hartnett keeps scenes lively and fun, while the story is being unfolded layer by layer. Very quickly from then on, the movie keeps you wondering and guessing as to what's really going on, constantly progressing without giving too much away  until the very end of course, when it resolves in ways even the most keen observers wouldn't have predicted.Slevin is a well-balanced cocktail of humor, plot, twists and intriguing storytelling, and any fan of mystery-style movies would do well to check it out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Rather underrated Josh Hartnett film,"Lucky Number Slevin is a great surprise- It takes from the best, namely Hitchcock and Tarantino in its approach to writing and directing and boy is it a ride. Keeping things unpredictable and breezy Lucky Number Slevin is a riot of a movie. The acting from everyone from Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Lucy Lui to old veterans like Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley is great- you know they're all having fun. You should too- go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Wow! Just wow!,"I had known about this title for years but had never chosen to watch it until now, and I am so glad that I did because it's a cracking good thriller. There were times when I could not decide whether it was meant to be a thriller or a rom com because the chemistry between Josh Hartnett abd Lucy Liu worked so well.Two gangsters, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley have been at war with each other for twenty years and afraid now to leave their bullet proof penthouses. They have in the past committed unspeakable acts and have both been hiring a mysterious hitman, Bruce Willis.Josh Hartnett comes on the scene and is attacked and kidnapped, often with amusing results, but swears he is a person of mistaken identity. He has no idea why these seemingly random attacks keep happening. No spoilers here, you will have to watch to find out what the real motive is behind all the mayhem.This is a very unexpected and clever thriller, full of twists and turns, with stellar acting all around, including Stanley Tucci as a cop. Loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
very good,"I must admit,this was one of the very good surprises that I've had last year,I'm not a fan of Josh Hartnett (not even close),but I gotta say he did an awesome performance during the movie,and Bruce Willis...what can I say? simply one of the best in my opinion, the whole plot demands the need to see even more until the resolution. Very good movie for those who like to exercise their minds to solve the clues,find motivations,for those who simply like to see Bruce Willis in a less action-like role,but with pure 100% good acting,and why not? for those who like to laugh with Josh Hartness pure innocence and ""naifity"", and Morgan Freeman...do I even need to say anything about this man? I don't think so,it's just a ""must see because I know this guy will fill out my soul"", his incomparable style just gives an extra touch of class in the type of action - not brutal,but an 60's gangster type of action - and for those who love sweet Asian beauty's you have Lucy Liu,but honestly,a think she's a little apart from the kind of movie,now here's a movie where I would like to see Sandra Bullock,just to see if she's able to perform in an action like environment movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Not as clever or as stylish as it thinks it is.,"This makers of this film really wish it was Pulp Fiction. They've tried to emulate Quentin Tarantino's non-linear story telling, his staccato rapid-fire dialogue and his offbeat characters...hell, they've even got Butch on board, with old Bruce playing a Tarantinoesque assassin. What they haven't got, though, is the ability to take all of these ingredients and whip up a feast for the eyes and ears the way old QT can.Writer Jason Smilovic's best moments don't even rival QT's worst, and the overcomplicated plot isn't half as clever or as slick as Smilovic obviously thinks it is: a case of mistaken identity lands Slevin (played by Brad Pitt-alike Josh Hartnett) in the middle of a gang war waged by two crime lords, The Boss and The Rabbi. Slevin must use his wits (and the help of a feisty neighbour, played by Lucy Liu) to ensure his survival.What Smilovic obviously thinks is witty and clever, sounds stale and hackneyed, and Paul McGuigan matches the writing perfectly with a half-assed attempt at 'stylish' direction, in which he incorporates every contemporary (and overused) trick in the book. A great cast, which includes Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Stanley Tucci, struggle to make the script work, but even they can't save this wannabe from being anything other than average.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Cross between Memento and True Romance,"I went to catch this movie this weekend, and was a little apprehensive given the generally poor reviews and box office. I just don't understand why this is, because this was about the most interesting movie I've seen in a long time. I think this had one of the most interesting plots I've seen come out of Hollywood in quite a while. It had all of the light-hearted murder and mayhem that Terantino included in True Romance, as well as the superb use of time displacement that Jonathan Nolan exhibited in Memento. The acting here was solid (no awards, but I never felt it was lacking). The pace and directing were both outstanding.

Excellent Twist,"I will have to say that Joshua Hartnett and Bruce Willis definitely have chemistry. Watched the movie-Wow, what a mind blower. Joshua really pulled off the part. Looked at some critics notes and they stated that Joshua was wearing a towel more then wearing clothes. Completely wrong!!!!Same critic who stated this, also stated ""Ghost"" was a flop. Joshua Hartnett really showed great talent and compassion in this film. Bruce Willis has always been tremendous I believe, with every Part he's played. What a Mind blower, fabulous.

An truly excellent film,"Nothing less than brilliance is expected from this movie with an all-star cast such as Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Lucy Lui, Ben Kingsley and many more. This film does not disappoint.When Slevin (Josh Hartnett) goes to New York to visit a friend, Nick Fischer, he gets jilted into the middle of a gang war. When he arrives at Nicks apartment he finds that no-one is in, but Nick is expecting him so he naturally lets himself in and makes himself at home. When two thugs knock at the door asking for Nick, Slevin has no choice but to be dragged into a gang building to see the gang leader, 'the boss' (Morgan Freeman). The boss then goes onto explain how Nick owes him 90,000 dollars, and Slevin (having been mugged as soon as he got to New York City) has no ID and seems to be living in Nicks apartment. The boss then explains how a rival gang leader, the rabbi (Ben Kingsley), recently broke the bond of trust between them by murdering the bosses son, and then he goes onto give Slevin two chances, either pay the 90,000 dollars or kill the rabbis son to make it even between the gangs. Slevin has no choice, his mission, to assassinate the rabbis son. But the pressure is really on Slevin when the detectives start harassing him and following him everywhere, when he learns that hes being followed by the world class infamous assassin, Goodkat (Bruce Willis), and when the rabbi and the boss start pressuring him more. Although when a nose neighbour, Lindsay (Lucy Lui) stumbles across Slevin's situation she is eager to help him out and soon enough they start to fall in love. Will slevin really kill the rabbis son? Will slevin find out who this infamous Goodkat is and why he keeps following him? Or will slevin simply go to the police?This film manages to maintain a marvellous story line with twists and surprises around every corner whilst at the same time being hilariously funny with its scattered black comedy. It also manages to pull of quite a body count whilst staying sleek and suave. This films for the person who likes to think through a film whilst seeing a funny, and sometimes gory film. The acting is superb, my personal favourite character is Slevin himself because of his innocence and lovable cockiness. Although their is also Bruce Willis's character Goodkat, a smooth clean assassin who gives no mercy. The script and dialogue are also superb. I consider this film to be one of the very few films that can pull off being very funny and yet really gripping at other points as well.All in all it is a very enjoyable watch, and anyone with a passion for films or movies will love it. It keeps you guessing right till the end.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

I have written on 2001, a space oddysey, and baraka, and now... on lucky number slevin. This...

Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis should set off some automatic *must see* bells, but just in case, if you haven't seen this flick you need to if you enjoy thrillers.

Lucky Number Slevin,"The movie is the history of Slevin, confused with their cousin, that due to the 2 big of the mafia of New York, is seen obliged to murder for both edicts if does not want that they kill it. The plot splits with Slevin Kelevra (Josh Hartnett), a youth that after losing his work and that its girlfriend deceives him, he decides to travel to New York to spend a few days with a cousin and to be forgot of his problems. Al to arrive at department, he is installed and himself shower, before being dressed he is found with Lindsey (Lucy Liu), who is the neighbor, after beginning a conversation, he is born a chemistry among them.Before being dressed, Slevin is required for some thugs and confused with its cousin.

Behind the plot is the famous murderer to salary Goodkat (Bruce Willis), who has its own plans for Slevin.A very similar style at world of Tarantino and some understandable dialogs in all its wealth, only by movie fans, they are perhaps the low points of a thriller of action, so well presented that manages to deceive the spectators during almost all the movie.

Don't miss this flick!!!,"This movie is one of those great ones that somehow doesn't get the attention it deserves and leaves the theatres too soon.

She plays a character unlike any I've seen her play before. Have I reached ten lines yet? No? Dang! Stanley Tucci is pretty cool in the film as well. He's cool in all his films.

Brilliant! And romantic,"Oh this movie was not welcomed by myself, when buses were hanging big poster and advertising it. Firstly I did not like the poster, where the impression was like a movie having no good and evil. I usually do not enjoy movies that has no hero., Main role has to be righteous , that is my favorite style. Recently movie distorts this typical hero epic much , and people got into story about ""bad guy"". They sometimes love bad guys.the stereotype about this movie was gone now. It is thanks to the nice sound track(very romantic), and Josh's touching acting.Before I say this is brilliant movie, I also want to say this is very well -made love story.

This movie was Horrible! should not have been made,"how do i start? there's so much to say. first of all every piece of dialogue was unnatural and forced. good actors with bad acting. it attempted to by witty, clever, and hip, but failed. its weak canned attempts to be humorous was stiff and unoriginal and just made the movie unrealistic and corny. so once the ""cleverness"" of the whole plot came to a head it didn't hit you hard cuz there was no real build up to it (i could see it coming a mile away regardless of how bad they try to confuse you). i know they thought switching the mood along with the last minute uncoverings would make this original and different but it really just didn't work. in a good mystery they keep you on your seat as they reveal things, this tried to keep you confused until it reveals it at the last minute for a big mind blowing twist. it didn't work because the bulk of the movie fails for lack of overall quality and the pressure of the big ending builds to a disappointingly lame head. if the movie was more realistic the few violent scenes in it would have been more powerful (something that blood and gore cant do on its own) instead they seemed out of place in a corny movie, where they were supposed to be some of the saving grace when the realism was sacrificed for the sad clichéd humor and super villain crap. this movie was a pot of gumbo that didn't end up stewing well, maybe because its gumbo from applebees or denny's (corprorate money maker) instead of some homemade from the soul mix (independant). i'm just saying that it is a big budget movie that attempts to look original, entertaining, unformulaic, and fresh but it ends up being the opposite of all those. its get shorty 3 mixed with some the unusual suspects, with a dash of horse manure. i was watching it as a movie to pass some time, and i still feel like my time was wasted. smart film consumers please watch with caution or avoid.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Hey don't rag too hard on Josh Hartnett,"I agree with the above sentiments about the movie in general. And I too, thought from the trailer previews that the least interesting character/actor was Josh Hartnett and I thought it was a bad casting move. But I went to see the film anyway, because it just looked like it might be cool and I was surprised by Josh. He had previously come off a little ""white bread"" midwest uninteresting in his first coming out. But after laying low for awhile and getting a fresh start, I thought he did rather well, and I found him quite charming with some great chemistry with Lucy Liu who was sparkling. I loved them together. And he was believable in the later developments of the plot - I was impressed. Of course, the two best actors in the movie were the illustrious Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley, (who shone even with one hand behind their backs, so to speak - this wasn't Shakespeare) And their scene together was a nice piece of work to find in the midst of the slick and style of the rest of the film.

Vapid Trash Slick Flick,"Lucky Number Slevin is one of those films that looks slick as snails but has a worse setup than a stunt in Jackass. In an effort to look and and feel cool, it negates that one thing that makes a cool film, which is a great plot line with some snazzy unforeseen twist(s) and witty dialogue. However, within the first twenty minutes, the plot and twist was obvious to anyone with half a brain, leaving the slickness of the film to pick up the slack but without one notable line of speech by any of the great range of actors, by the time the ""revelation"" is revealed at the end of the film, you just want let out a sigh and wonder why Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsly, Bruce Willis and Lucy Liu have put their names to such trash.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

A sub par Snatch\ Lock Stock rip off,"Following the recommendation of a friend of mine I wound up watching this ""brilliant"" crime drama. Having barely resisted the temptation to walk out, I felt like warning others to stay away from this ordeal. As suspected this is yet another movie with plenty of violence, complicated plot twists and a barrage of dull characters from the seedy criminal underworld of New York city. But what worked rather well in the Guy Ritchie films completely backfires in this film, making it the biggest flop I have seen in quite a while. The attempt to capture the sharp and cool dialog of said films is pitiful, and listening to it resembles being whacked in the head by a blunt object. The film is edited in an apparent pretext to increase suspense by hiding critical information from the viewer, this was done however in a terribly annoying manner. By the second half of the movie the plot twists cause one to loose all remaining sympathy for the characters, and replaces it with pure disdain. I can not help but wonder how great actors like Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman got mixed up in this embarrassment. My guess is currency had something to do with it. In short save your money for a more enjoyable activity, like going to the dentist.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

Everybody in the cast does such a good job especially Josh Hartnett, Lucy Liu, Morgan Freeman, and Ben Kingsley, they are having so much fun with their roles and as a result so is the audience. I won't get too much into the plot just so you can see it for yourself, there are many twists and turns that you could either go with or not go with, but I did.

Great Movie,"This was probably the best movie I have seen in the past 3 years. Bruce Willis is always awesome, but particularly here. Amazing.

The bald guy from X-MEN (dont know his name either, sry) was hilarious. Witty dialog, nice action, great camera work. Only thing stopping this from a full out 10 is that my theater was full and a fat guy spilled his drink on me. Honestly, i cant list any improvements.

Useless.There is one part, with Bruce Willis in, recounting a story, which is OK. Quite good actually. But enough balance - this film sucks SERIOUS RECTUM. All of the dialogue is knowing ""banter"" and ""wordplay"" that, rather than leaving me chuckling in Oscar Wilde-esquire irony, leaves me taking the DVD out of my player and doing something more pleasurable, like pulling out all my own fingernails.This piece of crap makes ""Batman and Robin"" look acceptable. It makes ""GIGLI"" look reasonably good! I managed to sit through 75% of Gigli on TV, including the end, and I could only make it through 50% of this.OK, if the director quit half-way through, and the second half was a musical, then I have seriously wronged this production, but I doubt it.I didn't think you could assemble this much talent for a turkey quite this bad.You can.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

The most Tarantino film that isn't the real deal,"I actually wouldn't have been surprised to find out that this film was at least partially created by Quentin Tarantino. It's not as gory as his usual fare, but it has a lot of his usual elements in it. Outlandish situation, great and memorable characters, lots of quirky dialogues and it even has one of his trademark actor, in this case Bruce Willis, in an important side role.And this isn't a bad thing at all and I'm not saying that Paul McGuigan is ripping off Tarantino. Quite the opposite. It's great that there's another director out there that can produce a film of this quality and style. Because make no mistake, this is a great film. Easily one of the best I've seen in a long time.What captures me the most are the dialogues and the characters. The whole situation about two mobster at war with one another is nothing new, but it's taken to such extremes that it becomes something new altogether. It's something straight out of a pulp story or a comic book, but in a good way. It's outlandish enough that you can sit back and enjoy, because you don't have to treat it like it's supposed to be 100 percent accurate, but it's real enough that you remain invested in the fates of its players. The same with dialogues. Weird and odd enough to capture your attention, but also fun and quirky enough to keep that attention.The plot is also surprising, unravels at the right pace and keeps you hooked till the very end. There are a few inconsistencies in the whole setup of two mobster silently glaring at each other across the street while their minions wage war beneath their feet, but it's nothing that would ruin the movie for you.What we have here is pure, undiluted fun. It's a movie of great characters, undeniable charisma and memorable scenes that all come together to form a cohesive whole. See it if you haven't already.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Lucky Number Slevin,"After his recent flops, Wicker Park and The Reckoning, Brit director Paul Mcguigan returns to Gangster No.1 territory with this clever gangster flick, and boy is it clever...Starting off as a story of mistaken identity, the film takes a perhaps obvious twist three quarters of the way through and becomes something entirely different, but you'll have to watch it to find out what, no spoilers here! Josh Hartnett plays Slevin, an innocent man in the wrong place at the wrong time who gets caught up in a bitter gang feud between The Boss (Freeman) and Schlomo (Kingsley). He is told that he owes each gang leader a large sum of money and must do each side a favor to cancel the debt.The film plays out like a pulp fiction novel with a British flair and comparisons with Guy Ritchie's Revolver can be easily made, though this film is far superior in every department. While Revolver had some clever dialogue, a lot of what was spoken seemed forced and trying too hard to be clever. Lucky Number Slevin never comes across like that, the dialogue is sharp and witty and has some of the best lines found at the cinema this year.The acting is also top notch, while the jury is still out on Hartnett, he puts in a solid performance here that matches his excellent but brief role in Sin City. Freeman plays against type and plays the villain, but imbues him with his natural charm to create the impression of a mob boss that becomes far more dangerous the more you warm to him. Kingsley is also good and Bruce Willis has a fantastic screen presence as a mostly silent assassin.This is the film Revolver tried and failed to be. A sharply written, superbly directed American gangster flick with a British influence, Lucky Number Slevin is a film that shows that talented director Paul McGuigan is back to his very best, highly recommended.http://www.filmcritic.zoomshare.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
A unique combo of wit and plot,"The matter of fact dialog (""I bet it was that mouth that got you that nose""), is dead pan clever and carries both the theme of misdirection as well as the plot. Having few DVDs on the shelf where the dialog is the style of the film, I appreciate this even more. Josh Hartnet's coy act along with Lucy Liu's adorable ""girl-next-door-slash- Columbo"" routine, allows us to have a sympathetic rooting interest while the gangster portion of the plot is both comic and bold as we're introduced to the serious history of the main players. Hated the wall papered sets, liked the camera movement in telling the story from present - to history - back to present and appreciated the Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley personas as they told their story and acted their perspectives as dueling criminal kingpins. But those sets were distracting at best....",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
this movie i liked...,"u guys, i don't understand what more u could ask for from a film? intense action, HILLARIOIUS scenes, and i mean hilarious, even the most serious instances will make you start cracking up laughing, a beautiful Asian, and of course there is the ever intense Bruce Willis. this movie was so well scripted, this is proved in many scenes. Bruce and Morgan Freeman are AMAZING, both of which are in this film, and prove that acting is an art not just a hobby. actors of this callibar deserve a chance at the Oscars. josh hartnett is okay, just medium, i think this role was mostly written for the likes of Brad Pitt, but we got stuck with hartnett instead. lucy lu is HOT, bruce is intense, the rabbi is amazing, the two black henchman are just something to fall in love with as soon as u watch the film, this movie is definitely worth two or three watches, there are SO many little easter eggs in it, see if u can catch em all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Not The Usual Suspects good, but good","This movie is a movie all about the ending. When I was watching it through, I was weirded out by the lame dialogue. Instead of just talking, they would dance around what they had to say and then about 50 seconds later, they would say it.The acting was great, but Lucy Liu or whoever was annoying. She never shut up.The directing was great, it always somewhat confused you, but wouldn't make you have to replay the scene in your head to understand it. Unless, of course, you are stupid or the president.The music was OK, nothing that would top John Williams, but it fit.The plot was sweet, but like i said before, the dialogue had some holes that needed to be filled in.But in the end, you just are forced into liking the movie. The right amount of people die, and the entire story of the past and present fit together like clockwork.So I'd say that it is probably the best movie this year so far, and to definitely see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"

I Have More Fun Thinking on my Problems,"I enjoy quick movies, heist movies and smart movies with great dialogs. I expected to see something like that in this movie, although I didn't knew the director's nature nor career.Boy, was I disappointed. Isn't this a real wanna be movie? I did understand it from head to bottom, but It didn't impress me at all! Maybe it is because of the poor intensity with which the characters were written. I never felt nothing for either Slevin nor her fast-talking Chinese neighbor. He could die and I wouldn't give a thing.The plot left me a huge taste of deja vu. Seen it, and enjoyed it. Basing itself on stereotypes, characters that draw themselves on unfunny fast conversations; with a humor that's far from universal. It's not even humor. Less if pieces of board with no common sense like the characters in the film digress into them.The twist disengages you completely from the movie, thinking that with the poor story awfully developed into snoozing stages we will be interested into it. The character explaining it all to the camera did it for me. Didn't have fun, didn't bring me anything new. I really ask you to rent it if you are in a HUGE crave of fun, and all other options are exhausted. Watch ""The Usual Suspects"" instead. A lot more mature.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Lucky Number Slevin Rocks!,"I just saw this flick on night shift, and I can't believe how anyone who truly watched give it a bad on the reviews.This one rocks. I have not seen anything remotely entertaining like this recently. OK, it starts a little bit on a clumsy note, what with horses, some sex, and a couple of murders, but these immediately sets you on course.What the first 45minutes of LNS does is to promise you a journey, take you halfway, and get you lost. Then you ultimately begin finding your way, or at least trying to...Well, to truly enjoy this, you need to be extra-attentive, I mean pay ultimate attention to clues, (you 're gonna need them in the end) watch out for the camera fading on things, elevators, finger rings, wrist watches, and just try to lock onto the puzzle, by the 60th minute, you ' ll find your way.I liked the performance of the girl Lindsey best on this movie although everyone did their roles perfectly, and yeah, there loads of one-liners here. The dialogue was simple, but well delivered enough to keep you stuck on. The storyline here wasn't bad but kudos to the direction, they made it all come out.Maybe this won't win an Oscar ( & why not:) but it is grand entertainment from play to the end....SEE IT!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
What a great movie,"I wouldn't say that this was an original, rather that it mixes some of the best bits from some truly great movies. Thats not to say it feels like a fake, it has a character all of it's own. Willis plays a good part, though he always plays a great part, albeit variations on the same one. Josh Hartnett is excellent and Sir Ben and Morgan Freeman also play themselves, superbly. Lucy Liu is something of a revelation to me, as i thought she was rubbish in kill bill, the only film i have seen here in previous to this. Plots good, clever and twisty, get it, you will enjoy it. Don't expect anything particularly new in plot variations, rather, view it as a masterclass of the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Pleasantly Surprised (small spoiler warning),"I never thought I'd see the day I would like a film starring Josh Hartnett, but Morgan Freeman stole the show! This film has plenty of surprises lurking around various corners, a strong line-up of actors, one plot going head on against another plot, Ben Kingsley with a beat-up accent and the sexy and beautiful Lucy Liu.I like to think that Stanley Tucci could have done more with his character, or maybe he just can't pull off the ""bad cop"" routine, and Bruce Willis got to use what he learned during The Jackal.If you like movies like Snatch and Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, this is a must see for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Chaos Theory - all will become clear,"Lucky Number Slevin is a great stylish action with interesting and well thought out parts and is bursting with many great Hollywood actors including Josh Hartnett for the leading role. The film has a sometimes complicated and fast paced plot where you can loose yourself sometimes but great none the less. Lucky Number Slevin is the sort of film where at the end of the film everything 'should' fall into place and become clearer.To simplify (without spoiling) Slevin (Hartnett) finds himself at the wrong place at the wrong time and ends up within gang business.Blending great actors and acting, a few laughs, gun's n' ammo, and a wonderful, exciting, chaotic plot, all a movie lover needs to slap a cheesy smile on their face in enough time to find another flick..8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
"Intricate, involving, thought provoking, and interesting - one of the best of 2006","Lucky Number Slevin is one of the best mystery thrillers to come out in a long time. I highly enjoyed it because of the originality behind it, the wonderful writing (Jason Smilovic), and because Josh Hartnett finally delivered in a performance. Paul McGuigan directs this crime/thriller/mystery to near perfection. With a brilliant cast, it's definitely one of the best films of the year.Slevin (Hartnett) is not really having the best of days. After arriving in New York, he finds himself accidentally tangled in a web of problems involving him with the two biggest crime lords in NYC, The Boss (Oscar Winner Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi (Oscar Winner Sir Ben Kingsley). Add in a mysterious and ruthless assassin (Golden Globe Winner Bruce Willis), a nosy detective (Stanley Tucci), and a cute neighbor (Lucy Lui), Slevin has a very full plate for the next few days.Let me start with the lead actor, Josh Hartnett. For so long, we've been waiting for this 'next big star' to break out, and he finally delivers in L#S. He makes Slevin cool, likable, and just straight up bad-ass...all those factors make Slevin one of the coolest characters of the year. Freeman and Kingsley give another pair of great performances, not surprisingly, as does Willis. With L#S, it's 3 great films in a row for Willis, with Sin City and 16 Blocks being the others. Lucy Lui is likable as Slevin's neighbor, and she and Hartnett seem to have nice chemistry as they work well together. I didn't really like Stanley Tucci's character, but that doesn't mean he was bad. He did his job in making his character one that you don't really care for that much.I simply loved Jason Smilovic's writing. It's simply brilliant, providing all kinds of twists and turns, making it all come together in the end, much like you've just untangled a quadruple knotted shoelace. Only veteran moviegoers will be able to predict Smilovic's excellent writing. This is the strongest point of the film. Paul McGuigan's direction is good, but nowhere near Smilovic's writing. McGuigan does the thing that most directors had problems with: getting the best out of Josh Hartnett. McGuigan's scenes are nicely cut, but I wish he would have made The Boss's room a little more modern. I think it was supposed to be like it was for the character, but I think most will agree that the boss's room looks odd in 2006. Except that chess set.All in all, 'Lucky Number Slevin' is a true winner, one of the best crime thrillers in years, with an unthinkable twist at the end that rivals those of 'Saw' and 'Memento'. I highly enjoyed it, and I know I'll see it several more times. I recommend you see it too. Due to the sometimes graphic sexual content and some language, this film shouldn't be seen by anyone under 16.9/10 --spy",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
more than I expected,Just finished watching Lucky number Slevin what can i say except wow this film is more than good this film is excellent.a man named Slevin is mistaken by 2 feuding gangsters (played by Morgan freeman and Ben Kingsley)for nick fisher now they want him dead. the story has a lot more than that but i don't want to say anymore because i would ruin it for everyone.lucky number Slevin is good on more than one level it has some neat action brilliant plot good acting and some funny parts.it is sort of like a very black comedy it has serious moments though. lucky number is also very violent and not one for the kids.9 out of 10 very enjoyable.,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Good Crime Mystery which doesn't convince the whole way through.,"There's a few points which had me thinking that either they were trying too hard, didn't make it fully believable, it was too random or it was not executed in the best way.

A great revival of the suspense thriller,"This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire length.

Me and my gal left this movie feeling as wired as drinking a pot of coffee, each.Bruce Willis has a commanding presence in the film and Freeman has the mysterious dangerous air about him, but its Josh who really shines. He portrays the character so well and keeps you riveted to the screen to see what happens next, and more importantly, why.If you are looking for a flick that will keep you guessing the entire way and make you love it as you sit on only the front part of the chair eyes glued to the screen, Lucky Number Slevin is it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
ooh so clever!,There's an obvious cast of highly respected a-list actors and actresses here and each one has given a performance to nearly if not the best of their capabilities. I'm not just going to explain the story as you can read it in the blurb although i will say just as you think you have figured out the twist and that you know what is going to happen you find you are wrong to a high level and a new piece of the puzzle appears. Iv got to say that Josh Hartnett makes a great main character and from this movie has made me respect him more. Lucy Lui takes a step back with just a supporting role and is convincing in that as well. All in all this is a enjoyable film that will leave you well entertained!!!,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
ingenious crime pic with surprising twists,"Lucky Number Slevin is a crime thriller with well-known actors and hilarious names of characters. Jason Smilovic has provided screenplay with enigmatic, precisely planned plot. The storyline is quite convoluted, but not to such an extent that an average viewer could not understand it. The dialogue is witty and quotable. In addition, to my astonishment Paul McGuigan (director of dull The Wicker Park) directs efficiently and keeps a fast pace throughout the film, which is to my mind crucial in this kind of flicks. The well-casted actors did a great job. In particular, Sir Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman are amazing as leaders of gangs fighting each other. Josh Hartnett also plays surprisingly well and convincingly. Among the minor vices of the film one can rate: an unnecessary love thread and a bit unoriginal (but surprising) plot. All in all, Lucky Number Slevin is an ingenious crime pic with numerous surprising twists.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Mystery"
Painfully overdone.,"This movie tries entirely too hard to be clever. Everything that comes out of Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, or Lucy Liu's mouth is clearly written with the intent of attracting reviews that describe the movie as 'witty' or 'clever'. There's no real substance to this movie, or anything the characters say. The way the characters present themselves is unbelievably annoying. If you enjoy *good* movies, I don't recommend this. If you enjoy slashers, teen comedies, or possibly romantic comedies, this might be more up your ally.

Laughable,"I think this movie was a complete rip-off of The Usual Suspects with a Pulp Fiction wannabe humor/pace. The fact that it keeps you guessing till the end does not make it interesting.

Payback meets pulp fiction,"It may start out pretty slow, but if you keep looking for 15 to 20 minutes it picks up the pace. This gangster movie was very well directed and full with details. The best way to describe it is to see it as a mixture of Payback (1999) and Pulp Fiction (1994). The faint of heart shouldn't watch this movie as the violence is quite direct. Oh, but the story is great! Slevin ( Josh Hartnett - The Faculty, Black Hawk Down) is not so lucky. He gets mistaken for his good buddy Nick Fisher and now gets in trouble with the two biggest kingpins in town aka The Boss (Morgan Freeman - Se7en, Amistad) and The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley - Sneakers, Schindler's List).

"This movie is okay, but it's a far cry from a masterpiece.","I had read good things about this movie, and so I was prepared to like it a whole lot. But, alas, it was not to be.

The people giving this movie a 10/10 (at last count, 25.2% of IMDb voters who rated this movie gave it a 10) are morons with bad taste who need to watch more movies, plus they are liars because even a mongoloid could tell you that this movie wasn't anything close to a masterpiece. But dumb people will love this movie and confuse its idiotic and convoluted plot for brilliance. On the other hand, I liked the cast. However, Oscar winners alone do not a good movie make.

I wish this was more popular,"I could care less about the cast, whether they are A List celebrities or not it doesn't matter. A movie can be great without a star packed cast. But these are people who have been around the Hollywood block and Sir Ben Kingsly sure knows how to play a great role. This is my favorite movie of all time, are there better ones out there as far as cinematic value and legendary statuses? Sure, but I can't explain why this had me at the edge of my seat. How the guy who annoys everyone by guessing the big twist at the end of any movie, and being right all the time, can't figure this one out. They didn't make it obvious but they didn't hide it all too well. I guess I was immersed in the story to much to pay attention.Either way this movie just hit me right on the head with enjoyment. It has its small bits of action which I loved. I don't need an explosion every 5 minutes to keep my attention and I hate it when everything ends in gunfire and crappy one liners. It has suspenseful moments that truly make you giddy with anticipation. It has its drama which will require more empathy if you can provide such immersion when watching movies.But what it does best is its twist ending. It's not all in your face like M Night Shamalyn.... Shamamalyeen I don't know the guy that did Six Sense. Ohhhh he's an amazing director for that movie and deserves more respect, no thanks not from me. I paid... ahem sorry WASTED 15 bucks too see The Village in theaters and if you saw that movie you'll know why I hate him. And Avatar the Last Airbender. Either way this twist is slick with it's entrance and it fits so right with the movie. Every thing about this movie is absolutely awesome in my mind.
