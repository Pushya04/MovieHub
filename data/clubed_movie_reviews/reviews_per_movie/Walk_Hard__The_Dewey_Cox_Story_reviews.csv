Hysterical and Clever movie!,"""Walk Hard"" is a clever parody of the life of a rock-star, and bio-pics such as ""Walk the line"", ""Ray"" and ""La Bamba"". It follows the formula nearly perfectly, and follows fake rock-star legend Dewey Cox (and yes, they do have plenty of puns with his name, but this is to be expected) through his life in the 50's, 60's, 70's and into today.The surprise of ""Walk Hard"" is that although it was written by the guys who made ""Superbad"" and ""Knocked Up"", and has the ""formula spoof"" similar to ""Scary Movie"" and ""Epic Movie"", this film manages to be quite intelligent, and manages to avoid overly gross out humor. While it has its share of gross out and slapstick gags, it isn't completely idiotic, while movies such as ""Epic Movie"" or ""Talladega Nights"" tend to be totally moronic and disgusting. The humor here is very observational, self-parodying, ironic, surreal, dark and often hysterical.The reason why ""Walk Hard"" works well is because of its somewhat wicked sense of humor. It manages to ironically ""overdue"" the jokes to the point that you can see the actual funny part is that it is being overdone and over-the-top. It self implies that something is going to go bad, and makes the audience clearly see what path the scene is heading towards, which is also another part of its sense of humor.The performances are very good as well. John Reilly plays Dewey very well, and his naive but good natured persona often plays out hysterically in contrast to a society often attempting to harm him. His character does lack some substance and emotional depth, though this is to be expected in the humorous nature of the film, and is the writing, not the acting. He plays the role from ages 14 to 71, and the goofy age difference between Reilly and how old of a character he is playing is another one of the film's ironic self-aware quirky jokes, in which he constantly reminds us of his age throughout the film so we can see this, as well as the purposely awkward looking make-up.Jenna Fischer is great as his love interest and duet partner, a parody of Reese Witherspoon in ""Walk the Line"", who falls on and off for Dewey throughout the movie based on his life decisions, another movie formula clich√©. Tim Meadows is hysterical as Cox' drug-addict drummer and long time friend, with all of his lines being in a tongue-in-cheek and smart-ass manner, and a hysterical repetition of scenes where he introduces Cox to drugs.All in all, the only problem with this movie is that it is quite uneven. The movie seems to spend a large time dealing with Dewey's life in the 50's, not spending much time in the 60's, 70's or 90's, and spending no time in the 80's. It jumps into his problem a bit fast and doesn't go into depth into some areas of his life as much as others.However, despite being somewhat uneven, ""Walk Hard"" remains a very entertaining, very funny, and witty movie. It is quite tragic that this opening weekend went up against the liking of nearly 4 very popular movies, resulting in a box office failure of this film. Hopefully next week, or in the future to come, this gem of a comedy (A rare thing in 2007), can be seen and gain a reputation among others.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Dewey Cox: Riley makes him real,"Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (rated R). Directed by Jake Kasden. Written by Judd Apatow and Jake Kasden. Starring John C. Reilly, Jenna Fischer, Raymond J. Berry, Kristen Wiig, Tim Meadows, Harold Ramis & Chris Parnell. Running Time: 96 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW:Like the film Ray (2004), a young boy and his brother frolic in the bucolic wonderland of the American South of the 1930s. Like Walk the Line (2005), a young man leaves his loving mother and hateful father to find solace in his music. Like... well, you get the idea. This film is primarily a send-up of the musical bio-pic, as Dewey Cox (Riley) channels nearly every rock icon that ever took the stage... from Dylan, Cash, Orbison, and Presley to Brian Wilson. Like his fellow rock stars, Dewey is often tempted by drugs and sex. In a hilarious motif, he is constantly opening a door and finding his drummer, Sam (Meadows), behind it with sexy backup singers and the latest drug of choice. ""You don't want any part of this s**t,"" Sam says, and proceeds to tell Dewey all of the drug's benefits. Despite their wayward ways, Dewey and his band are discovered by a trio of Hasidic Jews and begin to record a remarkable string of number-one hits. As he cruises the decades like Forrest Gump with a guitar, Dewey meets all of his legendary contemporaries, played by uncredited actors you are likely to recognize. Watch especially for Lennon, McCartney and Buddy Holly.REVIEW: 3 out of 4 Java MugsWhat is remarkable about this movie is the way we feel about the main character, Dewey Cox. It's easy to find sympathy for the likes of Johnny Cash and Ray Charles because we knew them as real people. But why do we feel so strongly about a singer we know does not really exist? Some of the credit goes to the filmmakers, who know which emotional buttons to push, but mostly we have Riley to thank. In an amazing portrayal, he takes what could have been a spoof-worthy sap and turns him into a fully developed character we really care about. Riley actually becomes Dewey Cox, by singing his heart out and even helping to write many of the film's songs.Other performances are also worthy of note, particularly Fischer's sultry Darlene, Wiig's ever-pregnant Edith and Meadows' drug-addled drummer.Though Riley's singing is quite good, it is still nice to have the likes of Lyle Lovett, Jackson Browne, Jewel, Ghostface Killah and Eddie Vedder playing themselves and singing those Dewey Cox originals. But none of the music was as brilliant as an early scene with Honeyboy Edwards singing the blues.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Watching it again and again.,"Absolutely hilarious film. It might be the best parody-music biopic ever made, with amazing talent, excellent music and great, funny lines.
Rewatch-ability is high. There are so many jokes in there and so much good music and acting, which make me wonder how come this film was not more popular back then. John C Reily is a multitalented actor and a great comedian overall and carries this film right from the start.
I guess that some folks didn't like the walk-the-line Johnny Cash film parody moments and that maybe got the film some negative comments. Reily however does a great deal of respect to the artist and furthermore he sings on each track with his own amazing voice. Impressive, heartful and hilarious! Walk Hard.

Cal Naughton Jr. no longer finishing second,"Oh yes this movie was funny. I didn't have many expectations, if any, of this movie, but it certainly delivered. I knew from the trailers and ads that the movie was going to parallel if not parody ""Walk the Line"", but there were also several references to ""Ray"". I would say one of the funniest references to ""Ray"" was Dewey Cox losing his sense of smell.Initially it looked like the movie would be very cheesy with punchlines being telegraphed well ahead of time. But, even with the punchlines being blatantly set up, it was better to go with the transparent set up instead of the thinly veiled set ups that a lot of comedies use.Interestingly enough there was not much profanity which made its usage that much funnier. Now, I certainly could've done without the male nudity, but maybe that was only in the unrated version. Even still, by and large John C. Reily held his own and the movie was terrific.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
possibly best comedy ever,"I've watched this movie around 50 times. Literally one of the funniest movies ever made. It would be great if it was a movie that kids could enjoy as well, but that is my only complaint. 100% adult themes and shows way too much for a responsible parent to allow children to watch.When I was a kid we had Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and Porky's. This is a hilarious movie, and I suggest watching it repeatedly since there will be a lot of things you will catch and fall over laughing at if you understand the movie at all. John C Reilly comes into a class A acting role with this one. And deserves it.Great music as well as amazing acting. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. Love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Lots Of Laughs, Entertaining But Another Crude Comedy","I got a lot of laughs out of this film but I warn those that his another modern-day crude comedy. It's definitely not ""family viewing."" It's a parody on ""Walk The Line,"" the biography of Johnny Cash with John C. Reilly playing the famous singer. He is extremely funny in this role but the humor is the absurd, dark variety.....so be ready for that!It's really a parody of the rock 'n roll/folk/psychedelic scene, more than anything, from the beginnings in the mid 50s up to the present. The majority of the film deals with the late '50s and up to the '70s. You get a lot of ""digs"" at folk singers, Bob Dylan and then The Beatles. It's pretty innocent and very funny. The lyrics to songs are hilarious. You also get a lot jibes as Cash and his relationship with his girlfriend-then-wife, June Carter. That latter is played by a pretty and very sexy Jenna Fisher.What isn't innocent are the sex, drugs and adultery jokes. Some of them are funny; some are way too silly or just plain crude and unnecessary....but that's comedies of today. I mean, we don't need to see repeated shots of a guy's penis, do we? Actually, the film only goes way overboard, language-and sex-wise, in the last 30 minutes when a bunch of f-bombs are yelled out and the story goes into the sewer....before coming out with a nice, sentimental ending. I guess that was supposed to make up for the all the sleaze. It didn't; but it still was an entertaining film which flew by.One last thing: the music in here is excellent. Some think it's the best part of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"First Half Funny, Second Half Terrible","There's reason this film bombed when it came out. It starts off strong, a skewering of Walk the Line.But they obviously ran out of material and desperately threw together anything they could come up with. The second half is just awful. What doesn't work:Lame Beatles jokes.Lame Beach Boys jokes.Lame Dylan jokes.Lame protest song and hippie jokes.All of them were uninspired, predictable, and unfunny.At the 45 minute mark, fast forward to the last 5 minutes.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Deserves so much more recognition,"Very surprised to see the IMDB rating for this one. It definitely deserves a higher score. The humour is often crude might not be everyone's cup of tea but you can easily compare it other movies in a similar over the top comedy-type genre like Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Step-Brothers etc. This one in my opinion is the best one out of all them. There were a few jokes that didn't land as great as they could but overall, this is was a non stop laugh out loud movie for me and all the people I have ever watched it with.-John C Reilly's performance is amazing. Despite the fact that his character is unimaginably out of touch with the world surrounding him, he makes it look so believable. He is the perfect fit for this type of character and you can see, he put a lot of improv in the scenes and made it his own thing.-The pacing of the movie is great. Its very clever in the way it depicts the cliches of music biography movies. It heavily underlines all the overused motifs in the genre (the neglecting father, the wife/lover perturbations, addiction to fame and money) but but makes them very genuine, in a way that the viewer doesn't get detached from the Dewie's story.
 
-And the biggest star of the movie: The music. The songs are great, they're funny, catchy and really well performed. Each song captures the essence of its times and pushes the story forward. I would dare to say they could easily hang with some of the biggest scores from Hollywood musicals. This why this movie works so much better than the more recent ""Popstar"" with Adam Sandberg, which made a similar effort in mocking the perks of being a music star. In that movie, the songs are well written and funny, but never seem like the real deal. In ""Walk Hard"", you can actually see how the songs could be hits in the movie's universe. All of them have great replay value and make the movie very rewatchable. There's the career breaking song, the falling out of fame song, even a Bob Dylan parody witch is hilarious. Its just a clever and enjoyable commentary on the history of music.All in all you should just watch it, if you haven't. I often skip movies if I see a lower than 7 rating on IMDB. You should not skip this one if you enjoy other Jud Apatow style comedies. Even if you've never been a fan of them, this one might change that!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"A solid parody, but over-produced and over-the-top","Apatow Productions had a terrific 2007 and then ""Walk Hard"" happened. At least they know it--$35 M budget and a total gross of less than $20 M. While the musical biopic parody is an idea that certainly among other parody options is fitting for this decade, Apatow productions learned that success will come with originality. That and not to a release a film like this at Christmas time.""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" stars John C. Reilly in an hour and a half romp through his life as a musician beginning in the 1950s. Spoofing all other music biopics, Cox finds his way into love affairs, drugs and much much more. A lot of the parody jokes get overplayed and redundant, but some are definitely spot on. It definitely feels like an Apatow script, only this time with director/writer and friend of Apatow's Jake Kasden getting his say.""Walk Hard"" is star-studded. There are an unbelievable amount of cameos from Apatow's trademark crew as well as stars from Saturday Night Live and others not usually in his movies that make an appearance in the film. The amount of familiar faces makes the film seem incredibly over-produced and some of the shortest scenes appear to have an unnecessary amount of money put into them.The film does have more humor in many respects than ""Talladega Nights,"" but by no means comes close to matching up with ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad."" While those two films are somewhat more poignant and true-to-life, ""Walk Hard"" relies excessively on ridiculousness to be funny, more so than any of the Apatow predecessors.In short, ""Walk Hard"" is funny and at times clever, but mostly just over-the-top and dumb. Every turn is a left turn and while many are applaudable, some are just downright weird.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
I am stunned into absolute silence!,"Prior to attending a showing of ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" I consulted the IMDb as I always do to see what other viewers thought of the movie. I was pleased to see it received 7 our of 10 stars. Now after seeing this piece of trash I will be forever skeptical of the rankings viewers give movies on this site. I never thought I would cry in this movie but I did. I cried when I realized I wasted $8 on this piece of crap. There were plenty of jokes and a lot of gags but none of them worked. NONE of them made me laugh. In fact the entire theater of about 80 customers sat in silence throughout this movie. Generally ANY movie will have one or two morons that laugh at every profanity or every drug reference, but this movie never elicited a single audible laugh from ANYONE in the theater. I cannot believe that one reviewer even compared it to ""This is Spinal Tap""--a movie I consider one of the funniest and most innovative of the past thirty years. This was definitely NO ""Spinal Tap""!!! The site gags were not funny, the set ups for most jokes were ridiculous, and the pay-offs simply didn't work. I could tell that on paper these jokes must have appeared hilarious but on the big screen they simply fell flat. Granted, there were a couple of catchy tunes, but if that is all you are looking for, simply buy the soundtrack and save yourself the ordeal of sitting through two hours of torture. I gave this movie 1 star only because IMDb didn't allow me to actually give it MINUS points--which it deserved. AVOID at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Starts off brilliant, but dries up","Yeah, I really loved its absurdist humour a lot of the time, but it really dries up by the end and I really didn't find myself laughing as much as I did at the beginning of the film. About the time the film starts jumping ahead in time really dramatically, it starts losing its funny, and the end jokes nearly all fall flat. The musical numbers are terrific, though, simultaneously being hilarious while also being honest-to-goodness great songs in their own right. The Let's Duet montage is brill. And, of course, there's the wonderfully random stuff, like John C. Reilly playing himself at age 14, or the mockingly melodramatic acting of Tim Meadows and Jenna Fischer, or the shocking full-frontal male nudity, which is so obviously an attempt to receive surprise laughter that it's a pretty fantastic joke. If only the film had sustained its momentum, it could have been one of the best comedies of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Wait and see,"I just got back from round two with this film. ""Walk Hard' the second go around made me laugh, but alas I don't think it is a comedy classic. It is however very funny especially if you know your rock music history and have seen a fair amount of music biopics.Director Jake Kasdan continues his streak of making films that seem to be made for me, ie The Zero Effect and The T.V. Set (except Orange County which just sucked) Kasdan, bless his soul, isn't interested in making comedies that appeal to a broad audience. I find his movies very refreshing and pretty darn witty. Walk Hard continues the tradition. This time however, he does have Judd Apatow helping out. So ""Walk Hard"" is rife with all sorts of lowbrow humour as well. All of it is pretty funny. The film has lulls, but in this day and age of lazy spoofs like ""Scary Movie"" I can forgive them.John C. Reilly nails this performance. He plays the movie silly (it is a very silly movie) yet his character still feels pretty genuine.That genuine aspect probably makes the movie work for me. The songs are good. Kasdan and Apatow obviously have a love for the material. It's good that contemporary film makers are taking cues from Brooks and the Zucker brothers and showing a lot of love for the material while spoofing it. Something that other spoof movies fail at miserably.So all in all...if you are a fan of all sorts of music.. Beatles to Beach Boys to Punk Rock...you just gotta see this movieFor everyone else...still pretty darn funny end kdc",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Bring on the parody,"And if there is a musical genre out there short of orchestral symphony, it gets sent up by this wonderful comedy.Not a movie for the kiddies by a long shot, but if you are familiar with music artists from the 50s on, and especially if you lived through those periods of time, the parody of styles and stars will leave you with sore sides from laughing.Make sure to listen closely to every lyric. They don't miss a chance to make jokes subtle or broad, and they don't take it easy on anyone.Songs in the credits are just as funny as songs through the body of the movie, so make sure to wait around for those rather than switching off after the story itself fades to black.A personal favorite of mine are the scenes where Dewey discovers new drugs. Although I've never taken drugs, even smoked marijuana, these scenes were just too funny to be offensive, especially the first discussion of the weed just named.Be in the mood to watch a comedy, especially for a parody of this type. If you can't really pay attention, you won't get everything, and will just think the movie crude. Also, if you're really stuck up about what's in your comedy, then you may not like this movie.If you're up for it, you'll die laughing.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
funny fictional biography film,"I never heard of this film before watching it on cable. It turned out to be surprisingly funny. This movie is about a fictional musician named Dewey Cox. It sort of follows recent films like the ones about Ray Charles and Johnny Cash. It starts with Dewey as a boy and he is responsible for a horrible accident with his talented brother. It's quite funny as the top half keeps talking. Flash forward to high school. Dewey is now played by John C Reily and he is supposed to be 14. Quite funny. He sings a song that sends people into a tizzy. Next thing you know his married, with a kid, and trying to make it in showbiz. Another really funny thing is whenever Dewey runs into the Tim Meadows character doing drugs. He also says you don't want none of this. Then acts offended if Dewey wants to say no. But as the story goes, Dewey gets hooked on drugs. He gets anther wife and has so many kids he can't keep track of them. He is at odds with his dad.And the songs they come up with are catchy, but silly. The film just en-chances the typical out of control life of a rock star.FINAL VERDICT: Better than expected. Not for kids.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
They've done it again!,"I must admit that I went into this one already thinking it would be another home run by Apatow and the gang. And they did not disappoint. John C. Reily has turned in his most comedic performance to date which is something considering his roles in Talledega Nights and Boogie Nights.Johnny Cash probably is rolling in his grave, but in laughter and not dismay. There are just too many classic moments in this film to label it as a long SNL skit as others have done. IT IS A MUST SEE!I think any review can be summed by saying that this is a comedy rock biopic in the spirit of Spinal Tap with the biting wit of a Mel Brooks film. Just Classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Walking Hard, or Hardly Walking?","Every comedy has its moments, and this Walk Hard doesn't have anything spectacular to make it stand out from all the other passable, but ultimately forgettable, comedies. John C. Reilly plays Dewey Cox, who is basically Johnny Cash... this is, after all, a spoof of a biopic.First of all, the fake Southern accents were a bit much. It was cute at first, but it soon became a little grating and obviously fake. Judd Apatow co-wrote this, but I get the feeling that he's better at doing ""realistic"" comedies. There is absolutely no sense of morality or character development in Walk Hard, unlike in Apatow's previous movies. I'm not saying that every movie needs this, but I left the theater feeling like this could have been a ten-part series on SNL or something. Every switch in scene is just a set-up for another gag, and a lot of moments in Dewey's life are skipped over. Nowhere do characters actually have a conversation with each other for a reason that doesn't involve setting up a joke.I know that John C. Reilly is the ""main man,"" but Tim Meadows got the most laughs from me, including a continuous drug joke. However, absolutely no one laughed at the Incredible Hulk joke. I'm not saying all the jokes were bad, but the pacing of the whole movie was off. Huge chunks of Dewey's life get ignored; Dewey's life is missing a few scenes in my opinion.But before I start getting too negative, I want to say that this movie has some very good jokes, and some good songs, although the hip-hop one was a bit too cheesy. I know a lot of work was put into the songs, and except for the aforementioned rap song, they were well put together. I know that Jewel (what a voice!) Ghostface Killah, Lyle Lovett, and Jackson Browne contribute to the title song ""Walk Hard"" (and I think Jewel sings for Jenna in the duet, although I could be wrong), while Reilly sings all of his songs well. Still, is this Spinal Tap? Not quite. The best song had to be the Bob Dylan spoof, followed closely by a clever little duet with Jenna Fischer. Jenna Fischer plays Dewey's main girl (he sleeps with 411 of them according to the tagline, but we don't really see many of them). Jenna does a pretty good job, but she doesn't get a lot of serious acting here anyway. It was strange seeing in a lot of cute dresses and hair styles. Definitely not the same Jenna you're used to in The Office, that's for sure.Oh, and if you were expecting boatloads of ""Cox"" jokes, the whole middle portion of the movie was seriously lacking in them. I know that Walk Hard doesn't take itself seriously at all, but I got the feeling that if it did, I would have cared more about it. All in all, a slightly above average comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Different style but another great one from Apatow gang,"As a huge fan of the previous Apatow movies, I drove recklessly through traffic to make it into an early screening of Walk Hard, and I'm happy I did. I think this movie is a different direction for Judd and his band, as it is more similar to Airplane in style than it is to Knocked Up. But that impressed me that they took that risk and made it work -- and it definitely worked as me and the rest of the theatre were laughing with regularity.Without getting too much into the details of the movie because I hate spoilers, the thing that made this movie great to me was the unexpected humor. Like Airplane, there are a lot of times when you just don't see the next line coming, and those are the best laughs. Besides John C. Reilly in the lead role, who obviously got a lot of the funniest lines, Tim Meadows as Dewey Cox's drummer really cracked me up, and Paul Rudd as Jon Lennon cracked up the entire theatre.It was definitely one of those movies where you're recalling a lot of funny parts a day later. So while it may be a different type of movie than the Apatow groups' other work, the sense of funny is still there, and I think this is up there with the best comedies of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Funny; Earns R Rating,"""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" made me laugh out loud. It's a sophisticated parody of music biopix. Some of its jokes might be too sophisticated for some viewers. ""Walk Hard"" earns its R rating. There is full frontal nudity, both male and female. This doesn't contribute to the laughs and should have been cut. It will alienate viewers unnecessarily.There are several brilliant cameos, including a Beatles sequence that deserves to be watched more than once. The movie's satire of the concept that Jews control show business is hysterical.After a while, even a series of funny jokes can become wearing; ""Walk Hard"" has no ""realistic"" narrative.

Here's what it looks like when a movie dies on screen,"I laughed once or twice when I saw the first ten mins of this, then had an obligation to attend to. Never saw the rest.

This movie made me laugh throughout, even though the script wasn't well-written and some jokes were lame, old and used. The acting is OK but you won't really notice it since this is a comedy. Unfornately, it's a comedy that's been done many times before. Most of the jokes are very old or just do not fit, or the characters cannot accomplish their effects to the full (as in Judd Apatow's other hits such as ""40 year old Virgin"").

The Third Layer,"I know of only three periods in Americam history when it can be said that the people as a whole, as Americans, were truly noble. Where being was more about ideas, ideals and intents than tribal exclusionism.One of these was the late sixties. If you were there in the midst of it, you would have experienced something that simply cannot be described today ¬ó a sort of group mind that was so shared and shared with better futures that is was often mistaken for spiritual.Much of that reflected and was fed by the music of the time. Folk. Rock, and that quantum edge between that often seemed perfect. So you, dear reader, may have to simply accept on trust that the music of the times, and times themselves, mattered. That's even though the artifacts have been since re-incarnated as ordinary things.Much of that ordinariness has been because of how we have reinvented the story to allow ourselves to handle the disappointment of the futures we ended up with. And a large part of that reinvention has been through movies that retell and reshape.Much of that can be laid at the feet of the slick marketeers behind what has become known as ""country"" music, where the story is in the surrounding wrapper of a metastory: honesty, forthrightness, god and country, guns. (This package comes with the standard negatives: anti-gay, woman, minority, etc.)The unwitting patron saint of this particular reinvention was Johnny Cash, a poor soul swept up in his and our addictions until even after death. That's when we got a particularly revolting biography. We seemed to want it. It has true love, a successful struggle with demons, performances of music to fill in for the thin story. Grimaces and joy.It also trivialized what the music of the era was. It turned a whole social movement into a mere plot device, no different than say a Denzel Washington-coached football championship. The music didn't matter at all. It was the fame that turned lives.(Something similar happened with ""A Beautiful Mind"" where the mathematics was incidental instead of what made the man mad, and along the way changes imagination in and of us all. But few people believe in math, and nearly everyone considers power in music as heavy.)Oddly, our reaction to this trivialization is not to look deeper at the real thing, but to add a third layer of abstraction that further trivializes. I must admit to laughing here and there, especially at the Dylan spoof. But I left the theater wondering if this is all we end up with from this era. Is it merely a joke now? Is this yearning and work already the same level as the fodder for ""Austin Powers?""Kids used to play with toy cars. They weren't real cars, but the play was generally along the lines of what real cars do, sometimes flying, but not as planes ¬ó only cars on air-roads. Then at some point, the cars could transform into robots and the robots themselves conveyed a simple cosmology of good and evil. Play became disembodied, and the connection with reality was lost.This is a transformer movie: three layers removed, transforming what celebrated complexity, subtlety and ambiguity into something manufactured by promoters as a battle of good and evil, and then transformed into a joke.Tom Paine dies again. I'm sure Apatow thinks it is just simple fun, like goofing on Nascar.It seems important that it is not.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Music

Worth seeing for Reilly's fine performance in the lead.,"From Judd Apatow and company comes this certainly very likable movie that parodies standard Hollywood biographies of musical entertainers, taking particular aim at ""Walk the Line"" and ""Ray"" but also working as a skewering of changing musical trends over the decades, as its lead character Dewey Cox (an endearing John C. Reilly) is more than willing to move from one genre to another, and basically do whatever it takes to keep up the rock 'n' roll lifestyle.Dewey Cox has had to deal with a tragic childhood incident which earned him the enmity of his father (Raymond J. Barry). The movie charts Dewey's progress over the years, as he ascends to stardom, becomes addicted to all manner of drugs, antagonizes the people in his life, and ultimately realizes what's truly important and puts his life back together.The Apatow style of comedy is evident as always, alternating between sweet and poignant moments and very adult moments - there's even some nudity. Sometimes it gets a little silly - such as the animated LSD trip sequence - but mostly it's an enjoyable movie that goes far on the abilities of its cast. Reilly, who does his own singing, is well supported by Kristen Wiig as his first wife, Jenna Fischer as the backup singer who becomes his second wife (while he's still married to the first one), Matt Besser and former 'SNL' cast members Tim Meadows & Chris Parnell as his bandmates, and Barry & Margo Martindale as his parents. There are a lot of fun bits along the way, from the likes of Rance Howard, Craig Robinson, Harold Ramis, Jack McBrayer, Ed Helms, Gerry Bednob, David Krumholtz, Jane Lynch, and Simon Helberg. Particularly funny is the stunt casting of people like Frankie Muniz, as Buddy Holly, and Justin Long, Paul Rudd, Jason Schwartzman, and Jack Black as the Beatles! Nice cameos by real life music stars are a treat, as well.There are enough laugh out loud moments to make all of this pleasant enough (at least this never gets truly mean spirited), and as a bonus the music is often genuinely catchy as well as amusing. Overall, good if not great stuff.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Complete Trash,"I walked out of this movie wishing I had my 2 hours back. The movie started out so-so and got steadily worse. This kind of shock-value, low-grade humor makes Airplane II look like Shakespeare. How Roger Ebert could give this a 'B' is beyond me. The only thing more disturbing is knowing that they will have to try and top this with yet more shock value and wondering what else they could pile on - this movie has poop, every English vulgar word, full frontal male and female nudity and graphic depictions of decimated people. Awful.I have to wonder about the people that made this film. Could you really go to the premier of this thing, smiling and proud you were a part of this? What were you thinking Jenna Fischer?!? Who would let their kids act in this thing and say such vulgarity? I'd be ashamed to have my name in the credits on this one. I'm ashamed just to admit I went to this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Apatow nails it again,"There is no doubt that Walk Hard is a great parody of the musician biopic as we know it today. The film is filled with rips and references to movies such as Walk the Line and Ray. Walk Hard does all of this very well, but also has its own brand of humor and jokes that stand on their own. From the time that the opening scene rolled, I knew that I was in for a treat.Judd Apatow and Jake Kasdan show their comedic genius throughout the movie, whether it be through clever dialog between characters or the genuinely funny original songs. The music performed by Dewey Cox does a great job of parodying various styles, from Dylan to Brian Wilson.John C. Reilly is fantastic in his role as Dewey Cox and establishes himself as a solid leading man. I was also thoroughly impressed that he actually sang and played all of the music in the movie and did it well. Jenna Fischer's performance in Walk Hard may be just what her career needs right now. It's nice to finally see her breaking the mold that she has set for herself as Pam in The Office.Walk Hard also featured a wide range of current and former SNL stars, such as Kristin Wiig and Chris Parnell. In addition, some of the regulars from past Apatow films are also featured, but I don't want to ruin any surprises here.All in all, Walk Hard is a really solid comedy and a must see for any Apatow fans. If you are going to see Walk Hard, do yourself a favor and check out Walk the Line and Ray before going. It will make for a much more rewarding experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
John C. Reilly gets a breakout leading role,"For a long time John C. Reilly has been fairly known for playing side characters and supporting roles in movies such as Boogie Nights. Gangs of New York, and an Oscar nominated performance in Chicago. Then he becomes known for doing comedies such as Talladega Nights. Now John C. Reilly had a chance to have a starring role in Walk Hard. He takes advantage of this role as he shows the funny side of doing an imitation of music biopics such as Walk the Line, Ray, and I'm Not There.In a weird way, it is interesting to see a comedy version of a music biopic. Anyone who watches should not take this seriously at all. It is like other spoof movies such as Spaceballs, Airplane!, and Blazing Saddles. It also belongs in with other Frat Pack comedies such as Talladega Nights and Superbad. Producer Judd Apatow has been behind many good, fun comedies.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Beautiful Ride(?) ‚òÆ I Smelt It ¬∞awfully funny¬∞ üíØ%üîç,"It's Not What It Looks Like, as Dewey says whenever he gets into trouble. This film is pretty awful, yet it's so droll. I hated it the first time I saw it. My son insists on throwing it on from time to time, and I must admit it grew on me. I even quote it from time to time. Caught up in the moment, I've even quoted it at funerals.WHTDCS is a lewd comedy that parodies the movies Ray & Walk the Line, as well as the mid 20th century music scene in general, Forrest Gump style. It follows the composite trope of a wildly successful American musician: Tragedy ‚òÆ Ambition ‚òÆ Road ‚òÆ Success ‚òÆ Inspiration(üíäüö¨üíâ) ‚òÆ Arrest ‚òÆ Rehab ‚òÆ Social Consciousness ‚òÆ Mediocrity ‚òÆ India ‚òÆ Decline ‚òÆ Paternity Suits ‚òÆ Lifetime Achievement Award ‚òÆ Comeback... TARSI-ARSC-MID-PS-LAAC? (I guess there's no acronym needed; you get the jist, I'm sure). To quote Tim Meadows: You don't want none of this! Unless you are craving something mindlessly stoooooopid, rather obscene here and there, and very funny, that is.WHTDCS is a 2007 96-minute release that is rated 75/57 on RT 6.8 IMDB. 75!!? The critics gave it a 75? This is the second time I've seen the critics overrate a comedy in the last month. Both movies happen to feature frontal nudity, including some 'dewey cox'. Coincidence? Mehbee... Either they've overrated this film, or they underrate most comedies. Often brutal in assessing comedies, something in WHTDCS caught the critics' eyes.I get where they are coming from. It really is funny, mostly due to the excellent performances. Even I didn't have the heart to rate it a 6, tempted as I was. The writing is mostly crafted for groans, with some succulent morsels in the mix, but it's the directing and the cast that produced value. John C. Reilly is Dewey Cox. He can sing, and he can also cry on cue at any moment, repeatedly. He is excellent. Jenna Fischer is terrific as Darlene, a June Carter type. Raymond J. Barry as Pa Cox is truly hilarious and one of the highlights of the film. Kristen Wiig, in a very early, pre-Bridesmaids role, is Edith Cox, Dewey's first wife. Tim Meadows may steal the show as one of Dewey's band members. There's also loads of cameos/small parts with familiar faces: Jason Schwartzman as Ringo Starr, Paul Rudd as John Lennon, Jack Black as Paul McCartney, Ed Helms, Martin Starr, Craig Robinson, Bobby Shad, Chris Parnell, Ghostface Killah, Jonah Hill, Harold Ramis, Jane Lynch, Eddie Vetter, Jewell (who can hardly contain her laughter), Lyle Lovett, Jackson Browne, a distinguished giraffe and more.Jake Kasdan, who also directed the underrated Orange County, wrote WHTDCS with producer Judd Apatow. They apparently watched tons of music films and biopics for inspiration, and their effort shows. They skewer the genre perfectly. While the film did not recover its budget at the box office, it is now a cult classic.QUOTESüì¢The wrong kid died.I never realized until this very moment how easy it is to cut someone in half.„Ä∞üñç IMHOüì£7.4 üìù7 üé≠7.7 üíì7.5 ü¶ã3 üåû4.5 üé®7 ‚ö°3 üéµ/üîä5 üòÖ7.3 üò≠4.5 üò±3 üòØ1 üòñ4.9 ü§î2 üí§0 üîö8.6Age 18+ Rated R - restricted, and consider it a hard-R for language, sexual innuendo galore, dirty dancing imitating sex acts, drug use, nudity w/ penis close-ups (the title is literally true, from a homophone standpoint), a hotel room of naked people having sex, and drug use.Re-üì∫?

Hysterical Mock-biopic,"Kasdan's 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' is a hysterical entertainer that spoofs biopics like 'Walk The Line' and 'Ray'. Since Judd Apatow is associated with the production, one can expect the humour to be of a 'vulgar' sort but that didn't bothered me here. I was only irritated by the scene where a crotch covered half the screen. That was pointless and not even the least bit amusing. But I was entertained by the loudness and over-the-topness of the movie.It does a fine job of showing continuity in time. In a way it celebrates the era but also makes fun of it, like Adam McKay's splendid 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' (also produced by Apatow). The vivacious soundtrack contributes brilliantly to the atmosphere.John C. Reilly is quite the excellent choice. The actor gets to display his comedic flair full throttle. It's hilarious how he mimics Joaquin Phoenix, Jaime King and Mick Jagger. Ditto for a sensual and barely recognizable Jenna Fischer who does a Reese Witherspoon as June Carter and adds her own flair to it and the Kristen Wiig who does a Kerry Washington as Della Bea. Moreover, cameos by Paul Rudd, Jack Black, Jason Schwartman, David Krumholtz, the hot Cheryl Ladd etc just add to the laugh riot. The camera-work and use of light is spot on.'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' is a trip to non-stop laughing out loud with a few occasional interruptions but it also celebrates those movies to whom it pays tribute, the time, the glamour, the music and the changing culture. In a very subtle way, it also brings forth a few relevant issues, like how country music and jazz which were once nationally popular have become a select genre with a distinct fanbase and how many of the performers of this genre today have gained global fame by hopping onto pop and hiphop.",,Anonymous,Music
"Somewhere between ""A Mighty Wind"" and ""Airplane!""","""Walk Hard"" is another film from the Judd Apatow gang who brought you such inane gems as ""Anchorman"", ""Talladega Nights"", ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" and so on. In the same vein, you'll get a wacky blend of absurd humor, parody, satire and sexual gags not suitable for young kids. Note: I saw the unrated version which has a few gags featuring, among other things, one or two closeup shots of a man's hangy down thing (haha IMDb won't let me type w.a.n.k.e.r).The tone of the whole film is very tongue-in-cheek and satirical, with a good zinger at least once every 30 seconds. Perhaps even more fun is spotting all the cameo appearances by famous personalities such as director Harold Ramis (playing ""L'Chaim"" the Jewish industrialist), Paul Rudd (""John Lennon""), Jack Black (""Paul McCartney""), Jack White from the White Stripes (""Elvis"") and Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam (playing himself). Other actors from SNL, The Office and Big Bang Theory add to the star-spotting extravaganza.The story is mostly a shameless mock-up of Johnny Cash's biopic ""Walk the Line"" but with scenes parodied from other musical biopics like ""Ray"" and ""La Bamba"". A goofily predictable rise to fame of a music star story, this film mercilessly skewers the clich√©s, with over-the-top melodramatic scenes like the bigwig producer telling Dewey he sucks and will never make it, only to start singing his praises after Dewey strums 2 chords. Other gags are even more silly, like some of the corny visual wordplays in ""Airplane!"" (for example there's a dramatic scene where he shouts ""I can't fight the temptations!"" and runs into the hallway where we see ...guess who?... singing their motown hit ""My Girl""). From the outset all the way to its conclusion this movie is pure silliness.If you like 'em that way then have no fear, you won't be let down. However if you're expecting something more along the lines of the more subtle yet equally hilarious Christopher Guest comedies (""Spinal Tap"", ""A Mighty Wind"", ""Best in Show""), then you might start to tire of the fast paced, deliberately predictable gags we see here. ""Walk Hard"" is an enjoyable experience but probably not intended to be a cult classic music comedy like the aforementioned Guest films which spawned an entire genre of sophisticated comedy (if you can consider a film called ""A Mighty Wind"" to be sophisticated). ""Walk Hard"" is just pure mindless entertainment, and it delivers. Watch it on days when you just want to shut your brain off and have some fun. I knocked off a few points because the nudity & prolonged sex scenes can get a little distracting from this otherwise silly romp (a 10-second closeup of a man's crankshaft might cross the line of discomfort).",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Judd and Jake out of their depth,"Judd Apatow, whose involvement in social comedies has been so successful lately, teams up with his ""Freaks and Geeks"" collaborator Jake Kasdan and dancing actor John C. Reilly (who showed us some nice soft-shoe in Chicago) to attempt a satirical musical biopic in Walk Hard. Drawing obviously on Walk the Line, Ray, and other sources, these guys do their best to provide some Christmas end-of-the-year cheer, but their ""hard walk"" goes soft and staggers toward the end.Cox is a catchall of a pop singer, a chameleon Zelig/Forest Gump whose life from age 14, where Reilly absurdly takes on the role from a younger actor, till early 70's, runs through blues, soul, country, punk--you name it--with appropriate drugs. There's pot for soul, LSD for psychedelic rock--Cox gets to hang out with a crude version of the Beatles in India with the Mahirishi. Cocaine leads him to punk--and so on. The trouble (or one trouble, anyway) is that though he's game to a fault, Reilly is colorless to begin with. It's impossible to believe teenyboppers would swoon for him. He has zero sex appeal. And that isn't funny like Steve Martin's ""wild and crazy guy,"" either.The constant shifts of musical style neglect to give Cox any unifying factor whatever. Apatow might as well have used six different actors for Cox, a la Todd Haynes with Bob Dylan. And Cox has a Dylan phase. Only you know what? The Dylanesque lyrics aren't at all funny, and satire ought to appeal to devotees. This is a music movie about a musician who hasn't a scintilla of musical authenticity. Or even a consistent shtick.Of course there are plenty of laughs, but Walk Hard is little more than a string of jokes and rough-hewn, even gruesome stunts. The way relatives are killed off seems infantile violent, while the sexual humor is adolescent. Jokes like the humping motions of couples in a black club, and the Jewish music producers dressed in full Orthodox regalia and with names like Mazeltov and Dreidel really appeal to the basest responses of the audience. This is way too sloppy work to compare with witty musical satire, and Apatow's and Kasdan's catchall screenplay seems lazy--ultimately uninventive.Of course this is meant to be Reilly's picture, but he's the victim of it.While it's been said the string of songs composed for Reilly to sing ups the ante for such satire, the incessant shifts in style keep the movie from every coming close to achieving the subtlety and point of a classic comic music movie like This is Spinal Tap, which defined a genre and style, or an oddball serious fake music documentary like Brothers of the Head--both of which evoke the worlds and times they come from brilliantly: Walk Hard doesn't really try.The movie's only (questionable) new note is the incessant mockery of the devices of music biopics. There it does have a clear and relentless point. The trouble is, it apes those biopics too closely. Again, Apatow and Kasdan have been lazy and unimaginative, good only at reaching for laughs--and too often reaching mighty low for them.This movie turns humble musical rural people into trailer trash. It's a trailer trash movie. But where the biopic evocation falls short is that Cox really has an easy time of it. He's neither a Johnny Cash nor a Ray Charles. He doesn't suffer the consequences of his drug use or his marital failures. So the ""hard"" of Rock Hard is only a word, unlike the genuine rough life lived by Charles and Cash. This is the trouble with taking everything lightly--and going to overly gruesome extremes to show a dark side of the past. It veers from the bloody to the shallow, with nothing in between. Of course the lighthearted approach was okay, in fact downright welcome, in the youth comedies of Knocked Up or Juno or the trivial adolescent coming of age hassles of Superbad--moments in young lives the kids are going to move on from. But for a life from 14 to 70, this approach leaves you feeling empty.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"Pretty funny, but not good","This definitely wasn't in a league of knocked up or superbad (my 2 favorite comedies). There were some funny parts, but overall the movie wasn't good. There were a lot of jokes that were reused throughout the movie which got old. The story was rushed and it made the movie look sloppy. Also, no one wants to see a penis on a big screen, unless you are one of those 8% of kids who draw them. I'm a little disappointed in Apatow, but then again I don't think anyone can go their whole career without at least one failure. I think it would have been better if it didn't have to follow 2 masterpieces that raised everyones expectations.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Has its moments but it is not funny enough to support the running time and ends up being ""OK"" but not much more than that","As an grown man, Dewey Cox waits behind the scenes to go onto stage for the performance of his life. While the introductions are being done, he finds a suitably dimly light corner, strikes a ""troubled"" pose and starts to reminisce about the life that he has lived that has brought him to this point. Fortunately for Cox the introductions are long as he needs time to start with his childhood and go through deaths, love, losses, betrayal, drugs, light entertainment, sex, more drugs, daddy issues and more drugs before he can perform with a clear head.I rented this film without actually realising that it was basically a spoof on Walk the Line, which I fortunately had seen some months previously. Without knowing this or having seen that film, I would suggest that you are probably going to miss a lot of the gags since some of them are funny mainly because of their similarity to the ""straight"" film. It shouldn't be a massive problem though because it still does work as a comedy based on the rock biopic genre and as such is general enough to not require a great deal of knowledge. No, the bigger problem that most viewers are going to have with it is that it is just not as funny as it should be.The length is part of the problem as it pushes the two-hour mark. Fine if the film has enough to make that work but this just doesn't. The plot is just a frame for the comedy, so that will not help engage; all that will really do it is to keep the viewer laughing as the film goes along. And there are laughs ¬ñ some good ones and plenty that made me chuckle ¬ñ but they are spread thin and are often the type that are amusing scenes rather than killer lines or sight gags. One is not better than the other but really this type of film needs both, the former keeping a firm bed of amusement to engage while the latter type delivers regular laugh-out-loud moments. Perhaps if it had been shorter then this wouldn't matter but this plus the running time leaves it baggy.The cast try their best though and it was nice to see Reilly leading a film and doing a good job of it. The rest of the cast are second fiddle behind him but I did think that, laugh-wise, there were good turns from most of the main actors while cameos from Duffy, Ghostface and a few others added some laughs. That said though, Walk Hard is not a brilliant comedy so much as it is a reasonable one. It is rarely as funny or as inspired as it needs to be and the comparatively long running time makes this stand out all the more, leaving a film that is OK but never consistently more than that.",,Anonymous,Music
"Another unique, but still generic niche piece benefits from musical context","Although comedic ringleader Judd Apatow keeps inching further and further away from doing what he does best, opting instead to propel his line of talent into a brand name of sorts, he does show up now and again with some of the better gags (in a mostly underwhelming and self-conscious screenplay) throughout the rock-bio, high concept prank Walk Hard. Some of the music movie jabs may rub fans the wrong way for being a bit crude or distasteful, but for every third half-cooked rock clich√© parody the movie shamelessly exploits, one clever and unique joke rears it's head to keep seasoned comedy fans and music-heads interested.In what might be quintessential ""friend of"" John C. Reilly's first headlining gig since his lead in Paul Thomas Anderson's relatively obscure debut Hard Eight, casting proves competent at least. When the repetitious, shallow Saturday Night Live extended sketch (complete with obligatory multiple cast members)vibe starts to sink in, at least a brisk, mock-epic pace laced with impressively produced, silly pseudo-songs make this walk worth taking once.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"A solid, albeit a little weary, addition to the Apatow comedy canon","Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story chronicles the rise and fall of fictional singer Dewey Cox's (John C. Reilly), showcasing the changes in his music as each decade passes, and the struggles he faces as a musician.Just when we figured we had enough of the typical singer bio-pic, co-writer/producer/comedy golden boy Judd Apatow has delivered yet another one, albeit his first real straight on parody since he first struck gold with The 40-Year-Old Virgin. There was obviously plenty to mine here, and just the brief synopsis should evoke memories of recent Oscar-winners Walk the Line and Ray. And while a lot of the moments that pass do allow for the filmmakers to take grand shots at these two films, it also allows for plenty of satire on the state of music through the various decades, from the rise of rock and roll in the 1950's, to the hippie peace movement in the 1960's and beyond. Also added to the mix are quite a few cameos by actors playing famous musicians of the time including Frankie Muniz as Buddy Holly and Jack White as the King himself, Elvis Presley (and an absolutely laugh out loud sequence featuring The Beatles).But in packing in a lot of this material from sources that were already too bogged down in the first place, Apatow and co-writer/director Jake Kasdan have bogged themselves down to. For a movie that is under one hundred minutes, it drags a bit too much for its own good. Some sequences run endlessly long, and some just pass by with ease. I do not want to say, or incur, that I was bored at all by one of the best (if not the best) parody films in a long time (especially if I have such tripe as Meet the Spartans to look forward to in the future), it just dragged itself along too much. I understand the effect the Kasdan and Apatow were going for, but I think they could have limited themselves a little bit more. What does not help even more so is knowing that many of the trailer's scenes are cut right out of the movie, suggesting an even longer Unrated DVD (along the lines of the way too long Virgin DVD). There just does not seem to be a middle ground in the area of pacing throughout the film, and it tarnishes the film as a result.The actual material itself is fairly hysterical. There are plenty of laughs to be found at any given turn here, and many laugh out loud moments to go with them. Just watching these actors delivering their lines in purely serious ways, especially during the some of the film's most ridiculous moments (ironically, moments that fall very close to those found in Line or Ray), is just too much to not be able to laugh at. All of these actors seem very at home with the material, and look like they are having a lot of fun with their characters. This also seems to be one of the closest followed scripts of the past few Apatow films, and rarely does it appear that the characters are improvising (or they have just really improved from their consistent ad-libbing). The sets, backgrounds and costume designs, evoking the specific periods, are just as funny, if not more. There is a grand sense of authenticity at work here, and anyone watching the movie can pick out specific ties to their own memories (real or imagined) of those eras. Of course, there are a few too many nods to current fashion trends, but it stays very keenly in the area of that specific era depicted during that point in the film.Reilly as Cox is a marvel in the lead role. He brings his more refined dramatic style to the role, and I think it helps lend a certain aura of credibility to the performance. It is just as serious and realistic as Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash, and only a few steps below the mastery of Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles, and Dewey Cox is not even a real person. He really makes this character his own, and when he is not being downright hilarious, without even breaking a grin, he is being heartbreakingly hysterical. It is a mixed bag, but Reilly makes it work, and he makes it work very well. His performance as the actor is only topped by his performance as the singer. He leads songs brilliantly at every point in the film, and even though the subtext of most of them is a bit risqu√©, they are still wonderfully written songs sung by someone with a great voice. If this role does not spring board Reilly into more leading actor work, it just may give him the needed boost to be a singer (or at least, to do more musicals or head to Broadway).The supporting cast, although not nearly as funny as Reilly, all lend a hand in making Walk Hard a very funny movie. From Kristen Wiig and Jenna Fischer as Cox's wives, to Tim Meadows, Chris Parnell, and Matt Besser as his band mates, to Raymond J. Barry as his father, everyone manages to steal a scene for themselves, and manages to deliver some solid laughs. Yes, there are quite a few flat jokes that are given by the supporters much more often than Reilly as the lead, but for the most part, they do a great job backing him up. It also helps that it seems like everyone has some sort of minuscule amount of chemistry with Reilly, allowing their jokes to fly very easily.Despite its faults, Walk Hard is a solid addition to the growing canon of Apatow comedies, and is one hell of a funny parody. Reilly was the best man for this role, and I am happy to say that he makes the film more than just watchable.7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

It could have been better,"Honestly i have very little patience with spoofs like this one. The kind of movie that is both a spoof and serious at the same time. Sure it's a spoof of movies like ""Walk The Line"", and at the same time it's not all comedy, but rather adapts the same sort of style as serious movies, but with scenes of comedy thrown in. I thought it worked better in ""Walk Hard"" than it usually does, but it's far from perfect.Starting with the good i can say that i always enjoy John C. Reilly. His comical timing and ability to stay serious while doing hilarious things is just great. Letting him be the star rather than the sidekick (like he usually is) is not a bad idea. Undoubtedly he has the talent to pull it off. The second good thing is that there are some scenes in this movie that are hilarious. Especially the scenes where Reillys band-member played by Tim Meadows tries to talk him out of using drugs (usually by saying how good they make you feel). Also a few of the songs are really great, good enough to be taken seriously in their own right.The major problem i had with this movie really is the sort of episode-like structure. This is not so strange considering it's something the movie inherited from Walk The Line. It starts out when Reilly's character is little, and then shows a bunch of scenes from his career. The problem is that those scenes are far too uneven in quality. Some of them are quite good (like the scene with The Beetles), while other scenes are just boring and lackluster (mostly the childhood-scenes). In some instances the movie feels more like a line of sketches rather than a complete movie.In the end i think it's a very thin line to walk for a movie like this one. Finding the balance between comedy, music, and serious scenes is difficult. Sometimes this is almost pure slapstick, other times it's almost as serious as Walk The Line. I enjoyed this movie, but i can't help feeling it could have been done better. John C. Reilly frankly deserves better. I rate this 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A must-watch comedy,"If you are looking for a good comedy in recent time, I would strongly recommend Walk Hard. This movie is a musical comedy which just simply tells about the life story of a fictional singer (Dewey Cox) who gains all his fame and fortune, yet simultaneously messes up his life by abusing drugs. The reasons why I keep watching it for so many times: 1. The movie makes fun of everything, the best parts are about Elvis Presley, The Beatles and drugs. However, almost every minute of it is hilarious. All the dialogs are so funny that you can laugh with tears. Here's one of Elvis Presley's quotes: ""It's called Karate, man. Only two kinds of people know it, The Chinese and The King. And one of them is me."" 2. Good acting from all characters, especially John C. Reilly as Dewey Cox and Jenna Fischer as Darlene Madison. 3. The musical work is quite fine. 4. The movie pretty much reflects accurately 2 things. The first reflection is about all the major changes in terms of culture, art forms and music in the United States through a long period of time. The second impression is how different art forms and music are related to different types of drugs that are used. 5. And finally, it is very American ... it is very theatrical.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

I can't bring myself to write anymore on the subject, stay away from this and your life will be richer.Its like a very poor mans Mighty Wind so if you got that you'll hate this.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A very loooooong SNL sketch,"I went to a free screening of this ""movie"" over the weekend...and I still wanted my money back.I'm a big fan of John C. Riley (and of SNL), but after the first 10-15 minutes of this movie, it seemed to me that the filmmakers (the overrated Apatow and his click) must have been desperate for new material after being in such demand after the success of ""Knocked Up"" (also way overrated) and ""Superbad"". To me, it's as if the filmmakers wrote this entire movie while watching the DVD of ""Walk the Line"" and kept pausing it after every scene to rewrite it as an SNL sketch. Unfortunately (like most SNL sketches) the humor is lost after the first few minutes. I just wish I were able to change the channel in the theater the way I'm able to at home with the TV.Don't get me wrong, watching this film, you really get the impression that this cast had a blast working together. Unfortunately, it isn't nearly as much fun to sit through...even for free.Johnny Cash must be spinning in his grave!",,Anonymous,Music
Someone get John C. Reilly into an actual musical,"Very telling that this was made eleven years before Bohemian Rhapsody and I was still thinking about how this feels like it could be a direct parody of that instead of Walk The Line.However, as much as I think the music biopic subgenre is ripe for parody, I just didn't find this all that funny. It definitely has a lot more going for it than the majority of comedies with Judd Apatow's name anywhere near them, in that it's at least something original, John C. Reilly is surprisingly good and even more surprisingly a really good singer, and the music is actually pretty great too (would have been nicer if every song wasn't muffled by a montage scene you're supposed to pay attention to more though).The crux of the issue for me is that I just don't care at all about Dewey Cox as a character, and I think that's because at almost no point does the film seem to take anything seriously - which is fine for a comedy, but when I didn't find all that much of it particularly funny, there's not really much else to chew on.It's visually very bland too, even though it does capture the era really well, there's nothing special about the direction at all, and so even though it's definitely got much more originality than your average comedy, I can't really say I liked it much more than...well, an average comedy.Maybe it was the wrong kid that died.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
sly deadly skewering of the music bio,"In 1946 Springberry, Alabama, Dewey Cox accidentally chop his brother Nate in half with a machete. As a teenager, Dewey (John C. Reilly) gains local success but he's condemned for playing Satan music. His father kicks him out leaving with his 12 year old girlfriend Edith (Kristen Wiig). It's hard. It's a long, hard walk. He will Walk Hard.It's a fun mockbio. It's mostly sharp deadpan comedy. John C. Reilly is great. It spoofs all the big clich√©s. Judd Apatow and Jake Kasdan skewered the music bio genre with this script. It's just great and nothing is off limits. It's not over the top spoof like the Abrahams and Zucker or worst the Wayans. Reilly is playing Dewey Cox almost straight but just dumb. The ridiculous stuff happens to him. It may hit wrong for the audience because they're expecting wild ridiculous spoof. It's a little different than that.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Laugh Hard!!!,"Finally!!!!!!! a good movie from apatrow!!!! when I saw superbad, step brothers and pineapple express i thought man this guy is not funny at all. then I realized that it was seth rogan not judd apatrow writing the movies. so when I heard about this movie and saw it wasn't written by seth rogan I thought that I would give it a try. and thank god I did. this movie made me laugh so hard I nearly cried though it does have mixed reviews if you are a fan of older styles of comedy (like mel brooks) or of rock and roll movies then I recommend you see this movie. two thumbs up. now i realized that judd apatrow is a genius. and that fat no talent assclown seth rogan. is giving him a bad name.(though the 40 year old virgin was OK)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Fun film, but it has its flaws","An amusing satire that is full of outlandish performances and some fun moments, Walk Hard does struggle from time to time to handle its storyline, but for the most part, proves to be a worthy film for spoof lovers and music lovers alike. John C. Reilly gives a great performance as Dewey Cox himself, and is able to fully commit himself to his insane role in the best way possible. Tim Meadows is also able to steal the screen in each scene he is in, providing an equally over the top character, full of many quotable lines. The film can be quite funny with its take on music and its enjoyable satire, but none of the humor earns more than a chuckle throughout. The film does have a bit of a problem with pacing, and can at times feel a bit tedious with its story often going around in circles. It's music acts and songs, I will say, are quite impressive, and perhaps the strongest element in the movie as a whole. None of them seemed quite tiresome to me, and by the end, I had one or two of the songs stuck in my head. In the end, Walk Hard is an enjoyable but imperfect flick, with some shining moments, and somewhat of a pacing issue. However, if you enjoy a slow burn ride down a ridiculous musical valley, this is certainly the film for you.

Editors bat 1.000,"Rather than point out what others have done well, I just want to add that the editing on this film is first rate. There are many good comedies that have lots of great scenes punctuated by not-so-good stuff. Marx Brothers films come to mind - classics without doubt, but stretches where you can go get a beer and not miss much; and most of the parody films of the last 20 years. Walk Hard doesn't let up. There's hardly twenty seconds without a whack to the funny bone. It may be just a raised eyebrow or a near-throwaway line that just happens to be perfectly placed. If there's a rating for Jokes Per Minute (JPM), this movie is one of the alltime best. And as a musician, this for me is one of the two best music business parodies of all time, the other, of course, being Spinal Tap.

"A sad, sad attempt at humor","Really? John C. Reilly, you are better then this. The movie starts off with a kid cutting his brother in half with a machete. Which is not funny at all. Did we really need the father making the same comments about ""the wrong kid died"" throughout the movie? Or the penis humor? Or the lame jokes?Judd Apatow co-wrote this? The Beatles sequence sucked. The only redeeming scene was Jack White as Elvis. To which Dewey responded, ""What the F$^% did he just say?"".Don't waste your time.Just don't.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Predictably silly,"This was the usual juvenile Apatow/Reilly fare but great fun to watch. It's worth it for the Let's Duet scene alone - in fact the music is so well done I spat out my wine laughing at one point. John C Reilly is utterly brilliant - it's his ""Elf"" moment. 
I watched Walk the Line the following evening as this is so clearly based on that movie primarily and kept giggling all the way through at jokes I'd missed. In short it's just a good fun movie with some very fun musical humour.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Underrated,"I don't ever hear anyone talk about this movie but it's actually a pretty great parody of ""Walk the Line"". John C. Reilly kills it as Dewey Cox a young kid who was cast away from his family and goes down as a music legend. The comedy beats you over the head with the lines and it's intentional and there are plenty of laugh out loud moments. The music is actually really quality too and adds to making it a great comedy rather than a good one. It shows the whole life of Dewey Cox and I for sure recommend it. It even had a nice Jonah Hill cameo that I forgot about.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Its a must watch if you are a music lover and read about the old times,"I have watched this film several times. I even own the extended cut which runs for 2 hours.The comedy lacks any subtlety.

The bold 50s, the crazy 60s, the drug riddled 70s, you could call this an American version of This is spinal tap but they are both completely original and different films.The songs are good, with great lyrics and the final song ""A beautiful ride"" always manages to bring a lump in my throat.Of course, this film isn't for everyone.

But at the end of the movie I got up and walked out thinking, could have waited to see that on video.In need of a few great laughs and some chuckles after a stressful holiday season?

"""Walk Hard or Hardly Walking""","Decent watch at best, won't watch again, but can recommend.I only recommend this as I think enough people like J.C. Reilly, and SNL style skits. This movie is essentially a long series of SNL sketches sewn together.I'm not a fan of this style of writing because it doesn't seem to matter what order you put some of the bits in, it's just stopping the story to tell a joke or two, moving onto another joke or two, etc., until they decide to go back to the part of the movie that progresses the story.Perhaps, watching a movie like this critically is counter intuitive, but even if I were to turn my brain off and enjoy it, I'm not a fan of drug humor, Dewey Cox is a jerk, and the music focused comedy isn't that good to me, despite the music actually being enjoyable itself. ""Let's Duet"" was really good though.There something to like in here, and I can see it: it's just not enough to get me to come back when there are so many options out there.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Another boring comedy with the same old jokes and clich√©s,"If you've seen the Scary movie comedy series and Epic movie comedy series, then you've seen the same old clich√© jokes as this movie.

It felt like a very long Saturdy night live skit and not the classic funny skits either, the more recent lame skits. Lots of songs throughout the movie (with an actor who can't sing).

"bawdy, irreverent","If you are in the mood for some bawdy, irreverent laughs, then watch Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, a spoof on Walk the Line, Ray and other literal rockstar slice-of-life clich√©s (pardon the pun; you'll get what I mean ;o)).Shocking scenes arise as expected from co-writer Judd Apatow (40 year old virgin, Superbad, Knocked Up), and are tremendously funny especially in the beginning. As the movie progresses, however, some hilarity wanes, but impressive are the prosthetic make-up appendages everyone sports as the movie spans from the time Cox is 6 until he is 71 years old.It's good that Oscar nominee John C. Reilly (Chicago, Talladega Nights) finally gets to headline a movie, after seemingly forever portraying the reliable sidekick or supporting character in his many, many movies.From playing a mousy receptionist in the TV sitcom The Office and the mousy sister in Blades of Glory, Jenna Fischer turns in a surprisingly sexy and laugh-out-loud performance as Cox's back-up singer and second wife Darlene. Her comic timing is great and amply supports Reilly's antics because she plays her role so straightly. As an aside, she looks like Buffy's Sarah Michelle Gellar with all the makeup.Nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song for Cox's anthemic 'Walk Hard', the melodic hooks of the rest of the songs are memorable, but the lyrics, suggestive or otherwise, prove the real riot. Also welcome are the cameos from Eddie Vedder, Jack White, Jack Black, The Temptations, Jewel, Lyle Lovett, comics Chris Parnell, Kristin Wiig, and bit parts for Jonah Hill, Frankie Muniz, Jason Schwartzman, Justin Long, Paul Rudd and others.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
An Evolving Classic In Its Own Right,"By spoofing every last music movie clich√©, the terrific ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" also shows an unabashed reverence for the same genre it roasts.While running the specific flatulence of the rock star biopic straight up the flagpole, ""Walk Hard"" delivers a scorching score and a charismatic performance from John C. Reilly. Dewey's austere beginnings -- marked by the unfortunate results of a childhood machete fight -- give rise to his superstardom, and all the backstage indulgences we demand from our rock biopics.""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" is charming, crude, unsubtle, and knowingly absurd. It's also a growing classic. With so many great music movies permeating history, it's ironic that yet another parody deserves mention in the same breath as the legendary films it mimics. - (Was this review of use to you?

"beat for beat, second for second, the funniest parody I've seen in years","""...and remember it doesn't say Cox, unless I say it tastes like Cox.""This is an example of prime send-up, a parody that lovingly references everything in rock-music-bio-pics, from (the obvious centerpiece) Walk the Line, Ray, Don't Look Back, Elvis flicks, The Doors, and countless others, including a mention to Yellow Submarine and the eras of Motown, rockabilly, even punk (yes, more than a decade before there is punk a version of Walk Hard is played). Kasdan and Apatow get what it is to do a send up, which is to be knowing of all the conventions, clich√©s, and formulas that end up coming out of what are, actually, real-life stories already put into a simple context. It follows the tradition of the ZAZ team (Airplane and Naked Gun) by delivering a joke or gag or just something weird every other second, and it builds up into one of the funniest movies in years.A friend of mine said recently that it takes someone to actually really like and admire what they're spoofing in order for it to be pulled off. This helps, of course, as one can tell that Mel Brooks had a love for the theater and musicals for The Producers and horror movies with Frankenstein, and more recently Edgar Wright with action flicks and Hot Fuzz. But there's another component, I think, that separates a film like Walk Hard from the recent slew of ""Movies"" (Date, Epic, the upcoming Meet the Spartans) is that the people working on Walk Hard are some of the funniest people working in Hollywood today, and knowing what makes fresh, vulgar send-up work. It's not simply about mashing up pop-culture references to make them stick, there has to be just something that clicks through the writing and acting.Walk Hard has that in spades- from the opening jokes (yes jokes, and they're running ones) about Dewey slicing his brother in half with a machete (with the brother still giving words of advice cut in half, and leading up to the also running gag ""The wrong kid died!"" line), going into playing the blues as a little white kid, to being 14 (and played by Reilly, of course) marrying a 12 year old fan, to the sudden bolts of inspiration for songs in the middle of a scene- not to mention the lyrics- it's already apparent this will be good stuff. But then there's more: Hasidim music agents with names like Kvetch L'Chaim; drug scenes out of Ray ""You don't want to do this!""; the ups and downs and the meetings with other famous stars (""Hey, George Harrison""). I could go on and on about the little details as well, some of which are probably too much to even mention in this review.Suffice to say Reilly pops out of a shell that he's been in over the past decade or so. One of the superb character actors of his generation (yes, I'm sounding like a pompously sounding critic for now), he's fantastic as Dewey Cox, giving him a sensibility that goes past simple parody- we actually end up feeling for this drug-addicted adulterer who goes in and out of rehab and finally settles in with his few dozen children of various mixed ethnicities (the catching montage, by the way, is priceless). He gives the character that 'umph' that even makes him more human than Leslie Nielson's Frank Drebin, and he creates so many absurd moments that it's easy to miss some of his subtle charms and dramatic touches. Just seeing him talk to a ghost Jonah Hill as ""older ghost"" brother Nate reveals his multi-faceted gifts.And like A Mighty Wind, Kasdan and Apatow and composer Michael Andrews make the songs legitimately good numbers amid some of the crudest innuendo in movie history (songs go between 'innocent' sexual acts to midgets and then to a huge orchestral number including countless tribes-people). Reilly also has the backup, acting-wise, of people from SNL (Meadows and Parnell), The Office (Fischer and Ed Helms) and of course past Apatow works (Rudd, Black, Long and Schwartzman give a movie-stealing scene as the Beatles in India). In the end, it's everything I love in a go-for-broke comedy that still sticks to the numerous predecessors it's imitating. And, if anything, it one-ups those movies as well as legitimate entertainment.So Walk Hard... Hard... to the movie theater!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Walk Hard limps in the second half,"John C. Reilly stars as Dewey Cox in a spoof on music biopics. The film starts off well enough, but as the movie drones on, the jokes quickly become redundant to the point of being downright tedious towards the last half of the movie (IE. anything after the 'beatles' segment is progressively worse). Reilly is pretty damn good as musical wunderkind, Cox, but sadly he can't compensate for the lackluster script. This isn't Apatow's worst written film (see Celtic Pride or Fun with Dick & Jane for examples of those), but it's still a step down from his more accomplished funnier ones (Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin) Walk Hard limps especially in the extended cut.

The sweet (non) smell of success,"Walk Hard is a parody of musical biopics such as Ray and Walk the Line. Dewey Cox is mostly based on Johnny Cash.Dewey Cox (John C Reilly) is a poor farm boy growing up in Alabama. In 1946 as a child, Dewey accidentally chops his brother Nate in half with a machete while they were playing. You knew this would happen as his brother took part in dangerous activities while proclaiming he would live to a ripe old age.This incident causes a rift with his father who keeps telling Dewey that the wrong son died and Dewey loses his sense of smell.As a teenager, Dewey gains notoriety for playing the devil's music and he leaves town to make his own way at the age of 14 with his 12 year old girlfriend Edith (Kristen Wiig.)Dewey gets his big break in a black nightclub where they play music to have sex to, as Dewey replaces the main singer at the last minute. The Hasidic Jewish record executives at the show get him an audition with a record producer where Dewey suddenly pulls out a hit song.As the years go by Dewey tries to deal with his childhood trauma by taking a wide variety of drugs even though his drummer pleads with him not to try them. He also never pays for the drugs.Dewey has an affair with his backing singer Darlene (Jenna Fischer) who he marries while still being married to Edith. Dewey later finds out he had lots of children.As tastes change Dewey tries different musical genres to stay relevant, there is even a trippy, hippy animated pert in India with the Beatles.Written by Judd Apatow and Jake Kasdan, this is one of the better spoofs as it tries to be fresh and avoid lazy retreads which a lot of post Zucker Abrahams Zucker parodies has done.Reilly is very convincing as Dewey Cox because he plays it straight, you would actually think Dewey is a real country music star which is actually alluded to in the post credit sequence.The Beatles sequence with the bad scouse accents was the most fun.

"Needs some trimming, but still quite a funny parody","I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times that I have been watching a movie alone and been brought to such levels of laughter that tears start streaming down my face. The first half hour of Walk Hard pulled that off right away. I watched this film and for at least the first hour I felt like Jake Kasdan and Judd Apatow were kindred spirits with me and also felt the tedium and repetition of every single biopic about a musician. I laughed so hard as they blatantly mocked the cliches you see in these films, and how the stories of so many rock-and-roll stars are exactly the same. The writing was smart, the movie was self-aware, and I'm starting to wonder if I will ever be able to take one of these biopics seriously again after seeing The Dewey Cox Story. John C. Reilly was also perfect casting for the lead role, because he can act like he's being serious while still delivering the comedy.There are a lot of cheap jokes in Walk Hard, particularly when they just play with the double-entendre of the name ""Cox,"" but I didn't mind it all that much. I think because the movie is a parody I am willing to give it more leeway when it comes to what I would typically call ""lazy"" comedy. Where the movie started to stumble for me was in the second half. It reached a point, when they were exploring the 60s and 70s, where it felt like they lingered for too long and didn't have any new jokes to keep things interesting. I also found the humor of Walk Hard better when it was more generalized and didn't focus on directly spoofing specific movies. All that being said, this is a movie that will stick with me. In fact, I still find myself humming some of the tunes, and it has been several days since I watched it. I think there are some places where it could have been edited down to make the whole experience a bit better, but that doesn't stop Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story from being one of the funniest movies I've seen this year.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Walks the line.,"For the most part, this satirical music-biopic plays things totally straight, sending up the entire genre just by adhering to its strict formula while making each event overly melancholic and utterly absurd. 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007)' tells the made-up life-story of a made-up musician in exactly the same way that most films tell the real life-stories of real musicians. As such, some of its funniest moments come not when it's being silly but when it's being serious, playing directly into the tropes that we've all come to expect from a well-worn and, frankly, worn-out filmic category. It comes very close to being mean-spirited but manages to stay on the right side of that line by always aiming at the musical movies instead of the musical figures. Though it takes particular aim at 'Walk The Line (2004)' and 'Ray (2004)', it manages to parody basically every music-biopic to be released both before and after. This isn't to imply that it's always hilarious, however. While it's often funny - though, not always - and it pretty consistently makes astute observations, it does starts to wear a little thin towards its mid-section. Here, it can only ever be as entertaining as a generic music-biopic - which isn't all that entertaining - because that's exactly what it's presented as. I'll also say that the stereotyping of its Jewish characters, while clearly supposed to be poking fun at the more subtle stereotyping done by other films, is pretty problematic. Still, the picture is never dull and it manages to leave things on a very high note (the best joke of in entire affair, somewhat unfortunately, plays after the credits). It actually makes you realise just how much the music-biopic relies on its audience knowing that its narrative is (supposedly) mostly true, as the filmmaking and storytelling used to convey it are basic, at best. It also shows just how generic the genre really is, as it satirises basically every single entry in it. It's not always laugh-out-loud, but it is always enjoyable. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
An American comedy,"Being a huge fan of the comedies from 80's I can't help but compare the current gang of Apatow, Phillips, Rogen, Ferrell, Reilly, Black etc to Reitman, Ramis, Landis, Murray, Chase, Candy, Aykroyd, Belushi, Martin etc. Funny enough, always appearing Harold Ramis seems to be the only connection between these two generations.I didn't know this was an Apatow production before the end credits hit the screen and I have to say I'm quite happy I didn't, because I could now see it without much prejudice, as I haven't really connected with any of the Apatow-era/gang comedies. I did find it somewhat funny. I also found it very American, very formulaic and very this millennium. Everything that the mainstream comedies from recent years are.The movie made me laugh mostly just because of the explicity of the jokes. Yes, it was funny when a mans private parts appeared on screen (should I put a spoiler tag?), but only because it's a major Hollywood production, not done this explicitly before? And you can easily see it's there ""just because"". Nor can I remember when they so openly and straight forwardly praised dope, even tho it's done in almost every comedy that is produced lately. These two always re-appearing and boundary stretching subjects are what I can't connect to, and at times it seems this is what the movies are all about.Being a European I don't find nude men funny, per se. Being kind of traditional, I don't find drugs very funny either. Then there's John C. Reilly - who I actually find an enjoyable actor, is doing the lead and trying to run a comedy. He just hasn't got the comedic charisma of Ferrell, Black or let's say Murray or Chase. He's sort of the Dan Aykroyd of the first decade, a good actor, but more of a wing man rather than a leading man.I was left with mixed emotions. The movie made me laugh quite a few times and it did have fairly good production values, but when the running joke is your path from mild drugs to stronger drugs, I can't say I liked it, even if it made me laugh.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

A Spoof That Manages Sublety and Emotion,"I had no previous knowledge of this movie so came to it with no expectations only that I normally like John C Rielly, and in the end I was pleasantly surprised. This being a spoof of the story of musician's life's such as the biopic's 'Walk the Line' and 'Ray'. The film rattles along at a good pace a we trace the life and career of the title character from his unfortunate childhood through to his rock and roll break through and his long musical career that follows. This is all done well with Reilly giving the title character a sense of child like wonder well in to his adult years. The spoof is handled well and with an admirable sense of subtlety that the makers of other American spoofs would do well to notice (and I suppose you would expect some screen craft to have passed down if you are the director from the Kasdan family). The supporting cast do well given the limited scope of their roles and Jenna Fischer does well here breaking out from her role in the superb 'The Office: An American Work Place'. The film comes to a pleasing ending which manages to be much more emotional that it has any right to do and on my part at least deserves at least one other viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Utterly HYSTERICAL!,"I didn't know what to expect when I first rented this DVD, but boy was I rewarded for effort. This was truly funny, and I found myself several times with head thrown back wheezing and hacking laughing so hard. It's a ridiculous sort of comedic quality that makes this movie work so you have to ""get"" that sort of humor to appreciate it. The part with Dewey Cox on the tour bus getting into a verbal altercation with his pet monkey nearly had me diving for oxygen. Although I loved this whole movie, I think they could have stopped at just showing the guys ass when he walked up to Dewey while on the phone. They didn't have to turn him around thus exposing his shriveled baby shrimp...a lil too much there, Apatow!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Great in moments...But marred by too immature humor and senseless vulgarity.,"This flick has some great nuances that poke at a fictional musician who is obviously a composite character of all the usual suspects in the post WWII era to present. It nails our absurd pop culture past. It can be wickedly funny doing so. Unfortunately, it also has a tendency to dumb itself way down into the territory of infantile vulgarity. Not to be a prude, but the heavy handed crudeness serves to mar the excellent work of John C. Reilly.Judd Apatow and Jake Kasdan need to go back and watch the Farrelly Brothers catalog. There is an art to mixing tasteless humor, political incorrectness, and making it all acceptable and hilarious. They aren't in that special spot where one overlooks the crudeness-which seems forced not funny. Reaching that ""spot"" can be like tap dancing around land mines, remaining funny to the extreme and tasteful enough that crudeness it isn't an issue, I see this as the ""acid test"" that separates the brilliant from the hack. While Apatow and Kasdan are certainly way past the hack stage they can still indulge themselves too much and fall glaringly flat on their face. It helps, as displayed here, there are moments of great sly humor mixed in-Yet it doesn't, overall, end up totally redeeming the faux pas committed.I wish I could have absolutely recommended this without reservations. John C. Reilly really is up to the task and turns in a good performance in spite of the writing/directing lapses. I just keep wishing this could have been a Farrelly or a Leiner,Hurwitz, and Schlossberg (Harold-Kumar) project. They would have been able to keep the low-brow humor from being too pervasive.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

"One long, repetitive, painful joke","Good Lord, this was bad. I expected a lot more out of Judd Apatow, who has quickly become one of my favorite directors with the 40-Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Superbad. But this was just awful...it's basically another Will Ferrell movie gone bad.John C. Reilly is pretty redundant as the lead role in this; pretty much anyone could have been inserted into the role of Dewey Cox and done the same job. He wasn't bad, but he wasn't particularly funny, either, and for a lead role in a high-expectations comedy like this one, that just doesn't cut it. Doesn't help that the supporting actors were all just terrible, to say the least. The whole Beatles scene is just retarded - I think my IQ dropped a minimum of 10 points after watching a bloated Jack Black repeatedly tell us ""I'm Paul McCahtnay"" - it's an SNL skit gone bad. Even Tim Meadows, one of my favorite comedians, derives ALL of his comedy from the same joke in the film, which is funny the first time you see it, but not the sixth time. Which leads me to my next point...Repetitive is really an understatement in describing this film's humor. Jokes that aren't even that funny to begin with, such as a jackass father repeating ""the wrong kid died!"" or Dewey tearing sinks out of the wall in his fits of rage, managed to recur throughout the film and made me sigh in disappointment.If you've seen Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory, or any VH1 Rock Documentary, then you've seen this movie. I'm aware that the movie is supposed to be a complete spoof of these typical ""rise to fame, fall from grace, then regain your glory"" films, but its delivery was just awful. Whereas a film such as ""This Is Spinal Tap"" managed to cleverly spoof the genre, ""Walk Hard"" is not clever in any way, which is critical to a film like this. Do yourself a favor and skip this one",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"An overlooked, soon to be classic","I can understand how this film is a failure. It looks like a typical cookie cutter comedy in the same style of Talladega Nights, Anchorman and the new Will Ferrell basketball movie, but without the star power of Will Ferrell.I had absolutely no desire to see this movie and was forced to sit through it.I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is. There are gags, spoofs and a constant sarcastic dialog that has so much humor, you will miss it if you do not pay attention. Or you just might not get it. I feel for those people because they are missing out on a lot of laughter in life overall.I would compare this movie more closely to Anchorman. The difference is that Will Ferrell is a walking joke with incredible star power and John C. Rilely is a bland hard to look at individual.Surprisingly, John C. pulls this role off. He is great as the sidekick but there are very few roles that he can carry as a lead. For him, this is it and he does a good job.The one thing that sets this film apart from many other similar comedies is the music and this is where John C. shines. Every song is almost a ripoff of similar song from a genre, but still great songs. The last time I have seen a comedy with great music that was 'original' and this good was the South Park movie, an often overlooked element to a very offensive movie. This element for Dewey Cox sets it apart from the Superbad's of the industry.If you do not go see this soon, it will be on DVD shortly. This will be its time to shine and and people will be saying ""Wrong Kid Died"" and ""I'm Deweys 12 year old girlfriend"" around the water cooler at work.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"The music is great, the rest less so","Spoof of every music biography you can think of with John C Reilly in the lead a Dewey Cox, a Johnny Cash style singer. Amusing, but only to a point, this is movie that sets up a joke and unleashes it then sets up another joke and unleashes it and then another and another one at a time in succession as it hits every movie music bio clich√© there is. As game as the cast is I could find no reason to keep watching this film, except that the songs are excellent. Frankly if it wasn't for the songs I'd say pass on this film until cable since the jokes are too few and often too obvious to bother with besides buying the cd of music would be cheaper and jump you right to the good stuff. 3 out of 10",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Apatow Feels Out America's Musical History,"Film writer Judd Apatow has officially become synonymous with low-brow comedy. And low-brow can sometimes be pulled off to surprising acclaim. And such is the case with WALK HARD: THE DEWEY COX STORY.With THE 40-YEAR OLD VIRGIN and KNOCKED UP firmly under his belt (as well as PINEAPPLE EXPRESS and YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN), Apatow has shown he knows how to tickle the funny bone of young and old alike ...but mainly the young. Deciding to test the waters of music history, Apatow jumped headlong into the tempest and came out of it looking fairly unblemished.The main thrust of the film's success is undoubtedly that it centers on America's musical past, dipping us into Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, Bob Dylan (big time), Jim Morrison (watch out for the penis shots), Elvis Presley (love the hair), Tim McGraw (country?) and even Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.The other big draw is its title character/actor Dewey Cox played by the oft-underused comedic actor John C. Reilly (TALLADEGA NIGHTS). Reilly plays second fiddle to no one this time, and holds firm his grasp on the character. Completely ridiculous lines roll off his tongue in effortless fashion (""The Siamese cat is a symbol of mobility in Ancient Egypt.""). He also is sometimes very physical in his comedy, running down the street in his underwear in true Jim Morrison fashion.Other actors and actresses are fairly forgettable, however, with the notable exception being Sam (Tim Meadows, best known as a not-ready-for-prime-time-player on Saturday Night Live). Sam assists Dewey in his drug struggles, introducing him to the fairly benign (pot) to the deadly (Heroin). And watching Dewey go through withdrawals was hysterical from a medical standpoint (""I'm freezing!"" ""He needs more blankets."" ""I'm burning up!"" ""He needs less blankets."")If you're an Apatow fan, you owe it to yourself to check out this musical farce. If you've been ho-hum on Apatow up until now, you still might want to check this one out.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Special to HollywoodinHiDef.com: Ben Williams' Review of Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (Blu-ray),"WALK HARD: THE DEWEY COX STORY 2007 April 8, 2008 1080p AVC Mpeg-4 Video / Dolby TrueHD Audio Directed by Jake Kasdan Starring: John C. Reilly, Jenna Fischer, Tim Meadows, Chris Parnell List Price: $43.95Reviewed by Ben Williams - Review Editor for Blu-ray.com 4/24/08SynopsisDewey Cox (John C. Reilly) is your prototypical rock icon. He had a harsh childhood, suffered tragedy and overcame his checkered past to rise to prominence in the musical world. His story is cribbed right from the plot of Ray and Walk the Line and follows the same basic structure of those films - - to the letter..Video QualityWalk Hard arrives on Blu-ray sporting a very nice 1080p transfer in the movie's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The movie will just about instantly leap off of your screen during the opening scenes in Springberry, Alabama. It's clear that this scene has been tweaked in post production to give it a colorful and idyllic feel. Fortunately, this is entirely consistent with the film's theatrical presentation and the entire film remains a faithful representation of the theatrical experience.Audio QualityI can't imagine that there would be any controversy over the audio section of Walk Hard. Presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround (48kHz/24-bit), the film sounds terrific. Additionally, Sony has provided a French TrueHD track as well as Dolby Digital tracks in both Spanish and Portuguese. The TrueHD track does a fantastic job of effectively portraying the film's many live concert sequences with abundant surround usage and crystal clear vocals. In a film where the joke is often-times the song itself, this is critical. If I can't understand what Dewey Cox is singing, then what's the point? Fortunately, this is never a problem and the sound does its part to move the story along.Bonus FeaturesThe folks at Sony have done an amazing job with the supplemental presentation of Walk Hard. This Blu-ray 2-disc set is completely loaded with extras. In addition to the huge list of supplements in this set, this Blu-ray release is also Blu-ray Live compatible. Those with the appropriate Blu-ray hardware will have access to an online portal featuring more deleted scenes, theatrical trailers and featurettes.Tru-Blu? Walk Hard is absolutely worthy of your time and attention. This is a hysterical movie that belongs in the collection of any fan of well-written comedy. Walk Hard didn't do so well at the box-office, so there is clearly a segment of the population that isn't interested. I hope this Blu-ray release will present them with the opportunity to reconsider the film. Highly Recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
John C. Reilly Shines in Over-Stuffed Parody of Music Through the Decades,"Here is a lesser known gem of the Judd Apatow's produced comedies. It didn't get the attention that 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN, KNOCKED UP, or SUPERBAD received, but it's plenty funny. I honestly can't even remember this film going to theaters, so it must've snuck in and out pretty quietly without a whole lot of marketing. Apatow and writer/director Jake Kasdan bring the usual flavor of Apatow's comedies to this spoof of musical biopics that have flooded theaters in recent years. Everything from RAY to WALK THE LINE to Oliver Stone's THE DOORS are parodied. The film's musical hero is Dewey Cox, who takes up music after accidentally killing his brother with a machete and being shunned by his father. Dewey hits it big after his first major song ""Walk Hard"" hits the airwaves and the film tackles all of the most oft repeated staples of music bio pics: infidelity, drug abuse, rehab, and the golden realization in the end. Except here it's all done for laughs with plenty of quotable dialogue, a load of great cameos, and some surprisingly good music. It's not the most amazing comedy in recent years but it's loaded with laughs.Just as with 2010's GET HIM TO THE Greek, music is a major part of the movie here and the filmmakers did not skimp out. They've gone through the trouble of giving Dewey Cox a wide selection of songs ranging from country to psychedelic and everything in between as Cox's style changes with the times. And they aren't just throwaway songs cobbled together without thought...most of the songs are actually pretty good, and nearly always funny. The crazy part: star John C. Reilly did all the vocals himself, proving not only that he should've been given leading man status a while ago (the man's easily funny enough to carry his own film) but he's got some musical talent (though I acknowledge it had to have benefited from some post-work). Reilly is great in this film and, while he's shown strength for dramatic roles, he really shines in comedy. He has a knack for the immature and goes wild as Cox struggles with the problems that come with his fame and fortune.The film's got plenty of laughs. SNL alumni Tim Meadows provides some of the best moments as Dewey's drummer Sam, who acts as Dewey's gateway introduction into every manner of drug (""You don't want no part of this, Dewey!""). My favorite part of the film comes in the 60's when Dewey joins the Beatles (Paul Rudd, Jack Black, Justin Long, and Jason Schwartzman) in India for some meditation and LSD. I wish I could say the laughs were non-stop but the film suffers from some repetition that drags it down. Dewey's on-again/off-again relationship with the love of his life Darlene (the gorgeous Jenna Fischer) and his repeated trips to rehab begin to feel like a gag that won't quit and it makes the movie feel at least a half hour longer than it should be. It becomes even more apparent if you watch the admittedly self-indulgent director's cut. It all eventually boils down to a series of gags as Dewey experiences every major decade/fad in music. There's plenty to laugh at but I think the filmmakers tried to fit too much into one movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Can't stop watching,"My cousins friend stayed with us a few months, he told me he watched this in prison, had me watch it, I've watched it 7 times since. Showed it to my cousin's husband, next day we watch together with our friends. I went to visit family and had my friend watch it. It's definitely a movie if you're stoned or tripping. I'm glad I found it good quality on YouTube cause it's not on any streaming services. I've listened to the soundtrack countless times, John Reilly really can sing, I wish he'd do more comedies like this. One of my top 5 for sure. I recommend to pretty much anyone.

Hated this movie,"I spent a small portion of my Saturday night watching Walk Hard. Going to see this movie was a complete waste of my time and money. There were scenes in Walk Hard that made no sense whatsoever. I left the movie theater wondering what the hell I had just watched. It was completely and utterly retarded. I have seen spoof movies before (e.g. Not Another Teen Movie, Epic Movie, etc,...). Yet while these movies are also retarded, they were also funny. Walk Hard was a serious disappointment and I do not recommend this movie to anyone except those that live their lives in a constant drug induced state of mind (maybe this movie will make sense to them).",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A One Trick Pony That's Actually Pretty Funny,"The film's a parody of Johnny Cash and the film ""Walk The Line"". It makes no bones about being clever, and it really isn't. You can see the jokes coming, but they are pretty funny. The whole film is predictable but it is also enjoyable. The best parts are the songs, which are full of pregnant pauses and innuendo, especially the parody of ""Jackson"". Jenna Fischer is gorgeous and easy on the eye compared to the befuddled and eternally confused character of Dewey Cox. There are only a few letdowns in the film. The final song, the summation of the character's life ""Hell of a Ride"" was unlike the rest of the film in that it was bland and totally unmemorable and a real let down. The other is the casting of the obese Jack Black as a young Paul McCartney. The film isn't worth owning, but if you can borrow a copy it is worth a watch. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Overrated and under delivered,"I've read reviews stating that this movie is funny, or that people who don't find it funny are missing the point. As someone who enjoys all comedy, from parody, to raunchy, to romantic, I completely disagree with people who say this movie has any cinematic merit.I was hopeful that the movie would be a gut buster, or at least a cult classic. It was neither. It was dry, slow, gratuitous, and unlike other parodies, was sorely lacking in biting wit or cleverness.20 minutes into the movie, I thought to myself, ""alright, it's got to start getting better, soon...they're running out of time."" It didn't. I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have a couple hours to kill, and don't put a high premium on your time.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"McCheesy's take on ""Walk Hard: A Dewey Cox Story""","I was kinda skeptical in seeing this one mainly because of the damage Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg had done to the parody movie genre. 'Epic Movie' who was supposed to spoof 'epic' movies like Narnia and Pirates of the Caribbean was a total mess. I didn't laugh one bit. Don't even start with 'Date Movie', its the most un-funniest thing you'll ever see in your TV screen. And the other film was just plain crap. I'm starting to think Uwe Boll is a better director than these two bloodsucking bottom feeders.So anyway, this one was co-written by Judd Apatow, one of Hollywood's awesomest directors, and the actors are mostly from the Apatow gang so I decided to give it a try.While it is not the greatest of Apatow's films, it sure succeeds in parodying 'Walk the Line' and it is hilarious as hell. The script, though sometimes a bit absurd and just plain crazy, was very well written. Its what you get from the world's greatest director in the comedy circuit.John C. Reilly portrayed music legend Dewey Cox like Will Ferrell would have portrayed it. The dialogues uttered by Dewey Cox were so Will Ferrell-ish. I am starting to think Will Ferrell would have been a better Dewey Cox. Don't get me wrong, John C. Reilly was awesome but Will Ferrell, I think was a better choice.The funniest scene would probably be the Beatles cameo in India. Jack Black is awfully funny as Paul McCartney, Paul Rudd was spot-on as John Lennon, Jason Schwartzman was hilarious as Ringo Starr and Justin Long was pitch perfect as George Harrison.Watch it. It is a decent parody movie. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Supprisingly Funny.,"I really enjoyed this movie. Dry wit, and some good one-liners. Simple but fun. The music was very good too which helped move the movie along without the felling of a dry patch in the running of the film. Happy day, I'd recommend it to anyone... but don't get me wrong, it's not Wedding Crashers or old school. I'm a bit glade Will Farrell didn't get this roll.. he would have been the obvious title role choice but it's good to see John C getting a lead in a comedy. He is good in this roll; he helps sets you up from the start, to come along for this dry humour laugh and a half. I always judge a movie by weather I'd go back and watch it again or when it comes out on TV, (this is especially true for comedies) this is one movie that I'd have no problem watching at least two or three times before I'd get sick of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
An oasis of laughter,"I have been waiting a very long time to see a parody that I could even laugh at, and I mean a long, long time. The latest crop of parodies today aren't even trying, and seem to be written just to make a quick buck e.i. Meet the Spartans, Scary Movie 1, 2, 3 & 4. Not only do I think The Dewey Cox story is the best parody ever; I would have to say it could possibly be the funniest movie I have ever seen. Before Dewey Cox Story I thought John C. Reilly was kind of riding on Will Ferrell's comedy coat-tails but now I see the true comedic genius is Mr Reilly. I even recall seeing the poster for this movie in the theater lobby early on and telling myself I wouldn't even consider seeing it, but after seeing Mr. Reilly's TV promo pieces for the movie I discovered he was a lot funnier than I gave him credit for and decided to go see it. I was so happy I did. The laughs are non-stop and the wit is razor sharp. Thanks Mr. Reilly for MAKING me laugh so very hard.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Hysterical Parody,"This is a hysterical movie! There were a few moments when I had to pause the film because I was laughing hard. I love parody movies with ridiculous premises and this one tried to one-up the prior scene as the movie went along. John C. Reilly did fantastic along with the rest of the supporting cast. Plus, most of the songs were written by the film's writers, so the lyrics were hilarious. My big gripe is I might have watched an extended version of the film or something because it ran quite a bit long and some of the scenes were dragging and not that funny. It had bursts of laughable scenes, but I wish they were more consistent with the funny moments. 3.5/5 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Better than expected and entirely quotable,"The trailers for this movie don't do it any justice. I thought it was going to be pretty bad. I mean it's silly, extremely silly but I laughed from beginning to end. The movie it reminds me most of is my #8 favorite movie of all time (yes I keep a list) 'Top Secret!'. Not since Nick Rivers have I seen such an amazing performance from a phony rock star. Also if you're a fan of cheesy biopics or ""Behind the Music"", this should really entertain you. Surprisingly, to me at least, it also is a very good musical. I'm not kidding. John C. Reilly is much better here than in his Oscar nominated performance in 'Chicago'. This is going to sound wrong but this part just fits him better. And he's a really good singer. I'm thinking I just might buy the soundtrack.At different points you can see bits and pieces of 'Ray', 'Walk the Line' (of course), 'What's Love Got to Do With It', 'The Doors', every rock n' roll movie you can think of. Oh and I love the casting of the Beatles. Paul Rudd's awful portrayal of Lennon just rocked. You see, it's meant to be like all the bad TV movie portrayals of rock stars that you've seen. However, Jason Schwartzman could have passed for Ringo. But the casting of Paul is just priceless.The movie, as I said, is really well done. I kept thinking ""oh when I get home I'm going to use that quote as my sig"". And then the next one would be even better. For that reason I think this movie will become even better on repeated viewings. But it's not for everyone. There's nakedness in this movie, lots. And some cursing and silly drug use. So if that stuff bothers you, it's probably not for you but I'd say it's for people who don't get offended easily and are fine with laughing at other people. I loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Satire with a leaky front tire still runs okay,"From the wiseass mind that brought you Knocked Up, Balls of Fury, and the 40-Year-Old Virgin comes this parody biopic that's mostly based on the recent Johnny cash movie Walk the Line. With a whimsical, winning performance by John C. Reilly, Judd Apatow's mock tribute to hard and fast livin' rockers is a knowing smackdown (albeit gently) of the tried-and-true, rags-to-riches Horatio Alger story. Hey, they mock because they love.Dewey Cox (Reilly) grows up in the Deep South, and owing to a family tragedy (not unlike Cash's, only much, much funnier), finds himself with a paw who doesn't believe in him (and, uh, no brother). So off to cut a record with his bandmates, played by Chris Parnell, Tim Meadows, and Matt Besser. (Meadows' character in particular is a hoot, always getting hooked on the next big drug). And then get married and father five or so kids. And then fall in love with a backup singer named Darlene (Jenna Fischer, who's a complete doppleganger for Amy Adams, I swear), who he naturally marries. While still married to the first one. And so on.He even meets Elvis (poorly impersonated by Jack White of the White Stripes), The Big Bopper, and even Buddy Holly (an improbable Frankie Muniz). Oh, and he goes to India to rap with the Maharishi along with the Beatles, who are played by four recognizable names - but they're so unrecognizable that they need to refer to each other (along with Dewey) by their full names. (Seriously. The impressions are so bad that they sound like they were written by someone who'd merely heard mention of the Fab Four at some point and never read anything about them.) There's plenty of drug references and some nudity, but what I like most are the running jokes. As with the Cash flick, Dewey destroys a sink when he gets upset. Okay, make that six sinks. And he steps in as a last-minute replacement for an established act - in an all-black exotic club. Imagine a good ol' boy on a stage, cracking wise to rowdy black folk, and then he steps right into a race-laced tune! Reilly himself sings a lot of the songs (he even co-wrote some of them), and the man has some singing chops (remember Chicago?). He really has to, in order for the film to work at all. Sure, it's a comedy, but a movie about a bad musician isn't entertaining - kind of like a movie about a bad comedian. Such a movie would be funny in parts, but whenever the performer was on the stage, you'd just cringe and hope for the best. So Reilly, as Dewey, has to be spot on, and he is.Despite a slowish first half, this is what you'd call an agreeable waste of time. The closing musical sequence (it's set at an all-star tribute to Dewey) is a real knockout - as it should be. It's reminiscent of the 35th Anniversary special staged to honor Bob Dylan back in the 90s, with various acts covering Cox's best (Jewel, Eddie Vedder, Jackson Browne, and Ghostface Killah all appear). But the final number, a solo by Cox, is a real heart - and show - stopper, and this more than makes up for the sluggish (even by the numbers, as far as parodies go) start.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Lazy, flat, a waste of film","Judd Apatow apparently believes he is God's gift to comedy. His producers and editors apparently believe he has a Midas touch and can do no wrong. Up until this movie, all of them may have been pretty dead on. With this movie, all bets are off.Perhaps if the movie had been cut down to about 15 minutes and put up on YouTube it might have garnered some hits and some pass-it-around-the-office laughs. At full length and in the theater, it is a train wreck. Joke after joke after joke falls flat. Actor after actor mugs and hams and tries to blow some air into this deflating blimp of a film, but it was never properly stitched together to begin with and their efforts come off as sad at best and indulgent at worst.I kept waiting for the movie to get funny. On paper, it probably read funny. But as I sat in the theater, beginning to dread each new scene, I realized it was a failure on the part of the director, writers, editors and execs to see that it wasn't working. Let's put it this way: even the lame Scary Movie spoofs are better than this. This movie just flat out sucked.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Wire-to-Wire Funny,"Five minutes into the screening, I commented to my friend how well written this movie is. Holy cow, they nail every rock bio-pic clich√© and then some. Hilarious from the first moment to the closing credits. Our crowd applauded at the end. Of course, it helps to have the director introduce the movie and for the sound crew to be local (somewhat) celebrities. And it also helps that we were given passes to see John C. perform a set in character at a local club after the show. Still, none of that would have mattered with crappy writing or performances. The movie stands on its own, should do well at the box office, and in my opinion, is an instant classic. Now, be prepared to experience heavy overuse of a particular joke based on the character's last name. And there's plenty of language to wade through. One more thing, before this hits Comedy Central's line-up in a few years, they'll have to edit one particular scene pretty heavy on nudity - the nudity is really out there, but it's not at all sexy, just played for comedy. You'll laugh, but it's not for the prudish for sure. Okay, I highly recommend it to those over 17 with those caveats. Scotto says Check It Out!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
It's a different type of humor,"I think the movie contains a very different type of humor and that's maybe why people don't find it so funny, but I think it's a GREAT movie and very funny overall.

An Absolute Waste of Time... Walked Out to See 'I Am Legend',"This movie is god awful. It is a failed attempt at making fun of Walk the Line and contains no substance, but rather just 'shock value'.

Within the first 30 minutes, there were multitudes of the 'f-bomb' at unnecessary times, ridiculous references to marijuana and cocaine, naked men walking around and a flacid penis displayed on the screen for five seconds.

"Great spoof. However, if you are a bathroom sink, you will not like this movie.","What a surprisingly funny and entertaining movie. This movie is one of the best spoofs on media stars to come out in a long time. Not only was John C. Reilly wonderful in his role as Dewey Cox, the entire cast was great. Special commendation must be afforded to Raymond J. Barry who plays Dewey's rambunctious father. Mr. Barry was truly hilarious. Now there a lot of nudity in this movie, but it's part of the story and without it the story of Dewey Cox could not be effectively told. If you like a clever script, strong comedic acting, and a movie that is a great parody of the entertainment industry and undoubtedly draws its material from the actual depraved behavior of some of the most well-known and internationally famous entertainment stars, then this movie is for you. Remember, though, the humor is adult and it's not for kids.There are so many things wrong with Dewey the character. At times he can be downright nasty; most of the time he is thoughtless and self-centered. Nevertheless, the creators of this movie have succeeded in developing a character who, despite his myriad of shortcomings, is likable, and, unlike the mentally challenged and emotionally stilted Forrest Gump, is a creditable metaphor for the human condition - and for a Hollywood movie, that's impressive.This movie also devotes a lot of time to some rather unconventional utilization of bathroom plumbing.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly Good Comedy for someone who usually plays a side-kick,"I had the pleasure of making it out to the movie theatre this Christmas to go and see a movie. I was shocked too hear my Aunt suggest Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, but there it was. I went to see it with my entire family and some extended family.Initially, I had heard nothing about the films, nothing from friends ore acquaintances who had seen it before me. After seeing various trailers, I was under the impression it was just another horrible farce movie like Date Movie or The Comebacks. This wasn't the case at all. It did have a few references to Ray and was an overall farce of Walk the Line, but it was not over the top at all with it. It was actually a shock to see how good John C. Reilly's voice was. Also, I may add that Jenna Fischer was stunningly beautiful and did great in her role (I don't think it was her singing though).There are several lines that had me laughing through entire scenes. I was even surprised to turn to my mother and aunt, who were laughing along with me. I was actually in tears from one specific part.My only disappointment was that the movie started a little slow. The comedy at first was kind of juvenile ad weird. However, once the movie got rolling it was fantastically hysterical.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Worst Movie He Has Directed,"I don't understand what he was thinking in this movie. It was undeniably the worst movie I have ever seen period. The spoofing of other movies was worn out with the scary movie series. And this movie was spoofing a life story of a real man in his long and apparently journey though life. I hated this movie with ever bit of my being and I really think the only way I would watch it again was if i got paid to. Superbad and other movies directed by Judd were good, as a matter of fact they actually had a story line an real significance. But this movie really wasn't worth the film it was on. I fail to see the nominations that were brought on by the Golden Globes. There are far better movies out at this time and or have been in the past year, including Superbad and other movies.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Comedy done right,"With all the awful ""comedy"" movies that came out during those years (Date movie, Epic movie, etc.) It's not amazing that a comedy this good would've flown under the radar.With an epic comedy cast and music/biopic jokes galore ""Walk Hard"" will have you smiling and quiet laughing at scenes from the movie even days after you've seen it. (Wanting to avoid all temptations and then running into ""The Temptations"" has to be the best musical joke in the world)This movie makes fun of the classic tropes that Hollywood insists on using in most music biopics (even if they're not entirely true) and does so masterfully.Also, it helps that instead of focusing in a single movie (although it spoofs heavily ""Walk the line"") it focuses in all of these tropes. You could say it's spoofing a genre and therefore giving you a spiritual successor to movies like ""Airplane!"", ""The Naked Gun"" or ""Hot Shots!""It's always hard to review comedies because they're highly subjective, my girlfriend didn't really laugh once while I was rolling on the floor at the site of Dewey Cox entering a bathroom and seeing a whole line of sinks ready for him to smash them. I could almost hear the sinks saying ""Oh no, not this again!""Or the knack Dewey has for barging into the bathroom only to find Tim Meadows surrounded by pretty women doing drugs and saying ""Get out of here Dewey! You want no part of this"" and then proceeding to make it sound awesome.Also, who knew the remedy for high drug detox would be the correct amount of blankets?I made myself laugh again, so I will finish my review with this:

Flop Hard: The John C. Riley SUCKS Story,"This is a review of the commercial advertisements for this pathetic looking piece of garbage, since I have not seen Walk Hard: The Dewy Cox Story. Never will I see it as a matter of fact. Since the ads for this crap were torture to sit through, I doubt highly I would ever consider wasting my time or money and see the actual film.While John C. Reily may be an adequate dramatic supporting actor, he is not a lead actor and he certainly has no flair for comedy. For whatever reason, Apatow seems bent on reinventing this guy as the new Will Ferrel. Hopefully Walk Hard's disastrous and pathetic showing at the box office will put a stop to this crusade. The 40 Year Old Virgin was far from a great movie, but the funny and talented Steve Carrell made it work. John C. Reilly, to put it bluntly, SUCKS as a comedic actor and has no timing whatsoever.To sell a feeble attempt for a movie such as Walk Hard to a fickle public, you need a guy like Carrell or Jim Carrey to anchor it. Everything about this production seems like it was destined to fail from the get-go.To make matters worse, an article brought to my attention around the time the movie was released where Apatow boatsed about the loads of naked male genitalia was was displayed prominently in the film (no pun intended). Thanks for the warning, Judd, but I already was planning on avoiding this movie like the plague.Anyone who would even waste their time giving something like Walk Hard a chance, you seriously have to wonder about. I have nothing against those who are attracted to their same gender, but if a movie shows excessive naked penis I am going to skip it. That's just me.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Slight but occasionally hilarious,"After seeing The TV Set earlier this week, I was especially interested in seeing the followup film from director Jake Kasdan and producer Judd Apatow. The biopic is definitely a genre in much need of a spoofing, and I figured Kasdan and Apatow, with the often brilliant John C. Reilly in the lead, would produce a spoof with perhaps a little more depth than other films of the genre. But, alas, Walk Hard walks about the same line as the Hot Shot movies, somewhat below The Naked Gun and somewhat above Scary Movie. It's funny for the most part, but painfully two-dimensional. It does have some nice jokes concerning the history of pop music that might bypass the younger generations. I especially loved when Dewey Cox went through his Brian Wilson period. The recording session of his Pet Sounds-like album is just great. ""I need an army of didjeridoos!"" Perhaps the funniest joke of the film are the various music stars of the era whose personae are occupied by celebrities in cameos. I actually wish they had gone even further with this, covering as many musicians as they could. The moment of the film that made me laugh the most is when Frankie Muniz, the kid from Malcolm in the Middle, appears as Buddy Holly. The casting is truly inspired, and I just love the way every phony celebrity is called by both their first name and last name every time they are mentioned, like, ""Well hello, Buddy Holly"" or ""How are you doing, Paul McCartney?"" The entire sequence where Cox meets The Beatles in India had me holding my sides. That could have gone on for longer. There are a lot of other jokes that cracked me up, as well. The entire first sequence, where we see the obligatory tragedy that sets Cox's life in motion, is hilarious. The recurring joke where, whenever Dewey gets especially upset, he finds the nearest bathroom sink, rips it out, and smashes it on the ground is one that is close to my heart. It seems that there are at least two Oscar clips of actors or, more commonly, actresses, smashing dishes on the ground when they are angry. And, if you want to see something extremely rare, Tim Meadows is hilarious in another recurring joke, where Cox walks in on him doing drugs in a back room (a direct parody of Ray) and then joins him. So, yeah, there are some great gags. But then there are long dry stretches. And, as I said, the film is very shallow. It's content to be just a spoof, so, in the end, it's not all that memorable. But it's well worth watching if you're looking for some quick, easy laughs.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A ridiculously dumb and heavy handed spoof of music biopics and Cash (& Dylan) Walk Hard will leave you in creases if you get on board with its late night comedy stylings,"A ridiculously dumb and heavy handed spoof of music biopics and Cash (& Dylan) Walk Hard will leave you in creases if you get on board with its late night comedy stylings. John C Reilly is terrific vocally in the lead role of 'Dewey Cox' (Cash) as is Jenna Fischer as 'a June Carter type' despite some questionable dialogue which is outrageous but just about treads (walks) the line. 'Walk hard', 'Guilty as charged' & 'A beautiful ride' fall into the category of songs which have no right to be as good as they are and the ensemble cast features a smorgasbord of nougties comedy superstars along for the fun.

While it definitely makes you laugh out loud multiple times, and will have you repeating lines to your friends, it didn't have the ""flow"" that most good movies have. It felt like a bunch of random scenes thrown together with little plot.

Too many to choose just one,"Saw this last night on DVD for the first time, and I was in stitches. Maybe because I work in the music business some of the really ""in"" stuff hit home. Here are the parts I liked best;1. The Blues scene, where Dewey busts off an authentic blues riff first time out on cutting his brother in half.2. The way Dewey talks to rock stars, always being sure to use their full names and titles, as if he's helping out the audience. Jack Black as McCartney is classic.3. When we are introduced to a ""fourteen year old"" Dewey, who looks an awful to like a 50 year old Dewey, although his band mates are teens. It's another example, like the cars in the Midget scene, where there is no attempt made to make flashbacks authentic.4. The Brian Wilson ""goat session"". He had the Wilson beard, man-dress and the over-the-top production of the ""Pet Sounds"" and ""Smile"" sessions.Many more, but in short, this is stands beside ""Spinal Tap"" as a scathing and hysterical look at the world of rock and roll.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

The best fake biopic in the business,"There are any number of reasons to hate this movie. For one, it can be repetitive. For another, it can be tasteless. Actually, those are the only two reasons I can think of to dislike this movie, which you should be expecting given previous Judd Apatow works when you go in.The thing that makes this movie truly great is that it is, whether or not you notice, the first American Hot Fuzz. Here is a genre parody so great that I think it would fly over the heads of people who haven't seen enough biopics or don't know enough rock 'n' roll history. There is that good old tasteless humor characteristic of Apatow films that could keep even the casual moviegoer laughing, but really what we have is a very studied recreation of the biopic that shakes a stick at trends we've seen but may not have noticed were trends.Dewey Cox goes through the phases of, essentially, every major music star between the '50s and the '70s. On the surface you'll find Buddy Holly, Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan and the Beatles, but those are definitely not the only ones whose surprisingly formulaic lives and their consequent biopics are parodied (even, impressively, the recent Dylan biopic I'm Not There seems to be parodied stylistically, though it seems odd to suggest that Walk Hard consciously called the off-beat touch of I'm Not There months ahead of its release). What this really is, is a work of genius, a biopic that is really only necessarily funny because you know Dewey Cox did not really exist.Perhaps the tasteless and obvious jokes are not enough to give this movie the longevity it might deserve, but the perfection it attains in satirizing the biopic should. The audience I was with got so hooked on Dewey Cox that I saw more than one tear fall in the duration of the movie. By the end, even I really cared about the fake recording star, although I did not really expect to. I think the cleverest thing of all about the film is that their invented Dewey Cox is not really half bad. It would have been easy to make that the big joke, that millions of people were falling for the music of Dewey Cox, too stupid to realize he sucked, but it's impressive because Dewey Cox, and his songs, for the most part, do not suck. Some of the numbers he performs are legitimately good songs. John C. Reilly does not always play the role comedically. I think that's what ultimately makes it memorable and good.So maybe if you see it, you won't like it, because it's often rude or you haven't seen or cared for enough biopics to play ""Spot the Genre Parody."" Fair enough. But if you want to see a movie so carefully put-together that it gives you chills, this is a good one to check out.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Poor but for the music,"Film Review: Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story Starring: John C.

That pretty much sums up the film, with the exception of its only saving grace ¬ñ the music.While the film itself is little more than a cheap shot at every other musical biography, it provides viewers with many nostalgic moments of the industry's greatest artists. Dewey Cox - a fictional icon ¬ñ is a hard rocker with a penchant for trying out different women; drugs and various styles of music.His peculiar relationship with Hassidic Jews brings freakish absurdity to the film, but the comedic element of The Dewey Cox story is seriously lacking.

Hard Walkin',"As a fan of the parody movie genre, who has seen it dwindle down from the greats like Naked Gun and Spaceballs to total horse crap like Epic Movie, it's great to see movies like Walk Hard. But that's just it - you HAVE to realize that Walk Hard is a parody. You could even go so far as to say it's our generation's ""This Is Spinal Tap"" in that a lot of people who originally saw it didn't get the joke at first.It's not just of the Johnny Cash biopic ""Walk The Line"", which it does parody heavily, but every biopic ever made. And not only does it follow the formula to a T, even right down to the part where the musician enters rehab and sobers up, but portraying the fictional Dewey Cox instead of a real-life musician is not an easy task. Especially when the Apatow gang really does convince you that Dewey Cox exists.The Cox saga starts off when Dewey accidentally decapitates his brother with a machete. He then overcomes his tragedy by discovering the blues. Then we cut to ten years later when we see a fully-grown Cox as a 14 year old playing in a high school band. From there, Dewey gets married, goes out on tour, leaves his wife for his backup singer Darlene, then goes to India to hang out with a really convincing version of the Beatles and gets involved with every pill and drug known to man, thanks to his drummer (Tim Meadows). But Meadows practically steals the show in that his character introduces Dewey to all the drugs.Overall, this is a great parody, and the Apatow gang pulled it off nearly flawlessly. John C. Reilly is an insanely funny actor, and the movie contains a killer soundtrack, which is more than worth seeking out, with all the tunes being performed by Reilly himself. It's too bad that other Apatow movies, like ""Superbad"" and the forthcoming ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" stole the thunder from Dewey Cox, but it's worth checking out now that it is on DVD.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

I'll admit quite a bit of the music was actually pretty good, including the duets with Darlene (Jenna Fischer).

However, the humor mostly fell flat for me and the running gags weren't even particularly funny. For example: the names of the famous celebrities he invariably encounters being repeated over and over. What did work better were the sexual innuendo jokes, especially the duet. Most of the best jokes are in the trailer that makes the movie look much better than it actually is. I think big American music fans from the fifties up to the eighties would get a lot more from Dewey Cox with all the references and inside jokes.

Frat boy humor in a high-concept package,"Some interesting decisions here from Judd Apatow and company. They start with just the essential choice to parody a modestly well-know music biography - ""Walk the Line"" which had come out only 2 years prior. Unlike ""Spaceballs"", the Mel Brooks parody of perhaps the most famous films of all time and one rife for satire likely the vast majority of film-goers won't even catch most of the allusions to Johnny Cash's story such as the death of his brother who haunted him his whole life. Also, Cash's name continues to carry artistic cache unlike a John Denver or even Elvis Presley so some viewers may have found themselves offended by the send-up of Cash's life story. Another interesting choice involves using a script made up of only jokes until the final 10-15 minutes of run-time when the film becomes very sentimental finishing on an incongrously uplifting final performance of a legitimate tune. The strategy seemed to be to launch one joke after another with the idea that enough will land to make the overall experience funny. While there is some sophisticated humor (Dewey's first wife played by Kristen Wiig promises to support his muscial career no matter what before nearly instantly trying to get a legitimate job for him in a slaughterhouse even after he has become wildly sucessful), for the most part - including the actual name of the film - it is a long series of racial, scatalogical, and genital jokes. There are many Python-esque absurdist moments as well particularly focused on fourth-wall breaking (much is made of John C. Reily playing Dewey at 14, 19, and 21). In short, probrably more of a party movie for groups enjoying some inerbriates.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Did I say it ruled?,10.0,Anonymous,Music
Go Stoned....?,"After dragging my poor boyfriend with me to see P.S. I Love You, I tried to make it up to him by taking him to see this. I was more than ready for a two hour ab workout. There was barely a jiggle registered. There were a couple chuckles, but the humor was sparce and far between....I was able to take a few catnaps and catch right up. I was so disappointed in this, I had such hopes. It wasn't for lack of talent-each actor was exceptional and committed their character. I can't put my finger on it...was it the editing? Was it too long? Would it have been better an SNL skit and left at that? I'll never know. All I know is it will take months before my boyfriend trusts my movie choices again....luckily, we started the year off on Charlie Wilson's War and are on our way to recovery.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent comedy,"A great parody of rockstar biopics, like ""Walk The Line"" and ""Ray"". Screamingly funny. Probably the second best rock mockumentary, after the incredible ""This is Spinal Tap"".Helps your appreciation of the movie if you have seen ""Walk the Line"" and/or ""Ray"" and have a good knowledge of rock music and its history. The spoofs of Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, The Beatles and Elvis Presley and the rap video are fantastic.Brief but great appearances from Jack White as Elvis Presley and Jack Black as Paul McCartney. Eddie Vedder, Jewel, Jackson Browne and Lyle Lovett as themselves add to the authenticity and star quality.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Let's Duet!""","I'm not a huge fan of John C. Reily. For some reason he reminds me of Will Ferrell and I don't like him too much either, but anyways, Reily did a fantastic job. This movie is great if you love the style and get the humor. If you haven't seen ""Walk The Line"", ""Ray"", or get old classic music like The Beatles or Bob Dylan, you will be clueless at some parts.Reily plays Dewey Cox, who is guilty of cutting his successful brother in half. Being blamed and rejected by his father, he journeys to become great. He learns the guitar and starts The Dewey Cox Four with his friends, and hits it big at 15. At the height of his fame, he meets famous musicians like Buddy Holly, The Beatles, and Elvis. Along the way he loses his wife and falls for his backup singer, gets addicted to drugs and must come-back before he sells out, also meaning caring for his 22 kids he never paid attention to.The first half is hilarious, then through his drug days it gets more serious. The songs are genius and catchy. ""Walk Hard"" has some of the funniest surprise roles like Jack Black, Paul Rudd and Frankie Muniz. Totally worth the money, however I wished they could have cut the need to show penis...",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Review of film in general,"This movie is hilarious and is so funny but I was angry that they cut two scenes that were in the trailer the ""Patrick Duffy"" scene and the ""It doesn't taste like Cox"" scene. The rest of the movie was hilarious.The movie was pretty much a parody of Ray and Walk The Line, pulling segments from both. The majority of the movie was based around Walk The Line. Jenna Fisher is amazing, as is John C. Reilly. Tim Meadow's character was an excellent addition, he delivers one of the funniest lines in the movie with ""You Don't want none of this #$%#"" There is full frontal male nudity but its hilarious. The movie follows Dewey's life from a child to an elderly person. Overall a great way to spend an afternoon, highly recommend to anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Reilly could have used some help,"This movie reminds me of one of those numerous SNL spin off movies that tried to cash in on the unexpected success of the ""Wayne's World"" movies. The writing is weak, few characters are developed or bring much to the story. I found myself getting kind of bored several times during the film and often wondered if I was supposed to be laughing at certain skits. I am a big fan of John C. Reilly, always have been, but this film is lacking in high caliber talent elsewhere, most importantly in the direction, which was weak. There are some talented people in cameos, but they are simply not given enough to do. I wanted a ""Talladega Nights"" and I got that film with the SNL chick that played ""Superstar.""",5.0,Anonymous,Music
John C and Laugh Hard,"3/4ths of this movie is some of the best movie-making you'll see all year and the 1/4th that isn't (the 3rd quarter post-Beatles part) doesn't sink it because it ends on a high note.John C. Reilly is close to spectacular in the title role. Jake Kasdan, Judd ""what-a-year-he-has-had"" Apatow, the supporting cast (including a slew of great cameos) and especially the people responsible for the songs have crafted an almost too-smart-for-its-own-good satire of popular music since Bill Haley and music movie bios (which I've never been a fan of).When this comedy works it is as good as BOB ROBERTS (without the dread that some pol someday won't adopt that character as a blueprint for running a campaign someday --maybe Barack already has sans the guitar and the conservative fascism --and, please, don't tell that there is no such thing as liberal fascism --just google David Geffen) and THANK YOU FOR SMOKING (without it political acuteness).The crazy thing about this movie is that I can't wait to buy the music CD from it. The songs are superbly crafted and they are funnier than hell. ""Let's Duet"" is as dirty as Springsteen's ""Pink Cadillac"" and it is a bit more obvious.WARNING: this movie earns its R-rating for the right reasons.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Felt like a bunch of typical SNL skits.,"Walk Hard looked really funny from the trailers....it wasn't. With all the talented actors and writers working on this, it still wasn't very good.Walk Hard follows the life of singer Dewey Cox (John C. Reilly). Reilly is a very talented guy, but he had nothing to work with. Even the jokes that could've possibly been funny were poorly executed and ruined. It's obvious that, since this is a parody of movies about musicians, might as well include every musician of each time period. The musician (or actors pretending to be musician) cameos mostly also fell flat, mainly because anytime a musician appears, the humor is based on exaggerated versions of the actual musicians, not jokes. Elvis was a ladies man jerk, Buddy Holly was young, the Beatles were hippie druggies. It's not funny making entire scenes pointing this out. The cameo actors got annoying sometimes too, but they were occasionally amusing. However, with the negatives, this was, at times, pretty funny. It was thoroughly entertaining, with very few lulls of boredom, though there were quite a few parts with no laughter.Overall, this was an entertaining, thought not very funny movie. It could've been much better.My rating: ** out of ****. 90 mins. R for language, sexuality, nudity.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
a very bad movie that people should see (garbage),"I seen bits and pieces of this movie and this movie is horrible. Heres the rules about this movie. First Dewey Cox does something to a teenage girl and he said that she is going to have babies and the frontal nudity is showing and it is very inappropriate thing to do. Second saying bad language to take care of babies is very terrible. Third those immigrants are also suppose to be in a different country because they should not let these guys help Dewey Cox. Fourth Those animals that Dewey cox has should have not be in this film because a ape should live in the jungles at Afrca and the giraffe too. Last they should of made this movie NC-17 for bad language, frontal teenage girl nudity, and sex humor. I hate you Dewey Cox your confusing everyone to see this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Walk hard for a great film,"This is without a doubt one of my favourite comedies. Judd Apatow and Jake Kasden know how to present a good comedy and they do so in this film. Walk Hard has an ample amount of jokes in it but the great mix of stupid laugh out loud moments you would see in any Will Ferrell movie and the ironic, clever or well throughout jokes makes this film so appealing that it will keep your eyes glued to the screen. John C Reily is fantastic in it and shows how much of a versatile actor he is, the music is great and the vast amount of cameos you get to see in the movie are brilliant. Walk Hard does very well by not sticking too closely to the walk the line story, for the majority of the time it has its very own great comic story present.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

It felt at times as though Naughton was trying to launch a pop career on the back of this, not make me laugh.The Bob Dylanesque song is great -it's repeated at the end (you'll miss it during the film) the lyrics are really funny.Also, slightly racist -black people are into erotic dancing",2.0,Anonymous,Music

Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story: Reflections of a rolling stone in a fun house mirror,"Walk Hard; The Dewey Cox Story; here in referred to as (WHTDCS) by this author is this years Forest Gump (1994). Concider, Forest Gump is mentally challenged, his best friend Bubba has a speech impediment, Lt. Dan is a double amputee, and his girl friend Jenny, dies of AIDS, all in the span of 30 years. The era is almost the same for both films as well as the violence, adult language, adult content, sexuality, drug use, political activism, rock and roll and racial equality issues. Granted Forest Gump was rated PG-13 and WHTDCS is rated R for male non-sexual frontal nudity, and a bit more funny, adult content but this film was made 13 years later, in actual time.The title WHTDCS, may be more offense to the American public but with a film titled Knocked Up (2007) the gloves are already off. Back to comparing both films; when the public watched Forest Gump, they laughed out loud but as previously stated, the main characters were mentally retarded, confined to a wheel chair, an alcoholic, suffering from a speech disorder, and dying of AIDS! Yet, the film viewing public more often than not found this film a comedy, is it not strange to laugh at those less fortunate than most! WHTDCS is very much like the cast in Forest Gump; Dewey Cox (John C. Rielly) has no sense of smell, his lead drummer is a drug addict as well as the rest of his band and Dewey is forced to leave home at the age of 16! Satire allows the audience to laugh at a sad situation like Forest Gump and WHTDCS. In the early 1960's Monte Python's Flying Circus hit the airways of Public Television in The USA, America had found a new comedy. It was great fun to laugh at The British! All of their silly walks, Spam, Spam, Spam, etc.,etc.,etc., but we were laughing at our English neighbors, not at ourselves. WHTDCS is grand satire at America, and Americans may find that too salty a meal to digest. Director Jake Kardan has made a very funny film, a pun unto itself, with actor John C. Reilly in the lead doing stand-up. Sadly the box office does not reflect the gross product of Dewey Cox, however hard, he may walk.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
What happens when the satire is actually better than the movies it mocks?,"Americans are getting very good at this satire genre. This film is a spot-on parody of every clich√©-infested fake country music bio you have ever seen (despite the great performances) from ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" to ""I Walk the Line"" - which I remember hating for all the things it was not, mainly truthful and meaningful. Every single medical emergency and unwanted pregnancy is there, every ghost from the past, every shameful substance abuse and rehab episode and encounter with the greats of musicdom. The songs cover an extremely wide range from pre-rock to hip-hop, by way of folk, psychedelia and disco. The hero even goes through a ""Brian Wilson"" period, which is musically the most complex and challenging part of the film. So much attention has been paid to the writing, the performance and the arrangements of the songs, in fact, in this film, that (1) it should have won Oscars for everyone involved, (2) this is the best original musical in a long time besides being a very good comedy and (3) the DVD has something like three hours of extras, deleted scenes unused songs and jokes, on top of the longer 2 hour version, all memorable and funny. And John C. Reilly has the voice of Roy Orbison with a lot more versatility. The man is a chameleon and a very underrated actor. All of which makes this film a much more sincere homage to American music than any single biopic it makes fun of.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Walk Hard"" should jog on - 42%","I can't exactly remember why I bought this DVD many months ago. I think I may have been taken in by the trailer or noticed that this was the product of the same man behind ""Superbad"", Judd Apatow. I do remember thinking how good it was that one of the most overlooked men in Hollywood, John C Reilly, finally had the lead in his own movie. Sadly, there was one thing I had forgotten. What exactly is the point in watching a movie spoofing the likes of ""Walk The Line"" if you haven't yet seen ""Walk The Line""? However I suspect that even if I had, it would only have been slightly funnier. It felt too bizarre and contrite to be properly funny, despite Reilly's cracking performance.Reilly plays music legend Dewey Cox whose songs strike a chord with America in the early days of rock and roll. Cast out by his disapproving father (Raymond J Barry), Dewey finds himself on the road touring with his band and succumbing to a variety of temptations - drink, drugs and women all lead Dewey away from success on a road to Hell whilst his accidental murder of his brother Nate (Chip Hormess) continues to pray on Dewey's fragile state of mind. But through it all, his on-off relationship with backing singer Darlene (Jenna Fischer) is Dewey's best hope of tasting success once again.Reilly pretty much saves this movie from being a complete wash-out. He is loving every minute of ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"", stretching each clich√© to breaking point and gaining maximum comic potential from each scene. Sadly, the film's humour is far too scatter-gun in nature to be consistently funny - a few scenes raise a faint titter but by and large, this was pretty disappointing. Most rock & roll stories are, by their very nature, excessive so no matter what lunacy happens on screen (pet giraffes, shooting acid with the Beatles, 22 kids and 14 step-kids and more besides), it's simply too ludicrous to be funny. Reilly is also pretty much on his own among the cast as well - Jack Black and Paul Rudd's cameos as Lennon & McCartney were genuinely funny as was Tim Meadows as Dewey's drug pushing band-mate Sam but everyone else overacts or is pretty unmemorable. Speaking of cameos, there are a wealth of famous faces in there but none of them are funny (other than those I've mentioned) and the last time I checked, this was supposed to be a comedy.I'm almost annoyed that ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" is such a waste of promising material and talent. It never seems to get beyond first gear, trundling along and minding its own business while this viewer waited for the mercifully short duration to go by. I did want to enjoy this but I simply couldn't - it's not funny enough and like other dreadful ""spoofs"" being released lately (""Dance Flick"" and the like), it feels too niche to appeal to most viewers. Perhaps if you've seen ""Walk The Line"" or ""Ray"" then maybe you'll see the funny side but if, like me, you haven't then I recommend looking elsewhere for a good old giggle.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
very fun!,"I laughed several times and was in the right mood to enjoy this ""spinal tap-esquire"" film. Good comedy is hard, and IMHO just the right amount of subtlety and over-the-top humor were in the mix to make this film worth my time. If you are spun out due to the stressful season and need a bit of helium to lift up check it out. The songs were clever and well done. I listened to an interview with Kasdan and Reilly and their love of the project was apparent. It is hard to watch all the serious shows and the take themselves to serious formulaic drivel that saturates the movie landscape. I will buy this DVD for all the extras that were not shown. I really enjoyed the credit songs and sat in the theater until the lights came up. Good Holiday Treat!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Warning, you'll be offended!","This film, ""Walk Hard,"" is spoof of the biographies on musicians like Ray Charles and Johnny Cash. It means to be light-hearted but there are just some offensive moments in the movie. Apart from the offensiveness particularly the stereotyping of Jews running the music industry, there are some worthy laughs. John C. Reilly can sing and work solo without his buddy Will Ferrell. I love watching him play the dim-witted musician without a sense of smell. Of course, I was offended by his brother's accidental death. He was cut in half during machete fight between young Dewey and his brother. His brother was the favored son. Dewey's mother is played by the wonderful Margo Martindale who also meets a strange demise while listening to her son's song on the radio. It's good to see Tim Meadows and Chris Parnell as his band mates who introduces him to drugs, alcohol, and sex. Christine Wiig plays his first wife. Jenna Fischer plays Darlene Madison who is a take on June Carter. The film is nothing more than silliness but there is some things to be offended about.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Good and long over-due dig at the rock music industry... Awesome movie,"I truly loved this movie, it is entertaining, funny, idea is fresh and creative, and the music, believe it or not, was pretty good (most of them).I also loved the fact that it gave the rock industry (in particular the Rolling Stones Magazine) a good dig. Such as: 1. The whole story is based on a guy with relatively modest music talent who made it to the big time. This is kinda true as many musicians at the early 60-70s made it big and became nowadays legends, not for some extraordinary musical talents, but because they had (1) the guts to pick up a guitar on stage and perform (2) the passion to perform and write music (3) a bit of luck (to be discovered by record companies), and most importantly (4) because there were no other competitors at the time, people listen to what they have. Good examples are the likes of Freddie and the Dreamers, Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Ramones, The Who, Guns and Roses etc. Even the likes of Elvis, The Rolling Stones and The Beatles can be put into this category. Elvis was a great performer, but not really a great composer, and The Beatles are great song-writers, but looked at how the Rolling Stones Magazine rate them - George Harrison no. 23 of Greatest Guitarist of All Time?! John Lennon, Paul MaCartney & Mick Jagger top 20 singers of all time? On the other hand, a lot of musicians faded into the abyss despite having huge talent simply because they are reluctant to constantly step into the lime light, just ask Nick Drake.2. Their dig at Bob Dylan was great... Many artist can write nonsense (best examples are Bob Dylan & John Lennon) in their songs, and people think they're genius because ""you guys are idiots... this song is very deep"". Yet when an Average Joe does the same thing, he's considered an idiot.3. The Beatles are the greatest band in the world, and I truly love them. But they can also act like a bunch of spoilt kids, simply because they're just human, but people often goes to their shrine and bow to them like they're Gods.4. Punk music are often written by some mad and angry yet rich and wealthy drug-addicts who really had nothing to complain in their lives, but choose this form of music to whine about how they cannot get laid at nights.5. At the end of the movie, one final dig was on the modern industry, where young money-driven artists take some 70-80's oldies and make it into some pathetic semi rap song. And boy are they awful. Just listen to what Jay Z did to Forever Young, Eminem to Dream On, Gym Class Hero did to Breakfast in America...Over all, a 9 out of 10 from me. Except a few jokes (such as cutting Dewey's brother & dad in half) I thought was unnecessary, this movie is brilliant and I've been watching it over and over again. So underrated and cult.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The greatest parody movie of all time,"There are other contenders, but this is the definitive winner. And I'm not talking about mockumentaries like this is spinal tap or best in show.

This movie sucks!,"I like Apatow's other works, but this movie was so uninteresting, I almost didn't even finish watching it. I do realize that it was a parody of other musicians' biopics (think ""Ray"" and ""Walk the Line"") but seriously I could have taken those two movies and combined plots, thrown in a few mildly humorous moments and sold it to Hollywood. Apatow and Kasdan did nothing special here. There was nothing original about this movie. I felt like I was watching a crappy amalgamation of two great movies that I had already seen--""Ray"" and ""Walk the Line""-- which depicted the actual stories of two actual musicians, both of which are far more interesting than the fictional Dewey Cox. If you're looking for a great musician biopic watch ""Ray"" or ""Walk the Line"". If you're looking for a great Apatow comedy, try ""Knocked Up"" or ""Superbad"". Or ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"". Or ""Anchorman"". There are so many better choices than this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
I can't wait for the DVD,"I loved this film and laughed all the way through. My wife liked it, too, but she's so sick of me talking about it that she has forbidden me to mention it any more. So I'm writing this tribute here.Silly jokes based on a deep knowledge of the history of pop music and thorough research into the musician biopic format. Silly songs with great tunes written by skilled professionals who nail their targets perfectly. And nudity just for the sake of nudity (Judd Apatow admitted as much in an interview). This film breaks no new ground--it wasn't meant to--it's a hilarious story told using a language taken from many earlier films--both funny and serious. And it succeeds admirably. The jokes are even funnier if you started listening to music and watching films in the 50's--there were many times when only the older people in the audience were laughing. Other IMDb reviewers disparage the repetitive jokes--I thought they were well executed.After listening to the CD hundreds of times in my car (darn, I wish I could sing as well as John C. Reilly) I was overjoyed to learn there's an extended sound track on iTunes with twice as many songs, but missing the David Bowie Starman song on the original CD. Some of these songs didn't make it into the theatrical release but are still great.I'm totally hooked on ""Beautiful Ride,"" the song Dewey sings in his triumphant last concert at the end of the film. Even though it has a lot of silly lyrics like the rest of the songs, I found it very moving and staged perfectly by director Jake Kasdan. And as in every other song John C. Reilly recorded for this project, his big voice really shines, Here's some of the lyrics for that song:'Cause when all is said and done. When youth is spent and burned. You'll see what it's all about: Music! Flowers! Babies! Sharing the good times! Traveling not just for business! Accepting your mortality! This is finally what I've learned!Thank you, Mr. Kasdan, for a great and continuing experience. I can't wait to see how you expand your comedic epic when you make my DVD!",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Timeless comedy,"I hate it when anyone on TV calls this movie a ""Bomb"" every time its mentioned. I think it gives people the impression that this movie was bad and thats why it didn't do so well at the box office. However, its just the opposite. I laughed my ass off throughout the whole movie and couldn't stop quoting it. Maybe it's because I got the music references easily and had knowledge of what was being made fun of. A group of teenagers actually got up and left the theater 20 minutes into it, I guess they were too absorbed in the shitty music of Hannah Montana and fall out boy to get the jokes.

Stale casting.,"So. Walk Hard. Not detestably unfunny, but fidget-inducingly slow. I was straining my ears the entire time for Anchorman quality humor but never really got what I was hoping for. It seems like this movie was really just a formality--a rite of passage, if you will. It didn't need to be a huge block-buster as long as John C. Reilly got a chance to prove he can sell tickets without the extra boost from WF. Hopefully there will be a return to form in their upcoming buddy comedies now that Reilly's proved himself a worthy, independent member of the ""Frat Pack.""The thing that bothered me most about this movie was actually the casting... Judd Apatow really needs to broaden his horizons.

The original music really fits the target era it's based in! Instead of directly copying scenes from Ray or Walk the line, the writers have written entirely new scenarios. Keeping it short, because it is a very funny well acted film beautifully shot, and surprisingly original. That is why I'm giving it such a high rating!

Jarringly funny and enjoyable ride,"Utterly comically outrageous pseudo-biographic story of unlikely rock star Dewey Cox and his life. Kasdan caught Reilly at the top of form using this rock star vehicle to highlight his brilliant talents - his real heart-felt singing voice and boyish-innocence acting, all the while engaging in hilarious caricature vignettes of 'rock-star-on-the-road' living. Meadows is precious, as usual. Prepare for way outside comical vehicles and too much pointless penis. But many laughs and actual moments of feeling occur among the ridiculousness as well, making it, for me, a jarringly funny and enjoyable ride.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Totally disappointed,"After hearing several interviews of stars and creators and sampling of songs on my local NPR (National Public Radio) over a few months, I was looking forward to seeing this movie and enjoying the parodying of the singing and personalities of Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, and others.Then I got the DVD from my library this weekend.Unfortunately, all the gratuitous sick humor, nudity, drug use, and violence, and minimal good singing ruined it for me and my wife. I realize that this was supposed to represent the depravity that Elvis and other rock stars have sunk to -- but gee whiz.Call me somewhat older than the supposed target audience of these Apatow comedies which seems to favor raunchiness and sexual innuendo rather than on true creativity, good acting, and good stories.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Walk Hard: The Story of Dewey Cox,"Spoof movies have been around for as long as the art form of film has been entertaining people. From Charlie Chaplin to Woody Allen to the Marx Brothers and Mel Brooks, film makers have been spoofing other movie forms to satirize society and politics. Spoof movies have made us laugh while also showing us the error in our ways and the inherent stupidity found in our societal ways. Unfortunately, the form has taken a beating with the ""(Insert Genre Here) Movie"" series which has driven the genre into the mire. But when Judd Apatow joined with Jake Kasdan (a co-collaborator on Freaks and Geeks and Zero Effect), what they came up with should have turned the genre up on it's ear.After the accidental halving of his brother, Dewey Cox learns how to play blues guitar and starts writing songs. At the age of 14, he insights a riot with the song ""Take My Hand"" and leaves home to seek stardom. Dewey's discovered by Jewish businessmen in a club where black folk go to dance erotically when Dewey fills in for the regular act when he gets laryngitis. Making a huge splash with his first single, Walk Hard, Dewey goes on the road and we follow him through the ups and downs, the relationships, the drugs, and the destroying of multiple public and private bathrooms.Jake Kasdan and Judd Apatow do a great job of making this movie feel like a real biopic and not just a series of skits formed together to make a movie. They present each time frame with real authenticity, injecting the 60's with the whimsy we've seen in past movies, and the 70's with the ""grooviness"" we've come to expect of this kind of movie. The music feels authentic as well, feeling as if it's been written throughout the time frames seen in the movie.But you don't go into a parody for the dramatic elements, and for the comedy this movie has great pedigree. It fits in handsomely with other Apatow comedies like Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin, and Forgetting Sarah Marshall. John C. Reilly, fresh off Taladega Nights, shows off more of the comedic chops that he had shown in that movie, while also bringing a dramatic pedigree to the role not typical to this kind of comedy in recent years (he was nominated for an Oscar for his role in Chicago). On top of that, it seems as though everyone in Hollywood wanted to be involved in this movie as this movie boasts one of the largest lists of cameos I have ever seen in a movie including Paul Rudd, Jack Black, Jack White of the White Stripes, Lyle Lovett, Jewell, Tim Meadows, Justin Long, Kristen Wiig, Craig Robinson, and Jonah Hill just to name a few.As with any biopic, whether real or fake, though, this movie seems to loose it's away as the main character loses his way as well. It becomes more frenetic and loses pacing later on, but seems to catch itself before straying too far. Also some of the characters are underdeveloped as usually happens in biopics as you try to cram in characters that truly effected the main characters life. Luckily, the movie never feels as though it's dragging, and remains consistent with the laughs throughout.While Walk Hard was a critical hit, it unfortunately, it bombed at the box office where it deserved more of an audience. I highly recommend giving this chance if you like comedy and musician biopics. While funny, the movie never feels as though it's making fun of the people presented in the biopics it's skewering like Johnny Cash or Ray Charles. A word of warning, as with any Apatow flick one can expect a large amount of vulgarity including full frontal male and female nudity, a lot of cursing, and more than one person getting cut in half, so this may not be a movie you want to watch in front of the children. For those of you who can get around the aforementioned vulgarity (or embrace it as I do) you will be justly rewarded!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't Walk Hard To See This.,"I was so excited to see this movie when it came out, and that's what made it even worse when I saw it and realized it sucked. This movie could have and should have been a lot better. The idea of a struggling blues singer striving for success is such a great idea for a movie and it was completely wasted here. Very few of the jokes were even laugh material at all. John C. Reilly was woefully disappointing, and sadly enough, the funniest character in this film was Jon Lennon (played by Paul Rudd), who appeared for about 4 minutes. Things started out OK, but once time started passing rapidly, this movie spiraled downward, getting worse by the minute. By the time the movie was half-way through I was already hoping for it to end soon. And by the time the final 15 minutes or so have arrived, this movie was pretty much terrible by todays comedy standards. Judd Apatow was only loosely affiliated with this project, so I won't bash him too much, but this movie is absolute garbage compared to things like ""Knocked Up"", and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"". Don't Walk Hard, walk away, that's what I say!",5.0,Anonymous,Music

I Love This Movie,"Walk Hard traces the life of Dewey Cox, an infamous musician you've never heard of, from his boyhood in Alabama and his last days as a major music celebrity.This is a role the vastly underrated John C. Reilly was born to play. He is absolutely hysterical in this role, and shows incredible musical skill performing the soundtrack. Reilly is just so, so funny in this, it's my favorite role he has ever done. A role you have to see to believe, he embodies Dewey Cox as if he was Dewey Cox.The music is great, all original hits inspired by the different time periods Dewey ""lived in"". I'm not a fan of Judd Apatow usually, but here his efforts are wonderfully concentrated with direction by Jake Kasdan, both of which wrote the script. Kudos on their best work, we see Dewey go through every decade, and the tribulations Dewey faces with love, drugs, and music.Jenna Fischer shows some surprising talent that's a far stretch from The Office, playing Dewey's second wife. Tim Meadows and Chris Parnell, of SNL fame, play hilarious members of Dewey's group. Raymond J. Barry plays disapproving father Cox in spectacular fashion.This is one of my favorite comedies ever, and well worth the ten rating I give it. If you haven't seen it, watch it. You'll love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Funny as Hell!!!,"This movie is just hilarious!!! I bought this movie when it was released as a birthday present for my boyfriend. Before buying it I had never seen the movie, and I wasn't too sure that I'd like it. But from the moment the movie started, I started laughing and never stopped. This movie is just too funny. I love the music as well. I love the music so much that I'm thinking about buying the soundtrack. John C. Reilly is actually a really good singer. He did an awesome job as Dewey Cox. I also LOVED Jenna Fischer as Darlene, she's too cute. If you haven't watched this movie yet, do yourself a favor and watch it!! Hands down this is my favorite comedy that is from the 2000's. I can watch it over and over and still laugh. When you watch it be sure to watch the extended version. The extended version is about 2 hours long but it's definitely worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Really funny and clever ""Walk the Line"" spoof","I really enjoy the ""Walk the Line"" movie and I'm a big fan of Johnny Cash. I didn't expect this movie to be such a straight spoof of the major hallmarks of Cash's life, at least as it's thought of in popular memory, but I think the movie did a great job of being a parody but also being genuine and intelligent, even astute. It comments on tragedy, and accident, and temptation and blame, most of it rooted in Cash's life. But somehow it makes the crux of those somewhat, erm, silly and part of human nature desiring easy solutions while ignoring risk. All while being hilarious.Highly recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"Funny, poignant, intelligent spoof!!!","I saw this film with my son and we both laughed and laughed. It is very funny but also has it's serious side. The acting was superb! I have seen Walk the line and several other movies of that genre and this spoof nails them perfectly. The thing that makes this movie far superior to other recent spoof movies is that it does have serious parts in it and also an excellent music track which is performed by the leading man. Other spoof movies are just stupid, this movie is intelligent. Some movies you watch once and that's enough for a lifetime, this movie is for collecting and watching again and again. Go see it in the theater, you do get more than your money's worth of laugh's.

This film is a keeper,"I did not think it possible to rate a comedy as a 10/10. This film was a surprise.What makes this so unique is that it is both absurd and serious at the same time. It cleverly walks the lines between. In an era where ""woke"" is as phony as you get, this film is the inoculation against insincere and shallow (woke) tropes. It lampoons other famous biopics (Ray Charles, Johnny Cash). Then, layers it with (mostly) great music and (mostly) great acting.For a good laugh with hints of seriousness, you can't do much better than this film. I watched this film twice in a row (which I don't think I have ever done with any other film).If you are ""woke"", you will strongly dislike this film. It pokes fun at insincerity and shallowness, which would be offensive.There are also drug and sex references littered throughout the film. In most cases, they add realism and humour. The scenes with Darlene (Jenna Fischer) work particularly well, as do the scenes with Sam (Tim Meadows). Riley (as Dewy) mostly delivers superb lines. Wiig (Edith) is an underrated actress who had the most difficult role to play and should be recognised for her decent performance. For some reason, Wiig is not listed in the ""top cost"" on IMDB.This is a movie made for audiences rather than aiming to score ""virtue"" points. This film absolutely deserves a 10/10, although ""woke"" audiences are likely to score it as a 1/10 because it will hit raw nerves.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good, but have reasonable expectations","I really enjoyed this movie...lots of sexual innuendo (more than I care for) but that is what Apatow is known for in his movies. It's too bad because it (along with the terrible Beatles impersonations) cheapen the spot on parody of musician biopics. Reilly is great although he doesn't make for a convincing 14 year old but that is probably the point! He's a great singer and while I don't think I'll be buying the soundtrack, they had a very talented group of songwriters crafting the tunes that propel Dewey Cox to the top of pop stardom. The film is unevenly paced with an emphasis on his early years and then little attention given to his actual music career once he becomes popular. A little too much of the focus on his drug addiction but maybe that is part of the parody factor as well. This is one of those movies that is good but could have been SO much better with some additional scenes to illustrate how his career developed instead of solely on his personal life.I recommend this film but it's important not to have inflated expectations. It's got some really hilarious bits but don't expect it to be over-the-top funny.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Walk Hard... away from this movie,"I don't ask for much from a comedy. If it makes me laugh, I'm happy. This movie did not. There's a point about an hour and twenty minutes into the movie (in the Extended Cut) where the stage manager asks if Cox will be reminiscing for much longer, to which Cox's drummer replies something like, ""He's only up to the seventies yet."" I felt like Michael Corleone: ""Just when I thought I was out they pull me back in"". Nevertheless, I stuck it out to the bitter end and had a couple of chuckles along the way. However, a handful of chuckles isn't nearly enough to sustain this two hour 'comedy'.On the surface, ""Walk Hard"" seems promising. The script was co-written by Judd Apatow (""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Knocked Up"") and John C. Reilly stars in the title role. Unfortunately the film proved to be as hilarious as a swift kick in the gonads. My main problem with the humour is that it's incredibly stupid, obvious and repetitious. How many times do I need to see Dewey rip a sink off the wall? How many times do I need to hear his father say, ""The wrong son died""? It certainly doesn't help that the vast majority of the jokes are just plain unfunny. Cox accidentally chops his brother in half with machete? He goes 'smell blind'? Believe me, I could go on and on. Even if you're wise to all or most of the movie/music references the laughs are still few and far between.The cast has some notable & semi-notable names but when even John C. Reilly doesn't deliver a solid performance you know you're in trouble. To be fair, though, I don't think that this film is a good fit for his talents. Also disappointing is Jenna Fischer and just about everyone else for that matter. The short Beatles segment (only mildly funny despite several in-jokes) is worth mentioning because it includes Jack Black providing the worst Paul McCartney you're ever likely to see.The best thing that I can say about the movie (besides that it eventually ends) is that it looks pretty close to the movies it apes. The music, on the other hand, is hit and miss. The title song is completely forgettable though there are a few notable tunes, such as the innocuous 'Devil music' ballad ""Take My Hand"" and the politically flammable ""(Mama) You Got to Love Your Negro Man"".In the end, I can't possibly recommend this movie unless your only alternative is to spend the time watching paint dry. Walk Hard? This movie crawls.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Epic Satire Succeeds As Comedy, Drama, and Rock History Lesson","I've never been a fan of the gross-out comedies of Apatow and Kasdan. But I've admired John C. Reilly as a character actor ever since he was a small-town teenager in WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE. And I'm a huge student of classic rock, having listened since the mid Seventies and also having read many books on the subject.I thought WALK HARD might have a few cheap laughs about groupies and sex. What I discovered was that it is a triumph on every level. It is a comedy funnier than anything this side of THE BIG LEBOWSKI or YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. It is a country-boy makes good drama as moving and sincere as FORREST GUMP or SERGEANT YORK. And it provides an epic history of rock and roll from rockabilly to the disco era that really has no equal in any other film.The cast of this movie is incredible. Not only is John C. Reilly performing on a Tom Hanks level as sincere, gifted, yet goofy Dewey Cox, he receives incredible support in every scene. Jenna Fischer plays the love of his life and she's every bit as stunning and compelling as Reese Witherspoon in WALK THE LINE (even though she looks more like Sarah Michelle Gellar.) Even the two little boys in the hilariously tragic ""prologue"" are believably innocent and carefree as they begin that tragic game of machete tag.The humor in this movie goes far beyond the sex jokes, the blatant rip offs of rock decadence, and the imitations of famous scenes in WALK THE LINE and RAY. A lot of the humor is very subtle, like the ""serious"" way stars like Eddie Vedder pay tribute to Dewey's simplistic lyrics. ""When Dewey Cox said he wanted to walk hard, he made us think about how we wanted to walk."" In the same way, the Beatles impressions are funny, yet you really have to know rock history well to understand the Brian Wilson references as egocentric Dewey screams for ""50,000 djiridous"" to complete his unfinished symphony. The same with the Bob Dylan period. Dewey Cox handles reporters in a way both rebellious and shallow, which brilliantly skewers the self-importance of Dylan himself in DON'T LOOK BACK, and the phony reverence of unwatchable tributes like I'M NOT THERE. (""What do my parents think of my protest songs? What do your parents think of my protest songs, Mr. Time Magazine?"") But the most indescribable power of this movie comes from the fact that it is always character based. The machete accident at the beginning seems like a silly joke, but when a talking machete literally walks into Dewey's acid trip you can't help falling down with laughter, even as you recognize that something very profound is going on. The movie laughs at the basic premise of all biopics, that knowing a man's personal tragedy means you understand his work -- and yet they brilliantly weave that tragedy into all his work.WALK HARD also mocks a lot of the feel-good premises of self-help therapy,that forgiveness is key and acceptance brings renewal. During the final montage, where Dewey sings ""It's A Beautiful Ride"" and reflects on all the happy and sad memories of his life, there's a couple of shocking images that are both screamingly funny and touchingly sad. When you see Elvis Presley pull a switchblade on Dewey, or his father shove a pistol in his face, you see how funny it is to expect a man to put a ""positive"" spin on his own life. Dewey has memories he's not ever going to share with his fans, but that doesn't mean the happiness in the song is fake. It just makes the whole story more complex, more lifelike, and yes, more funny than anyone would ever have dreamed!WALK HARD is a one of a kind movie.

Better than Average Comedy with Interesting Knoweldge Mixed In,"This is a movie that I remember when it was coming out. I missed it in theaters and picked up the DVD not too long after it came out. This was a movie that I thought was funny, but there were a lot of references I didn't pick up on. Jaime and I decided to rewatch this as we wanted to see a comedy. I also had an edible as well. It should be pointed out, that I've only seen the director's cut and that is what we watched together.Where I'll start is that this is a dumb movie. The movie knows it though and is leaning into it. We are following Dewey Cox (Connor Rayburn) from his childhood. He accidentally kills his more talented brother and this angers their father. While his brother is dying, he makes Dewey promise he will be great for both. Dewey then grows into John C. Reilly. This movie then becomes a comedy about how Dewey becomes one of the most popular musicians in history. It is riffing a lot on Johnny Cash, but also pulling in different musicians throughout the ages of music. I will give credit that there is some great writing there. Director Jake Kasdan helped co-write this with Judd Apatow. Together there is something special while also leaning into the comedy.What also helps is the cast. We are featuring the likes of Jenna Fischer, David Krumholtz, Tim Meadows, Kirsten Wiig, Craig Robinson, Harold Ramis, Martin Starr, Ed Helms, Jane Lynch, Paul Rudd, Jack Black, Jonah Hill, Justin Long and Jason Schwartzman to name a few. Not everyone does a great impersonation of someone famous. The scene with the Beatles is hands down the funniest part to me.This is a well-made film that has deeper knowledge. Just know coming in that it is stupid and absurd though. It is a shut off your brain and enjoy comedy that goes a bit farther than that in my opinion.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"The story of a singer's life and hard times, played for laughs.","The show has a number of mild to moderate laughs--not enough to be rated hilarious by any means, but enough to keep me smiling through most of it. On the basis of the rather predictable script only, I'd rate it as about a 6, but the script isn't the chief charm of this movie. It's the strong and subtle performance of John C. Reilly, one of those anonymous character actors whose name you never remember but whose face you recognize instantly. Another actor might have been tempted to take the farcical elements of the script and run with them, playing the role manically from top to bottom. Reilly is talented enough to seek out the quieter moments and build his character around them. This gave the film's wilder moments more credibility than if he had played the role full bore. It's on the basis of the performances--his and the ensemble's--that I rated it as an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Finchys a gag man, I'm more character based""","Well it appears that Apatow can do both. Make no mistake this is a very gag based film, but there are plenty of laughs in there. The storyline gets pushed along and it does not gel together that well, but if you like stupid/silly/awkward gags then this should be right up your street.For me comedy has to tick 2 boxes: quotability (basically how many scenes/lines/jokes are memorable) and longevity (how many times you would want to watch this) Whereas with a film like Anchorman you laugh more each time you watch it (due to the more character based humour and heavy ad lib) I don't think Dewey Cox will stand up to repeated viewings as well, although the one thing it has going for it in that respect is the songs.I loved the scene where he is recording a new song and the backing band just come straight in with the words... there were a lot of little things which added together made this a very enjoyable experience.Yes people with a dryer sense of humour might not enjoy it so much and there isn't much to think about but for an evenings entertainment I can't rate it highly enough... so 9/10 then!",9.0,Anonymous,Music

reasonably entertaining parody,"""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" is a parody not only of ""Walk the Line"" and similar musical biopics ‚Äì replete with the seemingly inevitable dead kid brother (see also ""Ray"") - but of musical styles and pop-culture trends as they have evolved over the past half-century.The movie starts in the 1950s as a young backwater hick named Dewey Cox (John C. Reilly), an Elvis Presley-style crooner, takes the country by storm with his hit single ""Walk Hard."" From there it's on to fame as a Dylan-inspired protest singer, a turn as a disco-diva, and, finally, the wizened recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award in his 70s. And, along the way, of course, there are the inevitable bouts with drug addiction, the time spent in prison and rehab, a wife (""SNL""'s Kristen Wiig) left at home to raise the kids, a mistress (Jenna Fischer from ""The Office"") who's his one true-love and who stands by him no matter what, endless arguments with his managers and fellow band mates, groupies and orgies for the taking, furniture- and crockery-smashing tantrums, songwriter's block, stardom as a 1970's TV variety-show host ‚Äì you name it, it's in here. There's even a hilarious encounter with the late-era Beatles, who seem well on their way to cutting each others' throats, let alone splitting up the band.All of this is, of course, played for laughs. Written by Judd Apatow and Jake Kasdan, and directed by Kasdan, ""Walk Hard"" is never more than passably entertaining, filled with as many jokes that fall flat as those that rise to the occasion. It's definitely not up there with the best of their work. Still, a 50/50 ratio isn't a particularly bad one as far as mainstream comedies go these days, and Reilly is so good as Dewey that he makes even the lesser moments more-or-less ignorable. There are also fun turns by Raymond J. Barry, Margo Martindale, Chris Parnell, Harold Ramis, Jane Lynch, and many others. Moreover, the music (by Michael Andrews) and singing (who knew you had it in you, Mr. Reilly?) are both terrific, and they alone are worth the price of admission.",,Anonymous,Music
