Much better than expected superhero action drama.,"I must be honest, it took me a while before I finally decided to watch this, as I'm not a big Hollywood superhero movie fan. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. Gil Gadot is excellent as Wonder Woman and lends credibility to the naive title character. The chemistry between her and Chris Pine was wonderful and made for a very believable love story. It felt very natural and romance between them seemed inevitable.As for the plot, I enjoyed the way the Amazonian women's back story was told, as well as Diana's (Wonder Woman). The visuals and photography are incredible! This is a visual spectacle. I loved the humorist dialogue, which was genuinely funny and never over the top or slapstick. Gil Gadot is just fabulous.This superhero movie had a very realistic feel to it with the added bonus of feeling and emotion. There are so many truths in this film humanity should take note of. The film has a very unexpected ending compared to most superhero movies, and that's what I honestly loved about the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A strong film!,"Much better than I would have thought. I'm not a big fan of Wonder Woman, but I can say that this movie is my favorites from DC, but that doesn't say much considering the past. I really like the period in which the action of the film takes place, during a real war is not something usual for a movie with superheroes. The actors are good, so is the action, maybe act 3 is a bit weak, but it works.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Its GREAT,"I don't really understand all the bad reviews here. No....it isn't non stop action. I didn't find it boring either. I enjoyed it at the theater....and now again at home. Maybe it's not the typical super hero movie...but it is a great beginning in my opinion. I liked seeing Wonder Woman's origin, though the whole man bad and woman good mantra is getting old. Thats the only reason I didn't give it a 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Admirable Fun,"It's a pretty good movie, as you probably have already heard if you follow the reviews. I was a bit worried. DC has shown a.... shall we call it tendency? -- to darken every comic book character, to the point where Suicide Squad had everyone with a sad backstory. It made me miss the cheery disposition of Caesar Romero's Joker. Yes, I get it that you're a sociopath. Can't you enjoy it?Wonder Woman avoids that. In the midst of the horrors of the Great War, there are real jokes, and moments of kindness and great deeds inspired by naive morality.Visually, the movie combines the splash panels and covers of the Dark Horse era of DC, with some canny casting choices among the secondary characters. Lucy Davis looks like Etta Candy from the late WWII comics era; Ewen Bremner looks like Charlie from the same era; both push the comic book look to the edge, without falling over.Miss Gadot turns out to be a very capable screen performer, with dark, expressive eyes. Chris Pine restrains himself as her leading man. If the screenplay sometimes falls into the current hackneyed tropes, it plays nimbly with others, like Chekhov's Gun. If the final battle is another round of Rock-Em-Sock-Em Robots, the earlier battle scene, fought in righteous anger, made me think about the Angel of Mons.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
impressive,"Maybe, one of the most inspired films about WWI. and one of the most impressive Wonder Woman performances. because it has the best plot, the director, the actors . I say that without be a fan of Marvel universe and defining the super-heroes of series as ""American culture stuffs"". but this film has many virtues. first - a seductive perspective about near reality, bitter references, good pledge for fundamental values and , sure, Gal Gadot brilliant work. pieces of mithology and war. and a photo. as good start for a character who, in Superman vs. Batman was the not official lead character and who, in this film, gives more than a beautiful job.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Wonder Woman,"Review By Kamal KThis film is everything you want in a superhero movie. This is the Wonder Woman movie we've been waiting for.One of the first superheroes ever created in comics and the very first female superhero, Wonder Woman is among the most recognizable superheroes in history.It is outrageously bold and confident, insanely fun and thrilling, powerfully dramatic and delightfully amusing, all rolled into one epic superhero outing. It sports some of the greatest action scenes and visuals of any superhero movie to date, many of which have been saved from the marketing in order to serve as delicious surprises when you finally see the movie. The cast are magnificent, especially Gal Gadot's lead turn as the world's first female superhero. And director Patty Jenkins has instantly proven herself one of the genre's finest filmmakers.Gal Gadot's casting was like a miracle for the studio, as her performance is instantly the stuff of legends. Gadot does a magnificent job with this complex mixture of emotions and motivations in Diana, as well as the many grand fight and action sequences, I can't imagine anyone else in the role.she is Wonder Woman now, through and through. Chris Pine actually delivers his second-best career performance here.The action sequences in Wonder Woman set a new standard for the genre. It has excellent hand-to-hand superhero combat on par with Batman's warehouse scene in Batman v Superman or Cap's fights against Batroc and Bucky in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. But it also has epic war scenes, fantastic sword-and-sandal battles (the Amazon battle on the beach is an instant classic), and big-scale superhero action set pieces bringing down buildings and demonstrating the full scale of superheroism and super-villainy.I loved Matthew Jensen's cinematography in Wonder Woman, and how it established different visual tones and styles for different settings and different acts in the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not a wonder, not a blunder","As someone who does enjoy superhero films when done right, there are some good ones out there as well as some disappointing ones. Enjoyed the character of Wonder Woman as a kid, and always felt compared to other superhero characters that she deserved her own film.Which she gets in this 2017 effort directed by Patty Jenkins. Is 'Wonder Woman' as good as the hype and a wonder of a film? Not to me, there are a few things that stop it from being even better. Does it deserve the negativity in a lot of the comments here? While it is easy to see why people would be disappointed, as it could have been better, my answer would be no and that some of the hate is over the top.There are problems here in 'Wonder Woman'. Part of it is to do with pacing, the film starts a little dull in places and later on as more happens in the story it felt rushed and at times it affects the storytelling which has its muddled moments.The ending is clich√©d and anti-climactic and some of the characters feel underdeveloped, especially the underused and underwritten villain.However, 'Wonder Woman' is mostly an exceptionally made film, apart from instances of frenetic editing, with a lot of atmosphere in the production design and lighting, audacious photography and special effects that are super slick. The music has a haunting sense of mood and rousing energy, and Jenkins directs with an understanding of the titular character and accommodating the performing of Gal Gadot.Script has some witty humour, heartfelt sentiment and also takes itself seriously without making the mistake of previous BC Extended Universe (of which 'Wonder Woman' is by far the best, actually being a good film) of being too grim and dark. The action is stirring and often spectacular in spectacle.'Wonder Woman's' story has its faults but most of it is heartfelt and thrilling. It does the character of Wonder Woman justice with a genuinely interesting back-story that makes her a compellingly real and easy-to-relate-to character who you admire for all her strengths and flaws.Gadot is superbly cast as Wonder Woman, creating a character that really stands out among the rest of the superhero line in terms of gender and her ideals. Chris Pine is amusing, commanding and likable with great chemistry with Gadot, while Danny Houston clearly enjoys himself as the villain. The rest of the cast do very solidly.Overall, not a wonder but a long way from a blunder. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Warrier Princess at her best!,"I was expecting the ""glitzy"" curvy wonder woman which I loved in the 80's but VERY pleasantly surprised to find the Warrier Princess side of her that deeply cares for humanity and the good that are in people. She is unconcerned with her looks and trying to impress others, and way more concerned with saving the world as she was meant to do. This film really showed the process of her becoming a true heroine! She loves, she protects, she saves. Wonder Woman is a great character and I think she was cast beautifully! She looks ""other-worldly"" beautiful and fit the part so well. The film was written well to show her innocence of the ""real"" world, her joy of seeing it and it's people for the first time, and her passion for saving us all!Team Wonder Woman Forever!This is a film I could watch over and over. :D",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A good re-imagination of the legend,"It is visually stunning, with a story that at times is baffling yet aptly comical, not in a sense that it's funny, but true to a comic (graphic novel) origin.Many things don't make sense, but here we have a superhero / superheroine who finds her way and stays true to her purpose.As usual, I suspect the less you are familiar with Wonder Woman the comic book and TV series over the decades, the more you'll enjoy this adaptation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Solid Overall,A really solid DC film in a time where the company has struggled to muster post Christopher Nolan success.,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
one of the best DC Movies,"""Wonder Woman"" was a captivating addition to the superhero genre, earning a 7/10 in my opinion. Its strength lay in Gal Gadot's compelling portrayal of the iconic heroine, infusing the character with both strength and vulnerability. The film's cinematography showcased visually stunning action sequences, with Themyscira's lush landscapes serving as a standout. The supporting cast, particularly Chris Pine, added depth to the story with strong performances. While the music and visuals were effective, they didn't always leave a lasting impression. Overall, ""Wonder Woman"" delivered a powerful and long-overdue female-led superhero story, though it had some minor weaknesses in terms of music and visual impact that kept it just shy of perfection.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A welcome addition to the DC film franchise,"It would be easy to pick apart Wonder Woman, but I don't want to -- I enjoyed myself too much while watching it. Gal Godot is completely believable as the title character, and Chris Pine plays a good second fiddle. It's a pretty standard origin movie, and the rest of the supporting cast is a bit weak, but this is definitely a welcome addition to the DC film franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best DC superhero films of the new generation,"Gal Gadot and Chris Pine both give a fantastic performance in this superhero film... the story was relatively original given how much of a generic formula most of this action hero genre follows... the character development was unique and special.. the story was nice and heartfelt but had some weak moments that weren't necessary and made the film longer than it needed to be... between this and The Dark Knight, DC has been keeping its legacy in modern cinema going strong..",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Gal Gadot is Perfectly Cast as Wonder Woman,"Gal Gadot is perfectly cast and her interaction with Chris Pine on screen is great, their characters have a lot of chemistry. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, but some parts seem to drag a little, but it doesn't really affect the enjoyment of the film for me. The final battle is a bit cheesy in terms of the main villain's revealed motivation and dialogue, but nothing really too bad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""I will fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.""","Wonder Woman was much better than anything else DC has released in a very long time, and it was a pretty great film, but was it as amazing as everyone say it was or are we all a bit bias due to the hype surrounding the film? In the first blockbuster superhero film featuring Wonder Woman since the 1970's, we see Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) sitting in her office, remembering how it all started, and we are thrown back to the Island of the Amazons, where she is a little girl. We see her grow up and go through her training, with her aunt played admirably by the Princess Bride herself, Robin Wright, making an epic comeback. After which, a series of events lead her to meet a man and leave the island to join the war effort in England. Gal Gadot played Wonder Woman and she was truly something special. While everyone got caught up in the hype of the fact that DC made a good movie, that didn't center around Batman, and the fact that this film was centered on a female superhero, they failed to see just how unoriginal the story actually was. As I was watching the scenes on this Island, with Diana growing up, not knowing what she really was, and leaving before she was ready, I was very much reminded of Thor, but that was just the first hour of the film. I thought things would get better but they didn't. She becomes this unexpected larger than life hero in World War I, much in the way that Captain America did in World War II. Both of them fought really bad guys who weren't the ""main"" bad guy behind the war, and then there is the whole God angle, which brings us right back to Thor again. The film was so well done, I think it is more than time we had a strong female hero that young girl can emulate and look up to, and I thought Gal Gadot was a breath of fresh air, who gave an outstanding performance. As far as originality goes, to me it just wasn't there, as it seems the writers took elements from two of the more popular Marvel films and mashed them together. The Bottom Line, Wonder Woman is absolutely worth seeing, however I'm all for original ideas, and I want to see something different, especially at a time when a new superhero film is coming out every month.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best adaptaion of Wonderwoman.,"Gal Gadot is the perfect actress for this role, the movie is well paced, with a well composed theme song. Eventhough they greatly nerfed her character power, the movie has thrilling action and the Amazonian goddess is well represented. Though I admit, it was still a little to groomy and dark for the tone for my taste.
Generally, a very safe movie if you just want to enjoy something.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Wonder Woman: Just not feeling it,"I'm glad that a female fronted superhero movie actually did well at the box office, I'm appalled it took this long and was thrilled at seeing the figures.Now when I first learned Gal Gadot was due to play Wonder Woman I wasn't sold, I just saw this tall skinny girl but was proven wrong in Batman vs Superman (2016) where I thought she did great. But a standalone movie? This was the ultimate test and though I think she did well I believe her proper debut failed on a lot of fronts.A tweeked version of her origin story Wonder Woman is full of famous faces and fantastic choices for the most part, it had a tsunami of funding and a competent lead. So what went wrong?The same as Batman vs Superman in my opinion, the DC Universe is simply not getting off to a good start. Flashy, cheesy and with some awful awful dialogue Wonder Woman failed to impress.I'm not saying its a bad film, I'm just saying for every good scene there are 5 average ones and a couple of stinkers.What took me back was the CGI, this is a AAA movie so why are there so many crappy looking shots? Truly unforgivable considering the budget, the script is weak, the story is predictable and the whole thing is somehow cheesier than the original television series (And that's saying something).I went in expecting gold but came out with mildly tarnished bronze at best, I wanted to like this I really did but am so unimpressed I'm just going to assume Justice League will be seven shades of abyssmal.The Good:Great scoreWell castThe Bad:Some choreography is offSome bizzarely bad cgiVery different from the original storyBarely connects to the universe they are trying to createThings I Learnt From This Movie:Each year judging by ratings people are easier and easier to pleaseI always consider Tom Cruise unconvincing in action scenes, he looks outstanding compared to David ThewlisDC is not going to be catching up to Marvel, ever.

A good film that's easy to re-watch,"Coming back to this in 2022 there are some easy themes that stand up to the passage of time. Since it's sequel has been and gone much of the hope has seeped away for as the DCU has been under minded by WB it has not been able to shape anything with consistency.With Gal Gadot as WW the star shines very bright and Chris Pine and all other supporting cast are well drawn but plots are a little underdeveloped and when the big bad is the god of war, Aries - the scale seemed small on the screen whilst the jeopardy on screen, whilst it comes to pass, feels more of a foot note than a truly mortal affair.DC have overpowered heroes like Superman but Steve Trevor deserves more emotional impact on screen given his choices and the villains are given too little attention. The red herring villain didn't work well enough and a more 3D female villain would have sufficed with Aries as her muse and empowered. Perhaps if Jenkins had shown the adversarial nature of women here, then ww84 would've had not misfired on so many levels.Snyder clearly had a game plan that was untrusted. So when I recall this film and recognise there are some great stand out scenes that come to mind. By the end credits we have a self sufficient film that could've been more but is not wholly disappointing like the follow up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
DC finds its footing,"There's a lot that went into ""Wonder Woman""; it's partially a romantic comedy, coming-of-age story, period action/superhero movie, but maybe above all, a love story. Diana Prince gears up ultimately out of love - which doesn't sound like something that'd fit very well in a war movie. Part of the reason this movie is so good is that it had big boots to fill. The DC movies haven't been stellar up to this point, and their inherent dreariness hasn't helped matters. And here's a movie with competent direction, gorgeous visuals and a lead actress that's fully up to the challenge. Gal Gadot instills in her character honor, innocence, and the necessary color to really bring a comic book movie to the screen.In other words, it's everything I was hoping for in a Wonder Woman film. It doesn't feel like it was ground out of a sausage factory, and really manages to do everything right. Just to give context, this is coming from a guy who's pretty burnt out on the genre.I loved this movie.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The special effects and action scenes are very well done as is the depiction of the time period and the challenges and perception of women.,"Wonder Woman (2017) is a movie we saw in theatres as soon as it was released. The storyline follows the rise of Diana among the Amazonians who are a group of females on an island isolated from civilization. When a human appears during the World War it springs Diana into action to discover what could be behind the war and how she can stop it. This movie is directed by Patty Jenkins (Monster) and stars Gal Gadot (Death on the Nile), Chris Pine (Star Trek), Robin Wright (Forest Gump) and Ewen Bremner (Trainspotting). The storyline for this is very well done and does a great job of introducing Wonder Woman as a character. I loved the depiction of the Amazonians and how it established the character from the foundation up. The special effects and action scenes are very well done as is the depiction of the time period and the challenges and perception of women. The villain was the only let down and I didn't love the final fight sequence, but 80% of this movie is a 10/10. I would score this a solid 8/10 and strongly recommend seeing this.

Better than your average hero flick,"Wonder Woman is a fairly solid superhero film. It has fun visuals, likable characters, and a simple but effective story. I see a lot of people criticize Gal Gadot's acting in this film but I don't get, I often hear that she is shaky or seems confused, when that is literally what the character she is playing is suppose to be, it's Diana's first time in the real world she is suppose to be confused and unsure. That being said the film is not perfect, Diana and Steve are really the only characters with any sort of character development, and even that feels rushed. That being said to all the people calling her a Mary Sue, read a comic book. When superman is like this we don't care but because Diana is a woman we do, grow up people.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wander Over To Wonder!,"It's a brand-new month and you know what that means right? Yes, another super hero movie to kick off the summer blockbuster season. This time it isn't Marvel cranking out the comic book, cinematic feature, but their rivals DC studios. With its recent shaky track record, the DC cinematic universe hasn't gotten the best publicity in terms of quality. So, the studio has decided to get the leading lady herself to pave the way. Yes, today's review is on Wonder Woman starring Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. Can this movie break the bad luck streak of DC/WB studios? Robbie K here to share some opinions on the matter, so let's get started, shall we?LIKES1. Gal Gadot is incredible and steals the show with her poise, pizazz, and acting talents. A fantastic casting direction that really brings the woman to wonder to life in beauty, ferocity, and bouts of heroism (a.k.a. kicking bad guy butt). Acting, stunts, and an on-point delivery of her lines makes this actress one of the tops in my book!2. The action is on point (for most of the movie) filled with impressive displays of weaponry, martial arts, and historical warfare. Wonder Woman's battles held such emotion, managing to bring the suspense all while delivering that feel good, post battle high, you might have gotten from reading a comic book. The team brings some fast-paced thrills we have wanted for almost a year and a half.3. A good representation for girls. I may have already said this, but this movie targets a wide variety of audience members in some form or manner. Yet this reviewer has to give props for the design of a character that is certainly worthy of representing the female super heroes and inspiring the female population that they certainly can do anything.4. Comedic timing: It's not going to be a super hero movie (at least in this day and age) without some laughs to break up the tension. Wonder Woman continues this trend, filling the void with well-timed one-liners, a few awkward encounters that often deal with sex, and some slap-stick gimmicks that do the job well.5. Character Development: I know most super hero movies have this element, but there is something about Wonder Woman that stood out to me. This film managed to spin Diana's character development into a roller coaster ride of feelings that almost made me tear up. Her journey to discovering herself and her role into this new world was poetically portrayed, using multiple angles to get the job done. It could have also been due to the powerful soundtrack, the visual effects, or maybe Gadot's acting, but it really worked for me.6. Fast Pace: We all know those movies that drag (and yes, I'm talking much of DC's library). Not the case for this film. The nearly 150-minute run time flew by for much of the movie having me at one point saying, ""Dang, it's already been 90 minutes."" Not something I often say.DISLIKES:1. Unoriginality: You'll find that Wonder Woman shares a lot with Captain America: First Avenger. The set-up, setting, and build up almost matching outside of the weapon of choice and martial arts moves. Certainly, not the biggest limitation, but something that others have been bothered by.2. Almost pointless crew: The crew that joins Diana held such promise in the picture, but it was dropped so hard in this movie. Outside of Chris Pine, the other members do little for the overall mission outside of a few throws, some ""tracking"" and mainly comedic relief. There were hints at character development and deeper dynamics, but they fizzled out faster than sparkler at 4th of July. I know, this movie is about Wonder Woman, but why even include these guys if that was the goal.3. Preachy: Some reviews state the whole feminism/males are pigs is overdone, and to an extent I agree. Yet the bigger dislike was the preachy monologues that sometimes plagued this film. A few times the heat of the moment was lost in a display of self-reflection, which is great, but not in the midst of a battlefield. Some of these moments also had that eye-rolling factor for me.4. Overuse of CGI: I like special effects, I like stunts, but I don't like overuse of a gimmick. The slow-motion interludes during the action scenes added some cool emphasis to Wonder Woman's skills (alongside some cool finishing moves). Somewhere along the production, someone got a little trigger happy with the effect and used a little too much for me, and soon started disrupting the cool stunts they had Gal do. In addition, there were some special effects that were a bit cheesy and took the edge off of Wonder Woman. Learn from Michael Bay people, too much of special effects makes for many jokes.5. The ending: Don't turn away, hear me out. The ending is great on many levels (emotional, prowess, role model, and morals). However, it lost the momentum the first few fights had with them, trading suspense for flashy special effects, drawn out banter, and unimpressive choreography. Sort of felt like the ending to X-men apocalypse where the bad guys bark was worse than his bite.The VERDICT:Wonder Woman delivers on many levels and breaks the mediocre displays that DC has cranked out over the last year. It's emotional, it's dynamic, it's fun, and it provides a solid role model for admirable heroes. I feel the movie met most of my expectations and I was happy with the overall product. It's far from perfect though, and still has a few things to tighten up (like developing other characters, balancing the CGI use, and keeping the momentum going). Still, I have to recommend this one for a theater visit, especially you comic lovers out there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining action movie with a fine cast and some good jokes,"Wonder woman starts with showing where wonder woman (aka Diana Prince) came from: the amazons who live on the island Themyscira. The island is somewhere near Greece but hidden from view by a strange fog for normal people. We follow how Diana grows up to become one of the greatest amazon to have ever lived. On the day of her final training something strange happens: a German plane from the first world war breaks through the fog surrounding Themyscira and crashes into the sea. Diana rescues the man (Steve, a British spy played by Chris Pine) inside the plane, but he is pursued by German soldiers who also break through the fog. The Germans are quickly defeated by the mighty amazon warriors and learn from Steve that the whole world is currently fighting a great war. Diana thinks it must be the work of Ares, the god of war and that it is time to wield the god killer sword to put an end to Ares once and for all. Together with Steve and his friends she leaves the island of Themyscira to go to horrific front of the first world war, trying to find and defeat Aris.I went into this movie a bit skeptical, because I wasn't impressed by Batman VS Superman where (the modern version) Wonder Woman made her entrance. But the character is interesting so I was curious how her origin story panned out. The start of the movie was a bit to serious/high fantasy for me but once Chris Pine enters the picture, it get's a lot lighter in tone and I started to like it a lot more. I really like Pine in The scenes where Diana enters London and get's in contact with 1910's civilization are hilarious and Gal Gadot does a fine job playing someone who's from a different world. I also liked the supporting cast who play Steve's friends, lot's of humor in those scenes.The action scenes where mostly very well done. Cool slow motion effects and very good stunt work. My only gripe was that the CGI doubles of wonder woman and her opponents where a bit to obvious in a few scenes. And like in many comic book movies, this movie also suffered from a bad guy that was not impressive at all. The final confrontation was a bit to predictable and way to much CGI effects for my taste. But there was an emotional touch in the ending which was well done and unexpected.Wonder woman is an enjoyable action movie with great action scenes and some good laughs. Recommended if your in for an entertaining action movie with some fantasy elements.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Proof that a woman can make a DC superhero movie just as mundane as any man.,"I was quite disappointed when I learnt that they hadn't cast Alexandra Daddario as Wonder Woman, but I'm over that now (not really, but I am slowly coming to terms with it). In lieu of Daddario, I guess Gal Gadot isn't a terrible alternative, but I doubt that the film would have been great whoever played the title role: the story, by Zack Snyder, is a by-the-numbers exercise in superhero banality, while director Patty Jenkins goes for CGI-laden style over substance, her film reliant on flashy overblown set-pieces in which our heroine proves totally impervious to harm, whether it be poison gas attack or being hit broadside by a flying tank. With Wonder Woman able to withstand any onslaught, the film is totally lacking in excitement.Having watched a handful of other DCU movies, including the recent over-rated effort that was Shazam!, I'm still waiting to be impressed. Casting David Thewlis as the villain definitely isn't the way to go...4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb - Mindless generic popcorn superhero nonsense. Not totally unwatchable (Gadot being easy on the eye), but definitely unexceptional.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Very linear, DC got it right, a female strong hero on the spotlight, she's Wonder Woman","Reading the reviews here. Either they are bowing down to the movie or just hating blindly. Not sure how many have actually seen it. Very good movie after all the disappointment from the past DCEU movies.Seeing all the trailers and featurettes, very little was left for imagination, but those didn't disappoint. The movie is about the journey of a demigod from Themyscira, where it's all bright and shiny to the real world, which is torn by war, greed, hatred and darkness. Diana walks in as the light.Getting her influence from Donner, Patty Jenkins got it right. What it means to be a hero, what does it mean to inspire..and the quest for the Amazon beauty to become the light in the darkness. Strength, sorrow, motivation, humanity, hope and loss forges the path to be the ultimate hero she's meant to be.Gal Gadot surprised me. Most of her past performances were, well, sub par. Finally she's in the spotlight. She did pretty well. Although she has a long way to go, everyone begins somewhere. This movie is for her. Kudos for her strong performance, specially the fight sequences.We all deserved this movie. While not a masterpiece, but good enough to be the stepping stone for women empowerment, and a proper story for a demigod and one of the most popular female superhero who can go toe to toe with the all powerful Superman. I just can't wait to see her interactions and chemistry with the big blue, and how they co ordinate, being the two gods that they are. DCEU is back on track.Apart from her, Chris Pine as Steve Trevor shined, and he is straight from the comic book pages. He's a good actor, not surprising.Despite all the positives, it has it's flaws. Some scenes were too long and unnecessarily dragged. Diana's chemistry with Steve could have been better. Dr Poison was equivalent to Kaecilius' henchmen..wasted.A good ending satisfies all, after the emotional turbulence audiences go through. This movie did justice to that.That being said, Man of Steel still remains the favorite DCEU movie for me. But perhaps that's because I'm biased to Supes.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Origin Story,"A great origin story, at this point my favorite movie in the DC Extended Universe. The story is simple but efficient and the visual and soundtrack are great.

Love it!,"Not sure what's with some of the bad reviews, this is by far my favorite DC film (I prefer Marvel)! Great pace, great cast, love the Amazonians, overall a great movie with some good action scenes, not too much but just nice! Gal's portrayal of WW is perfect! She's charming, strong, funny and a total goddess! (Not so much in the 1984 version). The best cast and superhero film by DC in my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Entertaining Superhero Movie,"Wonder Woman is fun and entertaining with spectacular action scenes. Gal Gadot performance is awesome and she looks beautiful in every frame.

Good!!,"This movie was different(much better) then I expected. Dawn of Justice was good, and watching right after that movie, I have a new found appreciation for DC universe movies. The bonds between characters were conveyed well, and the character development was done quite well for a single movie. The CGI was not too intrusive to the experience, unlike Dawn of Justice, which is a good thing. My view on the movie is positive, and would rate it 6.8/10. This movie deserves all the praise I've been listening to.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Good Message; Odd Plot,"""Wonder Woman"" ends on a note of self sacrifice that hits deep and outdoes many other similar superhero movies within the last eight or so years which often rest on noble cliche.""Wonder Woman"" does too, but I think it hits a nerve where others don't quite. The development is unexpected and takes you for a turn after the villain is found but the philosophical real villain remains. Here ""Wonder Woman"" shines in its thoughtfulness about the hero/villain construct, and gives the intellect something to gnaw on.However the last arc, though magnificent, doesn't quite excuse the vague mythology getting to that point or some disturbing questions such as why Wonder Woman is so quick to be an American hero rather than the hero of humanity she claims to be. As well as some thin areas such as exactly how invincible is Diana? Can bullets kill her? And then other loose ends such as the ragtag team Chris Pine's character puts together-were they really necessary, and did their stories conclude in a satisfying way?And then some casting choices were a bit unusual. Like for Ares. You'll see what I mean.For me Gal Gadot does a fine job, but perhaps doesn't have a big range. But she does give her all and embodies the character in her determination, innocence and her grappling with the question of whether to be humanity's hero. And of course her physical attributes! I think acting across the emotive Chris Pine certainly helped bring out her best acting moments.All in all a much deeper film than expected, but not without its parts which we all just look past.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

fantastic movie and strong inspirational female character,"I LOVED this movie and have watched it a dozen times as I have it on DVD Blu Ray.

This movie is amazing, and I recommend it highly. The battle scene are a sight to see and it's overall enjoyable and fun to watch.

"The fact that it ain't crap, doesn't mean it's art.","Finally we get a half-decent movie from the DCEU. Compared to the last installments, it's probably the best. But that's not saying much.To this movies credit, I gotta say that it has an honest heart. it's the first time that they actually feel honest about a movie. This one is not trying to elevate Wonder Woman to something unrealistic (considering the character that she is), it's very grounded, and overall a very enjoyable dumb summer movie.Having said that. It's not perfect. Like I said. It's dumb, but with a heart. The acting is OK for the most part (even though Robin Wright's helmet thing looked embarrassing and was hard to take her performance seriously just for that). Gal Gadot was OK, Chris Pine was OK. The rest of the cast was kind of there. The plot was a lazy combination of Thor and the first Captain America movie. Pretty dull in my opinion. The way the plot moves is very dumb and most of the conflict is avoidable if some characters would just listen, otherwise they look very stupid, even if the outcome was the same, giving them some common sense would have given them some substance. It just didn't happen, but I give that to the lazy writing. The villain was uninspiring, not a big surprise for this kind of movie, so you know that it comes with lazy CG and motivation. He just serves to have a super claustrophobic final battle filled with explosions and stuff. One kind of head scratching moment for me was that Wonder Woman was trying to avoid the greatest and most violent conflict ever: WWI. So the stakes seem stupid when you know that WWII was way worse and knocking on the door. We are obviously not going to see her react to that. With a big dope face realizing that the war she thought was the worse was pretty much the beginning.Oh, and the music. I hate it for the most part. I hate her theme. It's way too manipulating and forced.The things that I would have liked this movie to be are way to many to be listed here. So I leave it at: it was OK, not great, kind of good, very stupid and face-palming. but nothing as sinful as Suicide Squad. And to it's credit it's the first time a DCEU movie actually makes more or less sense.And to address those who believe that there is a big presence of quality on the film. No, there is not. It's just the first movie from the DCEU that is not complete S H I T. That doesn't make it good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

If Only This Was the First DCEU Film,"A WWI battlefield, shrouded in gun smoke and war remains, is flanked by trenches of soldiers who've accepted their fate of spending the rest of their short lives in this hell. On one end, a powerful but na√Øve woman slowly emerges, armed with a shield, a sword and a bundle of conviction to put an end to all of it. In this one sure-to-be iconic moment, the world is (re-)introduced to its new favorite superhero. Wonder Woman, an unabashed woman-empowerment film, uses its pre-established muscle for good: to give us a blockbuster full of true excitement, true humor and true heart. Being a wartime-superhero film, we expect a certain quality of action, and this delivers; the beach attack on the island full of Amazon women is a slow-motion blast of flying and fighting. But what really soars is the script, filled with dialogue that surprisingly pops (""We can't fix the war, but we can try to get to the men who can."" ""I AM the men who can!""). Elements of fish-out-of-water, believable romance and confident humor are more than consistent enough to the small moments of predictability, corn and bad visual effects. I can't help but imagine: what if this was our introduction to the Justice League universe? Instead of the faux-complexity of the Superman entries or the offensive simplicity of Suicide Squad, we'd be setting the tone for the franchise with a film about the effects of violence, the insanity of war and whether humans are inherently good or evil. Either way, it's so great to report that DC has more than righted their course and made a genre film for the ages.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Solid effort and great performance from Gal Gadot,"Gal Gadot did an amazing job as Wonder Woman. The film was a little slow paced at times and left confusing messages over the power of the Amazonian's - when you see the ending and how Wonder Woman's true powers are sparked.

Successful film thanks to the casting of Gal Gadot who was believable as one statuesque Wonder Woman,"Rousing movie with full of action and amusement ; it's complemented by exciting images , thrills and breathtaking scenes , including groundbreaking computer generator special effects . The success of this show can be attributed largely to Gal Gadot . Without her , the picture probably would never have gained the popularity that it did. Dealing with Princess Diana (Gal gadot) who lives in Paradise Isle where women have extremely long lives keeping their looks and all without men . But World War I intruded on their island and the policy of isolation went up in smoke . As Diana must contend with a powerful enemy whose desire for extreme badness sends the world down a path of destruction . During World War I , while Amazonian warrior Diana in training along with her trainer Antiope (Robin Wright) , a plane piloted by officer Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes near Paradise Island , the secret hidden island home of the mighty and eternally young Amazons . The unfortunate pilot is rescued by Princess Diana, taking still unconscious Major to safety , he tells of conflict in the outside world , and learns of the war against the invader Germans . Meanwhile , some enemy military disrupting the fictitious all-female sanctuary of Themyscira created by the Gods of Olympus . The Amazons decide to send one of their own to help fight in this crisis . Although forbidden to participate in the selection process , Diana escapes secretly from her mother Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and wins the right and responsibility to go . She leaves home to fight a war , discovering her full powers and true destiny . Taking the officer Steve , she joins him and subsequently teaming up with other valiant heroes (Sa√Ød Taghmaoui , Ewen Bremner , Eugene Brave Rock) . Heading to an early 20th Century London to stop the war she believes is influenced by the God Ares . Furthermore , the forces of evil threaten the nation, with the nasty General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) carrying out his misogynistic and chauvinistic policies as well as his chemist mad doctor (Elena Anaya) . Diana of the immortal Amazons aids for saving the world and that's why she wins the decisive power . More and more, cataclysmic events push the world to the brink , and emotionally vulnerable Diana must address a cruel dilemma. .A new era of wonder begins. Grace. Wisdom. Wonder. Power . Courage . The future of justice begins with her . Wonder Woman knew exactly which side she would take and it wasn't going to be . Can mighty Wonder Woman save humankind ?Thrilling heroine movie packed with frantic action , fights , moving scenes , dazzling production design and state-of-art special effects . This spectacular comic-book movie contains fantasy , noisy action , battles, romance , and is pretty entertaining. This is a dynamic , fast- paced and fun movie . It was made to appeal to wide range of audiences, so the plot wasn't so complex , but prominently featured super powers of Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot was absolutely believable as Wonder Woman, and there was no other actress of the time who could have played the role asides from her . This show had one really good thing going for it and that was a perfectly cast Gal Gadot in the title role as the immortal Amazon warrior , Princess Diana of Themyscira . Gal Gadot as Diana , Wonder Woman, would spin to transform into Wonder Wonder, armed with a invincible shield , magic belt giving her tremendous strength, bracelets that can stop any bullet, a tiara that can be thrown as a returning weapon and a unbreakable magic lasso that can force anyone to tell the truth . Nothing more fun to watch for a boy than to see her running here and there let me tell you. It also helps that it usually had a relatively good story line to go along with it . Including an interesting script and story from Allan Heinberg , Zack Snyder , Jason Fuchs , based on the characters created by William Moulton Marston .The motion picture was competently directed by Patty Jenkins.Followed by Wonder Woman 1984 (2020) in which Princess Diana finds herself trying to stay under the radar, working as an archaeologist at the Smithsonian Museum , directed by Patty Jenkins with Gal Gadot , Chris Pine , Kristen Wiig , Pedro Pascal , Robin Wright , Connie Nielsen . And previously ¬®Wonder Woman¬® (2011) by Jeffrey Reiner with Adrianne Palicki as Diana Princess / Wonder Woman , Cary Elwes , Pedro Pascal , Elizabeth Hurley . And the classic series Wonder Woman (1975) with Lynda Carter , Lyle Waggoner.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"A Beautiful,Thrilling Portrayal of this Icon! Most enjoyable!","Last evening I saw Wonder Woman and it met and exceeded my expectations marvelously! Gal Gadot shines on screen as the Amazon Princess with an excellent supporting cast(The chemistry between her and co lead Chris Pine is wonderful!). You could very easily enjoy this film without seeing any of the previous films or will realize it as the best of it's franchise to date! Have no fear that this will be boring because of the period the film takes place in,it matters not. Creators of the film benefit greatly by staying true to the source material that has encapsulated audiences since Diana Prince's debut in comics over seven decades ago. As well as DC comic's own Geoff Johns joining the production team! Wonder Woman is done justice as she serves Justice by the amazing combat Sequences shot by Director Patty Jenkins and the score compliments the screen accordingly!I don't need humor in a film about a hero , nor do enjoy it when it's forced into a story. The humor in Wonder Woman is well placed and most called for and appreciated. The same goes for the action in this film it is not overdone nor is it to much or to little it is just right. . This movie benefits from an exciting story, heroic characters that are enjoyable and most credible vile villains.

Gal Gardot is not an amazon!,"I am so sick of casting directors screwing up films with terrible choices! Batman vs Superman was ruined by Jessie Eisenberg!

I can understand casting Carter back 'in the day' but why choose a skinny, weak looking woman as an amazon today! Special effects and cgi don't make up for casting such a terrible Wonder Woman!Other than the terrible storyline that is full of holes any half wit would notice and the terrible cast, the movie ended up being barely watchable.As a strong intelligent, independent woman, I am so sick of this feminist garbage which has been associated with this film!I hope casting directors wake up and stop casting the wrong people and screwing up what could be good movies!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best of the new DC by far,"Wonder Woman - Saying that this is the best of the new DC films isn't exactly glowing praise. Saying that it now currently holds my highest score of the year, however, would definitely qualify.The dramatic and comedic tones were perfectly balanced. Such a glaring omission from the previous DC offerings was any real feeling of levity. Here, jokes were well timed and delivered even better. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine's chemistry was automatic, making these back-and-forths all the more believable. And Lucy Davis steals the show as Pine's secretary.There is something to be said for the theme song of this movie. Do me a favor and try to hum the theme to the Avengers. How about Captain America? The most recent Spiderman, maybe? I might not be able to pick any of those out of a lineup. Wonder Woman's theme is visceral and will be immediately recognizable after you've heard it. It's featured in key moments of the film, adding to the weight of the already powerful action.Similar to most of the Marvel films, this one has a weak villain. A German officer is presented as the antagonist, but I felt more like it was just war in general that they were fighting against. I definitely liked the payoff, but he was underwhelming as an adversary.The only other negative I can think of is that there are some moments of wonky special effects. It took me back to The Matrix Reloaded where Neo is just a computer animated cartoon knocking around a dozen Agent Smiths with a stick. The effects seemed jarringly dated at times.DC was in an absolute tailspin up to this point. The last three films received critic ratings of 55%, 27%, and 25%. This could have been the nail in the coffin. Instead, it was an absolute B12 shot to the brand and the studio itself. Box office hauls of future DC films will no doubt be bigger because of this movie. And to think I almost stayed away from this one based on Batman v Superman alone. Now, Wonder Woman is the only reason I'll keep DC in my lineup going forward. 8.75/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just AWESOME...,"Wonder Woman is Wonderful in this man-dominated world. (Really, Man-Dominated.? Women Rocks.. From the beginning of Mankind. Yeah) I just love Strong female characters.

She was the epitome of the Strong Women.It's sad that the world Hardly recognizes the focus, commitment & sheer will (you know what I did there ;) ) Women possess. Today also, women have to work 4 times Harder than men, just to get what they deserve. I just Hope, from this moment itself, it changes for the better. :)Now the movie, was so Gorgeous, I've difficulty finding words here. I was literally thinking, when the movie ended, what will I write in my review.? It was Magical experience, really.Gal Gadot was Out standing. Don't know why people hated her while she was being cast. Stupid. They needed more curvaceous woman than Gal, I think she was/is The Perfect choice for this role.If you just take the time out to look at her once, you'll feel All your problems, worries are Just Gone. She is Such a Beauty. Just Gorgeous. God (Zeus) Bless Her. I mean, after all, She's his daughter. ;)Chris Pine was Amazing. My God, he has Superb comic timing.Robin Wright was Just Awesome. Just seeing her in House of Cards & in This movie back to back, God.!! Both Strong characters.. Perfectly played.. Suck a Treat for Fans.David Thewlis, same as above. Seeing him in Fargo & in this movie, Man.!! He is a Fantastic actor.And I wouldn't be wrong if I tell you guys that this is the 1st DCEU movie done Exceptionally Well.

A wonderful step forward for DC,"DC has finally set their foot in the right direction. Say what you want about the previous films, but I think we can all agree that they weren't as well received as they could have been. Now with ""Wonder Woman"" we have a good solid superhero story that's actually meaningful. Zack Snyder is not directing this time around, but his influence is still felt in the visual style of the explosive action scenes. Those parts are very entertaining, but they don't take center stage here. This film takes the time to introduce us to characters we can understand and care for. I think Patty Jenkins handled the emotional story nicely. I enjoyed the quite scenes as much as the exciting ones. It's about this one journey which makes it easy to follow. So it's not a very complicated film.The scenery on the Amazonian island is breathtaking. Perfect use of locations. The ancient Greek mythology elements work surprisingly well. The idea of setting the world outside the Amazonian realm during WWI is good. It makes the fish out of water situation with Diana even more interesting, and above all it really helped her development. So that made sense. I will say this though: If you are well educated in history and you happen to know a lot about WWI, then you are gonna be annoyed by some things here. Because it doesn't stay completely true to how everything was back then. Some liberties were taken here and there. I'm not an expert on war history, but my brother is and I had to listen to many things that were inaccurate on the way home after the screening. So, sure. They should have gotten some more history consultants to revise the production. As a normal movie goer you probably won't even think about those things. But if you are a history buff then take note that this is pure fantasy/escapism. You won't be too bothered about historical inaccuracies if you go in with that mindset. I do think the villains were very stereotypical. Most of the time it works, but I would have preferred them not being so much like cartoon bad guys. The final fight gets really bloated and CGI heavy with many explosions. It's handled much better then how it was in ""Batman v Superman"", and I'll tell you why: It was focused. The entire movie balances the human story with the action spectacle well. And that gets a good positive point from me.The main characters are likable here. There's not much I can add to what's already been said, but I strongly believe I'm seeing Wonder Woman on screen and not the actress Gal Gadot. She embodies this role with pride. Her chemistry with Chris Pine is great. There's some banter towards the end that gets repetitive, but other than that I liked it. The movie has a nice message as well. It's about working together and that love and compassion should never be forgotten. All of those things are nice. This movie has an upbeat vibe overall. It's kind of like a classic adventure movie and I like that. You will walk out feeling happy or maybe even a little inspired. That's a good sign that this will not be forgotten anytime soon. So, yes. I can now say that this a wonderful step forwards for DC. They have definitely improved a lot and I hope they continue like this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Visual Extravaganza  Brimming  with Heart and Reason,"Patty Jenkins' 'Wonder Woman' movie begins with a rocky, uneven start. But this very flawed pace allows the origin story of the amazonian warrior mature in a compelling build- up, and eventually navigate towards the rest of her story in a riveting seismic progression. It gathers an affectionate sentimentality that sustains its potency even amidst the imposing explosive sequences that often triumph to take the audience's attention away from the oddly satisfying distraction, that is Gal Gadot. There are these resonating anthems that remain ablaze throughout the film's 140-minute duration: love and peace, sacrifice and courage, and while it gets extremely preachy sometimes, the narrative rarely gets boring. Jenkins' take on the genre doesn't abandon the idea of terror, and mass destruction, but it singularly escapes the confines of superhero clich√©s that eliminate its players' moral form. In 'Wonder Woman', Diana Prince's humanity is held by Gadot's portrayal with a bracing commitment, something she never loses even when confronted with the deceptive appeal of evil and darkness. Her heroic verve gets an unexpected reinforcement from Chris Pine's Steve Trevor, with whom she shares a surprisingly inherent chemistry. This is the first DC film in a very long time, to ever sustain such visceral distinction, a visual extravaganza brimming with heart and reason.Diana Prince's story takes us to a mysterious island known as Themyscira, hidden by Zeus in a protective dome of dim and mist, far from the grasp of humanity. She grows to believe that it is her sacred duty to protect her world, not knowing such 'world' will include what is beyond the clouds. But when the first man arrives in a suspicious water- crash landing, she expands her understanding and begins to welcome the idea of defending whoever needs help in the other side. But this eagerness barely entirely rests on a moral responsibility; she believes that Ares, the God of War, and her inevitable nemesis, is what causing the war waged by humans, and she needs to kill him in order to restore peace to both worlds. In one spine-chilling moment within her breathtakingly choreographed fight sequence with Ares, Diana rises from a fall, and virtually carries out her meteoric ascent, a symbolic assumption of her superhero status.But in spite of the amount of physical tension and visual explosion, Jenkins balances the flavor by injecting humor and romance, utilizing them even in places where gripping action sequences are imminent. Chris Pine shines in his own moments, a remarkable feat for a character in a saga that seems to underscore women empowerment. There is a powerful moment where he grapples for words to ask for Diana's help to win the war; he practically breaks down, a stirring and moving scene to behold. Part of the film's colossal allure is its heart--it never loses it, doesn't intend to, and it grows to more awe-inspiring forms as it reaches a resonating, albeit predictable, resolution.It is ironic to think that Diana Prince isn't human, but appears to be the most one, when compared with her colleagues in the looming 'Justice League' film. In the end, 'Wonder Woman' isn't a film free of blemishes as it still stumbles upon political truths it rarely gets justified, and minor expositions it doesn't seem interested to shed light on. But it has soul, humor, and wonder-- a narrative spectacle one seldom finds in a film of its sort.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Exceptional. Outstanding. DC Hits a Homer! FINALLY.,"WONDERful! No seriously, this is an excellent film! And I'm just not talking about the superhero genre. DC finally hit a homer with this one. This film also serves as evidence that Zack Snyder can WRITE a great story but should probably stay out of the director's chair. Warner Bros. and Ratpac Dune's¬†Wonder Woman is the superhero film we needed. Trailing so far behind the Marvel brand and film quality, DC needed to produce a film that would make up for¬†Batman v Superman and¬†Suicide Squad AND catch up to Marvel. Seemingly setting out to accomplish the impossible, this film exceeded all measurable expectations and provided a comprehensive cinematic experience. With many themes, this film hits on many topics and does so with incredible precision and elegance. It's almost as if this film is an extension of Diana Prince herself. Never addressed or referenced as Wonder Woman actually, Diana Prince's origin story is powerful and ever so apropos in today's socio-political climate. If only we could all have the courage, compassion, and determination that Wonder Woman embodies and represents.Ever since her creation in 1941 by psychologist William Marston, Wonder Woman has always been treated the best when all pre-existing inhibitions typically added to a female character in a ""man's"" role are removed, allowing the feminist ethos at her core to shine and erupt with unbridled passion and strength. Among other traits, the chief characteristic that separates her from other superheroes in both the Marvel and DC universes respectively is--no, not her gender--it is her ability to integrate truth, justice, compassion, and courage in everything she does to protect the planet entrusted to her people by the Greek gods. The key to understanding Wonder Woman is not through her brute strength or supernatural powers, but through her love and compassion for innocent people and her own integrity. Rarely has any film truly given women (or anyone, for the matter) a strong female protagonist who does not pander but exhibits excellence in well-developed strength of character and a complete eruption of the fantasies of many women to rise up to serve and protect. It would have been far too easy to sell Diana Prince as a vengeful women out to destroy men or seek revenge for the destruction that has befallen the planet; but no, that is not the Diana we see. We see a heroine of others--a completely unselfish hero who is of earth. Being of the earth is truly what separates her from someone like Super Man. Sure, some strong female characters from with the world of comics, literature, theatre, TV, or film have demonstrated strong characteristics and have been leaders; but¬†Wonder Woman sands alone as a film that provides audiences with a female protagonist who is not merely a leader, but the engineer--the author--of her own destiny and story.Why does this film work so well??? After all, that is the question you are likely asking yourself after so many DC flops (note: that does not count the Burton or Nolan films). The short answer is that Snyder was NOT in the driver's seat on this ride; however, there is more to it than that. Snyder's touch is certainly evident in many scenes (especially the action sequences); furthermore, he was greatly instrumental in the overall structure, but he took a backseat to the driver of this vehicle. His approach was important in the design of the car, and even building it, but when it came time to take it for a spin, he turned the steering wheel over to Director Patty Jenkins. Films featuring strong female protagonists most often seem to fair better when there is a women at the helm. And¬†Wonder Woman is a testament to that observation. Whereas a male director would have likely spent some time sexualizing Diana, Jenkins spends the time on her courage and compassion. Instead of focusing on the terrain of Diana's mystical home beautifully appointed with white cliffs and sapphire water or spending time on her sleek blade or even her trademark lasso of truth, Jenkins spends a significant amount of screen time on the terrain of Diana's face. A face that communicates the heart, mind, and soul of Diana. Instead of a face displaying anger or disgust at the world of men, her face is often bright, hopeful, containing a winning smile with eyes overflowing with optimism. In terms of the production design itself, it only bares hints of Snyder's penchant for beautiful music videos; the production design is one that takes itself seriously, but in the perfect amounts. Although the film is quite dark, there are sufficient moments of levity.Perhaps you're a stereotypical dude who does not care for films that feature female protagonists and feministic themes. No fear.¬†Wonder Woman is actually a World War I film disguised as a superhero movie. As much as¬†Wonder Woman works as an exceptional superhero movie, it is equally an impressive World War I film. Taking place in the days leading up to Armistice Day, this film displays the atrocities of war and the determination of both sides to win. You will find yourself in the trenches in France and Belgium with the Allied forces who, against all odds, are determined to defeat the enemy in order to stop genocide and widespread devastation. Placing Wonder Woman amidst the warriors of earth, connects her to humanity in ways that most superheroes cannot. Fighting for what you believe in is a major theme in this film. Some of the best war movies are those that ""show don't tell."" And¬†Wonder Woman certainly shows what war really looks like instead of talking about it as some abstract concept or spending time in diplomacy. In fact, diplomacy is thrown out the window, and Diana lays the need to fight on the hearts of the bureaucratic leaders and soldiers alike. Pick up your sword and fight. Don't just sit idly by while humanity is destroyed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Gadot Makes the Film,"Wonder Woman (2017)*** (out of 4)Amazonian warrior Diana (Gal Gadot) witnesses a plane crash into an ocean so she rushes to save the pilot (Chris Pine). Soon she realizes that there's some sort of war going on in the outside world and the two travel to London where Diana is going to get to reveal her full powers.It seems that next to Donald Trump, WONDER WOMAN was the most political discussion held by people on social media in 2017. I must admit that I skipped the movie in theaters and waited for its Blu-ray release and as an outsider I was just shocked at the countless political rants that were going on with the film. I don't plan on getting political in this review but I should also point out that I've never read a comic book in my life. With that said, WONDER WOMAN was certainly a good movie but I'm going to stop well short before calling it great or anything special.There were some wonderful things throughout the picture and we can start with Gadot. She was certainly the perfect choice for the role as she has the look down as well as the physical need for the role. I thought she perfectly owned every aspect of the role and she was certainly the best thing about the picture. I found Pine to be quite good as well and the two of them had a nice chemistry throughout. The Amazonian world was another good aspect as the look of it was wonderful and it really did come off as a fantasy world. The WWI setting was another plus.With that said, there really wasn't anything overly original here except for the lead being a woman. In fact, some of the things here I found to be quite lame including the non-stop sexual innuendo that starts right from the start to the very end of the picture. For all the ""she's a great role model for girls"" we certainly got a lot of lame jokes. I'd also argue that the CGI was used way too much. I know CGI is the king of the world in movies but for me when it's used poorly or too much it just takes away from everything on the screen and I thought that happened here.With that said, WONDER WOMAN is certainly a film that is worth watching but I'm just not going to celebrate it as some sort of great film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not perfect but great movie,"I really enjoyed this movie, and Gal Gadot was wonderful.I almost pulled all my hair out of my head as i read so many of the negative reviews. Please disregard any of the plethora of reveiws from people who think that either:1. There were German Nazis in WW1 (or that the Nazi party even existed at that time).2. That the Germans were the good guys in WW1 (yep i read that too).3. That this took place during WW2.Ignoring the incredibly large number of reviewers who espoused some of those 3 items will leave you with just a small handful to read. We really need to teach history more thoroughly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good entertainment despite some deficits,"For an action movie, the action scenes are good, but not spectacular. For a superhero movie, the special effects are very weak. For World War I movie, the realism of the historical setting is too inconsistent. (Probably explained by parallel history?) For an anti-war movie, the message is too flimsy. And passing from a gaudy setting on a beautiful (computer generated) Greek fantasy island to a gritty World War I setting is a bold move, no matter how well justified by the plot.For these reasons it is surprising that this genre-mixing movie actually works very well, overall.The film is the origin story of superhero 'Wonder Woman', though in this film she is only referred to as Diana, 'daughter' of the Queen of the Amazons, or 'Diana Prince'. Her 'mother' formed her out of clay to serve as an antagonist to Ares, the Greek god of war, but has become a bit protective. Diana is played byGal Gadot, who before becoming an actress was a Miss Israel and then a martial arts instructor in the Israeli military. This casting choice seems logical in many ways. It goes back toBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). (There are plenty of comments on this site claiming that she cannot act. I don't understand them.)In the first quarter of the film, Steve (Chris Pine), an English spy returning from Germany, crashes near the secret island of the Amazons and is rescued by Diana. Ultimately this leads to Diana leaving the island and seeking her destiny in a joint mission with Steve.After the warrior idyll of the first quarter, our two heroes travel to London, where the film temporarily turns into a comedy despite the gray setting. It is fun to watch an Amazon shop for clothes and get into conflict with early 20th century European gender stereotypes.In its second half the film becomes a war drama that has most of the action and superhero stuff, some of it in the trenches of the Ardennes. Unfortunately this is the weaker half, but it's still entertaining enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

hits almost every note perfectly,"Amazonian princess Diana (Gal Gadot) lives on the hidden island of Themyscira. Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) forbids her training but Antiope (Robin Wright) disobeys her. Zeus had created mankind which were corrupted by Ares, God of War. Zeus defeated him and hid Themyscira from the world. One day, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes his plane and is rescued by Diana. It's WWI and Trevor is an American spy working for the British. He had discovered that German General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) is developing a devastating new poison gas. Diana fears that Ares has returned to wreck havoc and journeys to kill a God. They travel to London where Sir Patrick (David Thewlis) is leading the peace effort.The DCEU was having problems. I wouldn't say that it is in any danger but it needed an unreserved win. This is exactly that. I was leery of the choice of Gal Gadot when it was first announced. Her English was barely understandable at the time and her acting was stiff. Her English has improved by leaps and bounds and her acting is also better. The genius of Patty Jenkins is to steer into her deficiencies. Patty fully embraces her sincerity and makes all the Amazonians have the same accent as her. It's a brilliant move.The other Patty brilliance is her emotional IQ. She understands human emotions better than anything in BvS. The best comparison is Martha and the double reveal of Steve's final conversation with Diana. Martha is a silly construction. The double scene is emotional heartbreak. The action is solid. The no-man's land fight is amazing. There is humor but not just the quippy Marvel humor. It is character-based and well-earned.

She is the best I have seen for this character and the closest to the characterisation in the comics, of which I have many.I never got bored throughout this movie, which I thought was well paced and beautifully filmed, perfectly capturing the introduction of a Goddess, not a super heroine, into what was then modern-day warfare. I am just sorry I didn't get to see it on the big screen.To all those commenting on her legs and feminine charms, what the hell has it got to do with the movie itself? Get over yourselves!

Wonder Woman: Best DC Movie after the Batman Trilogy!,"Just watched the first show and everybody started clapping when the credit started to roll in the end. That says a lot about a movie.Many of us had doubt when Gal Gadot was cast as Wonder Woman, and she proved the worth. What an amazing cast! Hollywood is full of beautiful actresses, but Gal also has a great personality which resonates with her character very well. She is strong as well as funny. Chris Pine turned out to be the perfect sidekick and love interest of Diana. He has this old classic Hollywood look. I am hoping we will see more of Connie Nelson and Robin Wright's character in the next venture.I don't want to go further into screenplay. It has its tiny flaws, but we have seen much worse in recent times. Many people might argue why the WWI? Well, the core of the movie is not the war, but the darkness inside us that causes the war. You can easily relate it to today's narrative.I enjoyed the movie through and through. Finally a quality superhero movie from DC after Batman Trilogy.

Obvious politically target-oriented film than a really entertaining film,"OK, this movie wasn't bad at all, but isn't good either. It's a poor attempt from those who own the rights of DC Comics' characters to start a new franchise such as The Avengers... which comes 6 years later. This movie is comparable to Captain America: The First Avenger, but most of the people is no longer interested in movies about the origins of superheros because... well, we all know them.The acting is below the average, and the CGI is, despite its quality, too unrealistic. OK, we're talking about the daughter of the King of the Gods, but the way the movie manages her obvious overpower above her peers is so bland it makes you laugh rather than enjoying the film. The story isn't even good, all situations coming out from nowhere just to fake some kind of continuity along the flick.I can't understand some of the extremely positive reviews of this film, but I guess it has something to do with the new Hollywood trend to make films about women empowerment, and it's getting good reviews because it's the first blockbuster to show a woman as a non-mystical super-heroine in the main character since Lara Croft. Maybe they should ask the creators of the last Mad Max movie for some advice about making a movie which truly represents the real postulates of the feminist movement, instead of filming ridiculous action films with zero undertones just for the sake of the box office based on DC hardcore fans and out-of-criteria feminists.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie is okay; this woman is amazing.,"Wonder Woman is the fourth movie in the DC Extended Universe and its second film following a single hero. Given the quality of the movies that preceded it and Wonder Woman's anemic presence in last year's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, I really didn't have high hopes for this one. I figured I'd give it a shot, though, and to my surprise, it wasn't awful; in fact, I mostly enjoyed it.Diana (Gal Gadot) is an Amazon from the island of Themyscira, a land occupied and governed entirely by women. When American fighter pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash-lands off their coast, Diana rescues him and leaves her home to try to put an end to the First World War, which she believes to be the work of Ares, the god of war. Matters aren't as simple as she planned, though, and she ends up learning uncomfortable truths about humanity, as well as secrets of her own identity.For the most part, Wonder Woman is a relief from the dour, clunky DC films that have preceded it. First off ‚Äì this one is in color! Gone are the days of gray-and-orange sludge; this movie has green grass and a blue sky. More importantly, Wonder Woman's costume has taken on some classic red and blue. The requisite sexist and fish-out-of- water scenes are mostly given their appropriate time on screen without becoming tedious, and a good deal of the intended humor actually lands. There's an improvised scene early on featuring the two leads on a boat at sea, and they play off of each other wonderfully.Unfortunately, the film still suffers from a lot of the issues that the previous DC films have: awkward pacing, on-the-nose dialog, weak villains, and an overwhelming score that beats you over the head with what you're supposed to feel at every step of the way. The movie is also incredibly cheesy, and while there is an appropriate, or even desired amount of cheese in a comic book movie, I found myself groaning a bit too much from it all. The battle scenes also manage to out- Snyder Zack Snyder in terms of their overuse of slow motion and ""awesome"", impractical fighting. When Wonder Woman herself isn't involved in scenes, I tend to lose interest, and the reveal toward the end of the film hit me like a handful of Triscuits.Far and away the best aspect of the movie is Wonder Woman herself. Gal Gadot's performance as a naive hero with an overpowering sense of duty is impeccable, and I loved watching her work. This character saves people because she wants to save them, and it is truly compelling to watch such a pure expression of a superhero. We have seen enough movies about heroes begrudgingly doing their work; in BvS, Superman looks pained to help, and Batman doesn't even try to save anyone.Wonder Woman in this film just might be my favorite superhero in the current cinematic universes, across both Marvel's and DC's movies. We see a hero who fights for those who can't fight for themselves. Marvel has produced quippy dialog and some fun fight scenes, but its heroism has faltered lately. For their deity superhero, they gave us a pile of cardboard with a hammer and a sexy accent. I haven't been this excited for comic book movies since the first Avengers film, and I really wasn't expecting that from DC at this point.I recommend this movie, not for its intrinsic qualities as a film but for the direction it is potentially taking the DCEU and for its main character. I still don't have high hopes for Justice League, but if they keep this hero doing what she does best, I'll probably be just fine with it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A good start for Wonder Woman,"Wonder Woman is fun and action packed, Gal Gadot's inexperience hurts the character less than I thought it would, which I credit to director Patty Jenkins.

Overall Wonder Woman is a good origin story for a character I hope to see a lot more of on the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Above all else, Wonder Woman is charming, funny and exciting","It's incredibly sad to read about how many milestones Wonder Woman touches on, especially in this day and age where a high-profile Twitter user must consider every message they post to the world in fear of being racist, sexist, homophobic, or just plain insensitive. Despite the influx of superhero movies since Marvel kicked off their Cinematic Universe in 2008 with Iron Man, and despite the abundance of long-standing and hugely popular female superheroes existing in the comics, and despite audiences calling out for a female-led superhero film ever since Scarlett Johansson donned the leathers as Black Widow in Iron Man 2, studios have failed to deliver one in 12 years. Perhaps the studios were scared they would have another Elektra on their hands, but that movie failed because it was terrible, and was a spin-off from the also-terrible Daredevil.The DC Extended Universe, in the face of the critical mauling they received last year with the double-whammy of Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, can only be applauded for taking the much-overdue 'risk' of launching a female-led franchise with Wonder Woman, a movie that not only represents so much in terms of moving cinema out of a stone-age mentality and into the modern world, but surpasses all expectations in a time of superhero overkill. Wonder Woman is, above all, charming, funny and exciting, and will hopefully help steer the DCEU back on track after an incredibly wobbly start. Making her introduction in Batman v Superman and emerging as one of the few positive things to be said about Zack Snyder's overblown and poorly-constructed smack- down, Wonder Woman begins in the present day but flashes back to the time glimpsed in the black-and-white photograph sent to her by Ben Affleck's Batman, when World War I was in full flow and her heart was won by a spy named Steve.The young Diana grows up on the island of Themyscira, a beautiful hidden paradise created by Zeus to be a home for the Amazons, a tribe of fierce female warriors tasked with protecting the world from the Greek God's evil, warmongering brother Ares. Diana's mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), attempts to shield her from the horrors of war and forbids her to practice combat, while her auntie Anitope (Robin Wright) realises her potential and trains her in secret. Zeus left the islanders a gift, a weapon called the 'Godkiller', which will prove decisive when the battle with Ares finally stirs. Cue the arrival of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), an Allied spy who stumbles on the island while fleeing the Germans. He brings death and war with him, and the Amazons want to kill him before Diana intervenes, revealing he saved her life. The tribe want nothing to do with a war waged by man, but Diana suspects Ares may be puppet-master behind the conflict that has taken millions of lives. Against her mother's wishes, she travels with Steve to London, where he reveals to his superiors German plans to release a devastating new mustard gas created by General Ludendroff (Danny Huston) and Spanish chemist Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya).The word 'man' carries a special significance, and director Patty Jenkins carefully weaves this idea into the film without rubbing it in your face. As well as the violent, dangerous 'world of men' lurking across the waters, there is also No Man's Land, the stretch of mud and rubble separating the two warring fronts. This is a place that no man can hope to survive, and this sets up the triumphant moment seen in the trailers in which Diana deflects machine-gun fire with her bracelets and shield before taking out anybody daft enough to stand in her way. This scene is made all the more powerful by Gal Gadot, who puts in a terrific performance despite her lack of acting experience and puts all the doubters to rest, proving to be just as savvy with comedy as the action. The fact that we care so much about her also means that the CGI-heavy climax, which seems to be trend with DC, can almost be forgiven. Thanks to well-written character development and some charming chemistry between Gadot and the ever- brilliant Chris Pine, there is a real emotional investment that was lacking in DC's previous misfires. In terms of origin stories, this doesn't rewrite the rule-book, but the importance and significance of Wonder Woman should not be underestimated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"It's a superhero movie, what did you expect?","I went in with low expectations, therefore I wasn't disappointed. However, if I were to have lent ear to all the reviews and commentaries, I would have been quite annoyed. This is NOT a good movie. I barely rate it average.There were good parts in it, mainly the feminist aspects of the film. Diana is tough, but also a woman, with a strong personal and cultural desire to help, mend, love. Of course, it is taken to ridiculous heights and made completely worthless in the end, when she kills a bunch of people, but still, it was a refreshing, if badly implemented, point of view.Other than that there is a lot of bad characterization, starting with the Amazons and Ares and ending with the three ""sidekicks"" that do almost nothing the entire movie. Even the villains are underused, in a movie that somehow managed to total over two hours. There are some scenes that should make the director cower in shame (see the ""they don't know that"" scene, ugh!) and some bad acting here and there.Gal Gadot is beautiful, but not an extremely talented actress. She did her best, though. Chris Pine played Captain Kirk, complete with motorcycle and the scene where he stops, thinks a little, then rides another way, plus the obligatory self sacrifice scene. I think it was some sort of tribute, but that part wasn't good in Star Trek either.Bottom line: you can watch it just like you would a Batman or Superman movie and expect just as much.

Wondrous,"When Steve Trevor(Pine, charming, wry) lands on Themyscira, it is the first contact between it and the world of man(the species) in a long time, and the first experienced at all by Diana(Gadot, bringing to life the idealistic titular character. Her smile, her grace and her world are all stunning. Their chemistry is strong). He tells the ethnically diverse group about World War I. Might Ares have returned, creating the conflict he lives for?There are chunks of this that pass without action. Especially in the middle section. The climax is less chaotic, loud and, well, blinding, than Batman V Superman's, albeit not entirely dodging those problems. And the first few aren't as consequential. The initial one is essentially combat training. However, when it's there, it is always good, and frequently amazing. It's not there purely because that's part of why we came to watch. Never does it just make people look cool, and let the heroine stack up a body-count. Heck, she barely kills anyone, and she clearly isn't interested in it. In one of the (too) many similarities to Captain America: The First Avenger(a movie it does largely match in overall quality. Nevertheless, it feels derivative), she ""doesn't like bullies"". No, first and foremost, she's doing it to save people.This as the leaders of the countries involved are shrugging off massive casualties. As No Man's Land is treated as an unfortunate reality, not one that is likely to be brought to an end. While the two villains, who could easily have been combined into one, spend their compelling screen-time either using horrible poison gas on the defenseless, or studying hard to make it even worse. She's there to rescue those she's never met. From a race she hadn't even encountered days earlier, in her whole life. We're in the middle of a comic book movie boom. And yet this seemingly obvious value and goal so often goes forgotten these days.Other than the leads, a lot of the performers, talented as most of them are, get lost in the shuffle, with only a couple of moments to really shine. The Amazons are almost all bad actors ‚Äì I figure they went for physical types, instead. I would say it could have been handled by hiring talents specifically for when they have dialog, and then those would be ones we didn't see in other scenes. Mostly, they are there to convince you of Paradise Island as somewhere people live, work, not only fence. And they succeed. There are pacing issues. The ending is bad, and borrows from great, but mismatched, sources. Occasionally, the message and themes get cheesy, and the final resolution is one example. Although the humor is rapid-fire, using the fish-out-of-water element well, it frequently feels forced, and I don't blame those who find it obnoxious and, indeed, at no point actually funny. The DCEU(no, saying that this is the best of the four isn't saying much) has yet to balance jokes with seriousness. It's not a perfect film. What it is, is genuinely engaging and moving. Warner Brothers? Keep Patty Jenkins around. She'll help you properly compete with the MCU.There is a lot of disturbing content in this. I recommend it to everyone. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Love this movie!!!!!!!!!!! Can watch it again and again,"I have no words. This movie is incredible, outstanding, excellent, fabulous, amazing etc. Gal Gadot portrayed wonder woman so well. I was amazed by Gal Gadot's acting. Gadot's accent is the same as she did in the movie so it seems like she was born to play this role. This movie has a deep meaning. The script is really good. Action is done very well. The shooting is also fab. The ending twist is perfect. I was always a fan of wonder woman but now I am even more. I heard Gadot got a neck and back surgery after completing the movie. Great for children above 8 and also great for adults. The plot is mind blowing. I have watched this without exaggerating 6 times.

Wonder Woman and Captain Steve Trevor seek to end WW1,"Near the end of WW1, an American spy (Chris Pine) is chased by Germans to the hidden island of Amazonian women created by Zeus to protect mankind. The princess of the island (Gal Gadot) leaves with the captain to help end the Great War and destroy Ares forever.""Wonder Woman"" (2017) combines the Wonder Woman TV series (1975-1979) with elements of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (1979), ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981), ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967), ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011) and ""Man of Steel"" (2013). It's a well done modern superhero flick and superior to both ""The First Avenger"" and ""Man of Steel.""The opening paradisal island sequence is good without overstaying its welcome. The story really picks up when Captain Steve Trevor and Diana depart the island. They have great chemistry and their relationship adds human interest.Unlike ""Man of Steel,"" which devolved into super-beings constantly pulverizing each other in the second half, ""Wonder Woman"" has the poise to take its time and establish an interesting assortment of characters. The entire midsection is great, but the last act, to be expected, comes down to two super-beings pounding each other. But at least the creators tried to add a weighty moral.The film runs 2 hours, 21 minutes.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Okay, we are all entitled to an opinion. If you go to see a movie that you know features a female superhero, probably seen stills and maybe a trailer, it shouldn't be a surprise to see ridiculous antics, a light plot, and a fun film aimed mainly at the male teenage market. Someone had a go at the acting, nothing wrong with it that I could see.

Better as expected - some hours of easy relaxed entertainment,"Yes it is yet another super hero movie. At the beginning (spider man, iron man) I liked the genre cause it was something different. No more spy themes, fighting the cold war, which is already long over in reality. Then it quickly started to bore me and recently I even got annoyed. Hulk, episode 20, Iron Man episode 30, Spider Man third character....
But this had some appeal to me. There is some sort of a story. There are characters and there is some OK acting. The action slowly builds up from some initial Amazon training scenes to later total god mode out of this world in the air hovering boss fight. 
If you want a movie to be successful these days you have to do this stuff. Either do it or be removed from the theaters after one week. After all: it is entertainment business.

The Amazon Princess Finally Makes It To The Big Screen,"I have to confess, I am not a fan of big-screen comic book/superhero films, especially of the last twenty-plus years. In fact, the only one of these I sat through in my life was the original SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, arguably the best film of its kind ever made-and this was back in 1978. But while I probably can't change my mind about the genre after seeing it, the 2017 film WONDER WOMAN has more than enough to distinguish it from the others of either the DC Comics lineup (which it is a part of) or Marvel.The character of Diana, the Amazon warrior princess who became Wonder Woman, originated in comic books the late 1930's, but the most famous iteration of this character was on television during the late 1970's, when the role was portrayed (and legendarily so) by Lynda Carter. Fortunately, in the midst of Hollywood's (and the film going public's) obsession with comics, the character finally made a stand-alone big-screen bow in 2017-and with no less than a woman in the director's chair, Patty Jenkins, here making her first film as a director since 2003's MONSTER.Israeli actress Gal Gadot steps into the role of the Amazon warrior princess, whose background of growing up among fellow goddesses on the mythical island of Themyscira is brilliantly depicted by Jenkins and her crew on location in Italy, and is mentored by the best of them (portrayed by Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright). But everything changes for her when an American pilot (Chris Pine) working as a spy for the British crashes his plane close to the island. Pine tells of a war to end all wars happening in the world outside of Themyscira, which is shielded by an invisible force field; and Gadot, having realized her abilities, makes every effort to try and stop it all. She and Pine take a boat into the worst of the fighting on the Western Front in France near the end of this war, World War I, and try to stop a ruthless German general (Danny Huston) from manufacturing a lethal gas sure to make an already atrocious body count in this first example of genuine mechanized warfare even higher than it is. The adventures that Gadot and Pine go on force Gadot to not only understand her own powers, but the weaknesses of the human race in general, and men in particular, and the penchant they have for killing each other through hatred. In her relationship with Pine, she realizes that love is the one thing that can save the world.Unlike so many other superhero comic book movies, Wonder Woman, besides having immense powers of her own, is also able to show empathy and understanding, only using her powers when nothing else will do. And even though her Israeli accent is very obvious in her line renderings, Gadot makes a completely credible Wonder Woman all the same-likely, she was the only actress capable of creating a Wonder Woman for this era (even though this film is set more than a century in the past) and still paving a certain amount of homage to Carter, whom Jenkins gives very special thanks to in the final credits. The visual effects and the costumes are all first-rate, of course; but the reason they, and the film in general, work as well as they do is because of Jenkins' fine direction and Gadot's portrayal. This is not just a slam-bang, hypersonic Hollywood spectacle. This is a spectacle with a heart and a conscience; and that's why it gets a '9' rating from me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It's great (i'm not going to call it wonderful),"Here is my spoiler-free review of Wonder Woman. After three films that left most people disappointed or upset ""Wonder Woman"" had a very difficult job to do. It had to please the fans, make people believe in the DCEU again and of course be a good movie. I personally really like ""Man of Steel"" and the director's cut of ""Batman V Superman"" (i am not going to talk about suicide squad) so i was very excited about watching ""Wonder Woman"" and i Think it delivered. It was entertaining at all times, it had exciting action set-pieces but it still took it's time to have some more quite character moments between Chris Pine and Gal Gadot. This is what makes this movie special. It told a great origin story with some themes that were very fitting to the rest of the film. I still have a few issues with the film like the Way some of the characters were treated and the use of CGI explosions but that's about it.

Plenty of Action and an Interesting Plot,"Born of the ancient Greek gods, ""Diana"" (Gal Gadot) lives on a isolated and unchartered island with the Amazons who train her to be the most skilled warrior possible. Then one day she sees an airplane in the skies which crashes in the ocean near the island and she rushes out to save the occupant. It's then that she discovers that this person is a man-and she has never seen one before as her entire island is populated by females. But before she can get much information from him the island is attacked by German soldiers who are eventually killed in a very fierce battle. Not long afterward she is told that his name is ""Captain Steve Trevor"" (Chris Pine) and he is an American soldier working with British Intelligence. Not only that, but he also tells her that the entire world is involved in a war on the scale of something that has never happened before. So having already witnessed the ruthlessness of the Germans, she decides to go with Captain Trevor to London to track down and kill the individual responsible-Aires, the God of War. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good ""Comic Book movie"" which had plenty of action and an interesting plot. Likewise, the presence of an attractive actress like Gal Gadot certainly didn't hurt matters either.

Excellent potential,"This movie has some really incredible potential. The thematic relevance and consistency is good, the visuals and color grade are refreshing, the acting is pretty great, and the writing has a lot of good moments and the story is compelling at base. Even the action stands above the standard superhero movie in memorability and fun. The prop and costume design is absolutely terrific.Unfortunately, all of this is marred terribly by the editing. The entire film is incredibly slow paced for an action movie, even several fight scenes feel lethargic. There are several scenes present that add nothing to the movie, and several jarring oddities. The editing needed serious tightening, and this issue multiplies existing issues. Some of the dialogue is tedious and unnecessary, and the slow editing compounds this into making the movie feel as boring as the dialogue at these parts. The 2 hour and 20 minute runtime is far too long for the substance of the film. There is little outside the editing that's negative, with some odd special effects or minor continuity inconsistencies.I praise this movie generally, but I can't recommend it for casual viewers. I'd recommend it only for DC fans or people who don't wish to engage much with the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Exceeding Expectations, but not Perfect","With the last DC film to come out being Suicide Squad, there was good reason to be concerned about Wonder Woman. Even after the initial wave of positive reviews for it started coming in I was extremely skeptical. With DC having been in a slump of critically unpopular movies and with superhero movie fatigue on the rise, I really thought there was almost no possible way this would be good or be received well. For the most part, I was wrong. That being said, it is by no means perfect. The fact that this movie is being lauded by many critics as some kind of masterpiece is strange. I was reasonably satisfied overall, but let's not get carried away.First, the good news: The overall premise of Wonder Woman helping to bring about an end to WWI by finding and battling the god of war Ares, is a perfectly straightforward and compelling superhero plot. The characters mostly work well, even if some of the side characters that accompany her later on feel a bit pointless and underused. Tonally this is also substantially lighter fare than the other recent DC films, which are all pretty heavy and dark and grim.Initially, I doubted Gal Gadot could pull off carrying an entire movie, but once again, I was (mostly) wrong. She embodies the role to the point where she is probably the best part of the movie and carries it with surprising competence. Part of my skepticism came from the fact that she is/was a model whose previous forays into the world of acting have more or less been as eye candy in the mind-numbing Fast and Furious franchise.Thankfully, her model looks are not used as a cheap device to hijack the movie into the realm of fan service. That said, her looks do help her to believably pull off a character that is essentially a goddess. Her character is also very clearly a warrior, yet she still mostly plays the character as feminine, not as a male proxy. She also plays the character with an innocent earnestness that, along with her looks, help her to stand out like a beacon in the drab, dreary, and miserable setting of WWI era Europe. And even though she may not have the acting chops of a top tier actress (and it shows in a few scenes), her being cast here fits well enough that I would have a hard time seeing anyone else in the role now. Strong casting usually trumps raw acting experience.Some of the scenes she is in with Chris Pine's character, who she has an appropriately awkward chemistry with, were allowed to be improvised, which sometimes leads to some very clunky interactions. It kind of works with the naivet√© of the character, but perhaps a more clever scripted sequence could accomplish the same thing better. I also wasn't a fan of the early sequences of the movie where Diana is growing up and receiving lots of exposition about her homeland and history. It's a beautiful setting and it sets up the rationale for her leaving, but it drags on and the other characters there are mostly uninteresting. Once she leaves, the plot picks up, with a few rocky patches here and there.The usage of slow motion during action sequences all the way until the ending is excessive, but not to the point where it's overly obnoxious. My thoughts on the ending and the accompanying battle are mixed. It works as a flashy and climactic way to resolve her motivations for entering the war, but it almost becomes a completely different movie at that point. I think this could've been executed differently so it didn't feel as out of place.One other problem which personally bothers me the most is the body count. Superman, Batman, and now even Wonder Woman all kill tons of people (Marvel is occasionally guilty of this as well). With Wonder Woman it feels especially wrong, since not only is she against the idea of war to begin with, but the German soldiers she is so easily crushing with her incredible strength are to her merely innocent men being manipulated by Ares. Yes, this is a war, but at no point is subdual or allowing surrender even considered after demonstrating her immense power. I understand that an action movie needs action, but action doesn't need to mean killing everybody. The early fight on the beaches of her homeland is also strange, with both sides just immediately deciding to kill the other despite having no idea who they even are. If you were a WWI era German soldier who accidentally sailed up to an unknown island and saw a bunch of women riding horses on the beach wearing ancient Greek looking armor, would you immediately open fire on them? It just doesn't make much sense.All in all, it's a good movie made better by the fact that it exceeded expectations, but I wouldn't overdo it with the praise. Let's hope DC movies can stay at this level or improve, and maybe Gal Gadot can counterbalance that dark pessimism in the DCEU with some refreshing hopeful optimism.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Perfection üíô,"This is the eighteenth time watching this stupendous movie. Wonder Woman has been my favourite character since I was seven years old. Thank you Patty Jenkins & THANK YOU Gal Gadot for this masterpiece! üíôThe film begins inside the walls of the Louvre Museum in Paris. The story begins with Diana, Princess of Themyscira looking at a picture from her past & we are taken on a journey on how she became Wonder Woman by participating in World War I alongside Steve Trevor & his gang plus defeating Ares, the God of War.Wonder Woman is simply amazing. The film does not hold back because Gal Gadot - bless her - gives you all the glory of the iconic Amazonian Warrior Princess. Gal Gadot was well known from the Fast & Furious series, but her quintessential performance in this film has cemented herself as an icon! As Princess Diana of Themyscira, Gal truly does kick ass in this film. She truly is a superwoman in reality as she did her own stunts despite being five months pregnant!This film is a masterpiece courtesy of the hard work put into the cinematography to the brilliant choreography & the production plus art design as well as the meticulous details into the costumes. It's one of the many reasons why I keep on watching this film because it truly feels like you are in their world.The message of love is strong in this film & I believe in love just like Wonder Woman.PS: I managed to muster the courage to go to the State of Israel & experience the beauty the nation has to offer.

An entertaining movie,"I found this movie quite entertaining. Despite it's over two hours duration someone can watch it with pleasure. I found many common things to the Captain America's movie as well as to the God of War action game with a female character instead. The movie introduce us to the world of the Amazons. A female warrior society where young Diana grows up. The photography of beautiful landscapes and world war industrial cities is tied to the movie's atmosphere. Costumes and vehicles too. Dialogs are pretty simply but they are not redundant most of the time. Gal Gadot's and Chris Pine's chemistry is good. She is a strong female personality but at the same time she possesses a lot of compassion for the human suffering caused by the war and therefore they have a common ground. Acting performances are not great but they are not bad either. Everyone has it's own separate role and they are all tied up together. Choreographies are impressive with tension and quite natural moves for CGI. The soundtrack and the sound effects are suitable to the movie's theme.

"A roller coaster of a movie, not in a good way","First of all, I'd like to point out that I have done reviews before and therefore, rest assured that I am not a bot, which now made me suspicious of all the good reviews that have been written for this movie prior to its worldwide release. This movie is a hot mess. I went in with high expectations after reading all the reviews praising this movie. At the end of the first act (you'll know which one I'm talking about when you see the movie), it felt that the movie should have stopped right there and probably leave Ares to a sequel or something. But no, it slowed down and then moved on to the next villain. And when you think it's over, another villain slapped you in the face and made me think, ""oh yeah, there's another one that they haven't addressed yet"". In total, this movie has 3 climaxes, all arguably equal in terms of power and and at the end of the movie, it is similar to the feeling of stepping off a nauseating roller coaster ride with dramatically steep ups and downs in terms of the pacing of the movie. I would also like to point out that I am not a comic book reader but an avid moviegoer and therefore, no... I am not a Marvel fanboy which many people would say biased my opinion. I want to go to a movie to feel entertained and sorry to say, this movie did not entertain me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Gal Gadot is the greatest superhero lead casting,"Wonder Woman rips straight from the comics what makes the character the greatest female superhero.

Director Patty Jenkins successfully presents not jut feminist but also universal themes without being contrived, something everyone can truly embrace. Accompanied by stunning visuals, Wonder Woman also works as a summer spectacle worth the ticket. The romance is genuine with Gadot and Pine's chemistry carrying the film.

So let me make clear, if you are already a comic book movie fan, this review is coming from a POV of somebody who never watches any of them except for Nolan's Batman trilogy and older ones from the 80's mostly, maybe 1 or 2 from the early 2000's like Spiderman and Superman Returns, both were pretty good.As a big fan of World War I (and WW II), I actually loved this movie's ability to converge the story of Dianna into that backdrop, and in my opinion, this is more of a WWI movie than it is a ""superhero"" or comic book movie, even though obviously it is also that, too. The reason why is because the way the scenes were staged and set up, it immersed you into that time period. Most of the costumes, background scenery, war scenes, and even the strategies, weapons, and geography discussed throughout the movie were surprisingly extremely accurate for that, and I was not expecting that whatsoever. In fact, my expectations were incredibly low for this movie before watching it.Second, let me mention the also unexpected delight of the added mix of legit funny scenes/humor and a love story that was almost as poignant as something at the pinnacle of that genre, Titanic. Once again, this was totally unexpected on both levels, and I was pleasantly surprised at how well they were included. It made the film even more likable and entertaining.Thirdly, the script is very good. It's not elite, but it is way above average and good for this genre. That was also unexpected.I also have to mention the acting, and Pine does a very good job in his role. Gadot's exotic looks and accent work extremely well for her role since one of the main ideas of the story is that she is a fish out of water entering the modern world from her secluded island.About the only thing I didn't like about this film was how the action sequences toward the end became a little too far fetched and cheesy, but even so, the scenes were emotionally powerful between the score, dialogue, themes, and acting so those components redeemed it just enough to save it from being really bad. It sort of devolved into an average villain cliche, and there is no denying that. However, there were some emotionally powerful elements going on while that was happening. I almost feel like I want to forget that bad part and remember the good parts of that final battle scene.Finally, I do not usually cry during movies, but this movie caused me to shed a few tears on two levels. First, it's an absolutely beautiful movie between the scenery, musical score, and cinematography. It's brilliant. Second, Gadot's reactions to the sufferings of war and her chemistry with Pine in the love story side of it and their disagreements about the causes of war she hates were very emotionally powerful, and I also did not anticipate that either. The movie has depth, it has emotional depth, and it is hard to forget because this is what makes it a solidly good movie.I've already seen WW twice, and I look forward to watching it again. Since 2013, there are only about 2-3 other movies I've seen more than once besides this one. So in another surprising way to myself, I would call this easily one of my top 5 favorite movies of the 2010's. It's almost a masterpiece.Update: I've now seen it 2 more times as of Oct 2023 and my review stands. It's a modern classic.8.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Time to call it flat out...  this movie sucks.,"Yes, I really wanted to like this film but I knew better after the first THREE terdfests from the DCEU.Apparently, I'm a glutton for punishment. Don't be like me, you shouldn't see this awful movie and certainly it's not good to support such trash. The more money the DCEU generates the more we'll see the same mistakes over and over and over again.Despite the fake early reviews, it is safe to say that Wonder Woman is another miss from Warner Brothers. The movie feels overcrowded and bloated yet shallow as a mud puddle. Comics have the beauty of telling a story over months of issues where corrections can be made even when the ball is rolling. Films do not afford that opportunity. If you make a mistake ‚Äî like casting a beauty queen that can't act ‚Äî then you're stuck with it. You can't ""change artists.""Word on the street is that Warner Brothers ordered the DCEU to incorporate humor and less morbid story lines. Well, the film that was turned in did feel like a piecemeal script. Apparently, you can't even hold out hope for a directors cut this time around.This script must have been written by the people who write the responses ball players give at a press conference. Seriously, did the writers make a drinking game out of how many awful one-liners they could jam into the movie? It's like they opened fortune cookie after fortune cookie looking for the next cheesiest line. Did the director have any input on writing any of this mess?At the end of the day, there is only one cure for the affliction the WB keeps perpetrating and the bad films that we find ourselves plagued with right now ‚Äî STOP!Just stop going to these movies! The studios will never stop churning out this mindless drivel that sucks all hope out of seeing a good superhero movie again until we stop throwing our money at them.Trust me, the dumpster fires that were Suicide Squad and BvS may be worse but in and of itself Wonder Woman just isn't worth your time or money.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"An over-hyped movie, much too predictable","I really don't understand all the hype that surrounds this particular movie. I had pretty high expectations for it and was quite disappointed when I actually got to see it. The only good thing that the movie had going for it was the film score and the cinematography. But if you look at the story line the movie is extremely one-dimensional. There is no real plot and almost no character development, literally. So, there's not much substance to all these high praises that this movie managed to accumulate. It seems.But just to be perfectly clear about it; this movie felt like feminist propaganda. And when I'm saying feminist I'm not referring to the textbook definition of feminism but rather the now established cult of man-hating individuals. As an egalitarian I can totally get behind the ""third wave of feminism"", which has very little in common with today's feminism. But I digress. The reason why I believe this to be the aforementioned type of propaganda is pretty simple to deduce; the protagonist is female, morally superior and virtually invincible (at no point during the movie was the life of the protagonist in any real danger*). Meanwhile all the men are portrayed as ""horny"", dumb, ""needlessly"" violent, expendable, and anything but virtuous. With the sole exception of the other protagonist (aka the ""crashed pilot"") who I'd dare to call a ""token man"" because of what fate awaits him during the end segment of the movie. I don't know about you but I call this very bad story telling. Ideally one should try to make every character just a little bit flawed (even the protagonist), otherwise the whole story just feels like literal propaganda. The writers intent clearly bleeds into the script in this particular case. One would have to be blind to not see that.*just to elaborate on the point that I made earlier: the protagonist was never in any situation that one could describe as ""dangerous"". She was clearly overpowered, and just to take the point home; the movie literally starts out with a scene from the end segment of another movie ""Batman Vs Superman"", which literally tells us that no matter what happens in this movie, at the end she'll make it out alive with a memento of a war (the photo). So that scene right there pretty much summarizes half of the movie, no pun intended.To conclude: I feel really saddened. Not by the fact that the movie was rather mediocre but by the fact that most people don't even realize it. That's the real tragedy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent movie,"After the big surprise that gave me Wonder Woman in Batman V Superman,  again comes a surprise with her individual film. An incredible plot,  entertaining from the first moment. Gal Gadot was born to play Wonder  Woman, her performance was excellent, I love her! And Chris Pine as  Steve Trevor loved it. The rest of the cast excellent. Special effects,  soundtrack, costumes, and 3D, the best I've seen for years. Every  action scene is amazing, I was surprised. It is a film with love, very  exciting, inspiring and the best that made DC Comics that never failed  me.

BIG improvement at the DCEU movies...,"When i first walk into the theater to watch this movie, i don't have that much of a high expectation. I'm pretty much avoiding a mistake that i already have made back then when i watched batman v superman: dawn of justice and suicide squad , and yet left me disappointed. but wonder woman is actually pretty good!I think DC evolve much, i think they learn from their previous mistake that they make such serious, dark, but unenjoyable movie. i could see how much effort to make Wonder woman to have dark serious tone yet still being enjoyable, heart warming, and pretty funny . i still have my comments though, on this matter which i will discuss later. The characters itself are very interesting. before i watched the film, i thought that the character wonder woman is going to be a marry sue (a character who doesn't face any challenges and is good at anything, which i despise). but, thankfully, she doesn't. wonder woman a.k.a Diana has her strengths that make her stands out, yet also has weaknesses that sometimes push her away from achieving her goals in the movie, which makes a good main character development. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine might me the highlight of the movie since i think without their chemistry and also performance the movie wouldn't be as well as it is. their relationship in the film, although a bit cheesy, is what makes the movie more realistic and emotional. the fight scenes are also very fun and action-packed.However, This film's not a masterpiece. it still has things i didn't like and sometimes take me away from the movie. first, the humor. as i said before, i appreciate that DC tries to be more fun with light-hearted comedy, but sometimes i felt as if they stretch a joke too long, that turns chuckles into a cringe. like, OK we get it it's funny now can we move on? second, some lines are also very cheesy. third, pacing. sometimes i felt as if this movie is going too slow yet too fast at the same time. at times i would question a character's motivation because i didn't understand their character very well, which leads into the fourth, the story telling. i know how i mentioned how i love the way that diana and steve character's developed, but as they centered on both of them too much, they as if forget the side characters. side characters are not as important as the main characters but still has their own uses in the plot and the main character motives as well. i felt some characters are so pushed out and forced, that i'm not even feeling sympathetic towards them, which is pretty dull sometimes that i don't feel as emotional the movie wants me to be, and fifth and last, is the CGI. i don't have much to say on this, rather than it's pretty acceptable, but sometimes it takes me away from the movie a little. although, some landscape shots at the beginning of the movie showing themyscira is gorgeous and eye- candy.in conclusion, even with its flaws, i recommend you to watch wonder woman, a movie i would hopefully call a kick-starter for great movies at DCEU at the future!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wonderful Woman,"This review of Wonder Woman is spoiler free**** (4/5)THERE'S A SAYING, a metaphor perhaps that states if a series or a distributor starts with a few false starts in previous instalments then the hype for the next instalment will dwindle, this, of course is true for other series' of films but for the DCEU it clearly isn't. There have been a few false starts for the series, Man of Steel didn't live to expectation nor Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice wasn't as good as was previously thought then Suicide Squad fell into the world of shame rather than live up to what it said on the tin. It seem the DCEU was in need of a saviour, at first this saviour came from a meme ‚Äì this had a bruised Batman and tired Superman fighting in an endless war, then beyond that shadow stands Gal Gadot's Diana ‚Äì perhaps the saviour of BvS.After Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman the metaphor loses its sight, and goes into turmoil, in the opening few minutes there's colour, a narration that explains the comings of war between gods and humans and a young Diana Prince (exceptional work from youngster Lilly Aspell) willing to train for a coming war. Her mother (Robin Wright) explains that there is no need to do this ‚Äì after this the origin of the princess progresses to when she is all grown up and has become a trained warrior. The opening origin story is exceptional there's a lot colour which we haven't seen in previous instalments, there's stunning story narration and a wonderful shot of Gadot's Diana training with her auntie (Connie Nielsen) the best fighter on the island. An island inhabited by women until a manly presence invades their homeland enter American spy Captain Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), he speaks of an ongoing war in the outer world. When he's teamed with Gadot their chemistry is magnificent these two work well together and prove to be the dynamic that we need.Pine is exceptional as Steve, he's funny, he's handsome, and he's a charmer who does anything to please our heroine. Diana who's never seen a man before is wonderful to behold especially when she tells Steve about where she comes from. She wants to go with him to go fight the ongoing war ‚Äì meanwhile villainous doctor, Dr. Poison (Elana Anaya) and her warmongering companion Ludendorff (Danny Huston) design dangerous weapons to outfit their soldiers. It's a wonderful story of war and super heroism a mach that never made a keen pairing before but now-a-days it works. It's dark but constantly dark and brooding as the previous films, something that the earlier DCEU intended to rely on Wonder Woman proves that you don't need to be dark to be good.And she does her job well, as Diana Gadot is fantastic she's a beautiful princess who loves the world of men and believes that life has a meaning, as her stronger alter ego she's exceptional, she's strong but on the inside she's vulnerable, unlike the caped crusaders or the men of steel she's not afraid to show emotion and the other wonder woman helming her director Jenkins shows this with exquisite style. Diana was the saviour in BvS, here she proves to be the saviour again who takes no BS. And Jenkins proves that a DC movie can have style too ‚Äì she adds a lot of elements here that makes this super-human feel more human as said she adds emotion there are other elements too the vulnerability makes her a more connectable superhero it proves strength in the female superhero line.Sadly it's not wonderful, in the last 20 minutes it hits a clich√© cg barrier that other superhero movies seem to rely on now-a-days, there are some moments that look they're made from green screen and sadly doesn't make it as good as it could've been. Other than that everything here delivers exceptionally well Jenkins proves that could teach the caped crusaders or men of steel a thing or two with this instalment, it's she's brought new light to the DCEU and it's about damn time.VERDICT: After a few false starts to the DCEU it finally has a success in fantastic style that hits punches with brilliant execution and fabulous performances this is perhaps the best instalment to the DCEU ever, now we can breathe again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"I enjoyed the cinematography, story line and of course Gail Gadot as Wonder Woman","I think the producers are at least 28 years late in finally introducing a female lead as their heroine who would be capable of carrying a huge blockbuster action/adventure film by herself. No disrespect to male co star Chris Pine who plays Steve Trevor who himself is trying to save the world from destruction by the Germans, but Gal Gadot kicks butt and brings to her audience a believable female action heroine who certainly shows by her actions that she does not need a man by her side to save her in distress.I really enjoyed the cinematography, as well as the musical score which had great synchronization with the non stop action displayed on the screen. The colour throughout the film was dynamic and crisp and I would put my money down that if Gal Gadot had not been just four (4) years old when Michael Keaton was first presented on the big screen as the Batman back in 1989, we would have in fact had a female action heroine winning over Batman at the box office back in 1989.Congratulations to the women's movement and to all those pre-teens who will try and emulate Diana the Wonder Woman as they grow into adulthood. The day will come maybe in my lifetime when the next Mixed Martial Arts Champion such as Conor McGregor or boxing champion such as Floyd Mayweather when asked who their idol was growing up and their response is Wonder Woman. There will come a time when women will become equal to men in almost every way, including as heroes to emulate, and boys will emulate strong film characters as Wonder Woman. The proof will come when women get paid equal or better than men in Hollywood based on their box office draw and not by their sex.I am a proud man and I congratulate Wonder Woman for the strong message it sends to all its audience. My only dislike was there was a bit too much CGI (Computer-generated imagery) during some of the extended action scenes which should have been edited down. Sometimes too much...is simply too much (CGI). I give the film a sound 7 out of 10 rating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Enjoyable,"This film tells the story of a British spy, who is saved by a princess on an island with only female warriors. Together they fight against evil forces drives the great war, hoping to stop the war and save innocent lives.""Wonder Woman"" is a fantasy tale, telling how a super heroine stops the great war by personally going to the front and fight. I find Gal Gadot very apt as the heroine. She is attractive but still has a fierce and formidable feel to her. The story is a little slow, and it could be edited down by a lot especially in the beginning of the film. The romance subplot distracts rather than adds, but that's just my opinion. There is a good climax, which I think is too short. It could have been lengthened and still remains thrilling.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Yawn,"If you are going to see this movie take a cut lunch with you as it is LONG! And boring in parts. They spent way too much time on the back story and one assumes that was because they are planning sequels. The movie could lose 40 minutes without damaging the story line. With any of these block buster type Super hero movies I am left with the definite impression many of the ""reviewers"" on IMDb are either studio plants or have not seen the actual movie and base their votes on Trailers. Much of the final scenes was over bloated and unnecessary and did not add anything to the story. Gadot was outstanding in the title role. Chris Pine looks, as he always does, on the verge of tears or a breakdown or something. I don't rate him as an actor. Supporting cast were good.

Among the Bests,"Wow Wonder Woman just blew me away. The casting was great especially Gal Gadot, Cris Pine, Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen. And also, the decision to use WW1 backdrop and how well it was portrayed was just perfect.The movie has a raw feel to it which makes it extra special. Not a moment will go by where you'll think they tried too hard to fit in the humor, it all comes as natural as natural can be. There is a lot of little moments in the movie that can be appreciated like for example the dancing in midst of war, the romance between Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor. Moreover, the action alone can be a driving factor, which makes me want to watch this movie again and again. Its one like, that we've never seen before.Yes, this movie is not perfect, it has few, a few CGI issues which I think all big action movies have in common (including Marvel movies as well), however, with Wonder Woman its handled really well.I honestly appreciate the hard work and passion that went behind making this movie possible.

Beyond (Gender) Expectations,"The moment Diana Prince took her first spear tackle at evil in Batman Vs Superman threw a gauntlet at the feet of an entire generation of older movie-goers who's lingering impression of Wonder Woman was a soft, curvaceous and inherently feminine Linda Carter of the seventies. Spinning magic girl transformations have been replaced with a monstrous power that frankly woke me up in my seat. She was my lingering impression and my first taste of a DC that left me wanting more.The Wonder Woman role has big shoes to fill and sadly the shoes themselves will give her a scrutiny male counterparts are not burdened with. Will they be sensible shoes, combat boots or heels? Gal Gadot's counter-argument is a role that is strong, personal and honest. Her tremendous power is counterbalanced with a naivety that reaches beyond comic relief into an often scathing critique of the human leanings toward inhumanity. She reminds us of a bigger picture by becoming a passionate observer of our frailty and in doing so, often exposes her own while retaining all of her strength. In this regard the role of Wonder Woman is an unprecedented success as she struggles to find herself as a person rather than her role as a female superhero.Although aspects of female gender roles are present they develop in other characters. The mother, the amazon, the witch, the submissive - all present as people rather than stereotypes and the roster of strong performances delivers with a confidence that define these women with substance and a dignified strength while avoiding becoming lessons or cautionary tales in femininity.I feel it as important to note that the male characters in this movie also avoid the same gender stereotypes. The men who marginalize her share the same disregard for all life. The men who initially sought to protect her - as we are taught to by our mothers and sisters - quickly fall behind her and support her strength. She is never forced to explain herself.In a genre filled with movies about other movies or stories that build momentum for bigger stories to come it's refreshing to see a movie that delivers a strong tale, genuinely warm characters and manages to embarrass us with the lesson that genuinely strong and honest characters make our gender expectations irrelevant.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Exactly the type of movie that the DC Universe has needed for some time,"Wonder Woman is a superhero film starring Gal Gadot in the title role and the fourth installment in the DC Extended Universe. Directed by Patty Jenkins (2003's Monster), the film not only redeems the DC Universe of some of its previous missteps, but also breathes some new life into the superhero franchise as a whole.In 1918, the Amazonian princess Diana (Gal Gadot) trains with her fellow warrior sisters on the isolated island nation of Themyscira. One day, an American pilot named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash lands near the island. After being rescued by Diana, Steve tells her and the other Amazonians of the outside world and of a ""war to end all wars"" currently being waged by the human race. Refusing to allow the death and carnage to continue, Diana decides to leave with Steve and fight alongside him to hopefully put a stop to the evil people responsible for this war.Featuring a well paced plot and some creatively choreographed action scenes, Wonder Woman is exactly the type of movie that the DC Universe has needed for some time, considering some of the poor creative decisions that were made in its three predecessors. There was also a good balance of humour scattered throughout the story, very much in the vein of some Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, but never so much that it feels forced and tacked on at the last minute. Gal Gadot's performance in the eponymous role is great, her acting range has improved significantly since Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. My only real complaint is that the film does follow a typical ""superhero origin story"" format and does little to detract from that. However, considering how interesting the main character is, this does not draw away too much enjoyment from the overall film.I rate it 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I wonder ... Woman,"Not me of course, though I do admit I was wondering if this was going to be any good. DC did not have the best record concerning building up their universe, so skepticism was not really out of the ordinary. But the movie proved me wrong and made a lot of things right. And it's really nice that it's the Wonder Woman movie to kick off that trend. I know some will either cherish that and others will hate it - just try to leave the feminism discussion out of it.And enjoy a movie that really captures the making of a superhero. Wonder Woman rising in the best sense. There still are some hurdles that are tough to overcome. The main villain for example has his issues, but for every thing that may not work 100% you have twice or three times as many other things that are really good. Take Chris Pine for example: I wasn't sure if this was necessary casting ... but it very much was. You needed someone who could hold his own. And Gal Gadot really is amazing in this. Looks and beauty aside, she really pulled her weight acting wise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
wonderful woman,to start with performance Gal Gadot & Chris Pine really looking nice together. Movie starts with proper introduction and with simplicity which is expected. Those who think it is feminine movie they are wrong. Compared to captain America this movie is one step behind.

"Finally, a brilliant spectacle that doesn't rely on the spectacle alone!","Having become mightily bored by the glut of formulaic American super hero movies, with their incoherent plots, appalling dialogue, and suspect morality, only ever partially redeemed by their creative visuals and incredible special effects, I had no desire to subject myself to yet another. But the weather was so hot today I whisked my ten year old nephew to the only 'family' movie in our local air conditioned cinema. Immediately this new world was a visual treat, and the necessary background to WW unfolded like a Greek myth. A few hints of the Amazonian women swaggering like chaps in their training camp, and a couple of corny lines from WW love interest Chris Pine delivered in the expository style early on started to eat away at my disbelief, but these minor grumbles didn't portend and the movie grew in drama, spectacle, tension and intensity. My young companion turned to me saying 'this movie is amazing', and I agree. Gal Gadot and Pine are both credible actors (it's not his fault he's too pretty to be a 'real' hero) and they are well served by an above average script (especially for this kind of movie). David Threwlis brings serious acting chops to the table as expected, but the revelation is Lucy Davis, whose comedic sidekick could carry a show of her own. The audience loved her, and laughed along at every nuance. Her charisma bounced out of the screen and reminded me of the superb character actors of the old studios in the decades before the end of that system; e.g. Eve Arden, Margaret Rutherford, Mary Wickes, Joan Blondell et al. Stardom awaits. I won't overplay the feminist/girl power angles, but if my ten year old nephew loved it as he did, then I can confidently say most young boys will too. Drag them there, the girls too!

What was the big deal?,"I admit when people rave about a movie, it usually means I'll hate it, but when my sister convinced me to see it because it was an origin story, I was like 'ok'. It was SO BORING. First of all, it was tooted as this big feminist film, which It was not. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm a hopeless romantic and this is not necessarily a bad thing. But if your intention is to empower women and the best thing about the film is the romance between steve and Diana, you went wrong somewhere. I had absolutely no interest in any of the plot and basically suffered through all the war scenes.

Wonderful!,"Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is strong, intelligent, charismatic, funny, compassionate, fierce, courageous, empathetic, and somehow still relatable. She's everything we need today in super hero - hopeful and strong. While the movie itself has some clunky points (especially the CGI at the end), Gadot's performance is everything I could have hoped for in Wonder Woman. As a life-long WW fan, I had my concerns about how this would come off, but she's perfection! I hope she's able to continue in the Role. I have a 7-year-old daughter, and I'm thankful to have a role Godot's wonder woman for her to look up to, the way I looked up to Superman as a boy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Wonder Woman the Character is better than Wonder Woman the film,"Most movies on this website's top 250 films are adaptions, be it a novel or a comic book or even another film. I am not a reader and never read comic books growing up so I am not biased when I watch adaptations which I strongly feel is one of the reasons Wonder Woman has 8.3/10 here and 93% on rotten tomatoes. If Wonder Woman was a spec script this film would not be trending. Until this film Angelina Jolie was the highest earning action Heroine at the US box office with Lara Croft (2001) $131 million. She also managed $118 million with Salt (2010). Scarlett Johanson achieved $126 million with Lucy (2014) and no other actress had been able to carry an action film entirely alone. Hunger games, Star Wars, Divergent and Terminator don't qualify because the male opposite were just as strong.The other reason is that this film is directed by a Female. People love this film because it is the first time a Female director has worked with a big budget like this. $150 million. It has been long time coming. I hope female representation will improve from here on and it seems so because Ava Duvernay also achieved a milestone by becoming the first Black female director to direct an upcoming $100 million film also becoming the third overall behind Katherine Bigelow who did K-9 (2002) for $100 million.I give this film 6/10 because there is nothing groundbreaking like Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight. Its actually half that. Wonder Woman is just another superhero popcorn film whose Lead has an accent giving further evidence that Jews runs the World lol. Wonder Woman is played by Gal Gadot who I think is responsible for the financial success not the story or the CGI. She is genuinely funny, sexy and a great actor. I bet She and Chris Pine who plays the male lead will win the Best Duo at the 2018 MTV movie awards. As for Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen whose names are also on the poster they don't make it past the first ten minutes of the film which is fraud because I love Robin Wright.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Wonder Woman is not just the summer's best movie but one of the best superhero movies ever!,"Cue that awesome theme music! Gal Gadot plays Diana, Princess of Themyscira, and daughter of Hippolyta. Best known as Wonder Woman.And by god she kills it in this. Wonder Woman is not merely the best installment of the DCEU so far but it's probably the best DC movie since the Dark Knight trilogy. Wonder Woman is also one of the most entertaining superhero debuts since the first Guardians of the Galaxy. On top of that, there is finally an excellent movie to set the benchmark for future superhero movies about a female hero.Director Patty Jenkins transports audiences to Paradise Island where Amazon warrior women are tasked to defend mankind from the vengeful Ares, the Greek god of war. Their ruler's daughter Diana is kindhearted, brave, compassionate, and courageous. She rescues a dashing spy named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) who informs her people about a greater conflict we know to be World War One. She is appalled by the destruction and onslaught so without question she sets out on a quest to end it.Gal Gadot is the beautiful beating heart of this movie and perfectly cast as Wonder Woman. She's charismatic and authoritative but not so much that she loses her feminine charm and sense of humor. Yes a DC character being funny! Imagine that! Chris Pine is the love interest/sidekick who could honestly serve as the lead of his own adventure movie. Pine is factory built for these types of tough but clever action roles. His chemistry with Gadot is the best romance in a superhero movie since probably the original Spider-Man movies. The supporting cast is a strong one. Connie Nielsen is dignified as the Queen, Robin Wright is her steely lieutenant, Danny Huston is a slimy Nazi-by-another-name, Elena Anaya is her creepy henchwoman, and Lucy Davis plays the comic relief.The movie uses the wartime setting to its advantage. No Man's Land becomes Diana Prince's debut as Wonder Woman. German infantry fight Amazons on horseback. Later the finale boils down to a god versus another god. And yes they use the Lasso of Truth. It's so cool! The timing of this movie couldn't be better. It works splendidly as a summer blockbuster at the very least. But it gives hope to female viewers young and old that women can be heroes too. It gives male viewers a chance to see a true ideal feminist hero in action. It also redresses for the mistakes made in the previous installments of the DCEU and honestly makes me more excited for Justice League",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good for Comic Fans, Painful for Historians","Wonder Woman (2017) is the best DCEU film since the Dark Knight Rises. Having said that, it is not great but it is a good comic movie that will satisfy 2 hours. It's not as good as the Nolan films but not nearly as bad as the other recent DC movies. The acting from the leads is solid. As a lifelong Wonder Woman fan, Gal Gadot is my new favorite Wonder Woman by far. She's not perfect acting-wise, but her beauty, confidence and strength sells it. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor is believable and you care about him. The story is simple (bad guy wants to destroy humanity and the heroes stop him) but very focused. The comedy is a lot similar to Thor's but still enjoyable and does its own thing.With all that said, my main issues with the film are with some of the characters (and how they are driven) and the time capsule of the film. Wonder Woman is great but for much of the film, she often feels like a supporting character in her own movie. While not intentional, Trevor is the one that drives the plot and kind of takes over the film. While I like his character, the film is called 'Wonder Woman'. She should've been allowed to make some more decisions for herself. I also want to add that the side characters are passable but could've been better. I honestly didn't really remember them after the movie was over.My other issue is the film being set during WWI. The comics are set during WWII. This made sense since the Nazis ideologies were evil and this was when chemicals were really being advanced (Holocaust anyone?). WWI was a lot more politically complex and was basically the clash of empires. No side was completely innocent. I get this is just for entertainment but, as someone with a history degree, it is distracting. Captain America: the First Avenger worked well with WWII and think Wonder Woman would've made more sense too in that time period. I mean the Germans they're describing are Nazis, not Kaiser imperial soldiers. The film just felt more WWII-ish than WWI. Watch War Horse (2011) to compare. I just wonder (haha) what happened when WWII started for Diana. I guess that was just ""Ares"" too and that'll be the sequel? If so, then what will have been the point in this film or Trevor's fate?There is not much else to comment on. The film looked really good, even beautiful at times. The music was pretty forgettable (no memorable theme that Wonder Woman deserves).Overall, I give the film a B-. It wasn't great but wasn't bad either. I think it is a step in the right direction for DC. I would recommend the film for at least one viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not wonderful, but better than anything else in the DCEU.","Well, it's finally here. I think it's safe to say that this is one of the more anticipated superhero releases of the last decade, which makes it all the more unfortunate that it had to play within the boundaries of the DC Extended Universe, of which it is the fourth entry. It should be stated up-front that while Wonder Woman is not quite good enough to affect the overall quality of the franchise in any meaningful way, it is certainly better than any of the three films preceding it. The DCEU is on a steady climb upwards; let's hope they don't plateau any time soon.Our framing device sees the Amazing Amazon, in modern-day Paris, receive a photograph from Batman, along with a note asking to one day hear her story. This story begins with her childhood on the Amazonian island Themyscira (there actually is a cute little Paradise Island reference in there, too), her development into a warrior princess and her eventual meeting with the pilot Steve Trevor, who crash-lands into the ocean nearby. After hearing about the Great War, Diana determines that Ares must be behind it and resolves to return to the world of mankind with Trevor in order to vanquish the God of War.The fish-out-of-water elements work greatly, not only in terms of the larger cities and groups of people but also in more intimate settings between Diana and Trevor. The clash of cultures is as thought- provoking as it is hilarious, and these scenes were a great way to let the audience catch a breath between action sequences without getting bored.Because boring, this film is not. At times it can be frustrating, illogical, incoherent and just plain sloppy, but it's never boring. An example of the sloppiness can be found when Trevor refers to the War as ""The War to End All Wars"", before Diana and her mother exit the room and Diana says ""You heard him, mother! He called it 'A War Without End!'"". That's just lazy.The CGI isn't great, and this is especially noticeable in a few scenes where someone falls or leaps from a great height. There's one particularly glaring example where a character is shot in slow- motion, and it's not at all convincing. The music was good, though I was a little disappointed that Wonder Woman's main theme from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was used so sparingly. I actually thought that was a big highlight of that movie's score, and was hoping to hear it play over the more badass moments (like when Wonder Woman fights a bunch of bad guys with her lasso; that was excellent!)Where it all fell apart more for me was towards the end. Wonder Woman is sure that Ares is behind the Great War, while Trevor insists that mankind just sucks. Let it suffice to say that the filmmakers attempt to have it both ways, and the result makes little sense. There is also a stupidly pointless death that completely took me out of the film.And so, while it's not a bad movie, the DCEU is still yet to give us a good one. Wonder Woman is probably on par with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the rival MCU's latest film, so at this stage it appears that Fox's Logan is, for now, still the best superhero film of the year. If the DCEU follows its current trend, though, November's Justice League should be an enjoyable watch.Oh, and Wonder Woman is also apparently telekinetic, now, stopping metal with her mind. Considering she already has her bracelets and shockwaves to accomplish the same feat, this felt out of place.http://alexfalzon.com/wonder-woman/ - for more reviews.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Wonder Woman""- Not only the first truly good film for the DCEU, but just a darned fun movie on its own right!","If there was one thought to streak across my mind throughout the entire run-time of director Patty Jenkins' long-awaited cinematic adaptation of the iconic comic-book character ""Wonder Woman"", it's a simple word... redemption. This is the first film in DC's struggling Extended Universe to live up to the promise of its comic-book origins. There have been hints at brilliance here and there, but the three previously released films have all ultimately faltered and fallen flat due to their own numerous issues and contrivances and infuriating focus on convoluted style over substance. Not so with ""Wonder Woman""... this is the first film in the entire series that places all of it's focus on delivering a charming, thrilling and entertaining film foremost, where the style is dictated by the story, and not the other way around.If you've grown tired of waiting for the next great DC cinematic adventure. If like me and many others, previous releases like ""Batman V Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"" left you feeling empty and angry and underwhelmed. If you were worried that the DCEU would just be a constant exercise in misery and tedium... your hopes for something better- something good- have been fulfilled with the absolutely delightful ""Wonder Woman."" It's not a perfect film, mind you. It's uneven at times and suffers the same one-dimensional villains that have plagued the similar Marvel Cinematic Universe. But it is a promise of better things to come in the future, and is not only by and far the best the DCEU has to offer at this point... it's just a darned good film in its own right.On the island of Themyscira, Diana (Gal Gadot) lives in peace, princess of a tribe of Amazon warriors created by the great Greek Gods to protect humanity from the clutches of Ares- God of War. However, the human world soon enough intrudes on Diana's idyllic life when American Spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash-lands near her home and she and the other Amazon warriors are told of the ""Great War"" that is taking place- World War I. Diana goes against her mother's wishes and leaves the island with Steve, hoping that in helping him on his mission to stop a deadly chemical attack by the German army, she will be able to confront Ares and put an end to all war. But at what cost will her daring mission come?The great success of ""Wonder Woman"" comes in large part from its simplicity and keen storytelling. It doesn't venture into needlessly lofty and overstuffed (and half-baked) themes and sequel-baiting as has been the case with previous installments of the DC franchise, but instead just tries its hardest to be a competent, concise and entertaining origin story. And that's why it succeeds. Director Jenkins and screenwriter Allan Heinberg smartly concentrate on the fundamentals of character establishment and development above all else, while also giving the film a great deal more personality than has been evident in previous films. With razor-sharp writing, top-notch action set pieces and a constant and appropriate sense of humor that keeps the chuckles coming, you'd be hard pressed not to find yourself grinning ear-to- ear throughout the entire film.The cast is also just a ton of fun. Gadot was by and far the best element in the otherwise sloppy ""Batman V Superman"", but she wasn't given much to do. Here, she absolutely shines and proves herself more than worthy to call herself ""Wonder Woman."" She's got the dramatic chops to handle the heavier moments, the light-hearted whimsy to perfectly land the film's many delightful ""fish out of water"" gags... and she just kicks major butt! I can't wait to see her again on the big-screen. I also quite enjoyed Pine in his supporting role. It's a bit of a standard character, but he gives it the same wonderful personality he's injected to so many other roles. And supporting parts played by the likes of Robin Wright, Connie Nielsen and Sa√Ød Taghmaoui are all exceptionally well-cast and performed.This praise all being said, the film does have some rather large issues that I feel are being generally overlooked. Especially with the film being as hyped up and over-politicized as it has been. Funnily enough, the film suffers a major issue that also desperately plagues many films of their rival studio Marvel- the villains are weak. Pathetic even. Despite having the delightful duo of Danny Huston and Elena Anaya portraying them, the villainous Erich Ludendorff and ""Doctor Poison"" are frankly laughable at times, coming off as so stock as to be ridiculous. At times they even feel like they're in a completely different (and far inferior) film. I know I can't be the only one to cringe when they repeatedly use the old trope of ""villain kills an associate to show he's a threat"" several times to increasingly hilarious results. In addition, the film is a bit uneven as it reaches its midway point, with several key characters from the first act seemingly vanishing and some plot-threads being abandoned for prolonged periods of time. It's a bit distracting. You know the film is capable of so much more.But despite these complaints, I can't help but whole-heartedly recommend ""Wonder Woman."" It's just such a breath of fresh air for this particular franchise thanks to its smart filmmaking and fantastic performances. I was worried before the film came out. Because I will fully admit I have not enjoyed a single other film in the DC Extended Universe to this point, and I was fearing that ""Wonder Woman"" would deal one last fatal blow to the franchise. But it did just the opposite... it revitalized it in the best of ways. And I would favorably compare it to other great superhero origins of the past 10 years, and say it's one of my favorite Summer action films of 2017 thus far.""Wonder Woman"" gets a very good 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

They say they made mustard gas with Hydrogen, which should do nothing to gasmaskes, and differently not break glas. Most chemical weapons react on skin too, so there really is no reason to break the mask at the WW1 level of tech, and differently not if the target is London, which again would not make the English surrender in the war as most of the troops are already at the front at this time. The bomber that has to deliver the weapons are actually more of a ""super weapon"", in this point of time anyway.All in all it feels like they have watch Captain America, added a little more sex, took out the humor, switch the weapon with gas and bad guy with a God, that is stronger than all the Gods combined, but weak against lightning from Wonder Women that he himself just trowed.....",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"An over-hyped movie, much too predictable:","I really don't understand all the hype that surrounds this particular movie. I had pretty high expectations for it and was quite disappointed when I actually got to see it. The only good thing that the movie had going for it was the film score and the cinematography. But if you look at the story line the movie is extremely one-dimensional. There is no real plot and almost no character development, literally. So, there's not much substance to all these high praises that this movie managed to accumulate. It seems.But just to be perfectly clear about it; this movie felt like feminist propaganda. And when I'm saying feminist I'm not referring to the textbook definition of feminism but rather the now established cult of man-hating individuals. As an egalitarian I can totally get behind the ""third wave of feminism"", which has very little in common with today's feminism. But I digress. The reason why I believe this to be the aforementioned type of propaganda is pretty simple to deduce; the protagonist is female, morally superior and virtually invincible (at no point during the movie was the life of the protagonist in any real danger*). Meanwhile all the men are portrayed as ""horny"", dumb, ""needlessly"" violent, expendable, and anything but virtuous. With the sole exception of the other protagonist (aka the ""crashed pilot"") who I'd dare to call a ""token man"" because of what fate awaits him during the end segment of the movie. I don't know about you but I call this very bad story telling. Ideally one should try to make every character just a little bit flawed (even the protagonist), otherwise the whole story just feels like literal propaganda. The writers intent clearly bleeds into the script in this particular case. One would have to be blind to not see that.just to elaborate on the point that I made earlier: the protagonist was never in any situation that one could describe as ""dangerous"". She was clearly overpowered, and just to take the point home; the movie literally starts out with a scene from the end segment of another movie ""Batman Vs Superman"", which literally tells us that no matter what happens in this movie, at the end she'll make it out alive with a memento of a war (the photo). So that scene right there pretty much summarizes half of the movie, no pun intended.To conclude: I feel really saddened. Not by the fact that the movie was rather mediocre but by the fact that most people don't even realize it. That's the real tragedy.Final verdict: watchable, but don't believe the hype. It's not ""that"" good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"i mean,,,, its okay",i did like this movie. i was entertained and i liked certain aspects of it for sure. is it a good movie? yes it is. is it a great movie? no it isn't. though the high rotten tomatoes rating suggests its a masterpiece it is far from that sadly. i think it had the potential to be great but due to the lack of continuity this movie had it struggled to reach its full potential. it is the best DCU movie by far but honestly thats really not saying much. wonder woman is a let down on all parts which is a real shame. this shows that justice league will probably be no better,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the Best Superhero Adventure,"""Wonder Woman"" is certainly one of the best (if not THE BEST) superhero adventure recently released by the cinema industry. The film is a comic book on the big screen, with a very well written screenplay and a very attractive and full of action story. The cast is fantastic and Gal Gadot and Chris Pine show a wonderful chemistry with their never boring romance. The beauty of the charming Gal Gadot is exotic and sexy she really ""steals the show"" with her perfect performance. The top-notch special effects is state-of-art and impressive. The direction of Patty Jenkins surprises since this is her first blockbuster work. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Mulher Maravilha"" (""Wonder Woman"")",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not a movie for the boys,"Interesting reading the comments for this movie. I would guess that most of the negative ""reviews"" are from males in the 18-to-28-year-old demographic who have been weaned on the vast catalogue of male-dominated action-hero films and the increasingly violent video games of the last couple of decades. I suspect also that these ""reviewers"" are not so much disappointed with the movie but more likely threatened by the idea of a woman - and an exceptionally attractive one at that - being the heroine.As a male in my 50s, and one who grew up with hundreds of comic books - Wonder Woman, Superman, Batman, etc - this movie is far closer to my idea of how WW should be treated that certainly the 80s eye-candy that was the TV show. I mean, what do you boys want?!Aside from the odd movie like ""Kill Bill"" and ""Lara Croft"", I can't think of many others where a woman gets to play the hero centre-stage. Yes, there are many flaws with the movie - if you want to nit-pick every single stupid little thing - and guess what? This applies to practically every movie out there. But the fight sequences alone - the choreography and the fact that you can actually see the action (not close-in shots to mask the inadequacy of the actors/directors) - make the movie well worth it.The boys that rate this movie negatively would probably have been far happier with a male director (instead of female), one who perhaps wouldn't have given Gal Gadot as much breadth to threaten the male-dominated super-hero world.This movie is a breath of fresh air in an increasingly confusing and overdone series of super-hero universes. I would love to see a version with a script written by a woman.If you haven't seen this movie yet, and as with any movie anyway, ignore the negative criticism and make your own mind up. I have four daughters and they loved (most of) this movie, and actually found it inspirational. These days, and in this world, anything that inspires my girls gets my nod. Good job, Gal.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My favourite film,"I love this film, an absolute must-watch for everyone. Nothing compares within the genre (or outside of it in my opinion). Everyone involved deserves great credit for this film, but I want to give special credit to Gal Gadot (all the actors are great, but she completely embodies the character in a manner rarely seen) and Zack Snyder, who not everyone realises was responsible for casting Gal Gadot in the first place. The director Patty Jenkins deserves a special mention for an oustanding job including apparently having to fight to keep what is my favourite scene from the movie. Again, everyone involved deserves credit, but I can't mention everyone here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The BEST DC movie yet!,"DC has finally done what fans were hoping for throughout its choppy film history: to produce a quality superhero film that can rival the juggernaut that is Marvel Studios. Wonder Woman has achieved this by following the same formula that Marvel Studios has used in nearly every single one of its movies - it may be old and we may bemoan watching yet another superhero movie with the same formula, but lets face it...it works. And works it does in Wonder Woman, providing nothing new and exciting, but resulting in an entertaining MÃ∂aÃ∂rÃ∂vÃ∂eÃ∂lÃ∂ DC film nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
WB & DC Comics finally gets it right !!,"What were Warner Bros and DC comics smoking when they decided to make Batman vs Superman and Suicide Squad? Or what were they smoking when they decided to release Wonder Woman (WW) before Justice League?Whatever they were smoking, the latter was the better stuff because the only word I can think off describing this movie is fantastic !! Yup !!The previous two releases with huge star casts and big budget action sequences were to be told in truth plain boring. WW is like the monsoon in India, refreshing and entertaining.To be frank, there is nothing new in WW if you scratch the surface. It is the coming of age of person who has superpowers and fights a villain to protect the world, a sample template of all superhero films.But WW is different because the superhero is a woman and that where Patty Jenkins and the writers catch our attention and surprise us. When was the last time we saw a movie completely dedicated to woman superhero??They get most of things perfect from the word go. Amazons, the place where WW is born and belongs to is visually mind blowing and beautiful. The warrior women star cast is perfect with Nelson and Wright perfectly playing Diana's mother and aunt. Special mention to Wright who is terrific in action sequences inspite of her age.And then comes Chris Pine who is so happy to play second fiddle to WW. He is the catalyst and the wow factor for women audience. He and WW share a fabulous chemistry on screen and have some nice comic moments too.The movie takes time to build up and the setting of WW One is prefect. And there is that one beautiful action set piece with WW taking on the Germans on the battlefield and single handedly destroying them. Perfect.And finally, there is Gal Gadot aka WW aka Diana. Gadot seems to have been born to play WW. She has the physique, the personality and the acting skills to play this role. I don't think any other actor would have done justice to this part. She is breath taking in the action sequences and what we saw of her in Batman vs Superman was just a trailer. She owns this role.The action sequences are good and the technically its a pretty neat film.However, the climax was tad disappointing and the villain was big let down. Thewlis is fine actor but not suited to play the villain. Plus the villain's role was poorly written. Even Dr. Maru's role was not well written and I hope to see more of her sometime in the future.But its still a great film and a must watch for movie buffs. If you are a woman you will love it as its all about women empowerment. For men, watching Gadot in short skirts beating the hell out of the bad guys is fulfilling.Can't wait for the sequel. he he he.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"For once, the DCEU did something right...and even fixed a common issue.","I was not excited for this film, especially since this would probably be nothing more but another dull female-led superhero movie. But not only did this exceed expectations, but it also SAVED its franchise from destruction.Wonder Woman is not only the best superhero movie of the year by far, but it's also the best female-led superhero movie out there. Thanks to several strengths, it's elevated by powerful writing that tells an engaging story, master-class visual effects, engaging action scenes, a cast of likable characters, and a positive message of female empowerment that actually WORKS. My best recommendation is that this is one of those films any superhero fan will enjoy, but this could also be for those who want something with good female empowerment in their lives. Just to give something good other than the crap we've gotten from 2017. Well, now Wonder Woman got her movie, now we just have to wonder who's next.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It is not what you deserve, but what you believe...","Right, well it was with some mixed anticipation that I went to watch ""Wonder Woman"" in the cinema this weekend. Why? Well, first of all, I am not overly keen on superhero movies, so I had no real incitement or drive for watching this. But then again, I had been told by several people that this was definitely an impressive movie, and one that was well worth the watch even for a non-superhero fan.I watched ""Wonder Woman"" in 3D in the cinema, which was completely pointless, because there were no outstanding or particularly impressive 3D scenes that made you go ""wow!"" So an ordinary 2D viewing of this movie is recommendable.I am somewhat familiar with Wonder Woman from the comic books that I read during my childhood, and also having seen a few episodes here and there from the mid-1970s TV show ""Wonder Woman"". So I didn't really have much of any expectations of what the movie had to deliver for it to be worthwhile.And I must say that I was actually impressed. For a superhero movie then ""Wonder Woman"" turned out to be at the higher end of the scale in terms of being entertaining and watchable.This was definitely Gal Gadot's movie through and through, because she carried the movie so well with her performance as Diana. She has a very charismatic demeanor and her on-screen appearance just demands attention from the audience. So I think that she has been very well cast for the role of Wonder Woman, and I think it will actually be nice to see her again in upcoming superhero movies.""Wonder Woman"" was a visual tour-de-force, and the special effects were impressive and worked very well in favor of the movie. Most of the time it felt like you were right there in the movie yourself, because of the believable special and visual effects. And it was an amazing visual experience to witness Diana run about on the World War II battlefield and take on the Nazis, especially when the scenes were spiced up by those impressive visual effects.And it should also be said that the camera work and cinematography in ""Wonder Woman"" really helped the movie to stand out as well. Lots of great visual presentation of the various scenes throughout the course of the entire movie.The cast in the movie was good, and aside from Gal Gadot, then I was more than impressed with the performances put on by Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Sa√Ød Taghmaoui, Ewen Bremner and Elena Anaya. Danny Huston was great in the villainous role of Ludendorff, and Elena Anaya really nailed the role of Dr. Maru. It was a shame that the Dr. Maru character weren't given more on-screen time, because that character had a lot of potential and could have proved so much more effective had the writers opted for more focus on her. However, the casting of Chris Pine was puzzling to me, because he will forever be Associated with a substitute captain Kirk from the ""Star Trek"" reboots.The characters found in the movie were well-rounded and quite nicely detailed and fleshed out on the screen. There was just about enough character development and growth for all characters to make them all matter and have importance to the storyline. However, some could have benefited more from having more on-screen time, of course.One thing that failed, aside from the offbeat and misplaced attempts of comedy, was the fact that the German's didn't speak German. That small feat and detail brings so much flavor and believably to the movie. So I was puzzled why they hadn't opted for that kind of authenticity.There were some misplaced attempts at bringing humor into the movie, which didn't sit well with me, and it stuck out like a sore thumb in comparison to the rest of the movie. For example, with the impressive feats and abilities that the Amazons showed, then why did Diana have such problems with a simple, rotating swing door? It was just a laughable attempt at comedy that should never have been in the final cut of the movie.I was genuinely entertained by ""Wonder Woman"", and I will say that director Patty Jenkins definitely stepped up to the task and delivered where it mattered and where it counted. Regardless of if you like superhero movies or not, then ""Wonder Woman"" is definitely worth taking the time to sit down and watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Dc now has 2 masterpieces. The Dark Knight and Wonder Woman!,"This is the best movie of 2017 beyond a shadow of a Doubt. This movie blew me away.

Steve Trevor and Diana Prince chemistry is so legit that it surpasses major Romantic hits. Nonetheless, its a Superhero Movie!! and boy, it delivers on that front.

"more superhero film should be done at this way, different way from marvel","just back from my viewing this morning (it is opened 30/5 here i n HK). I admit i was having lot of doubts before getting to this movie. First of all, still no review yet on RT only few days before US opening ( always a bad sign). Few users' reviews on the web and they seems to be too good to be REAL. And yesterday i saw few users here saying those good reviews are fake and giving horrific 1 star and rant on the movie ( will get back to this on the latter part), my heart dropped dead.Forgetting all those worries and trying to be neutral as best to see what i am going to get out from this film, i could say i should never saw those evil, brutal 1 star users' ""what to say"". This movie is REALLY REALLY GOOD!!!! Those good reviews are no lie at all. Everyone agrees wonder women was the highlight Of the BVS. This movie elevates that into another level!! The story really give depth to the character, Gal Gadot is really charming as the wonder women. The action sequence was made beautifully and the final act was just WOW that it gave me a chill that i was longing for a superhero film.Inevitably, people do compare this to those Marvel works. For me, Wonder woman is on pal with Ironman 1 & Captain America 2 winder solider. And people have to bear in mind DC is always different from Marvel, that is the reason it make this movie or DC movie so cool. i do enjoy watching Marvel stuffs, they are always entertaining and action packed, but that's all, they are kind of forgettable and lack of depth. Except Ironman 1, CA2 or maybe civil war, i don't really think other Marvels are really that great, some are even not good to me (i.e. Thor, IM3..). DC movie is not afraid of stepping into the dark side of the human heart, it will give u something meaningful to ponder on....WonderWomen's backstory is set on the WW1, the darkest moment for the humanity. it is the path for wonder women to realize who she really is and what she stands for out of knowing human is the one to blame for all the evil and terrible things they are capable of but human is also fond of love and capable of building better world. The story is so compelling.To those people who could rate movie at 1 star. i mean how could you do that just because you don't like it or simply you are fan of Marvel. We really need different kind of movies more than just always one similar formula.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Major Disappointment,"I can't help but wonder if I watched the same film that impressed so many people. As with most DC Comics films, this one was a great disappointment. While Marvel Comics films tend to be satirical and even self-effacing, DC films are pretentious and tedious. Sadly, Wonder Woman was no exception to this rule.The scripting was totally unimaginative, with dialogue that bordered on infantile. Visually, the landscapes all seemed plastic, with B-movie grade CGI throughout. Even the music was awkward, fighting the dialogue during the more intimate moments and drowning each scene in instrumentals. I found myself doubting whether the director and editor are aware that there doesn't have to be a bombastic or flowery incidental score under everything ‚Äî it displayed a lack of confidence in the dialogue and acting carrying the scene.Regarding the acting, both Gadot and Pine gave it their best, struggling with the stilted dialogue and boring, telegraphed story line ‚Äî but even they couldn't transcend this quagmire. If not for its pretentiousness, this film would have played far better as a comedy, lampooning itself. Instead, it drowns itself in incessant platitudes of women good/men bad, framed within a plebian one-dimensional plot.Again, I'm at a loss to explain its high marks, other than to ascribe it to the currently trendy political correctness that elevates all patronizing misandry to high art and entertainment.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazonian's Deliver!,"The much anticipated new Wonder Woman movie is with us, and for once the film lives up to the wall-to-wall marketing hype.With a heavy dose of mythology, Diana is growing up as the cossetted daughter of Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen, ""Gladiator""), the Queen of the Amazons, on the hidden paradise island of Themyscira. Trained up as a warrior by Hippolyta's sister, General Antiope (Robin Wright of ""House of Cards""), Diana is clearly something special. Her ego is reinforced by the knowledge that she was made of clay with life breathed into her by the God Zeus. ¬†It's enough to turn a girl's head!It's 1917 and the man-free paradise is shaken up when an American spy by the name of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine, ""Star Trek: Beyond"") crash- lands in the waters off Themyscira. ¬†(And yes... you didn't mishear me... this film genuinely features a hero with both the names ""Steve"" and 'Trevor""). Prince Eric - no, sorry, wrong film - is saved and awakened on the beach by Diana as the others arrive. ¬†""Thank God!"", say the Amazonians. ""At last, someone to process the 200 year backlog of washing and ironing""!But Steve (an ""above average specimen"", LOL) is not long for paradise as he needs to return to the war with the results of his spy-work: a chemistry book stolen from the gorgeously deformed Dr Maru (Elena Anaya), gas-developer for the evil General Ludendorff¬†(Danny Huston). Seeing Ludendorff to be her God-like nemesis Ares, Diana returns with Steve to the WW1 battlefields with the intent of killing the God of War and so ending the 'war to end all wars'.Much 'fish out of water' fun is had with Diana meeting civilised London society, although perhaps this section of the film doesn't quite live up to its full potential: ¬†having ice cream for the first time, without any sign of surprise, all she can come up with is an amusing but rather lame ""You must be very proud"".But where the film really accelerates into awesomeness is when Diana reaches the trenches. She emerges from the trenches like some shimmering vision of hotness, to set male and lesbian hearts a flutter. Its the most memorable trench-exit since the finale of ""Black Adder 4"", and the subsequent scenes of Diana single-handedly facing the German guns is for me one of the most compelling and enjoyable scenes in any recent DC or Marvel movie.Holding all this together is the ex-Israeli army-trainer Gal Gadot in the title role. And man oh man, what a Gal! Statuesque, athletic but also sweet, charming and emotionally fragile she completely owns this role from beginning to end. ¬†Gadot made a memorable entry in the otherwise poor ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (#marthagate #neverforget #neverforgive) but nothing prepares you for just how great she is in this outing.Chris Pine - the thinking women's Chris Pratt - once again proves himself as a talented actor who manages to successfully morph to inhabit the role he plays. Much as he did in the excellent ""Hell or High Water"", not once did I equate him to be James Tiberius Kirk after the first 5 minutes.Effective in supporting roles are David Thewlis (""Harry Potter"") as a 'helpful' army bod and an almost unrecognisable Lucy Davis (""The Office"") as Etta, Steve's comedic secretary. ¬†Steve's rather unlikely sidekicks of Sameer (Said Taghmaoui, ""American Hustle""), Charlie (Ewen Bremner, ""Trainspotting"") and 'The Chief' (Eugene Brave Rock ""The Revenant"") all rather fade into the woodwork by comparison.I saw the film in 3D (""careful now... you could take an eye out with those things"") and very good it was too. Aside from some rather unnecessary Amazonian arrows, its never feels overdone, and elements of it were extremely effective.Another star of the show is the superb Wonder Woman theme by Hans Zimmer, here rolled out by the film's composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (""Hacksaw Ridge""). Unfortunately, the rest of the soundtrack is not particularly memorable.The film shifts into more traditional yawn-worthy 'superhero finale' mode in the last twenty minutes, which is a bit of a shame.Patty Jenkins (""Monster"") directs and knows the audience she is aiming to please. One can only imagine the empowering impact this film will have on young girls, crossing their wrists and in their imagination casting terrorists into the hell that they should be consigned to. In this week of yet more Isis atrocity in London, Wonder Woman is a role- model we could all stand and salute: ""I believe in love"" too.(This is an abridged version of the One Mann's Movies graphical review.

Excellent,"I just saw this for the first time after being disappointed by Wonder Woman 1984 and reading reviews that said this first one was way better. And yes, this was sort of what I was hoping and expecting 1984 to be like, or at least be more like.As far as the comic book genre goes, in my opinion, this movie is a masterpiece. It truly is. It was everything it could possibly be, and maybe a little bit more. Every scene was perfect with only a couple exceptions. There is beauty, symbolism, depth, and good acting at every main part. It even had some really funny scenes sprinkled in that were unexpected.Although the action scenes toward the end were a little bit cliche, they were necessary to the story and still differentiated themselves for some uniqueness, which is all you can ask for in that setting.This is the movie I wanted and hoped for out of WW 1984.

She's not cocky, she's assertive, she's not arrogant, she wants to learn and has humility, Wonder Woman is a real character not just another hero in tights being super. The direction from Petty Jenkins works well, the pace builds after a nice set up, it looks great and the WW1 setting gives the plot some depth and context.

Wonderful!,"Just want to mention that there were many changes, but many for the best, the movies was good and the action sequences great, there was some comparison to Captain America however lets squash that right away, Wonder Woman was around long before Capt. America and its the other way around actually, just research the comics and you'll discover the truth, its just that the Captains movie came out before Wonder Woman. But there are some good messages which we all should listen to especially about war. Look forward to Justice League and WW part II this should be very interesting. One final mention Wonder Woman should be more caring and gentle, also a role with Linda Carter as a mentor would be fantastic! I would love to see her, we still love you Linda Speaking about Justice League: Green Lantern must be in the Justice League Movie, even if he makes a late entry at the end of the film for a quick save or to give a last minute assist, he is a founding member, we're talking the original, Hal Jordan. Either ask Ryan Reynolds and Martin Campbell to proceed with part II of Green Lantern Corps movie (the movie was great in my opinion) or just get another actor like Armie Hammer, someone new who looks like a leader, or Jason Bateman and start filming already, okay. Or get another actor, think a young Kevin Costner, whoever he is he must imbue knightly virtues and spirit, a good person. What went wrong in the first film: He should not ride in a car on a track like he did in the film, he is not a kid. He could have just rode in a super hot Mursiellago or Lamborgini or the Bugatti Veyron the 2 million dollar car and that would have been fantastic, see what I mean guys, come on. But hey I loved the green lantern movie minus the mentioned, just make sure he looks cool and is a good guy, strong, leader. Also please keep Blake Lively she was great and as a supporting character and Mark Strong as Sinestro also bring her back Angela Bassett. What went right in the first movie he uses a futuristic machine gun to shoot the evil Elder at the end, he also flies, has a force field, shoots blast out of the ring, and throws giant heavy objects at his opponents all excellent, well done. He could have a green body armor of types, huge and throw all sort of things like a garbage truck, an oncoming train, giant blocks the size of building, and have the green aura / force field show us it also allows him superhuman strength to lift buses, punch falling boulders to smithereens etc., The Lantern rocks, he also happens to be the king of Green as since he doesn't have to destroy any property when he throws things around since they are made from his ring, there is no damage to the environment. I imagine he and Aquaman have a good relationship because of this and because he is like a knight. This is visually spectacular stuff and extremely impressive. Also you must bring Sinestro and the green lantern corps, just make them look better and stay away from some of the chicken aliens yeesh! also Killowag should look better more impressive, bigger, like the thing but not as big as the hulk.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fairly good superhero movie.,"The script is delicate, the characters are full, the narrative is smooth, and the scene moves beautifully.

The Feminist Icon Becomes A Message Against War In Oustanding Superhero Film,"Wonder Woman was not created by Aphrodite or Zeus, but was rather the brain-child of a controversial psychologist and inventor, William Moulton Marston. (Marston's other claim to fame is the invention of the lie detector.) Although Superman and Batman were selling well to kids, there was a wave of pseudo-psychology which claimed that comic books were poisoning the minds of impressionable youths. Detective Comics (later renamed DC) were frightened that these radical groups were influencing the voting public which might hire lawmakers to ban comic books altogether. DC hired Marston to address this problem. Rather than changing existing comic books, Marston offered an unexpected solution: make a female superhero, i.e. a super-heroine. The result was Wonder Woman.Little did DC comics know Marston had been involved in the early suffragette and birth-control movements of the early 20th century, and he incorporated much of the iconography and symbolism into the comic book. Wonder Woman's looks was originally a hybrid of the Varga pin-up girl posters of the 1940's and Suffragettes of the early 20th century. For example, Wonder Woman's early adventures often involved her being chained, an icon used by feminists and suffragettes in the early 20th century in propaganda posters and political illustrations. When chained, Wonder Woman loses her powers. Her magic lasso compels the person being lassoed to tell the truth, an obvious reference to Marston's lie detector. The comic was an instant hit and even became iconic for the Women's Liberation Movement of the 1970's.Fast-forward to 2017. Patty Jenkins has directed an outstanding film on a screenplay by Allan Heinberg from a story by Heinberg, Zack Snyder and Jason Fuchs based on the DC Comics character. Starring Gal Gadot as the title character and Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, this superhero action film flies as fusing of Ancient mythology and human history, and the offering is one of the best of the genre since the original ""Superman"" film starring Christopher Reeve (1979). Like ""Superman"", ""Wonder Woman"" begins with the backstory of the title character. Her name is Diana, daughter of Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nelson) and she lives on Paradise Island where only women reside whose culture is a throw-back to Ancient Greek mythology. (Paradise because there are no men to screw things up...?) Diana as a youth is taught by the best combat teacher of the island, General Antiope (Robin Wright) in the ways of combat and becomes the best among her peers.Sticking to the origins, Captain Steve Trevor, an American spy working for the British, is being chased by Germans during the First World War and crashes off the coast of Paradise Island. He has in his possession plans written by Dr. Poison (a real character from DC Comics). After a confrontation between Amazons and the Germans, Trevor is taken in by the Amazons and forced to reveal who and what he is. Eventually, Diana decides she must go with Trevor back to ""the world of men"" and help stop the war. Her reasons are mythological in which she must stop the ""God of War"". Of course Trevor doesn't buy into Diana's myth story but plays along to get back to the war. They sail by boat back to London.One of the best sequences is Diana's introduction to early 20th century society. Gadot offers an excellent performance as the slightly culture-shocked fish-out-of-water but never overplays it. She tries on a pouffe dress which definitely wouldn't be ""Wonder Woman"". Eventually, she dons a suitable outfit and signs onto a mission with Trevor and several marginal characters to stop a fatal gas attack which makes the mustard gas of the war seem like the steam from a sauna. The inventor is Doctor Isabel Maru, a.k.a. Dr. Poison who has been supported by General Ludendorff. (In fact Ludendorff was a real general in the First World War and was involved in Hitler's so-called Beer Hall Putsch to overthrow the German government in 1923.) The mission is not sanctioned by the war office of London but in secret with only one member of Parliament offering assistance, Sir Patrick Morgan (David Thewlis). This merry band of misfits, a woman who knows nothing about western society and culture, a Scottish drunk, a Native American pacifist, an Italian actor, and an American spy make their way to the front lines of the First World War.An outstanding film all around with excellent performances and a good balance between story and action. The filmmakers made the decision to withhold Diana becoming ""Wonder Woman"" until nearly half-way into the film, similar to ""Superman"". One of the best decisions: she never says ""I'm Wonder Woman"". A superhero speaking his or her name is a fatal screenplay error made by many other screenwriters who shall remain nameless.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Best. Movie. Ever.,From the beginning until the end this movie is so fascinating and interesting. I loved the messages in this movie.

A good movie that made me want to keep looking forward to the second.,"One of the action scenes perfectly matched the music, and it was very impressive. It left a deep impression on me. The story is wonderful but the ending is too casual. I have to say that Gal Gadot added a lot to this movie and the role of Wonder Woman.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wonderful!,"Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is everything we want from a super hero - strong, courageous, empathetic, kind, just, fierce, loyal, and yet somehow still relatable. As a life-long WW fan, I had high hopes going in, and while there is some clunkiness for sure in the movie (the CGI at the end, for instance), Gadot's charisma makes up for it in spades.Two other stand-out performances are from Connie Nielsen as Hippolyta and Robin Wright as Antiope. Wright especially takes what she's given in the role and makes the most of it, I found myself wanting to spend way more time with her Antiope.I'm thankful that Patty Jenkins gifted us with a Wonder Woman that my daughter can look up to, the way I looked up to Superman when I was a kid. Thank you for this!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Latest Adaptation of the Powerful Female DC Superhero,"Well, I think this was a rather different type of DC superheroes movies. This one was felt as a combination of fun and a little bit dark altogether. This movie was telling the origin of Wonder Woman and I think it was told in a very nice way. The earlier part showing Diana since her childhood was quite nice to see. What I loved the most was actually the moment when Diana went to London for the very first time. It was truly fun to see the naivety of her in the ""man's world"" and I think Gal Gadot's portrayal in these scenes were very spot on.What I loved about this movie was also the way Diana evolved from the innocent Amazon woman to what she became at the end. I believe the duration of the movie was just nice even though it was a little bit over than 2 hours. Some might feel it was too long at the beginning but it should not be considered as a flaw. My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. I know she was touched during those emotional moments and I know she loved Gal Gadot portraying Wonder Woman.Chris Pine was charming as Steve Rogers and his chemistry with Gal Gadot seemed very nice. The awkward moments during their trip back to London were very fun to see as well. Steve's allies particularly Sameer was the stand out one. Apart from the fun part, there were also some dark moments and emotional moments as well, reminding us that DC superhero adaptation movies would always have dark tone, but it was not as dark as the other earlier movies. Those of you who prefer lighter tone would definitely be able to enjoy this.This movie was directed by Patty Jenkins who had just 1 movie to her credit prior to this one, albeit a very highly critically acclaimed one titled Monster (with its main cast Charlize Theron won the Golden Globe and Academy Awards). It was a surprise to me that she was able to make the action sequence looked very cool. The special effects was wonderful. The fight scenes were nice. The sound effects were great, especially since I saw this in a theater with Dolby Atmos sound system. The dramatic, emotional, fun scenes were nicely done by Jenkins. All around I think she did a wonderful job directing this movie and hopefully it would bring more audiences to flock the theaters.For those who are expecting to see post-credit scene, be informed that this one did not have any, just like in Batman VS Superman: Dawn of Justice. I guess they did not really want to be seen just like any other Marvel movies? (Although there was some brief mid-credit scene in Suicide Squad).In conclusion, I believe this one was a wonderful superhero movie from DC comics. Not since Elektra in 2005 that a female superhero became the lead of a movie based on comic books. Not even Marvel had it in the Marvel cinematic universe. Perhaps after this, they would be making an independent movie of Black Widow?Anyway, for those of you who prefer Marvel comics movies compared to DC comics movies due to their lighter tones, I think this one would surprise you. For those who are die hard fans of DC comics, I am sure you would be coming to see this one anyway. But for those who just enjoy the movies adapted from any comic books, you should be able to enjoy this one. Just watch this and you would understand what I meant.For my complete review pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Wonder Woman (2017) Problematic third act,"The DCEU wasn't doing so well in its first few movies because it was definitely lacking some preparation, but with the release of Wonder Woman that universe seemed to have a lifeline. This film is very different from what we usually see within the superhero subgenre. The first two acts are wonderful, especially after leaving Themyscira and in the trenches scene. The choreographies are incredible, the photography is good, it has an interesting direction. However, from this moment on, the film begins to deteriorate a lot. The third act is boring, it's tiring and it doesn't seem to be the same movie anymore since the pace of it was great. For an hour and a half it tried to be different only to end up being a generic superhero battle. It never had anything so different from other films in general, but within the subgenre it managed to work something new and it worked very well, unfortunately the third act pulls the film down.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazon icon,"I really enjoyed this movie and thought Patty Jenkins did an amazing job. DCEU movies in my opinion haven't been that great, but I think this one is a lot better than the others. It was cool to finally see a good female superhero movie. Even though Gal Gadot's acting isn't stellar in my opinion, I think she's really charming and fit the roll nicely. I watched this in a history through film class for WWI, so we looked at comparisons during the battle scenes with gases, trenches, etc. Although their isn't a magical pill you break open to give you super-human strength in real life, some of the other stuff was pretty accurate. I haven't seen other work directed by Patty Jenkins, but I'm hoping the next Wonder Woman installment will be just as good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Had an absolute blast watching,"I am a fan of DC, even their films, although I personally love them, I can understand a lot of their criticisms and recognize they're not the best superhero films. So going in I was excited but also realistic, in that I try to not have my expectation too high.And boy I was not disappointed, I had an absolute blast watching it. The action is amazing, the shots were beautifully shot and directed. The highlight of the film is of course Gal Gadot and Chris Pines who both owned the roles of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor. Even the supporting cast provided some great humor and depth, it really made me care about each characters.The only gripe I had was there was some disappointment with the antagonist. The antagonist is not bad in anyway, in fact the antagonist is visually cool looking, but I realize that the antagonist is not the best villain, good but just disappointed.All in all, it is easily one of the best blockbuster films this year, had an amazing time.

More than Super,"Diana begins a hopeful believer in humanity's essential goodness and a despiser of Ares' violent mind-control-like influence over them. As she fights the Great War, she inspires humanity to rise up and be their better selves but is eventually confronted with the fact that humanity is not the essentially good brotherhood she thought it was and Ares' influence is far more devious and subtle as well.The questions at the heart of this film are ""Will Diana despair when faced with reality,"" and ""Is humanity, with all it's dark impulses, worth saving. This struggle is so much more relatable than watching Superman try to beat up another strongman who is going to enslave humanity.Diana empathizes with dying soldier's and comes to the rescue of small villages instead of flying past dying civilians and toppling building by throwing bad guys into them. She sees how evil men can be and is brokenhearted, not angered. She is a hero that wants to end war, not wage it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Cringeworthy,"I am really losing hope in everything that I used to believe in, in general, thee days. This load of crap is rated 8.5? What the hell?The movie is so weak, It's like the movie makers don't even care about anything anymore other than completely depend on CGI and good effects. Like they KNOW we are that dumb and will just take it up. The story was god awful, stupid even by superhero comic standards and the acting was atrocious.There was literally ZERO character development for any of them. No depth. It just all was whipped along as if for the sake of completing the movie. None of the characters were likable and relatable on a psychological level. Comic relief was forced and did not make us laugh. Watching Diana do her innocent act was totally unbelievable and as fake as it can get.I fell asleep. My girlfriend well asleep and my friend who is generally very tolerating of dumb movies EVEN he fell asleep.But that's okay, not a lot of movies are necessarily good. But what breaks my heart and trust in the movie world is that this is getting so much attention and respect with a stellar rating. It's an insult to some of the other gems people have produced to see films like these get ratings similar to theirs.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not a perfect 10/10,"First, I wouldn't honestly rate this title 10 stars. But I'd be happy to give it 8 or even 9. Why 10 then?Captain Marvel has a 7.1 on IMDB. Wonder Woman is only .4 ahead of it. That's a crying shame.Gal Gadot NAILS this character. Her strength, her courage of conviction.. it gives me goosebumps when I think of certain scenes and how righteous and powerful she is.
Chris Pine is also great, and the chemistry between him and Gadot is charming, well-done, and so well-written. Some of the CGI is spotty, but there are some beautiful sequences as well (such as when her mother is teaching her their history).The third act, and the fight with Aries borders on 'meh'. I also thought the cast of misfit soldiers was kind of annoying at times, and also why did they attend that party in that castle? That whole part where they passed high-level German security with bad German accents was very ridiculous.But overall, the movie is actually a fun experience. It makes you feel things. When WW goes ""over the top"" of the trenches with her shield, I literally raised my fist in the air and cried 'yes!' (I'm a guy btw).I have watched WW three times and will gladly watch it again. I saw Captain Marvel recently and will NEVER watch it again.

a pretty film that's all,"For me, the way the story was told was good, the visual effects are beautiful, but I did not like the acting and the villain.

Oh boy does it rock when there are action set-pieces!

Far better than expected.,"This movie is incredible to look at and has a lead to match.

Knowing when to slow it down enough for us to get some build the characters and the world without ever letting it drag.My only gripe is the final act isn't as strong as the first and second.

The actors are all very good, with the exception of the Ares Actor. He tried, but the script was not written in favor of him, obviously.

"Good movie, for a superhero flick","This is a good movie.I'm not generally a fan of superhero films. They strike me as philosophically superficial Bayesque things.For most of its running time, WW is about characters, who have well-considered philosophical positions. There's no rubbing your nose in those positions, but they're consistent.The absolute strength of WW is in its writing. Which isn't to say that any other bits are bad-- the acting is certainly adequate, although it is a a super-hero flick, not Osage August Count, so the bar is not that high. The direction and editing are fine, and where they fail, it's due to trying to be original, rather than trying to be the same as everything else-- even its directorial failures are a plus in my book.WW doesn't try to be anything particularly amazing. It's just a superhero movie. Eventually, it turns into boring action for its own sake. But ""eventually"" puts it miles beyond every other superhero movie I've ever seen.

Wonder Woman is a mythological delight...go with it,"It's been years since I've written a movie review but after reading the reviews here, my conscience literally forced this one from my fingers.First of all, I'm a guy who hasn't liked a superhero movie since The Dark Knight. I'm also super-picky about movies in general. Having said this, I found Wonder Woman uncommonly refreshing...better than 99% of what comes out of Hollywood these days. Why?Gal Gadot - Her screen presence is breathtaking...mesmerizing. She portrays strength with vulnerability, naivete with intelligence.Chris Pine - His timing and delivery are spot-on as usual. I bet every director loves working with this guy.Cinematography - From the muted colors of WWI to the lush island paradise, brilliant.The story - It's not Shawshank but the emotive elements are all there. Engaging from start to finish.The mythology - Basic but intriguing and credible. Great tension is created against the prevailing left-brained mindsets.The jokes - Corny at times but for the most part they provided nice relief from the drama without ripping the viewer out of the moment like every other superhero movie.The twist - People hate on it but I bet no one saw it coming.Anyway, forget all of this -- the movie just works. And what it lacks in originality, it makes up for with heart. One might call it the Armageddon of superhero movies. So let go. Give it a chance. Your life might not be changed but you may see this list of imdb trolls for what it is. 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun movie,"After reading all the negative reviews I thought to give a shot nonetheless. And maybe it was because I wasn't suspecting much I liked it.

A honest Superhero Origin,"The best of the DC Universe in my opinion, the beginning is perfect, the humor is so good because it is not forced it came with the situation and the character I love how Diana sees and understands the world is a vision so innocent but so energetic, powerful that is contagious and makes you love the character, has so many moments of characters retrospection so well developed. It is not afraid to be cheesy so it came out as honest, for me it is the problem I have with superhero movies they want to get away from the good, selfless, noble hero because they are aparently 'cheesy' so superheros movies for me don't seem honest but parodies or so dark that they are depressing. This is what I want to see in a superhero movie, the scene of no man's land made me feel in a way that I have no words to define it... it was EPIC.But I think it's a shame that the end has broken the rhythm, I think Dr Maru is one of the most mysterious and interesting villains whose potential is wasted to make way for a plot twist and another of the final CGI battles that DC abuses. The movie had a very clear message that at the end i don't know why they decides to destroy it making the story a bit inconsistent for me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Warrior Women,"In the 1940s, William and Elizabeth Marston worked as psychologists in New York. However, the couple had other interests as well. In 1941, they created the character ""Wonder Woman"" for publisher DC Comics. The role model was their young, polyamorous life partner. In a magazine interview, William Marston stated that the couple wanted to produce an alternative to the then popular (male) superheroes.Right from the beginning ""Wonder Woman"" appeared on many different media platforms. TV shows, radio programs, video games and a couple of action movies have all, on various occasions, hosted her shenanigans. The gal has also been featured in contemporary artwork on a regular basis. Most famously in pieces by American so-called ""pop artists"". Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, to name just a few.Warner Brothers started to plan for a new ""Wonder Woman"" movie at the beginning of 1996. But, after failing to come up with a workable screenplay, the entire project got stuck in development hell. The intended picture was finally abandoned in 2002.But, never say never. In 2015, Warners decided to put ""Wonder Woman"" back on the silver screen again. And this time the studio executives decided that they wanted a female director. Patty Jenkins, who just a few years earlier had directed ""Monster"" with Charlize Theron, seemed to be the right woman for the job. Especially considering that picture's great artistic and commercial success.Although the film was not aimed exclusively at young women, the marketing department at Warnes realized that this demographic could constitute an important target group. So, a few weeks before the premiere, a promo for the movie was released during the season finale of the TV-series ""Supergirl"". And it worked. ""Wonder Woman"" turned out to be the highest-grossing film of any female director ever.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It is full of light, color, heart and a cohesive history, characteristics that make it one of the best of its kind in recent times","With the proper introduction of the Man of Steel, with the new older summer of Batman and the anti-heroes who are part of the Suicide Squad, we can finally enjoy a movie of Wonder Woman, the most powerful heroine in the DC universe. After being introduced to the general public in cinemas in ""Batman vc Superman"" that already gave us a very good idea of who the character was and what she was capable of doing and now, the wait is finally over. To bring this super powerful woman to the screen, she was called Patty Jenkins, who does not have as many jobs on her resume, but who became known worldwide for directing Monster (2003) that gave the Oscar for Best Actress to Charlize Theron for playing Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who becomes the first serial killer woman in history.
One of the great strengths of the production is the script by Allan Heinberg - egress from TV series like ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Sex and The City"" - which builds a script with many merits, respecting the origin story of Wonder Woman bringing to it highlights several other aspects. Setting the plot at the end of the First World War, the script manages to present aspects of the behavior and customs of society from the beginning of the 20th century, and issues related to the power of those who are in charge of nations, political decisions, all still permeated with gods and legends. mythological, as well as dilemmas of whether or not humanity deserves to be protected by the Amazon.
The film begins today, after the events of 'Batman v Superman - Origin of Justice', and shows Diana Prince, who works in the Antiques Department of the Louvre, receiving a World War I photograph from his mail sent by Wayne Enterprises, when you start to remember your past. So we are transported to the beginning of the 20th century, when we see little Diana, who has always wanted to train with the other Azones, but who was prevented by her mother Hippolyta, who hid her father's identity from Diana, thought she you shouldn't worry about that in times and peace and that you should play like a child and not fight. Over time, Hippolyta is convinced by Antiope and Diana then starts to train more than any other Amazon. When pilot Steve Trevor crashes on his plane and is rescued by Diana, all Amazons learn about the dangers that surround the isolated Paradise Island in the world of men.
These first forty minutes of the plot are dedicated to telling Diana's childhood, showing how life is on Paradise Island, and better setting the viewer in Greek-Roman legends. With Diana's departure with Steve, it is interesting to note Diana's still naive gaze on humanity, especially in a time of war. The contrast of this naivete in her eyes with that of the experienced pilot and spy Steve is when we realize that she was there embarking on a transformative journey towards London where her beliefs would be confronted. In fact, arriving in the English capital, more aspects of this naivety in relation to the customs of society are understandable and a highlight of the film alongside Etta Candy (Lucy Davis), Steve's secretary. While Diana was born and raised trained to be a warrior, she does not understand the use of dresses, fashion, etc. Even going through a revolving door in your new outfits and a sword becomes a hilarious challenge and trying ice cream for the first time becomes a unique experience. There is also time to be impressed by man-made weapons to kill people. Even the struggle for the right to vote - which would only be won years later - is cited as a criticism of society at the time. The same criticism used later when Diana enters a military audience where only men are allowed. And what about Diana confronting the coldness of political decision and calling the general a coward for allowing soldiers to die on the front lines of battles? Just what we expect from the character. The best of ""Wonder Woman"" is due to this meeting of two peoples: Diana's, composed only by women; and ours, where women had (still have) fewer rights and opportunities than men. The script is fanciful in scenes where the current machismo is ridiculed with pleasure by the protagonist.
The script uses the entire first half of the plot to insert Diana into the world of men and develops the character in a slow, careful and skillful way. And from the final half, Diana is able to show her skills to humans, with special emphasis on the scenes when the team reaches the Western Front in Belgium, they are interrupted by enemy machine guns, but Diana leaves alone in the middle of no-man's-land and gathers allied forces behind it to free the village of Veld. The scenes of Diana appearing behind the barricades and facing the enemy soldiers is epic, as well as the scenes in which she invades through the windows the places where she faces

The scenes of Diana appearing behind the barricades and facing the enemy soldiers is epic, as well as the scenes in which she invades through the windows the places where she faces several German soldiers to the sound of the heroine's theme song. In the final stretch, there are also the excellent action sequences with Diana's fight with Ludendorff and, especially afterwards, against another unexpected villain amidst many destructions, shots and explosions.
One of the highlights of the film is the relationship between Diana and Steve and that was essential for the film to work. Since Diana rescued him from the sea, we have noticed a sexual tension between them. The complicity between the two only grows over the two hours of projection and makes us cheer for the couple at all times. The chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine is evident and the scene in which he teaches her to dance under the snow and then go to the bedroom and surrender to the love they feel for each other is the culmination of the couple's relationship building. It is in Steve that she knows love and better understands the human action. Humanity's decision is the cause of war and violence, but humanity is also much more than that. It is a humanity capable of loving and that deserves another opportunity. It is also worth highlighting the duo that leave with Diana and Steve to destroy another arms factory together with Ludendorff and Maru. Spy Sameer (Sa√Ød Taghmaoui), excellent sniper Charlie (Ewen Bremner).
If most of the film builds an exciting film in both visual and narrative, the ending, despite having twists and turns, cannot escape much of the concept of elevating action at the expense of coherence. They are minutes of much noise for nothing, without any direct contribution to the lesson that the heroine needed to learn about humanity. These are moments when the director changes the retro look and uses more practical effects for a more obscure and full of green screen effects.
The production of the film also deserves all the praise. Production designer Aline Bonetto, photography by Matthew Jensen are incredible in perfectly setting the time of the First World War in both sets and costumes. It is a war movie with the presence of a superhero, making everything more real and believable even with all the fantastical aspects that involve the origin of the heroine. The soundtrack by Rupert Gregson-Williams is sensational. The composer mixes action themes very well, using the character's theme music very well in moments when he detonates his enemies and also several stretches of pure emotion in the midst of the climate of war. In the post-credits we still have the Australian singer Sia, who wrote a song for the film, entitled ""To Be Human"", with the English musician Labrinth, who is also on the soundtrack.
'Wonder Woman' is a film with excellent production, with a first script and that works thanks to the direction of Patty Jenkins and the scenic presence of Gal Gadot. The choice of the dietician is not only for the symbology of a woman directing a film of a female protagonist in an action film but, consequently, also for being the first woman to direct a superhero film with a female protagonist in Hollywood. Just to abuse the clich√©s of films of the genre such as slow cameras and camera turns in the beating scenes, the scenarios where these scenes take place end up differentiating the film from so many others of the genre.
The Israeli actress, on the other hand, manages to pass the still naive look of young Diana in the land of men, all her discoveries and dilemmas, which contrast very well with the wiser posture of the character of the first and last scenes of the projection. Diana was very well represented as a normal woman. A woman with very high values, but still a woman. It can be sensitive. She is smart and emotionally independent. She may be confused. She may lose her confidence or not. She's everything. She has a human heart. The actress exudes charisma, easily switching between the sweetness of a young woman discovering a world different from her own and the strength of a warrior who distributes tapas without losing her hairstyle.
'Wonder Woman' is the best film in DC's eccentric extended universe, a work of great quality, quite faithful to its original material, which was a box office success and which will certainly generate new sequences. It is a symbol for women and it came to break barriers and prejudices. It is full of light, color, heart and a cohesive history, characteristics that make it one of the best of its kind in recent times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Worth watching! Don't watch WW84 though.,"Really liked Wonder Woman, so much so I bought it. Found it enjoyable to watch with just the right amount of action, romance, and funny mixed together.Gadot and Pine's performance really clicked and worked together throughout the entire film. The ending, which I'll not spoil, is one of my favorite movie endings ever. The kind of ending where you think to yourself, now that's how movies are suppose to make you feel. I think it's a wonderfully done movie, pun intended.Warning though, stop with the first WW movie. I sincerely wish I had not watched WW84, so horrible it tarnishes the enjoyment I got from the first WW.

Wonder Woman: Daughter of gods,"The director of the movie ""Wonder Woman"" Patty Jenkins selected Gal Gadot cause she had been in action movies aside from Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot has a notion about the environment that has to be used in this kind of movies. Nowadays DC movie saga has two movies of Wonder Woman. The first movie WAS released in movie theaters in 1974 and the last adaptation was made in 2017. The last is one of the movies with better quality where a woman is the star character.Gal Gadot developing her role as hero who previously and during the movie had trained Kung-fu, boxing, handling of swords and brazilian jiu-jitsu. Wonder Woman is called Diana and she lives in a island with just women all of them are called amazon. She has never gone away the island, aside her mother does not let her explore it. That island cannot be seen by anyone unless you be into. Diana is daughter of gods and her mother is the queen of the island.The environment of the movie is besieged on the First World War that happened in 1914 until 1918. Gal Gadot as Diana is what I like more cause the script that gave her fits her very well, It is worth mentioning that her skin and clothes make her look like a goddess of lightning. Wonder Woman always gets victorious, obviously not at first trying but with faculty and strength she wins. This is a movie that has been made to watch and watch again, simply one of the best actions movies I have seen.This is a fictional movie but also tackles real problems and real events that happened in the world, as I have said, but in this adaptation combining Wonder Woman with the First World War, one of the main problems in the movie is Ares, the demon who started the war and as Diana, he has special abilities. For all lovers of action movies and DC comics or movies, mainly women I totally recommend watching Wonder Woman.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The god of war,"DC Comics and Warner Brothers are expanding their universe. After Wonder Woman's appearance in Batman v Superman in 2016, she gets her own standalone film.In keeping with the Justice League universe, the film has that dark and murky look. We get a long drawn out beginning of a young girl who is a descendant of a Greek god wishing to train to be a warrior despite her mother's resistance to the idea.We then see a grown up Amazonian princess, Diana (Gal Gadot) who develops little muscular physique despite all her training with fellow warrior sisters on a mystical isolated island of Themyscira.When an an American pilot Steve (Chris Pine) crashes near this island followed by German soldiers, the Amazonians learn of an outside world where humans are engaged in a great war, the first world war. Diana leaves her island with Steve and goes to London with a desire to stop the war.Steve has found out about a German chemist called Dr Poison trying to develop chemical weapons that would render gas masks useless in a background of both sides to the war having peace talks. Diane believes that Ares, the god of war is responsible for the human misery caused by warfare.The film improves once the action moves to London but there are problems with the story. It is weak, when a sinister German general is disposed off well before the end of the film, it just confirms that a certain character is going to be the big bad of the movie.Some of Steve's ragbag of associates who are there for camaraderie and comic relief are useless. A marksman who cannot shoot.The film feels overlong and underwhelming. You have to suspend a lot of disbelief in Wonder Woman's acrobatic abilities as well parrying bullets with her wrist bands.Gadot showed promise in her appearance in Batman v Superman last year, but carrying a film on her own exposed her limitations as an actress. Her range is limited and in many scenes she is just required to pose and replaced by CGI either in slow motion or sped up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Best of the DCEU (that I have seen so far..),"So, after being a massive Marvel fan I was reluctant to take the plunge with the DCEU having heard many mixed things.This is the 4th entry to the DCEU. Having been intrigued by Man of Steel, I very much enjoyed Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition. Suicide Squad wasted so much potential. This was a chance for the DCEU to restart almost and take it back to the beginning - literally.In many ways it feels very comparable to Captain America: The First Avenger but it also has plenty of merits. The character's origin story to me was fresh and I enjoyed the depiction.I thought Gal Gadot and Chris Pine were fantastic as was David Thewlis. Another mention to Lucy Davis who plays the secretary and also offers some light hearted reprieve.A feel good superhero origin story which didn't leave me bored and definitely one to rewatch.8.5 / 10Current DCEU Rankings:

A Lovely and Powerful Feminist Superhero Who Delivers An Essential Message to Humanity,"Some fierce critics claim that Wonder Woman is a fake feminist flick, while this movie demonstrates in subtle and important ways that a woman directed it. Some others that it does not depict accurately World War I, when it never pretended to be a comprehensive lesson regarding all the events of the first worldwide conflict in the History of Humanity. Whatever some may think, Gal Gadot is a perfect cast, because she is brilliant and her charisma shines through the screen: both fragile and strong, tender and caring, but ready to fight the evil that men do. Looking forward to seeing The Amazon Princess again in 'Wonder Woman 1984' as soon as the coronavirus pandemic no longer prevents its global release.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing,"I basically fell for the raving reviews of most people calling it the best superhero movie to date and other similar adjectives just to find out that, even when the movie as a whole kind of works as a superhero movie, it's parts are severely flawed and disjointed in themselves.If you can get past the fact that Gal's acting is so one-dimensional at best (she's kinda charming and that's it), the lousy story (including villain, plot devices and even some dialogue) which makes impossible to let you suspend disbelief and the cgi fest which wasn't bad but uncomfortable to watch at times, you might enjoy the movie (which seems to be the case for a lot of people). But if you are looking for something refreshing and different in the genre, this movie is not it and DC (and WB) seem to be very far from understanding the game that Disney is getting away with (even when their movies are not perfect, they are at least good enough in most cases).Unfortunately with the success of this, they basically are now showcasing wonder woman as the leader of the justice league at least until superman gets back, and even then she might be given a role that will attempt to steal the spotlight.All in all, this had potential, at least as a black horse of the genre, but the effort was so wasted in mediocre scenarios and lame execution that it just fell too short.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Gift to Life Long Wonder Woman Fans,"While it may not be the most action oriented or thrilling comic film, it's still a great one.Origin films can sometimes be a bit ""paint by numbers"", but this one still does things to keep it fresh and exciting.For most comic fans, they get to see their favourite characters on the screen often, but not for Wonder Woman fans.WW has always had a difficult history when it comes to TV and film. While characters like Batman, Superman , or Spider-Man have an endless amount of media appearances, Wonder Woman only has a handful.This movie was so monumental for Wonder Woman fans.While not a perfect film, I am forever grateful that Wonder Woman finally got her own film and that it was actually good!

Without a doubt a step in the right direction for DC,"""Wonder Woman"" achieves what ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman vs. Superman"" could not: it delivers a quality film. The story, characters, and setup are the best DC has offered since ""The Dark Knight Rises."" One drawback, however, is DC's overreliance on CGI, which sometimes makes it hard to discern if we're still watching live action or a Pixar movie. Thankfully, these heavily CGI-laden scenes are brief, unlike ""Man of Steel,"" which prominently showcases its digital effects.Despite this, ""Wonder Woman"" remains a powerful and compelling film, easily becoming one of my favorite movies of the summer. Its widespread appeal is evident from the moment the film begins. The story is focused and engaging, making it enjoyable even for those who aren't die-hard DC fans. I highly recommend this movie; even if you don't love it as much as I did, you'll at least find it entertaining and worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The back over DC,"The best movie of the new era of DC superheroes in the movies, we can safely say that with a timeline completely confused in its chronology, the DC universe finally began to make sense in theaters. Wonder woman is not a perfect movie, it's far from that, but it's a sigh of hope. Telling a story of origin, the film is a great flashback, and make it clear in the first scene, the script of the film is good, especially in the construction of the character and creation of the myth, but in the unfolding of history itself is diffuse. WONDERFUL, GOOD, PASSIVE, these are the 3 adjectives that we can use to describe each act of the film, with a very well built beginning, we have the presentation of the hero and the call to adventure, even if it follows a structure already known, the film is Great, with great scenes and a creation of the world, the Amazons are incredible, and the whole representation of their mythology also, in the second moment we have the acceptance of the adventure, the movie falls, but still good, passing in the first war more with taste Of cold war, we have fights veiled, great dialogues, a great team building, and even the great help of the wonder woman in the reconquest of a village (great sequence), the problems begin in the third act, where the film calls for a villain , Which appears out of nowhere (although the movie is all foreseeable), super forced and that badly helps in the character's progression, maybe if the film did not have a super powerful villain, just an analogy of the war in r To Ares, would be much more interesting, even because the wonder woman was not yet a ready heroine, but insist on putting the hero in the test of fire, do what n√© .... the end is disconnected with everything that until then came Being presented. The film seems to have been directed by zack Snyder (who despite the critics, I really like a lot of his filmography), we have his cameras used excessively in the slow motion mode, we have his photograph characteristically gray, the scenes of battles that seems to have His signature and even the clear evidence and affirmation that the hero is the hero, in spite of all this evidence, we know that the film was directed by the experienced in television but new in cinema patty jenkins, that sends well, and to notice that the fall Circumstantial in the film is more the script's fault than its direction. We can not fail to praise Gal Gado, who, although not having the best of dramatic charges, behaves well in all scenes of the film, especially in action. ""Wonder Woman"" is not a good thing, but it is a confirmation of what we already knew, DC knows how to make a hero movie!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Another great super-hero origin story by DC,"I didn't remember how good this movie is. This is a fine super-hero origin story. This is clearly inspired by Donner's Superman, and it has the charm of the first Raimi's Spider-Man movie. And Gal Gadot, who would thought, is the ultimate incarnation of Wonder Woman. The first thing that will be in my mind if I hear or see about this character, will be Gal Gadot's face. Patty Jenkins direction is amazing, same thing with the photography. Oh, and Wonder Woman's theme is badass.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Solid entry in the DCEU and for female-led superhero movies,"While not amazing by any means, Wonder Woman delivers its promise of a strong entry in the DCEU as well as the first truly good female superhero film.Gadot owns the role as Wonder Woman in the iconic character's first ever live-action adaptation on the big screen, breathing new life in the DCEU with a heroine that is radiant, uplifting, and relatable (a first for DCEU movies). Her performance as Diana Prince the character is very well done and her interpretation of Wonder Woman the warrior is excellent, the noticeably lacking some intensity in the final battle.Pine's Steve Trevor is a charming and charismatic English spy who has great chemistry with Gadot and gives an overall excellent performance, as does Robin Wright who plays Antiope, Diana's aunt.The rest of the cast give decent, but highly forgettable performances. Because so much of the film focuses on the core duo, characters like Etta Candy (Trevor's secretary as seen in all the trailers) and the three other members of Trevor's team do not get much focus.The villain is comparative to the subpar roster of MCU villains that can be summed up as ""fine, but forgettable,"" though there is a twist that is somewhat interesting. Ultimately though, nothing to write home about.The plot can be considered ""above average Marvel movie"", which is absolutely fine. It's better to have a simple and solid story rather than try too hard to have an overly complex one like previous DCEU films. The pacing of the movie can be compared to that of Rogue One. While the action scenes are better spread out and the movie has a riveting final thirty minutes, a decent portion of the middle is slow and boring. A bit too much time is spent with characters we don't care much about, leaving the movie a bit watered-down.Immediately noticeable is how saturated, bright, and colorful the film is compared to the previous doom and gloom DCEU movies. Themyscira is an absolutely gorgeous sight to behold and Wonder Woman's beautiful costume truly shines as one of the best looking live-action superhero costumes I've ever seen. The action scenes are fairly well filmed, though the frequent use of slow-motion can get a bit annoying at times.Read my full review at http://tinseltownreviews.blogspot.com/2017/06/wonder-woman-2017-new- hope-for-dceu-and.html",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman,"I had been waiting for this film for over a year. I had my exam yesterday but I was more worried about making it to the theater on time. I finished the exam within an hour and 15 minutes and rushed to the IMAX. I was not disappointed. I cleared the exam and the movie was good.Wonder Women is the best DCEU movie till date.It hooks you right from the beginning. You see the beautiful world of Themyscira and want to join the beautiful ladies in their quest. The CGI sequence telling the story of Zeus and Ares is brilliantly done. I hate Slow-Mo but Wonder Woman used it in a good way. It was a thrilling experience to watch it on an IMAX screen. It made me wonder if I was really watching a DC film. It did not feel like a DC film at all.Most of the DCEU movies have suffered from the same problem. They take things too seriously. I mean, I love Batman and I love the dark atmosphere they create in those films but what's the problem with one or two good jokes? Most of their films maintain the same dark tone throughout the run-time. When they decided to go the Marvel in Suicide Squad, it turned out to be a big turd. Fortunately, Wonder Woman does not suffer from the same problem. It works on multiple levels. It has got style with substance. It has got action and emotions. It has a got a good foundation, over which multiple layers are placed beautifully. There is character development and you get to see how Wonder Woman becomes Wonder Woman. Now, this may sound like I am exaggerating but DC has disappointed me so much in the past that WoW feels like a breath of fresh air.Acting wise, Chris Pine was brilliant but it is Gal Gadot who stole the show. She was made for this role. Her transformation throughout the film is brilliant. To be honest, watching her kicking some butt on the big screen was worth the money and wait.It isn't without faults though. The biggest problem with the film is the climax; I saw it coming from a mile away. Also, the ending is a bit too much CGI and made me feel like I was watching a Michael Bay or Snyder film, which kind of ruins an otherwise amazing experience.So Wonder Woman is a good film and I would suggest you watch it on the big screen. With this film, DC has finally understood what they need to do in order to make a good film. It has given them a much-needed start. I just hope they don't mess it up in future. Now, I am excited for Justice League.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Above the Rest,"""Wonder Woman"" is the answer to the DC universe's prayers. It focuses on telling a story without trying to be edgy/trendy. It takes its time to develop Diana, as well as the world around her. As the film progresses, you see her grow into the character she was destined to be as she breaks past her naive perspective on how the world and the humans within it work, and it was nice to see a basic super hero flick with some depth. Most of the action sequences are polished and entertaining, but sometimes they bring a touch of reality to a scene, and play an integral part to her growth. Sadly the climax turns into the usual, with a villain encounter that undermines what the film was trying to accomplish with his cheesy performance and light show of a battle. There were also drawn out jokes and scenes that wasted precious screen time, but it manages to end strong despite, and I still say it's a step in the right direction for the genre. It's time for less trends, and more good story telling.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

You'll be seeing lots of colorful wonders when you're with this Wonder Woman,"For the past 76 years, Wonder Woman has been such an iconic female character in the DC universe. She always proves that if men (superheroes included) can fight against the darkness, the women can do it too. With her sword, shield and Lasso of Truth, she fights for what she believes in and is always there to help those who are weak. Now the time has come for Wonder Woman to make her way to the big screen for the first time ever and the results are phenomenal. And if you remember Lynda Carter stepping into that costume and saving the day in the classic '70s show, then you will definitely remember Isreali sweetheart Gal Gadot as the feisty, tough and big-hearted superheroine. After her scene-stealing debut performance as the Amazonian princess in the flawed, but totally entertaining ""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice"", I say it's about time that a female superhero gets her chance to shine in her own film. After a year in waiting for this movie to come out, I can say this with a happy heart, this movie is the ride that definitely lives up to the hype. Deftly directed by Patty Jenkins, who gave Charlize Theron an unforgettable performance--and an Oscar---as the serial killer Aileen Wuornos in ""Monster"", ""Wonder Woman"" embraces its origin story with enough humor, heart and stunningly choreographed action sequences that it never drags or sags, it just comes alive in a real colorful way. Born in the all-female island of Themyscira, Diana (Gadot), daughter of Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), has always wanted to be a warrior just like her mother and her aunt Antiope (Robin Wright). In the years that followed, Diana has been training and preparing for action, but discovers that she has powers that are astonishing. Next thing we know, a young soldier named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) lands on the island and Diana is exposed to a more darker side of human nature where bullets are ripping out of their guns and lives are lost. Steve manages to warn these ladies that war is coming (the World War, in fact) with highly impossibly created weapons invented by Doctor Poison (Elena Anaya) and General Lundendorff (Danny Huston). So Diana leaves her paradise home and travels to London with Steve to fight and to find the one God that actually caused it (I think you know what I am talking about). Part of the fun and heart of this movie is watching Diana exploring and learning about the good and dark side of life. As war causes pain, casualties, and emotions, they can sometimes bring us hope that the world can change, even if it's not as better as one would expect. Along the way, Diana and Steve got the help they need in some unlikely characters including Steve's smart assistant Etta Candy (Lucy Davis), a Scottish sharpshooter named Charlie (Ewen Bremmer) who is struggling with PTSD and a master of disguise named Sameer (Said Taghmaoui) as they fight their way into enemy territory with lots of surprises left in store for them. After the superb ""Man of Steel"", and the flawed, but somewhat good ""BVS"" and ""Suicide Squad"", ""Wonder Woman"" is the DC film I've been waiting for. Here is a rousing, colorful and heartfelt adventure that has big laughs, cool action, characters that you can actually root for and a climax that may be as typical as one might expect from a superhero movie, but it's filled with more emotional power that some might not see coming. The cast that Jenkins has managed to put together, including the awesome David Thewlis in a pivotal role you have to witness for yourself, is amazing. I've always been a fan of Chris Pine's work, following his best performances in the brilliant ""Hell or High Water"" and the ""Star Trek"" films. The cocky demeanor that he brings to Captain Kirk is actually quite useful in the role of Steve Trevor and he has an real undeniable chemistry with Gadot. Plus, the screenplay by Allan Heinberg gives us dialogue that crackles with sly humor (Most of the hearty laughs comes from Sameer, Etta and of course, Diana & Steve) and a lot of exposition that creates a more streamlined plot that is more reserved for a film like this. To end this review, let me say something about Gal Gadot. It's not easy to fill the shoes of Wonder Woman that was once inhabited by Lynda Carter. But she makes it look effortless and puts a lot of hard work into the character. She gives such a remarkable and endearing performance as Wonder Woman and I think this is the one that might actually make her a big star and the character that I can't wait to see again. She's wonderful. So is the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A surprisingly powerful film,"The DC Universe gets a powerful boost with Patty Jenkin's engaging, thrilling modern tribute to the Wonder Woman legend. The trailer did not do justice to this polished, beautifully rendered film with an uncommon heart, contrasting the increasingly tired, smug Marvel tone.The British supporting cast add a deeper flair to the proceedings, with Lucy Davis and David Thewlis offering smart performances. Gal Gadot channels a mixture of innocence, strength, wisdom and humour which reminded me of Christopher Reeve in Superman (1978). The script gives her performance a spirit and urgency which the origin story frame allows to flourish. Chris Pine is equally fine, balancing a challenging mixture of humility and bravado that gives the film a distinct edge.The parallels with Superman (1978) are particularly apt. Both films kick-started modern takes on legendary figures with colourful, exciting adaptations of origin stories. The actions sequences are intense, clever and filled with emotional resonance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best comic film I've seen!!,"Go and watch it! It's the best addition to the DCEU yet! Gal and Chris have great chemistry, all the actors' performances are superb, the music was MAGICAL, and when the film ended, I wanted more.But I suggest not to bring your little ones to see it, though.

"Entertaining, but unoriginal and a bit dull at times.","I'm not involved in the D.C. vs Marvel debate, but it's pretty apparent this film is a mishmash of the first Captain America and Thor movies. The plot is the same as Captain America (stop the evil rouge German general from using the spooky weapon he's making in his secret lab), while the romance and humor are very similar to Thor (a man/woman from a mythical planet/island awkwardly interact with human society along side their romantic partners).The plot doesn't move quite smoothly, and it's often difficult to determine how characters got from point A to point B. The secondary characters are forgettable, as is the villain (the perennial problem with comic book movies it seems). Chris Pine and Gal Gadot have great chemistry, and the humor mostly works, being lighthearted without becoming unnecessarily goofy. The action scenes are too few, and lacking the intensity to create enough suspense, but it's still fun to see Wonder Woman kickass, especially with that lasso.I won't spoil the movie, but the ending is a letdown down, and quite inexplicable upon further reflection. That being said, the stunning Gal Gadot carries this movie, and her performance so encapsulates the intelligence, heroism and beauty of Wonder Woman, that it's enough to make the movie worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wonderous and wonderful.,"Wow.Let me just get this out of the way. I love both Marvel and DC. I want them all to be good, but if I'm being honest, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad are complete misfires. They're both messy, mishandled, with a lot of corporate meddling. However, Wonder Woman is the complete opposite. This marks a second great DC film for WB in my books(I know there are people who love/hate Man of Steel, but I happened to really like it).Princess Diana, otherwise known as Wonder Woman here is fully realized and completely three-dimensional. She finally gets her due in cinema and I cannot be more pleased. She's idealistic yet naive, compassionate, yet stubborn, and brave. I typically dislike origin stories, but every now and then they can be very fun, and Wonder Woman is that exception. Patty Jenkins who led Charlize Theron to an Oscar, brings a story that is packed with heart without ever getting too over the top or too heavy handed. During the hype train I disliked the idea of Gal Gadot, mainly due to her inexperience as an actor. She slightly won me over for the short amount of time she was in Batman v Superman, but now she really won me over. I will admit, there are moments where she didn't exactly deliver her lines effectively, but I think the more she plays this character the more better she'll be.Chris Pine is great in the role of Steve Trevor. Again, while I thought some of Gadot's delivery felt dry or cheesy, she and Pine do have a great chemistry. I always preach about this, and even if it sounds like overkill at this point, but chemistry is so important with anything that has to do with romance. The romance here is solid and believable. In a very good way it was very reminiscent of Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter.The supporting cast are solid, highlights include Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright portray Queen Hippolyta and General Antiope, and they're not characters who get the short end of the stick, they actually contribute to Diana's upbringing. The supporting cast is good too. Pine's Trevor recruits a ragtag team, again reminiscent of The Howling Commandos in Captain America: The First Avenger.Taking a page off Marvel though, the villains are the ones who do end up getting the short end of the stick. There is a twist I didn't see coming, but even then it was a bit excessive and kind of out of place. I will say though, I happened to enjoy only Elena Anaya's creepy Doctor Poison out of the film's villains.The third act is slightly underwhelming, but the action scenes are fantastic. I was quite surprised as I was concerned about Patty Jenkins' ability to shoot action. Also they're lit in daylight and being able to see everything unfold is just pure eye-candy. Something I appreciated is that Jenkins also shows the casualty of what war brings and she doesn't compromise on the gruesome reality of it. Visual effects are good, but there are few moments where its so obvious that it's cgi. I'm not very picky in that department, but when it's too too noticeable, then it automatically takes me out of the film.I did mention Captain America: The First Avenger multiple times, and the film takes some influences and operates like it, but it's not a carbon copy at all. On the surface Wonder Woman might appear to be of similar adventures and superhero films that we've seen on screen, but it's moving parts and the little things it does that makes the film shine. With good character moments, humorous banter, and a resonating romance, it is the female superhero film that we needed.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wonder Gal shows Batfleck and Neck-snapper how it's done...,"We begin with Diana regaining possession of that old photo of her she so eagerly wanted in BvS, then flashback to Princess Diana as a child who yearns to be like the rest of the Amazons of Themyscira. Her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), is hesitant/hiding something from her, but eventually allows her sister/Diana's aunt, Antiope (Robin Wright), to train her to be better than the rest of the Amazons. She proves herself to be just that and so much more. After Diana rescues Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), whose crashed plane from World War I penetrated Themyscira's shield/cloak, their two worlds collide. Once Steve's subjected to the Lasso of Truth (Pine's equal parts amusing/utterly believable when under its influence), Diana's convinced the Amazons' old enemy, Ares the God of War, is behind 'the war' Steve speaks of and is determined to help the world of man.Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman was the stand-out in BvS, and proves the skeptics incorrect about that simply being a 'fluke' due to her limited screen-time. This movie rests on her shoulders, and Gadot proves more than up to the task of portraying Diana as brave/courageous/intelligent/'badass' and, most of all, deeply empathetic/compassionate (not just regarding people, but animals too). She radiates warmth and her performance is, at times, heartbreaking (especially during the really emotional scenes). Gadot also has good comedic timing/delivery of lines (like when she discovers ice cream) and is just so likable, endearingly earnest, but genuine. Everything a hero *should* be (unlike other certain so-called 'superheroes').Pine's Steve is far more likable than his Kirk. He does a lot with what could've been a thankless role and, like Diana, Steve proves himself a hero. He helps Diana adjust to being in a new world, teaching/explaining things to her, but is never condescending. Both actors 'click', especially in the boat scene when leaving Themyscira. They have an easy chemistry; their banter is fun and Steve/Diana's respective fish-out-of-water scenarios allow for some amusing moments without verging into silliness. They respect each other, neither one is ever portrayed 'negatively' to 'prop up' the other (even when they argue), and it's one of the only comic book movie romantic pairings (that's been developed over the course of just one movie) which I've found truly believable/has actually had any emotional impact.Steve's secretary, Etta Candy, also provides some humour, though thankfully isn't too annoying. She takes an instant liking to Diana (you can see why) and Diana respects her in return. See, other comic cook movies? Mutual respect between characters isn't THAT hard! Steve's other trusted reinforcements only get small amounts of screen-time, but each feel like fully-developed/proper characters with depth/flaws. The camaraderie that forms between them and Diana is earned/believable, bringing real 'heart' to the story.On the villains' side there's Danny Huston's Ludendorff, who Diana believes to be Ares, thus providing Diana with an adversary she can beat up/someone you really want to see her kick the arse of. Even better, though, is Elena Anaya as Doctor Maru aka 'Doctor Poison' (she and Ludendorff make a truly twisted pair, with a sick sense of humour that at least makes them more memorable than the typical comic book villains). I've been impressed with Anaya's previous work, and she conveys so much whilst acting with half her face behind a mask. In a scene she shared with Steve, I even felt for her (Pine does well here too). I appreciated the moment between her character and Diana near the end, and that it didn't go quite the way one might've expected.While the Amazons are only in the beginning of the movie, they still make a strong impression. Witnessing them in action is quite something to behold. Despite Hippolyta and Diana often disagreeing/arguing with each other, Gal Gadot and Connie Nielsen completely sell the love their characters feel for each other (as well as ALL the Amazons). At first David Thewlis feels underutilized as Sir Patrick, who helps Diana/Steve, but later on shares a scene with Diana through a window that I thought was visually interesting.The music throughout the film packs an emotional punch, and those complaining about 'overuse' of the awesomely memorable 'Wonder Woman Theme' (which we got a taste of in BvS and this film's trailers) need to hush, as it's only used sparingly/at the RIGHT times, mostly during the epic fight scenes (proving almost as 'iconic' as the 'Superman Theme'). Speaking of, this movie gives us something *different* with the hero's style of fighting. Her use of sword, shield, bullet-deflecting bracelets, as well as the Lasso of Truth, makes for some stunning/inventive action sequences.Regarding complaints of 'too much CGI' during the climax, given who was fighting who and the power at their disposal, the effects on display were justified. The Wonder Woman costume doesn't get enough credit for being true to the comic whilst also being functional/non-gratuitous/non-exploitative (no star-spangled panties here). The first time she shows it off in the 'No Man's Land' sequence is very memorable. Not only is it one of the movie's best scenes, but it also deserves to be right up there alongside the first time Superman saves Lois as far as immediately 'iconic' (there's that word again) sequences go. Diana's other costumes are also gorgeous, as is Themyscira ('Paradise Island' indeed). The film feels like a classic action/adventure movie. It's well-paced, has plenty of heart, and is indeed one of the best comic book movies in LONG time.Naturally, it'll have its detractors/nitpickers, but this is one movie where the hype is warranted/to be believed. It's everything I've been waiting for/wanting to see in a superhero movie for so long. This isn't just easily the best DCEU movie so far, nor is it simply an excellent superhero movie, it's also a triumph for the first big screen adaptation of Wonder Woman and an enthralling cinema-going experience/one of the best movies in recent memory. Everyone involved with this film should feel proud/pat themselves on the back for this accomplishment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Gal Gadot magnificently does well bringing Wonder Woman to life on the big screen.,"We saw a glimpse of what was to come in Batman v Superman (2016) when Gal Gadot appeared as Wonder Woman. Finally after so many years, Wonder Woman has her own movie and Gal Gadot magnificently does well in the titular role.Wonder Woman starts off by exploring the origins of Diana Prince being born and raised on the island of Themyscira being raised by her mother Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and later undergoing secret training by her Aunty General Antiope (Robin Wright) to become an Amazon Warrior to which Hippolyta forbids at first but later relents. Things change when Diana rescues pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) after he crashes off the coast of Themyscira while trying to escape from the German military. Steve reveals that he is actually a spy and has uncovered a sinister plot by General Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and his chief chemist known as Dr. Poison (Elena Anaya) to develop a bioweapon that is deadlier than mustard gas. Steve wants to put a stop to the deadly bioweapon and Diana, believing that Ares is behind World War I, wants to help Steve.Gal Gadot is a welcome addition to the DC superhero franchise and deserves a well earned spot as one of the best superhero portrayals as Wonder Woman. Not sure what Wonder Woman would have turned out to be like had the plans for a movie came to fruition in the late 1990's and in 2009 with Megan Gale almost earning herself the role however the movie never eventuated.Chris Pine who is frequently cast in leading man roles does well taking a step back and playing second fiddle as Steve Trevor to Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman. He is not a wimp nor is he relying on Wonder Woman all the time, but still wants to prove he can hold his own and lead the charge to prevent the German's deadly plot. The rest of the supporting cast including Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, Danny Huston (a quality villain), Said Taghmaoui and Ewen Bremner (can't do any wrong) also do well in their respective roles.Director Patty Jenkins does a terrific job bringing Wonder Woman to life. Well known for the crime drama Monster (2003) which netted Charlize Theron an Academy Award for Best Actress, Patty Jenkins also earns the distinction of being the first woman to direct a superhero movie.The only downside is that it could have done with more action and less time on the backstory. That being said, the movie was far from dull.After seeing the various trailer of Wonder Woman beforehand, it certainly lived up to the hype. The movie was definitely well worth the experience and I left the cinema very content and fulfilled. Wonder Woman has deserved its popularity with critics and audiences alike, and it looks like it will be one of the most popular movies of 2017. Audiences are sure to see more of Wonder Woman pop up in Justice League in November 2017 and any future sequels down the track.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"If you watched the Carter original, you will be sadly disappointed.","Anyone who saw the original Wonder Woman movie, as bad as it was,wlll find the original far superior to this piece of crap even though the newer version is full of cinematic gimmicks which the original did not have.Lind Carter was not the greatest actress but compared to Gal Godot, Carter was by far the best Wonder Woman. Besides Carter is beautiful, Gadot is very unattractive. I suspect that those who exalt this film are feminists.And compared to the original movie, this one is badly directed. It lacks cohesiveness and credibility. It is as others have noted, a badly flawed flick. If you go to watch it, don't have high expectations because you will really be disappointed. The flick got a lot of undeserved praise.The only reason I went to see this flick was to take my 14 yr. old granddaughter and my 17 yr. old grandson. My granddaughter loved the movie, my grandson was bored by it, thought it was a waste of time. But I can understand why anyone who is still a juvenile at heart might enjoy this fantasy. Also, why viewers who were not old enough to watch the original Wonder Woman had nothing to compare the latest flick with the original. It is like the James Bond movies. The original Sean Connery versions were by far the best but as the movies went on and new actors became James Bond, they couldn't match Sean Connery. Likewise Gadot is no Lynda Carter. And I don't mean to compare the James Bond movies with the DC movies because the DC movies including the latest Wonder Woman are not even close to being in the same class as the James Bond movies. It is like comparing the Untouchables with the Brahmans.Another thing that one has to wonder. Wonder Woman was not released until June 2, yet there were so many reviews written prior to that date. So is someone stacking the deck in order to get people to watch the flick?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Greek Mythology, Super Heroines, and the Great War","Wonder Woman is a 2017 DC superhero film. The story follows Diana, a young princess of the Amazonian women of Themyscira. Diana grows into a strong and formidable warrior and is eventually introduced to the outside world when a pilot from the Great War crashes near Themyscira. The Amazonian princess saves the man's life and is soon swept up in the conflicts of the outside world.Wonder Woman is a fun and action-packed film. The battle scenes are fantastic and there are a few genuinely funny moments. Incredibly moving at times, Wonder Woman is a great superheroine film.If there are any critiques of the film that could be made, it is probably the few jokes that don't work. They are cringe-inducing, but thankfully, those moments are few and far between. Another point to be made is that most superhero movies, especially origin stories, must always deal with the reactions of normal people to the super- human abilities of the hero. This film glosses over this detail and no one is particularly amazed at Diana's powers. However, these are minor critiques.Overall, Wonder Woman is a great film. Nearly all audiences will find something to enjoy in this movie. Fans of the comic books are especially in for a treat. While no extreme changes are made from the newer source material, fans will be very happy to see their favorite heroine done well in a good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
an insult to the million humans that were slaughtered in the war,"Sorry for my English i am not a native speaker.SPOILERFirst of all the movie was good in terms of cinematography and CGI. That is one of the few good things I can say about the movie. To me it is quite shocking that most people don't see the heavy propaganda in this movie. Really, it is a pity as the movie could have become a quite good anti-war movie. Instead they decide that Wonder Woman takes side with the allied forces and they do very little to show how both sides were slaughtering their own people for their imperial demands. Why do they show only the Germans to use poison gas? Churchill had no problem using poison gas against civilists as he stated 1919: ""I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes"" Why don't they show the British empire enslave the people of their colonies? Why don't they show the peace movement in all countries over the world? Why doesn't wonder woman join THEM instead of one of the obviously equally evil fighting forces? They could have shown the revolutions in all over europe that actually did a lot to end the war. Instead they make a propaganda flick for a ""humanitarian"" war.A pity.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Movie in DC's Cinematic Line-Up So Far,"Following her cinematic debut in 2016's Batman v Superman, Gal Gadot returns as Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman. Raised on the island paradise of Themyscira and trained as an Amazon warrior, Diana's world is forever changed when American pilot, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), crash lands on the island's shores. Learning from Steve about World War I (which they call the war to end all wars), Diana leaves her home in hopes of bringing the conflict to an end. Following DC's previous mediocre superhero films, Wonder Woman is a vast improvement. Not only is the film's action stunning and gorgeous eye candy, but it also has a strong, cohesive plot line that audiences can get invested in. The biggest praise, however, has to go to Gal Godot and Chris Pine for their respective performances. Diana is a hopeful hero, not one to angst or brood like some other superheroes. While she is a more than capable fighter, in this film she is shown to be quite na√Øve about the workings of the world. This pairs nicely with Steve Trevor, who, while a charming character, is more cynical about the world than Diana. He can also handle himself in a fight and is not in the film simply as someone for Diana to save. In fact, they often help one another out. The film also knows when to slow down from the action and focus on moments between characters, which give the film a more emotional depth. Now, admittedly the film's German antagonists are a tad one-dimensional, being the stereotypical German villains that are evil purely for the sake of being evil. However, this hardly hampers the film's enjoyment. Overall, this is the best film in DC's cinematic line-up so far. It is worthy of the praise and worthy of seeing in cinemas.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Good movie and addition to the DCEU,"To start with, I do enjoy the other DCEU movies. I loved Man of Steel, liked Batman V. Superman, and thought Suicide Squad was ""okay."" Wonder Woman is another one added to the DCEU that I would say I ""liked"".Some of the good things about Wonder Woman:1. The humor. There are good touches of humor here without making it too corny (Marvel is an expert at the corny humor).2. The romance. I appreciated that there was some of that in here and the relationship with Steve Trevor is what shaped Wonder Woman.3. The action. I am not going to lie, Wonder Woman kicks butt.Overall, this is a good movie. The editing is also not all over the place, which is a problem for all of the other DCEU movies. If I had to rank this movie, I would say it ranks like this for me:Man of Steel Wonder Woman Batman V. Superman Justice League Suicide SquadI do rank Man of Steel ahead because that is a personal favorite.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Moments of enjoyment,"For most people that go to the movies these days, they tend to keep a open mind to the tune of simple things; What will the movie bring? how will the director incorporate certain elements from comics to ""real life"" situations? etc etc For me, Wonder Woman turned out to be one of those movies. Something that comics (DC in this case) expressed in comic books and now have adapted to the big screen (minus the 60's television series and previous adaptations).Wonder Woman tends to be more action packed at times while carrying to the original idea on how Wonder Woman came to be. Some crude humor made its way into the movie early on then hits you with a dose of sequences full of action and explosions.For me it was worth watching but I'll probably wait till DC studios comes out with Justice League sometime soon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It has been such a long time since we had a truly optimistic, heartfelt, and passionate superhero film. It seems you either have to be super edgy (DC's BvS and Suicide Squad), or super goofy/sarcastic (Marvel Movies)... but Wonder Woman has found a way to navigate those awful waters and find what makes superhero films so great - the same way Richard Donner did with ""Superman"" 1978.So don't bother listening to haters - this film is a once in a generation flick, that resurrects the feeling of joy and optimism at the idea that there are ""superhumans"" and ""superheroes"" out there saving the day.Wonderful flick - and best CBM since ""The Dark Knight"" (Possibly ever - alongside Superman 1978). 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

the best entry in the DCEU cinematic universe so far,"While not a perfect movie, ""Wonder Woman"" is definitely good and by far the best movie of the DCEU. After the likes of ""Batman v Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"", my bar was set pretty low for this movie, and I'm glad to say that it exceeded my expectations.The beginning starts off a bit weak and exposition-heavy, which was slightly off-putting but still enjoyable enough. However, the second that Steve (Chris Pine) and Diana leave her island, the movie takes a turn for the better. It was refreshing to see that the two love interests in a superhero movie actually had chemistry for a change, and watching them interacting and learning things from each other was just a delight. Without a doubt, the middle was the strongest part of the movie, and the most enjoyable aspect was Diana and Steve's relationship, partly because of the script, but mostly because of the performances by Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. Speaking of Chris Pine, his character actually serves a purpose in the movie and works perfectly next to Diana. Both characters learn from the relationship and grow as people, Diana learning about the realism of the world from Steve, and Steve learning something from Diana's childish optimism, and that there is always something to believe in. Gal Gadot was a delight in the role of Wonder Woman. I was slightly worried while watching ""Batman v Superman"" because I thought she would play a bland and boring version of the character, but this movie just shoved that fear aside. Her line delivery at times could have been better, but it was the emotional lines that counted, and boy, does she know how to deliver a blow. Aside from that, the movie also raises a few interesting points about war and the goodness of men. It forces you to see war from the perspective of someone who never witnessed anything like that before, and who is genuinely baffled by this war and why anybody would choose to start something like it. All of this is brought up in some very powerful scenes, and the goodness of Diana can actually move you, separating her from some other ""purely good"" characters we've seen before, such as Superman and Captain America.Now on to the negatives. Most of the problems with this movie come with the villains and the obvious meddling of the studio. Let's talk about the villains first. There's two major villains in the real world - Dr Poison and a German general (I believe), but there's also obviously Ares, whom Diana is set on finding because she believes it will end the war if she kills him. The two ""real world"" villains were pretty generic and over the top, with unclear motivations and just completely forgettable. Without spoiling anything, ""Ares"" is not much better. There was a clear point in the movie where I thought ""Okay, this is beautiful, I hope they stop right here and end on a quiet, but enlightening note"", but they just HAD to shove in a major, over-blown CGI battle at the end, which I thought was completely unnecessary. It completely ruined the point that the movie was trying to raise, and if the ending was different, I would have given this movie a higher rating. Also, a minor thing that sort of bugged me (I know it bothered some people more, it was just a minor thing for me, though), is the excessive use of slow motion. I'm not really a fan of Zack Snyder, and as we all know, he really does go overboard with the slow motion. And yes, I know that the movie was directed by Patty Jenkins, and not Zack Snyder, but he was involved with the film and clearly had a role in it.All in all, this movie was definitely better than what I had expected, I'm just slightly disappointed that it went the traditional superhero route by the end when it could have been so much more, but otherwise, I think it's a great, fun movie that DC fans are going to love.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Unremarkable script, memorable film","Has major script flaws, courtesy of Zack Snyder and his signature male gaze. Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot do what they can, it appears. The result is strained but seems genuine.

But as the first film in a new push toward more female action leads, Wonder Woman is memorable despite being unremarkable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This is One Surprisingly Good Movie,"Wonder Woman is the latest film in the (up until now) failed DCEU and it seriously kicks some ass. With the 2016 arrivals of Batman V Superman and the atrocious Suicide Squad, expectations were tempered with this film and rightfully so. Batman V Superman may have redeemed itself with a self-indulgent but much needed director's cut and Suicide Squad...well, yeah-that just was terrible so any pessimistic antics regarding this film are sort of justified given the track record thus far. Well, I can say without a doubt in my mind, this is one seriously cool film. Directed by Patty Jenkins and also stars Chris Pine, Danny Huston and Robin Wright, Wonder Woman is the DCEU's Marvel equivalent to Thor and it is just as good, if not, better.First off, the film is very informative even to a layman. It doesn't treat things as common knowledge but it doesn't hold your hand either. This is a smart movie when it comes down to it because it doesn't rush anything. Everything in the film flows naturally, it doesn't feel like these characters are boring or that the story is not engaging. The pacing is very well set and for a film that is pushing 150 minutes, that's impressive. The acting is also surprisingly great. Gal Gadot as Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman is probably the most perfect casting in cinema history. Gadot is fierce, brave and absolutely stunning in her portrayal. It reminded me a lot of Christopher Reeve when he was Superman. The supporting cast lead by Chris Pine is also great. Pine is proving himself to be one great actor. With last year's Hell or High Water and now this, Pine is slowly proving what it means to be a movie star. Another stand out in the film is Danny Huston who seems to relish in villainous roles. Huston is really great here and I'm hoping he gets the credit he deserves. While there is much to praise with this film, there is also so issues I had with it as well. Many people were actually comparing this film to The Dark Knight at my screening. As much as I did like this film, I am also here to say: No. Not even close.The issues I had with the film were more so directed in the way of the script. While I thought the pacing was great in the film, I thought some of the dialog was horrendous and cheesy. The film does escape and shed some of the very things that landed DC in hot water but it also can't seem to escape one very damaging part of DC: bad dialog. While I am sure that many people are not going to care about a misplaced line or two in between Wonder Woman kicking butt and taking names during trench warfare, it does become a bit of distraction during the less exciting moments. The moments between Pine and Gadot are very melodramatic and feel more like a soap opera at times. Many people will like it, I personally thought the cheeky stuff was more so thrown into the film rather than feeling natural.Overall, Wonder Woman is a great addition to the superhero genre. It has heart, it is lighter than other DC films but also has the edge it needed to be a cut above the rest. Fans of Wonder Woman comics should be pleased and tickled pink by this lovely film adaptation and those of you who were skeptical can breathe a sigh if relief because this movie is definitely worth the price of admission.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"I never thought I'd be using the word ""adorable"" to describe Wonder Woman.","In DC's new installation, director Patty Jenkins and co breathe new life into the 75-year-old iconic character. Created for the purpose of ""fighting using love"", Wonder Woman had always been a interesting character to include in stories, but hard to pinpoint when it came to personality. After the last 3 DC movies I said no more for me. I'm glad a friend changed my mind on that. I didn't go to see it because it was the next chapter in a cinematic universe, I saw it because it told a story (and the hype behind all the critic reviews, of course). And there's a perfect balance to her: she's not sexual used by virtue of her appearance, and she's not a feminist. She's just a woman, who shows vulnerability, and wants there to be world peace. I was so surprised by how much they humanized her. Inspite of the fact that she was a stonehard killer, she looked at the world mostly through the eyes of a little girl. And I never expected that. I didn't just like it because it was a great movie, I also liked it because this is the best incarnation of Wonder Woman I've ever seen, even compared to the animated features. If you want a movie with great world history, a little bit of mythology, and an awesome ""new"" superhero the center of it all, I'd recommend checking this one out. This took decades to get to, and even Joss Whedon admitted it was too complicated for him to make. Don't watch this because of the Cinematic Universe, watch it because it's a good movie with (finally) a well-made message behind it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Its just OK,"I had heard some really good things about this movie, so I was obviously excited to see the film. After I came out of the theatre I couldn't understand what all the fuzz is about. The movie is just OK. I think it is closer to being bad than good.The acting is good. Most of the actors do a very good job in portraying their characters. The only two actors who I believe were miscast were Robin Wright and David Thewlis as Sir Patrick.Robin Wright just looked ridiculous dressed like that and doing ""stunts"" ( or better yet a CGI version of her). And David just made me feel sad for him, he was terribly miscast and his character was laughably bad.The action scenes in the movie are mediocre. They are full of pretty bad CGI and slo-mo ""money shots"" (trying to look like 300). It was very sad to see how they have an actress like Gal Gadot that is an army veteran and knows how to fight, being replaced by a bad CGI version of her.I must admit, there are some parts in the action scenes that were pretty cool, specially a fight in London.The first half of the film is pretty slow and had me pretty bored, it was really boring to see all the exposition and the Amazonian world. Actually, I was looking at my watch for whole run-time of the film.The relationship between the characters was good enough and believable. But there was a big problem, the movie failed in making me care for any character except Wonder Woman. When a character died, I really didn't care about it. I will give it this, I was glad someone died in a superhero movie.The ending was terrible though. It was a CGI culsterf*ck that reminded me of BvS. It was really unexciting and completely ruined the message of the film. And the final shot... it was so cringeworthy.I did enjoyed the ""feminist"" aspect of the film. I was expecting this movie to have extreme feminism and make all the male characters stupid or assh*les while the female characters are perfect. But the movie actually makes both male and female characters relatable and competent.In the end, this movie was just mediocre. It is nothing impressive and i wouldn't pay a ticket to watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not even bad in a good way,"I was very excited to see this given all the hype and positive reviews. Not to mention my girlfriend wanted to see it, and there's not many she actually wants to see.I doubt you can imagine the level of disappointment I felt by the time it was over. And I honestly have no idea why so many people think it's so amazing.WWI was a huge tragedy, but the first war that was very well documented. And I would have thought that if they had picked that for a setting, that there could have been some semblance of realism somewhere. Not to mention some way of involving her in events that actually, or at least, might have happened. So maybe that's nitpicking. But from start to finish, the plot in general had holes big enough to drive a warship through.I can't really comment on the acting as the script was so bad I don't think anyone could have saved it.It would have also helped if it would have had a great, or even good antagonist. But the villains here got so little screen time, they never felt even a little threatening.A good supporting cast could have made it better as well. But they too seemed to get no character development, and didn't seem to have too much of a reason to even be there, aside from the odd bit of comic relief and to remind us of how gorgeous Wonder Woman is.Technically, there was nothing special about it. The CGI was nothing special and the editing left me wondering how much had been cut out.On the plus side, and maybe the only positive about the whole movie, was that Gal Gadot looked great as Wonder Woman. But really, the only reason I can think of for all the glowing reviews, is that people love watching a hot woman kicking ass and taking names (and she didn't actually take that many names...but she did kick a lot of ass though)And in case you're curious, my girlfriend liked it a whole lot less than me.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This is Wonder Woman in all her glory,"#WonderWoman movie is simply amazing. It doesn't hold back, it pulls out all the stops, it doesn't reserve some parts for a potential sequel, it fully gives you this iconic Amazonian Warrior princess in all her glory. You'll be constantly blown away by what she can do because the film is constantly eager to show them to you. Gal Gadot has cemented her star power and the DC Cinematic Universe has redeemed themselves through ""Wonder Woman.""Starring Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Connie Nielsen, David Thewlis, directed by Patty Jenkins, before she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana, princess of the Amazons trained to be an unconquerable warrior in the mythical island of Themyscira. But Diana is unaware of her true identity. When an American pilot crashes on their shores and tells of a massive war raging in the outside world, Diana feels compelled to join him and fight alongside mankind to stop the threat and kill who she blames to be the cause of such destruction, the god of war Ares.Because it's a DC movie, much of the visual and the style of ""Wonder Woman"" is what you'd expect from a DC movie. But what's great about this one, which by the way the other installments unfortunately failed to do, is that ""Wonder Woman"" manages to inject entertainment, so it's not all brooding and dark and depressing like the way they've turned boyscout Superman into.And I think much of that is thanks to the fish-out-of-water aspect. This is a woman who comes from a place which has a significantly different culture than ours. And halfway through the end, the fish-out-of-water aspect becomes less about literally not fitting in and more about her misunderstood perception of us, mankind. So perhaps ""Wonder Woman"" is an example of a success story that happens when you don't give all the control to Zack Snyder and when studio heads don't meddle with the mythology and the filmmaker's vision and when things are not forced or rushed. The result is a story which you can tell has been given a considerable amount of thought process.Any doubt anybody may have had about Gal Gadot playing this role will fade away the minute she steps into the screen. Not only does she look the part, she's absolutely gorgeous, her acting is sharp, she also performs the action sequences with strength and elegance. She becomes Wonder Woman, they are now inseparable, just like we're all going to have a hard time imagining somebody else other than Hugh Jackman as Wolverine/Logan. This is Wonder Woman's debut on the big screen, billions of girls and women on earth look up to her as their hero, they have been anticipating this moment for years, so it is a huge responsibility, one that I think Gadot gracefully carries. Kudos to WB and DC Entertainment for entrusting this to female filmmaker Patty Jenkins who does an excellent job because more than just it being a great superhero film, ""Wonder Woman"" is a very well-made film. It's spectacular in every sense of the word.-- Rama's Screen --",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"One word: WONDERful. The tape has a truly altruistic heroism & heart; Justice, freedom & hope.","One word: WONDERful. Wonder Woman came to save the DCEU. It is a truly perfect film, a round movie from beginning to end that has its closure. It's even one of the best movies ever made. As the story goes many years before the other films doesn't need to leave loose ends or references to connect them with the rest of the universe. The origin is counted in the first half hour; in the island of Themyscira the scenes are quite colorful with a very beautiful tone, unlike what we were showing the previous films, although the plot is short and the characters don't appear much; Antiope (Robin Wright) is spectacular & Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) also does a good job. When England is shown the colors become tenuous (by the tone of the war) engaging the rest of movies; Diana (Gal Gadot) & Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) make an excellent dynamic duo, with good chemistry, charisma and companionship, have a kind of romance & complicity: pure dynamite. The dynamic reminds us of Richard Donner & Christopher Reeve's Superman, the serious drama tone to Tim Burton & Michael Keaton's Batman. Ludendorff (Danny Huston) is a transitional German villain for the plot but it's necessary; Doctor Poison (Helena Anaya) works as a villain, & the final fight with the hidden villain, Ares, is good but it lasts a very short time. If Patty removes that plot, the film stands alone because Diana fighting the Germans is delightful. The tape has a truly altruistic heroism & heart; Justice, freedom & hope; What Man Of Steel should have been. Excellent action scenes, very good choreography and very good production work. The soundtrack is exciting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Refreshingly different and successfully entertaining,"This is a refreshingly different super-hero movie: one with a female central character (Diana Prince - the name Wonder Woman is never used in the film - played by the tall and beautiful Israeli martial artist, model and actress Gal Gadot) and a female director (Patty Jenkins who previously gave us ""Monster"", another work with a central female personage) with a significant number of female support roles (Amazonian heroines, a chemist villainess, and a comedic aide).Of course, we've seen WW before in ""Batman vs Superman: Dawn Of Justice"" and we'll see her again soon in the forthcoming ""Justice League"". What works so well with this movie is that it is an origin story that stands alone and does not require the audience to have any familiarity with other super-heroes which enables it to reach out to a new (especially female) audience.The narrative is straightforward, starting on the well-realised Amazonian island of Themyscira and then moving, via 1918 London, onto a blood-splattered battlefield at the conclusion of the First World War. There are effective action sequences but also some nice humorous touches in a work that does not take itself too seriously and delivers handsomely on the entertainment front. Chris Pine is ideal as the good-looking American who leads Diana from one world to the other and introduces her to the best and the worst of humankind, while David Thewlis is interesting casting for a vital dual role.The flaws in the film include the easy defeat of the main villain (after all, he is a god) and an excessive running time and some feminists will criticise the portrayal of the titular heroine, but overall the work is a major success that deservedly will do well at the box office.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
enjoyable,"So we bought our tickets and our medium sized popcorn box (usually lasts about 15 minutes in the movie), grabbed the 3D spectacles and sat in the theater to watch Wonder Woman. That's the way to do it. Each genre has its rules and one needs to know a minimum of them before entering the cinema theater or starting to see a movie on TV or on his/her preferred viewing device. When I chose to see a super-heroes comics inspired movie I do not expect a lot of realism or credibility from the story, and these are not the films where I am looking for lessons about life. On the other hand I am ready for fun entertainment, for action and special effects, I hope to see a coherent story with actors performances that make me care about the characters. I do not care about the laws of physics, but I hope there will be some humor and that the good guys will eventually prevail.Many of the super-heroes movies nowadays do actually carry some cultural background, it's just a different type of culture, and it helps, although it is not mandatory, to know it. 'Wonder Woman' is a character that combines the mythology of comics stories with the other mythology, the ancient Greek one, the one we read about and maybe learned about in school. Invented during WWII, at a time when women were playing an increasing role in supporting the war effort, mostly by undertaking the roles played in economy by the men sent to fight, but not on the first line of the front, the character of princess Diana (yes, this is the name of the character) carries a strong feminist message. The authors of the script and director Patty Jenkins moved the origins of the story to the end of WWI, the war that was supposed to end all wars. By the way, hard to believe that this talented director is at her only second film, and that 14 years passed since her remarkable debut with Monster. They brought the princess from her isolated island somehow hidden in the mist of mythology, in a tentative to really end all wars. We all know that the tentative failed. In the process the hero will learn a few things about men and evils of mankind, will avoid and block a whole arsenal of bullets and bombs and will kick many bad guys to dust.I enjoyed 'Wonder Woman' because of a few good reasons. The feminism of the message is never dogmatic and almost always impregnated with a dose of self-irony. Gal Gadot who plays the lead role may not be a great actress, but she has the looks, is very well fit physically and typologically for the role. The film is very much the story of her coming to age while learning to understand mankind and fighting on the side of the good guys. She does it with the smile of a teenager on her face and radiates optimism and belief in truth which somehow becomes credible and succeeds to overcome the horrors of the carnage fields of the world war we see on screen. While playing well on the mythology grounds, the story has enough humor to avoid being dry or pathetic and lets us understand we are still in fantasy land. I also liked the special effects, especially in the opening scenes when the Amazons fight the uneven battle with the war machines created by men since they were lost in history. The color palette of the cinematography was well adapted to the different phases of the story, although the 3D spectacles made it (again) too dark - there is something that needs improvement in the technology here. I also liked two of the supporting actors - Chris Pine who succeeded to be the nice guy without being over-sweet (also because of the dose of humor invested in his role), and especially David Thewlis which I have seen previously in Fargo and who develops to be a formidable actor. I liked less the other characters, especially the bad guys, who were, well ... cartoonish. The end of the story was a little disappointing. It looked like one of these epic superheroes endings, but the careful preparation and building that preceded prepared me for something better. It leaves however clearly the path open for the sequels and I will be making reservations when pre-sales tickets become available.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great Hero, Great Movie, Great Return","Wonder Woman is great! When the first trailer was released I was quite pumped already. I've always liked Wonder Woman and it was great to finally see her in the silver screen with today's effects and all.Wonder Woman is a great hero. She's strong, intuitive, and tough while still being both compassionate and kind which was essential to her original character; and this movie keeps true to that. Diana in this movie has those same characters and Gal Dadot's performance was very believable.The movie is essentially an origin story which can be hit or miss. The DC Extended Universe movies have not been well received at all, but more on this later. The movie's color scheme is quite clever, showing the island Diana grew up on as a very bright and beautiful with everything outside of it being dark and dreary. It captures the intensity and grit of war, especially the time it takes place in, World War I. There's even a scene where they go into the trenches and it's quite authentic. There isn't a single filler character, even the side characters of the group of soldiers she links up with are entertaining and add a lot of flavor to the movie. My only nitpick is that the music seemed all over the place.This is also a great return for DC movies. As I mentioned before recent DC movies, such as ""Man of Steel"", ""Batman V Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"" (a movie I actually liked for just how fun it was) weren't greatly reciprocated and for good reasons. But ""Wonder Woman"" nails everything that DC movies in the past were great: balancing comedy and intensity. The movie doesn't have that many comedic moments towards the end but it does have that balance very well in the beginning and the movie benefits because of it.In the end, I highly recommend this film. I feel that it's one most people should enjoy, especially those who have been disappointed by DC movies over the past couple of movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Don't believe any rating below 5,"I'm going to go out on a limb and say that most of the really low reviews are written by anti-semitic bigots. I don't say that lightly, but with full knowledge of the faux controversy surrounding Gal Gadot's (an Israeli) casting as the lead. The truth is, this is an entertaining movie. You will enjoy it if you have enjoyed the Marvel movies or superhero movies in general. It has what the vast and overwhelming majority of moviegoers want. Action, laughs, feels and love. Also a hero that *gasp* isn't dark, ironic or edgy. Everyone in my family loves this movie. It's clean; it has no foul language and most importantly no blasphemy, nudity or sex. Is Gadot an Oscar- worthy actress? - no, but she works here. Does the CG get a bit muddy at the end? - Yup, but it diminishes the movie not a bit.

is she really wonderful? not for me!,"I'm sorry but this movie disappointed me! I read some of the reviews here and they are total bull and lies. Just because Warner Bros gave them an opportunity to watch the movie before others, they wanted to give a good fake ratings.Wonder Woman was supposed to be a breath of fresh air for Wonder Woman revival and to bring a female hero to the screen as it is dominated by male heroes.This movie was a huge miss for me, and I anticipated this movie so much, I knew it would blow me away and I just couldn't wait to see the movie. I ignored all annoying backslashes the movie was getting from fanboys, haters, nerds and anti-Israelis.The movie had everything going so well: the cast, everyone was amazing with the acting, flawless. Props, costumes and settings were top notch. I don't know how they built the old England but was it believable and amazing! I love Wonder Woman's costume so much.It had some comedy to it which were really nice.The story was the biggest gripe for me, I was quite surprised they put a lot of back story to Diana when she was little. But things just went down hill after she kissed the guy. Everything became a messed and it felt like the movie makers ran out of ideas, had budget restrains and just didn't know what to do so they rushed it.One thing I liked about Diana is her naive personality.So far the best DC movie which I approve is Suicide Squad. Every other DC Movies had not impressed me yet and I was hoping this movie would, but sadly DC missed the mark.The thing about Marvel's movie adaptations is that they aim the movie towards people who are aware of who the comic character is. But the story is freshened out for people who are not comic book readers nor do not know about a comic character. And for the hardcore fans of the character who are deep in knowledge with the character's story and universe. Marvel will add little nuggets, clues and cameos in the movie.However this movie just missed the mark. The movie was just aimed at people who don't know anything about Wonder Woman.Also anyone seen God of War Ares use thunder has his powers? shouldn't that be Zeus? also how could Diana be created if Zeus gave his life to create shield for Namascrara?One thing I hated about Wonder Woman is she keeps clapping her wrist together, that thing is so annoying! It is meant to reflect bullets and projectiles but why does she use it as a special attack???R0ttenT0mato obviously gave a false review ratings because of the backslash the movie was getting.Zack Synder wrote the movie, and after 1hr of the movie, the story just turned to mess. I don't think i will be watching Justice League because I was disappointed with this movie!Captain American First Avenger sucked, but Winter Soldier was too freaking amazing!

I have to say I wasn't very impressed by how the story unfolded but I did like how they presented the comic book hero, it gives us some insight as to who she is and some foresight with what to expect in future movies starring our amazon goddess.

"A fun watch, but nothing groundbreaking here.","Well, I was pleasantly surprised to see WW on HBOGo already, I was like, ""Hey, I kinda wanted to see this!""

Yeah, there were problems with the plot, and the acting could have been better, but my biggest problem with the film was the lack of character development and the historical inaccuracies. The vehicles (motorcycle especially) and aircraft, clothing, speech, everything - wouldn't even have passed muster for a WW II film, let alone one set in WW I.From the previews I had high hopes for this movie, and I really liked Gal Gadot as WW, but the movie overall was just 'meh'. I watched it and actually made it through to the end (unlike a few other reviewers) but I did find myself glancing at my watch more often than usual.So yeah, there have been better superhero movies, but there have sure been worse ones, too.

Great superhero origin story,"Patty Jenkins gave the character a softness that was perfectly combined with the harshness of the worlds created by Snyder, where the violence is not funny, the wars leave victims and consequences, and where the evil is defeated but it doesn't wash away the pain it generated. In that dark world, Wonder Woman's (and/or Gal Gadot) light shines brighter.All Themyscira is perfect and beautiful, as it is all Diana's origin. But the story told works in more than the literal level. The script is superb and well above the generic ones. We have the literal Diana's adventure that ends up with her becoming the hero we know. Then we have the interpretation of War in the world. The naive notion that Diana has, about ending the world by defeating one villain. That translates to the believe that in our world there are clear ""good guys and bad guys"" and with the defeat of the ""bad one"" the wars would stop, when is clearly way more complicated than that.
And it also brings the notion of the people that benefits from War and tries to influence humans to give to them nature of war and conflict, for their benefit. I'm referring to Banks that finance wars, the industrial military complex or just plain and simply the militar arm of x country.And then we have Jenkins really using the Snyder visual style, with amazing sequences and fights choreography with slow motion, but also a bombastic third act that can be a bit much. The villains could've been a bit better. And maybe a bit faster here and there, maybe. Maybe one or two less ""slow motion"" scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Fun, but a bit over-hyped","I enjoyed the film a lot more than the other DCEU movies. That being said, it was a bit over-hyped. The story fell a little flat to me. It was fairly predictable (I could tell who Ares really was as soon as that character came on screen). Steve's secretary (honestly don't even remember her name) was so one note. She obviously was written in to be some comic relief but she just didn't end up feeling real. Like for instance, Steve (who was presumed dead) shows up with a strange woman, and she just doesn't question it. Not too mention that whole scene in general was silly to me. Steve has made it clear that getting this notebook back to his superior is incredibly important, so why waste time making Diana try on a bajillion dresses. I mean, I know its to have a funny scene where Diana rips a dress as she tries to fight in them, but it just doesn't make sense in context of the movie. I will say though that I did like the war scenes. I felt like it accurately portrayed what war would have felt like back then. The desperation, the pain, the fear in people's eyes. And I also liked that the film had elements of PTSD in there. It brought another layer of realism in there. Those were some aspects of the story I appreciated.The CGI was lackluster. Certainly not the worst thing ever, but there was a number of times where it looked fairly obvious they were standing in front of a green screen. And they overused the slo-mo in fight scenes.I know this review seems fairly negative, but honestly the film was still really entertaining.

wonder women review,"It goes without saying that dark comedy is very difficult to accomplish. I would almost say it's harder to pull off than regular comedy because you need to be able to keep people invested in the dramatic aspect of the film, while still keeping them laughing throughout the majority of the duration. Director Martin McDonagh has matured as a filmmaker over the years, starting off with In Bruges, which was pretty much a flat-out comedy, to Seven Psychopaths, which placed him a little further into the spotlight, but I must admit that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is not only his best film to date, but also one of the best films I've received the pleasure of witnessing all year. From laughter to genuine tension and heart, this is a film that's pretty much perfect all around. Here is why I can recommend this film to everyone.After the tragic death of her daughter, Mildred Hayes calls out the local authorities on three billboards, publicly stating that they're not doing their jobs and not a single arrest has happened since the death of her daughter. While publicly displaying this is upsetting to some, she sees it as a point being made. Through some very cleverly written humor throughout the entire film, levity is brought to the table in times of sorrow, making this a very easy movie to watch. Although the story itself is quite depressing, this film is written in a way that will still find a way to make you smile.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

While I don't consider it good to compare, it was inevitable to remember similarities with Captain America: The First Avenger.But I won't deny The goosebumps i felt while Wonder Woman fought, while 'Is She With You?' was played (composed by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL).

Slow motion and SJW service spoil an otherwise great film,"It has to be said. This is the best DC film since the Batman Trilogy from Christopher Nolan. The story is engaging, the characters well developed and even the humour misses being corny. Two things take away from the experience:First, the slow motion effects. When they are well done, like in 300, they work incredibly well, but when they fail they are a major turn off. Zooms on the face or animated jump sequences look incredibly out of place and spoil the pace of the otherwise well choreographed action.Second, and I am sure a lot of people will disagree with me here, the political correctness agenda in this film. It's already a feminist film, by definition. But adding a native Indian American character to World War 1 just so he could utter that one line about the white people destroying ""his people"" is beyond ridiculous. And that's only the most blatant bow to the SJW community.I won't write more, with so many reviews already being up. If you can ignore the above, it's an enjoyable film for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Spotless Fun,"Gal Gadot is a real eye feast here, smart, strong, superb, clever and cool.

His part is a great addition to Gal's superior playing.Others are very well chosen, too.

Just another superhero movie,"Just another superhero movie. And by that I mean that it has a central hook to differentiate itself from other superhero movies (this is basically Thor meets Captain America meets a woman) but is letdown by an especially convoluted and nonsensical neverending ending - not only did it not make sense on a visual level but neither did it on a plot level with some of the ""twists"" and actions undertaken.Some of the bright spots include the casting, the first half for the most part, the rapport between Diana and Steve, and some of the action choreography when it's close quarters.Diana's naivete felt kind of out of place or overdone - sure she doesn't understand certain things about the outside world but she acts like a childish moron sometimes (like Thor without the undercurrent of angst and the general sense that he's that way all the time). Not to mention her ""resolve"" at the end is a bit unfounded considering she was right about Ares. Not only did that reveal make the Amazon women look like idiots but it also justified her belief in people and in a sense let them off the hook from being selfish and evil in their own way. She got to learn a lesson but not too hard of one and she was right anyway so oh well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A re-envisioning that works.....,"I'm old enough to remember the original Wonder Woman TV series. As a kid I got a kick out Linda Carter's lasso twirling, 70's fem super hero.Carter fitted the role beautifully and I have to admit skepticism, when I heard yet another remake, of sorts, was on the way, in the form of a Wonder Woman film.I was surprised therefore, at how immediately comfortable I felt watching the latest film. Gal Gadot is a perfect choice for the role of Wonder Woman. Her looks, athleticism and the somewhat exotic accent fit well into this franchise. Better still, the story line, whilst a bit contrived, works well enough to make this a mostly enjoyable, action packed romp.Perhaps the only downside being, what I felt, was a somewhat subdued and uninteresting performance by Chris Pine. I don't mind Pine but somehow I felt he was more fizzle than burn this outing. Look forward to seeing more of him in the Star Trek franchise where he really shines.Casting this small consideration aside, there's a fair bit to like here. Don't over think it or expect anything by way of a revelation, it is comic book super hero land after all. If you are sensible enough to sit back and simply enjoy this fun action flick for what it is, you wont be disappointed. Seven out of ten from me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very entertaining Marvel film,"Wonder Woman finally has a feature film in the DC universe. And it's Gal Gadot playing the infamous bad ass hero. I really loved her as Wonder Woman, she plays the character not only with a tough heroic persona, but also with a very strong sense of heart and morality. She brings depth and empathy to the role, which is of course very much needed. Chris Pine stars alongside Gadot, and I can't think of a better actor to play Pine's character. He is the love interest of Wonder Woman, a soldier she meets at the beginning. He is of course an extremely good looking man, but he brings more than just a rugged handsome face to the role, he also brings emotion and depth and his chemistry with Gadot is very believable and the audience is automatically pulled into their story. Their connection really en-chances the movie overall. Diana (Wonder Woman) and her personal growth in the movie is also a big part of the plot. We see her grow and discover things about herself and the world, we see her connection with Pine and where that goes, and then of course we get to see a lot of cool action sequences, especially towards the end when the true enemy is revealed. I give Wonder Woman an 8/10 overall, pretty entertaining well made superhero flick.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thanks DC... thank,"Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), princess of the Temicira Amazons, lives in, the island of the Amazon. While he was in his training guerrer, with the Amazons, receives an unexpected visit from Steve Trevor, a soldier of U.S.A. He said that the world is killing each other (Second World War). Diana could not believe it, so it follows that the God of War, Ares, therefore Diana with Steve van at the center of all the war to defeat Ares.Let's start with the actors. Gal Gadot as Diana Prince is the best part of the film (along with Chris Pine). In addition to the action that was very good, the character is a completely incorruptible. I'm a big fan of the comic, but Wonder Woman never interested me as a character, I really don't have so many expectations for this film, therefore i saw her on the Internet... eh... to follow. As i said before i had so much interest in Wonder Woman, but to see the film and how you think the character inspired me to follow this character. Let us continue with Chris Pine as Steve Trevor. Has Chris Pine you know very well of the Spinnoff/prequel trilogy of Star Trek (directed by J.J Abrams). It is a type that I, as an actor, and this character is everything expected of him. Great character with a great personality.Dc at the end makes a good film. I without exaggeration i left vomiting of the hundred, after seeing Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad. But with this film... surprisingly... no.I like very much the meaning of war that have in the movie, as if there was a God to do that peleasen between them/us. I really liked that part of the movie.The villains I liked. But Ares I liked much more than the other villain. The effects are good, but abused too many of the CGI, in the initial fights against the Nazis.Thanks DC 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Oh...Gal Gadot one ""Wonder Woman"" lights up the screen with her beauty","I had doubt about this movie, but Gal Gadots portrayal of Wonder Women was very nice it reminded me of my youth, when i watched Lynda Carter in the role, when times where much simpler.

A great change in pace for the DC Extended Universe.,"It was a good film, and a great change in pace for the DC Extended Universe, and I hope to see Snyder learn from this film with Justice League later this year. Wonder Woman featured a stellar cast, a fantastic lead, a great origin story, and beautiful score, but still suffered from some minor writing issues, and was a little too reliant on its CGI. Gal Gadot nails her role, yet again, and won herself a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or 7 out of 10 for Wonder Woman.

"Terrible, poorly written movie","This was a very bad movie. DC has another stinker on its hands. Most people are going to see it because the trailer was fantastic. The movie, however is not. It's just absolutely absurd. The SJW, feminist nonsense is just over the top. Gal Gadot is a terrible actress. The battle scenes are just garbage, as well as its treatment of the conflict and resolution. It's over the top absurd. How most of the professional reviewers haven't called it out is unreal. If you're a history major, interested in history, you're going to hate this movie and its message. It's just dumb. Wonder Woman basically has the same mentality as Emily Blunt's character in Sicario, and it's just as absurd.It's not a good movie. I can't recommend it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Finally a good DCEU film!!,"You know..As a comic book fan, The DCEU films has been very disappointing with Man Of Steel, Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad. And now we have a game-changer: Wonder Woman!!Wonder Woman is the 4th DCEU film and first live action feature film. Wonder Woman delivers good origin story, decent action (no over the top CGI destruction porn), good fight scenes, funny moment, nice romantic moments between Diana & Steve Trevor (Chris Pine).I was concern with this film back then because of the DCEU's poor reputation and Gal Gadot as an actress to pull off Wonder Woman in her own film BUT she and the movie proved me wrong. She impressed me as Wonder Woman, she embodied the character much like how Christopher Reeve embodied Superman, good job Gal. Im not a fan of Wonder Woman but I know some things about her and pretty much this film captures the essence of the character and story, I believe its based on the new 52 series. Im glad that Wonder Woman was finally given the chance to shine (giving a break to the usual Batman/Superman) and deservedly praised. WB needs to keep on shining the rest of the DC superheroes.I enjoyed Chris Pine as Steve Trevor: Cool, bold, courageous, funny, passionate and determined, Chris Pine nailed it. Him and Gal had chemistry. I'd love to see him again!I don't want to say much but Wonder Woman is worth watching. Its one of the best superhero films in the same sense as Superman 1978, Batman Begins, Iron Man, Captain America: The First Avenger and Spider-Man (2002).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Yes, she's Wonderful!","""It is our sacred duty to defend the world. And it is what I am going to do."" Diana (Gal Gadot)That's a simple manifesto spoken by Amazonian princess Diana, aka to us Wonder Woman. Here's a DC Comics hero to go nose to nose with the big boys from Marvel, at least on a par with the best of them. You go, Girl.From Diana's island paradise, Themyscria, to the WWI front lines, she remains steadfast in her goal to rid the world of war, starting with the one to end all wars. That she cannot end any of our wild wars, even as a demigod, is a lesson she learns.That simplicity is also naivety, but innocence is part of her charm leading to a satisfactory second act where the comedy is affecting in a heroine-out-of water motif in London.The love affair between her and spy Steve (Chris Pine) may be the best this summer because like her, it has innocence and idealism all in one. Although Pine's role may seem to be better written, the actors have an unmistakable chemistry. Do the characters make love? See for yourself, and let me know if you like the answer.The scenes of the origin at the island have a freshness I haven't seen this summer. Amazonian women fly like Cirque-du-Soleil acrobats to dispatch German soldiers; Queen Hippolyta (Connie Neilsen) and her sister, Antiope (Robin Wright), are as believable warriors as Thor and Wolverine, and certainly just as pretty. The idea of an island of competent women does more for feminism than all the high-blown speeches of sociologists, and without the rant.How Diana and Steve help the war to its armistice is part of the film's fun to figure out. The film does not have the rampant sardonic humor of the mature Marvel series (although the mercenary soldiers are amusing), and it relies too much in the third act on those old superhero staples, electricity and excessive mayhem. Yet it does have a heroine more interesting than many of the males who have dominated the genre.Wait, wait! Could a reason for its success be that it's directed by a competent Patty Jenkins? Female hero, female director. That's a Marvelous combination!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
BEAUTIFUL,Wow wow wow how beautiful gal gadot is! And the movie not less than perfect,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A wonderful film that draws too many comparisons.,"Wonder Woman (2017) is a triumphant movie that shows the comic book genre doesn't have to be dominated by men. Unfortunately, because it took so long getting here, I can't help but draw comparisons to other works that came before it, making Wonder Woman seem derivative. In fact, had this movie come out eight years ago, it would have made Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and Thor (2011) look like they were copying it. As it stands, though, Wonder Woman feels formulaic, even if the superhero is a woman instead of a man.I will grant that some of the jokes come at the expense of the ""fish out of water"" character of Diana (Gal Gadot), playing on her na√Øvet√© of the ""modern world"" for laughs (a la Thor) but with a more sexualized context because she's a woman. There were a few missed opportunities to add depth to the character via these circumstances, the interaction with Chief Napi (Eugene Brave Rock) being one of them (as the Amazons and the Blackfoot tribe were likely very isolated from each other). Either way, the levity helped to break up the incredible action sequences.The action sequences in Wonder Woman served a few purposes, both of which helped develop the titular character. The acrobatic style of the Amazons looks a little ridiculous when they're fighting each other, but thoroughly brutal when they're fighting anyone else. While she dominated on the battlefield, showing that she could conquer ""no man's land"" (an apt observation of her gender), when she struggled against the main antagonist of the film, her vulnerability made her a much more interesting character. After all, it's tiresome to see an overpowered character with no obstacles to slow them down. That being said, I think the film could have gone in an interesting direction if the antagonist got away since most superhero movies end with the hero winning.A wonderful film that draws too many comparisons, I give Wonder Woman 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

An Above Average Superhero Film,"I'm incredibly surprised by all the 1 star reviews on here. Is this really the worst movie you reviewers have ever seen? ""Woder Woman"" has it's flaws, sure, but is far from the worst movie i've ever seen. In fact, I found this to be one of the better superhero movies i've seen recently.As I stated before, this movie has it's flaws; the beginning of the film, while necessary I suppose to explain the backstory, felt fairly contived to me. The acting was mediocre at best (Robin Wright's character, Antiope, most of all) and the ""Amazon kingdom"", where Diana (Wonder Woman) is from, felt hastily pieced together. Once the film leaves the island, however, things improve quite a bit.Now on to some positives. I felt that the supporting cast did an excellent job in this film. Chris Pine delivers another solid performance, which is to be expected these days. Danny Huston puts in a believable performance as the evil German general and, in my opinion, served as the best antagonist in the film. Ewen Bremner also does a good job in his usual ""silly character"" role which has seemingly followed him since his first big performance in ""Trainspotting"". Gal Gadot does a fine job in the leading role, delivering what I felt was a fairly authentic performance overall.This film takes place during the Great War of 1918 which was an intriguing choice in my opinion. The setting seems pretty believable considering the context, which helps draw you into the film. The action scenes are, for the most part, well executed and aren't so frequent as to compromise the plot. This film does have a semblence of a plot, too, which is a big reason why I liked it. Many superhero movies forgo the plot for constant action, which luckily ""Wonder Woman"" does not do. This allows us a chance to spend some time with the interesting characters. I felt the humor in this film was really well done as well, and did not seem forced like so many movies do. It also fit the time period fairly well.The ending has it's issues, but overall I felt it climaxed at the proper time and ended at the proper time as well. While the runtime is quite long (2 hours 20 minutes), it never felt dull apart from the first 25 minutes or so. There is one particularly emotional scene right before the end that I felt was really well done, especially for a movie such as this. The conclusion leaves room for sequels like all superhero movies do, and while I don't really care for these types of endings, it was expected nonetheless.Overall this film is indeed flawed, but I still enjoyed it as a whole. it is certainly not worthy of all these 1 star reviews it is receiving (is this movie seriously on par with Battlefield: Earth? I think not). While I was hesitant to watch it, in the end i'm glad I did. Watch it for yourself before passing judgement and see if you agree with me. This is the best DC movie thus far in my opinion, and well worth the chance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Warped and too lengthy,"DISLIKES1- This movie is far too long and inflated with unnecessary lines. Diana is too preachy; her self-righteous monologues and dialogues contribute nothing to the film, to the contrary, they rob the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film.2- This is a fantasy/action movie but there is not much action and, the mixing of fantasy with an element of warped history does not help either. Of course the producers were aware of what they were doing. They deliberately depicted the Turks as the partners of the Nazi Germans who developed chemical weapons during WWI. Sorry, I am not a 5 year old and I know for sure that Nazi Germany had not existed until 1930s and the Turks had stayed neutral during WWII. Actually, to the contrary of what the movie shows, the Turks saved a lot of Jews from the hands of the Nazis. If the producers were looking for a Nazi collaborator, I wonder why they didn't chose a different nation who indeed helped the Nazis during the war e.g Switzerland, Sweden, Italy or Japan...I wonder if John Kerry used his influence over the Hollywood producers when he met them last February. Of course, one should know why the US has created so many superhero Hollywood characters. Such superhero characters have merely served towards the US's goals during the 40's, 50's and the cold war era against the Soviets (Capitalism V Communism). By the looks of it such superheroes will serve the US's foreign policies for a long long time to come.3- The message of the film is rather laughable considering the number of people Diana already killed, her shouting about love at Ares was particularly silly at this point. First kill and then send love messages. Yeah sure... We have seen this scenario in real life indeed. No, the world does not need a superhero thank you Bush, Obama, Trump, Kelly...LIKES1- This is not a low budget film by any standards. Costumes, special effects etc were all good.2- It is good to see a strong female superhero amongst the male dominated superhero characters.3- Fighting scenes were good but I would have expected to see more of them.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

DC makes a comeback!,"I'm going to start off by saying that in the Marvel vs DC battle, I am on the side of the former. Watching those films is just like breathing in a suspicious magic potion only to find that you're under a spell you can't break free from. But this review shouldn't be about Marvel. This should just be about me telling you that finally, it is now DC's moment to shine in the spotlight. This film is a renaissance of sorts and has been able to bring back memories of the glory days--when we were all watching the Dark Knight movies (gosh, has it really been that long?).There are some things that differentiate a good film from a bad one and one of those is character building. I have spent quite some time ""researching"" Marvel characters and reading their backstories, being the superhero geek that I am. But going into this film, I thought, ""I have no idea who Wonder Woman (aka Diana Prince) is and have only seen a rather dissatisfying appearance of hers in Batman vs Superman. Will I really grow to like her?"". The answer to that as I have found out now, is ""yes""-- a big one.This is an origin story so obviously, there was a lot of character building. We got to know where she came from, what her beliefs were and how that affected her actions. From her childhood to her adult life, she is shown to be a very passionate and warm individual but also very strong (literally, too) and aggressive when she needs to be, which is a beautiful equilibrium that somehow suits women the best. Greatness wasn't thrust upon her‚Äîshe was born with it. She didn't undergo a revelation in her mid-twenties and decide that it was time for her to save the world, because she was always destined to do that and she knew it.Gal Gadot, really proves her worth and makes every aspect of the character she plays, believable. A bit like Captain America, the world Wonder Woman discovers is completely alien to her and something about that genuine innocence catches my approval all the time. It is also a great source of comedy. I didn't watch Suicide Squad, so I may be wrong, but it seems to me, that this is the first DC movie that has been able to strike a very good balance between humor and gravity. Maybe they've tried to follow Marvel's footsteps, but no matter it has yielded good results. There is also a fair bit of romance in this film that a lot of other superhero movies of the recent past haven't had. Since that is another ingredient to add to the batter, I must say they've proportioned all the elements skillfully and have baked the cake quite well.The film is engaging right from the very first moment. The action and tension aren't too overpowering despite the backdrop, being that of the First World War. They're there exactly when we need them to be, to keep the rhythm steady. No part of the film lags behind and makes us want to see some extra pace.Another thing that stood out for me was the element of mystery right from the beginning of the film, made clear to the viewer. We know where Wonder Woman spent all her life growing up but we're never told exactly what her lineage is. That keeps us excited throughout the film, as we know there is something yet to be discovered. The twist in the last act really caught me off guard and is probably one the best ones, I've seen. Despite its long run-time it doesn't feel stretched, thanks to some great direction and editing.The plot is very well conceived and apart from the obvious powers that our lead possesses and their resulting effects, nothing seems too wild to be true; no deus ex machina, here. Chris Pine's character, Captain Steve is extremely likable as well and is the perfect friend and support. Along with some other people, he and Diana give us a great display of togetherness and form quite the unlikely team of heroes.However, a couple of minor shortcomings come to mind. The Amazons, Wonder Woman grew up with, don't end up being as important as they're shown to be in the beginning. They never really play a great role in anything much. I was hoping they would all come together to help our leading lady in the end but that never happens. Also, I'd have liked to see some of the events that transpired during the transition from the 1910s to the present day which lead WW to be in the place that she is now. But maybe that's for some other day.These points are still, not enough to deter someone from watching this film. It is enrapturing and comes at us like a dark horse. The best thing is that now, more and more people will consider making such films with a powerful female lead. Hopefully the upcoming DC productions will be able to build a tradition of quality on this strong foundation. Maybe then, I might even begin to question my allegiance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Conceptually Strong but Thematically Scattered, Wonder Woman is Both Fiesty and Flat","Superpowers affect the outcome of the first world war, as a crashed fighter pilot accidentally uncovers a secret island of warrior women and recruits their champion to fight for the allied forces. Once they've left the idyllic fantasyland of this island paradise, however, the femme fighter's deep-seated na√Øvet√© bubbles to the surface and our soldier splits time between babysitting and desperately redirecting the brunt of her morally-indignant rage toward the enemy.Flavorful and energetic, Wonder Woman has a lot of good ideas, but it struggles to unify them in a mixed setting. And, perhaps coincidentally, many of its central themes directly overlap with Marvel's competing films. It shares a ground-level war setting with Captain America. Mythological fantasy / fish out of water elements with Thor. Black Panther's insular society, deliberately isolated from the modern world. Each one has a unique twist, of course - tweaks and eccentricities to distinguish this character from the rest - but it's still all-too easy to draw those parallels, and the numerous comparison points make this film seem less daring and original. Poor effects work often lets Wonder Woman down, too. Particularly where the use of her powers are concerned, there's a stiffness, a distinct sense of detachment from reality, that robs important scenes of their implied power. We can see the strings, in other words, and that draws our focus away from the bigger picture.Gal Gadot certainly looks the part of an Amazon, a stunning mix of elegance and athleticism, but her chances to show personality and take ownership of the role are limited. For such a specifically character-driven story, that's a major problem. The supporting cast picks up some of the slack this time around, but presumably they won't be around for the forthcoming sequel, as it's set nearly seventy years in the future. All in all, this was a light dose of conceptual fun, but I'm going to need a better reason to stick around for the next one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Don't believe the haters; this is a great superhero movie,I am a guy so this may be a little slanted but this was a fantastic heroin movie. Wonder Woman is a powerful but naive woman of superhuman power. Great story line as she realizes the true human nature. The movie is long but for me never slows down and i wished it was twice as long. The actress playing wonder woman does a great job portraying a heroine who battles out of dedication and love for mankind with wide eyed enthusiasm. Yes the story get far-fetched like it is a good thing the machine gunner aimed directly at the shield instead of at her feat. But a great addition to the Marvel family with a great background story. In the end she discovers the power of love brings her the quiet confidence to defeat the god of war. Very romantic and maybe sexist but great heroine.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the better superhero flicks,"Although Wonder Woman is, together with Batman and Superman, one of the most iconic of all comic-book superheroes, she has not featured very much in Hollywood's long-running love-affair with the superhero movie, an affair dating back at least as far as the original Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" from forty years ago. This is surprising, because some much more obscure characters (Electra anyone?) have been dredged up from the Marvel and DC universes and given their own films. Hollywood has even taken to inventing its own superheroes, like Black Scorpion who was a film character first, a television one second and a comic-book one third.I have heard two possible explanations for the neglect of Wonder Woman. One is that, although she was originally intended as a symbol of female empowerment, her skimpy costume has made her more of a male fantasy-figure, and film-makers have been afraid that they will be accused of sexism if they allow her to keep that costume and of political over-correctness if she is forced to exchange it for something less revealing. The other is that the character is too closely associated in the public's mind with Lynda Carter from the seventies TV series for them to accept any other actress in the role. In ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" from 2016, however, she was given a supporting role, and now she takes centre stage.Superheroes fall into three categories. There are those like Batman who have no actual superpowers and rely upon a combination of athleticism and hi-tech devices. There are those like Spiderman and the Hulk who are born normal humans but acquire their powers by accident. And then there are those who possess superhuman powers because they are not actually human, like Superman who is an alien from the planet Krypton. Wonder Woman falls into this last category. She is an Amazon, one of a race of demi-goddesses created by Zeus to defend the world against the evil war-god Ares. (This is a version of Greek mythology which might have been unfamiliar to the Ancient Greeks, who generally regarded the Amazons either as mortal women or as daughters of Ares). Among the Amazons Wonder Woman goes by the Latin name Diana whereas all the others have Greek ones. Some might claim this as a goof, but this was her name in the original comic strip, and the film-makers doubtless wanted to respect tradition. In any case ""Diana"" is more familiar to English speakers and easier to pronounce than the likes of ""Hippolyta"", ""Antiope"" or ""Melanippe"".The story is set in late 1918, during the closing days of World War One. If Zeus charged the Amazons with watching over the world they seem to have been asleep on their watch because, isolated on their hidden island of Themyscira, they have been blissfully unaware of the war raging in the rest of the world until Steve Trevor, an American spy, crashes a stolen German aircraft on their shores. When Diana, as Wonder Woman is known on Themiscyra, learns from Steve about this dreadful conflict she leaves her home to try and end it and to thwart the machinations of Ares. At first it seems that Diana's task will not be too difficult because the German General Staff, convinced that the military situation is hopeless, have persuaded the Kaiser to sue for peace. The fly in the ointment, however, is General Ludendorff who believes that the war can still be won with the aid of a new type of poison gas invented by a brilliant but evil female scientist. (This plotline may owe something to the sixties movie ""Fraulein Doktor"").I must admit that I deliberately missed this film when it was shown in cinemas, largely because I had less-than-fond memories of the aforementioned TV series. Carter was undoubtedly one of the most beautiful young actresses of the seventies, but her talent did not match her beauty, and her fellow cast members were no better; I was surprised when Debra Winger, who played Carter's equally scantily clad little sister, later emerged as a successful, gifted and rather serious Hollywood actress. The plots, whether Wonder Woman was helping the Allies defeat the Nazis or assisting with law enforcement in contemporary America, were dull and predictable.Fortunately, the film is a lot better than its television predecessor. The statuesque Gal Gadot not only has the looks needed for the title role but also has the acting skills to go with them. There is another good performance from Chris Pine as Steve, initially a rather cocky, headstrong young man, but one who proves himself capable of courage and self-sacrifice.The relocation of the story from the 1940s to 1918 caused some controversy, but I felt it was the right idea. Wonder Woman in World War Two was always going to be a warrior in a partisan cause, fighting for our side (good) against their side (evil). Here Gadot plays her as a fighter for peace, someone who is not only strong and courageous but also loving and compassionate. Her enemies are not the Germans, but anyone of any nationality who rejects peace and seeks to prolong the conflict, and this characterisation gives the story a greater moral depth and power than would have been possible with a simple goodies-against-baddies storyline. This depth is emphasised by director Patty Jenkins, who gives the film a surprisingly dark and sombre visual tone, about as far from the cartoonish look of the television series as you can get. Superhero flicks have not always been my favourite film genre, but this is one of the better ones of recent years. 7/10A goof. The idea of producing a new poison gas by replacing the sulphur in mustard gas with hydrogen just would not work, scientifically speaking.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Exhilarating superhero spectacle from start to finish, Wonder Woman is an entertaining hit","After suffering from two cinematic misfires 'Batman Vs. Superman' and 'Suicide Squad', the DC cinematic universe has managed to find light at the end of the tunnel with this exhilarating superhero action spectacle Wonder Woman. Needless to say, the hype for this one is high. Introduced in the aforementioned Batman Vs. Superman and set to appear in the upcoming DC hype 'Justice League', the eponymous superhero is treated with a stunning cinematic experiment that brings more than just eye-popping visual heft and a pulse- pounding narrative. It firmly embraces the dazzling nature of the titular hero from the comic books without leaving out room for some political themes and a surprising emotional heft many entries of the widely popular genre neglect. This is all brought beautifully together by director Patty Jenkins, first female director behind a superhero flick in history. Furthermore, it marks the first female-centric superhero flick since the horribly panned 'Elektra' twelve years ago. This film follows Diane (played by Gal Gabot), a young lady born and raised by her mother Queen Hippolyta (played by Connie Nielson) on an island entirely inhabited of women. Upon saving Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine), a British pilot who crash lands into the ocean, Diane grows eager to help fight as a warrior in the European front during World War I. Against her mother's wishes, Diane sets out with Steve to Europe the defeat the God of War Ares who they believe the cause behind this tragic war -- all while becoming the famous Wonder Woman in the process.Whereas 'Captain America: The First Avenger' set its titular hero in the era of World War II, this one sets its hero in the height of World War I, the war that many referred to as ""the war to end all wars"". With the Great War serving as the backdrop of the plot, this open doors to some surprisingly clever themes surrounding the titular character and the atmosphere. As with many superhero movies, this one kicks off with an origin story showcasing Diane's upbringing in a world dominated by women, and her inspiration of becoming a warrior following her encounter with Steve Trevor followed by her family's harrowing attack by the German Army. The premise along the long journey that follows is greatly strewn together by themes of women empowerment, a political issue that ran rampant during the World War I era. Without overarching the story, the political themes and the story's ideology about mankind being the catalyst of war nicely fuel the versatility of the plot, especially when the hero and Steve Trevor come to the epiphany towards the end. Furthermore, the chemistry between Gal Gabot's Wonder Woman and Chris Pine's Steve Trevor is genuine and, unlike many action flick, never drags into ham-fisted territory. Both of their performances are swell, particularly Gabot who boasts great versatility in the lead role. And the humor, which pokes fun at the feminist themes throughout the picture, is surprisingly clever, if occasionally awkward. Like in many superhero entities, the action sequences which consists of a prolonged fight sequence on a rugged German battlefield, a fight sequence on a beach, and the final climatic battle at the end are all visually impressive and exhilarating to watch. The final fight sequence in particular sets stone to unexpected emotional resonance, while splashing the screen with abundance of colorful CGI -- more better or worse.Wonder Woman is a spectacular superhero action thrill ride from beginning to end, and represents nearly everything that makes a superhero movie entertaining. It is a film that defies against the disappointment of the DC cinematic universe's previous entries and marks a game changer for the DC comics' cinematic cosmos. It is not a perfect picture, but it is certainly one that is more than worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Could have been much better. But still a good watch, especially as it breaks into the male dominated superhero world. Bravo to Gal Gadot!!","A good watch, overall. It is a bit high on melodrama and they fail to do the justice to the character of Wonder Woman with weak background story. Having said that, Gal Gadot definitely gave her best, even though I feel she was more intimidating in FF franchise.Story (6/10): There is a fine line between sounding fascinating and sounding ridiculous and I guess the writers here crossed that line. Set up in the era of WW2 (1930s and 40s), Princess Diana of Amazon is raised in a well protected - all ladies - environment among female warriors of Amazon in a remote island where she is the only kid. As she grows up, she realizes her potential and super powers. The island is specially protected to prevent any attack from their nemesis, Ares. However, Diana has her first encounter with the real world when Steve crashes his plane near the island and Diana comes to know about the world war. This triggers her to help Steve end the war by killing Areas (who she thinks is responsible for the war) and, in the process, ends up discovering her true supernatural powers. The beginning of the story was very weak and that almost killed the story department. Certain events were inexplicable and not coherent with the events shown a couple of scenes back. Screenplay was much better than the story per se - some of the punches, especially related to Diana's first encounter in the real world were great.Acting (8/10): Clearly it was Gal Gadot's movie and she dominated very well. Her natural aggression without putting up explicit expressions gave her a good edge when playing a super woman. Her chemistry with Chris Pine was perhaps the next best thing in the movie. Chris Pine was amazing to watch. Besides the lead pair, two other characters made a very strong presence felt in the movie, Danny Huston and David Thewlis. Danny Huston was brilliant, playing a very intimidating character of Ludendorff - a German General. David Thewlis, playing Sir Patrick - a member of the Supreme War Council of Allied forces in WW2, was great to watch.Direction (7/10): Patty Jenkins made a good effort with a little weak story at hand. The pacing of the movie was quite good. With the above average length, he perhaps ended up creating more than required which could have been edited out. The climax, in particular, was quite long with hyper melodramatic sequences which tested the patience of the audience. His use of Diana's character, who was experiencing the male dominated world for the first time to convey an unbiased view of how things should be in an ideal world, was great. Aesthetically as well, the movie was made really well.Overall (7/10): Definitely to be watched, especially as it breaks into the male dominated superhero world. Bravo to Gal Gadot, whom we would love to see more in such strong characters - even if not a superhero.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Amazonian princess Diana's quest-come-self-discovery!,"From all the superhero films, this was one of the most anticipated. Mainly because of the woman oriented theme. People were desperate to see the solo woman superhero. Today, we have the great visual effects technology, that anything can be possible to bring on to the screen. And actress like Gal Gadot, even better it gets. Yes, it was a wonderful film. A simple storyline, but a well made film.The Amazonians who are cut off from the rest of the world, is preparing for the battle if Ares returns. All these years nothing has happened, but one day a fighter pilot crash on the cost of their island. Then the princess embark a journey back with him to find, and end the Ares threat forever. But she only ends up in the WWII, and what happens in the following sequence are the rest of the film.Who would have done a better job than Patty Jenkins. She nailed it, and so set to direct the sequel too. Even the supporting cast was good. DC's visuals always high standards and so this one. Action sequences too amazing. There's lots of changes in the character, as well as in everything. Firstly a nice superhero costume. And connections like Diana's father, the island, all pretty nicely written out. The DC universe just got extended. I can't wait to see 'Justice League'.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I'm torn,"Prior to this, I watched all X-Men/Marvel/DC (besides Justice League&Aquaman) movies and thought this was a pretty good watch.Yes, it had some flaws but overall I liked it, it gave a good introduction to Wonder Woman, her background and motivations, how the character thinks and what her identity is.After reading negative reviews, it makes you really want to hate this movie, all this negative energy.But no, I enjoyed it for major parts, I feel too much sympathy for it to give it less than 7*.It's not as complex as Batman v Superman, not as bad as Suicide Squad, it has a good mix of amusement, emotions, awesome settings/props/production, action. It has solid parts and I'd say it's close to be great.I think some of the villains had to be a bit more convincing and Gal Gadot, while she is extremely beautiful, had to have a stronger physique, especially stronger legs (but hey, that's maybe being too nit-picky, also she was pregnant) to give the movie the final push to be awesome. Also, the CGI was good for the most parts, but similar to 'Black Panther' it sometimes doesn't look 100% correct.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazingly stupid!,"I went to the theater with very low expectations after seeing the trailers, despite the extremely positive reviews and scores both here and at Rotten Tomatoes. I am deeply amazed anyone could give this garbage more than 2 stars out of 10. The acting is terrible, jokes are awkward, CG is the worst I've seen in years. Even 20 years old movies are better on that front. Almost every scene is with extreme DOF and all characters look like cut out and placed in fake and badly rendered environments. The lighting is totally off. The dialog is so horrible. I've read opinions this movie is much better that Suicide Squad. To me SS is in a different league. It is entertaining and the love story between Harley Queen and Joker is enough to make the whole movie. Wonder Woman is even worse than Batman vs Superman, which is one of the most boring movies I've ever watched.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A Powerful, Female Driven Superhero Film,","Wonder Woman is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. We were all starting to lose hope in the DC Cinematic Universe, and rightfully so, but this film gets everything that the likes of Batman Vs. Superman and Suicide Squad could not succeed in right. It has a great origin story for the character that does not go on for too long and is given enough scope for people who know very little about the character to understand. The tone is also perfect, it takes itself seriously and tells an engaging story, while also remembering to have some fun.I did think that the finale of the film was a little rushed and could have been fleshed out a lot more. Once the big twist is revealed and the character gets in to what we would call the final ""boss battle"", it went by very fast and got resolved before we got a chance to really get invested.The cast is all around fantastic, such as David Thewlis in a terrifically layered role and Ewen Bremner bringing great characterisation, as well comic relief. The highlight is without a doubt Gal Gadot, who delivers a performance as Wonder Woman that I believe will truly go on to be iconic, and Chris Pine as Steve Trevor. He had a presence in this role that was very intriguing, it was clear that the character really clicked with him, he was funny and charming.A widely entertaining superhero film that has a perfect tone that this universe should try to maintain. Engaging and great fun, Wonder Woman is miles better than I expected, largely due to director Kathy Jenkins' unique vision, it is a special movie that is different to most superhero flicks, worth the watch to anyone looking for a good adventure of fantasy film.When a pilot crash lands in her world, Wonder Woman heads to fight in a war, discovering her true destiny.Best Performance: Chris Pine",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Marvel in tears,"I always watch movies before reading reviews. Despite its mythology and practical inaccuracies, WW was very pleasant to watch and had the quality direction and artistic-sequences that Snyder used us to expect.I read afterwards the surprisingly too many hating reviews which could be categorized in 3 categories: those who judge as documentary commentators, those whose views are biased by Marvel and those who doubt the impartiality of IMDb.To the 1st I have to say that at this moment BBC produces a supposed accurate retelling of Trojan war, including black actors as Achilles and Patroclos. While in a first script of WW, she was supposed to be of extraterrestrial origin and Superman's kin! So you can understand my relief when I found out that it wasn't the case and that mythology damages were contained.To the 2nd I will retort that except Dr Strange and the 1st Captain America I didn't see any memorable movie or TV series from Marvel whose stories are inconsistent and boring.To the 3rd I would advise to check Box Office Mojo where WW stands 5th in all-time comic adaptations.Despite a few scenario holes and a couple of bad CGI, the movie respects the feminist ideas conveyed traditionally by the character and provides a good entertainment",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The film is a success due to Gal Gadot and Chris Pine's chemistry,"Much can be said about why certain films are a success. Do I think Wonder Woman is an entirely amazing or original film? Not at all. Do I think it has enough distinct features to succeed as what is easily one of the best superhero films of this decade? Definitely. It's great that here we have a film that actually tackles more relevant themes that include the brutality of war and humankind, rather than another generic Marvel ""Let's save the world from this evil supernatural guy."" The entire storyline and villains aren't a complete success, and sometimes there's some awkwardness to be found. However, the two leads of the film, Gal Gadot and Chris Pine, are endlessly charming and have such electric chemistry. Truly a great duo. Their dialogue together make up the best sections of the film and they're fantastic together. For that reason the film succeeds as much as it does.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"OK, but unbelievable action scenes; didn't appreciate sexual banter","I give the movie a passing grade if you don't think too much, pleasant entertainment, nice visuals and special effects.I'd like to make two negative observations: (1) I found it impossible to suspend disbelief regarding the action scenes. She's just a mortal (or so it seemed for most of the movie), and she manages to charge lines of armed enemy soldiers, deflecting hundreds of bullets coming at her all at once in different directions (even with her bracelets, etc). (Superman came from a different world and had super powers. Batman was human (like seemingly Wonder Woman) but handled just small crime gangs and individual criminals.) I also cringed at the fierce practice sword fighting scenes among the Amazon women: a wonder no one would get hurt. (2) I am not a prude but at one point in the movie there was continual references to nude Steve Trevor's (offscreen) genitalia -- blatant references and much innuendo. It seemed out of place in a movie like this. Surprised me. I guess we are in a new age.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A WONDERful New Step for the DCEU,"Following the average films which came before, the eyes and hopes for the DCEU was on the shoulders of WW. WW is the step in the right direction for the universe and gives it the kick it needs to hopefully make this universe stronger. While this film was a vast improvement over the other outings in the DCEU it still suffers from issues that plague most modern superhero movies.First the strong points. The first act set on Themyscira is a department from other films in the DCEU in that it actually has colour which makes the world seem like a better place and helps to show the strength of the amazons. This setting helps to see that WW is a good character with hope, something which the DCEU version of superman lacks. The first act also gives us the start of the relationship between WW and ST (Chris Pine), while I have issues with the Love of the relationship I could not help but notice the incredible chemistry between the two and both put in some of their best acting ever. This acting continued all through the film and only got stronger. Unlike the previous films in the universe it actually has moments of light and comic relief. The setting of WW1 is strong as it is not a time period which is used in major films to often. In tone with the setting the costumes help in selling the period with all players looking like soldiers. WW costume has went through slight changes from her appearance on BvS in that its more colourful, this is a strong change as it helps to sell the hope that she has for the world and mankind The action in the movie is incredible and the stunt work is done extremely well. The film is well paced with each part moving at a reasonable rate. This is down to the lack of any sharp editing of the movie like what happened to BvS and SS. Last point, the film is allowed to breath and only contains small nods to a wider universe, it acts as its own movie.Now for the negatives. While the action in the movie is strong, it suffers from an overuse of slow-mo as well as moving to fast which makes some action beats seem rushed. The film relies to heavily on cgi and it is most clear in the final act of the film. Their are moments in the film when it is clear that the actors are working with a green screen. The film suffers from some of the same problems that plague both DC and Marvel movies such as the cgi heavy final act as well as the weak villain characters and most supporting characters. The villains of the film are not used enough in the film which hampers any character development for them. The same goes for the supporting cast of the film, some are used for comic relief and others are barely used at all. Their are some great actors on the movie who are not giving enough screen time which is a shame. Some of the best jokes and action beats have been ruined in the trailers and while it does not hamper the film too much, it would have been nice to see them fresh in the film. The relationship between the two leads at times felt too forced. There were certain moments that felt to similar to events that happened in the first captain America film and it ruined the story a bit.So while the film did have its issues, it was still a good movie and is the best in the DCEU. It hopefully shows that the studio now sees what needs to be done and they are willing to fix it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Entertaining, but too safe.","Princess Diana of Themyscira is DC Comics' most recognizable female superhero ‚Äì and actually one of the most famous and most popular overall. It's a wonder that this woman had to wait so long to have a movie of her own, especially considering how long Hollywood has been giving us superhero movies and how many of them have been made. Wonder Woman first appeared in DC Comics in 1941 and has had her own comic book series ever since. In 1975, the character finally made her flesh-and-blood debut with her eponymous TV series starring Lynda Carter as the Amazon princess who, under the name of Diana Prince, used her superpowers, her Lasso of Truth and her invisible airplane to help the U.S. Army fight the Nazis in World War II. But that series only lasted until 1979. In the years since, DC superheroes like Superman and Batman have each appeared on the big screen in multiple incarnations, with different actors playing the roles. When those two made a movie together in 2016, Wonder Woman (played by Israeli actress Gal Gadot) joined them and the following year finally gets a movie all her own. And ""Wonder Woman"" (PG-13, 2:21) is only the beginning.Diana (Gadot) grows up on the isolated, uncharted island of Themyscira, the only child on the island and last child of the Greek god Zeus. Diana is fascinated by the constant close combat training of the adult Amazon women around her and wants to learn to fight too. Diana's mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), doesn't want that for her daughter, but Hippolyta's sister, General Antiope (Robin Wright, from Netflix's ""House of Cards""), secretly indulges the young girl's desire. Diana grows up hearing tales of how Ares, the God of War, killed all of the other gods and, jealous of Zeus' affection for mankind, wants to use his powers to end their existence on earth. Ares' rivalry with Zeus culminates in Ares mortally wounding Zeus, who created and placed on Themyscira a weapon capable of killing Ares. As Diana matures, she becomes well-educated and, eventually with her mother's grudging approval, also becomes a skilled fighter. She instructs Antiope to train Diana harder than any Amazon has ever been trained, alluding to a secret from Diana's past, and a destiny she doesn't want to reveal to her daughter.Diana's idyllic world is shattered one day when an American fighter pilot named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash lands in the waters surrounding Themyscira. Diana saves his life and protects him as the Germans pursuing him come ashore and get into a fierce battle with the Amazons. Afterwards, Diana, struggling to get over the novelty of seeing her first man, uses her Lasso of Truth to learn who Steve is and what he's doing there. She hears of the horrors of the ongoing War to End All Wars (which no one yet realizes is only the First World War) and becomes convinced that Ares must be responsible. Steve has stolen the notes of a German chemical warfare mastermind known as Doctor Poison (Elena Anaya) and is determined to deliver it to his superiors in London. Diana convinces Steve that she can help him do that if he will then take her to the front where she is convinced that she can stop the war. These goals run the pair afoul of sadistic German General Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and Sir Patrick Morgan (David Thewlis), a government official who doesn't want his armistice negotiations derailed.""Wonder Woman"" serves the time-honored character, her followers and your average #MovieFan fairly well. The script comes from Allan Heinberg (a long-time television writer crossing over into film for the first time), based on a story by himself, Jason Fuchs (writer of ""Pan"" & ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"") and Zach Snyder (who is one of the producers of this film and is known for writing and/or directing the ""300"" films, ""Sucker Punch"", the 2013 and 2016 Superman movies and November 2017's ""Justice League""). The plot serves as a good origin story for the title character, even enhancing her mythology and placing her in World War I (rather than WWII, like the 1970s TV series), allowing for subtext which includes women's rights (the suffrage movement) and the development of modern mechanized warfare (large-scale killing of people at a distance). The culture shock she experiences meeting men and encountering western society for the first time allows for amusing and humorous moments which feel organic. The action is intense, but the violence relatively bloodless. And the heroine's appearance is terrifically styled.Topping the list of the movie's significant strengths (and hiding its weaknesses) is the great acting, especially Godot's. The beautiful, agile and talented actress is the perfect choice to bring this character into the 21st century, giving her a complex and pleasing mix of strength, vulnerability, determination, compassion, intelligence and sex appeal. She's a warrior, a woman and, most of all, a human being. On closer inspection, however, the film's flaws emerge. The character of General Ludendorff behaves and transforms in ways that aren't only far removed from the historical record, but which don't even make sense in the context of the plot. The same holds true for some of the other characters, but the film's larger problem is in its overall plotting. The rote interpretation of superhero genre conventions keeps the movie from being as creative and exciting as it could have and should have been. Still, ""Wonder Woman"" is the best DC film since the 2005-2012 Christopher Nolan / Christian Bale ""Batman"" series and it's refreshingly lighter in tone than that trilogy and other cinematic incarnations of the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This movie, in spite of its imperfections, is strong and entertaining enough to warrant a recommendation ‚Äì and give Movie Fans hope for the cinematic future of the Amazon princess and her DC partners in fighting for justice.

Just as bad as BatmanVSuperman & Suicide Squad,"Before I start I want to be clear on something, I gave the movie 3 stars, but it's not that bad, the movie deserves between a 4.5 and a 5.5. The reason why I gave this movie a 3 is because of the UNBELIEVABLE hype it got and the only reason for that is because it's a super-hero movie directed by a woman and it stars a woman. (I don't hate women, and I am not anti-women at all, because nowadays if you say those things you will be labelled women hater for no reason). So to balance it off I am giving it 3 stars, because seeing it's getting 8s/9s that it never deserves.The first thing I absolutely hated about this movie and it's the SAME thing with BatmanVSuperman & Suicide Squad, literally EVERYTHING you saw in the trailer were the ""best"" and most ""important"" parts in the movie. You don't even have to go to the movie because you can watch those trailers.The story and the movie itself were so boring, there was nothing happening at all, you don't feel anything for the characters and character development was nowhere to be found , the movie was dark, except for the themyscira part , and don't get me wrong I have nothing against dark/heavy movies (The Dark Knight is one of my favorite movies) , but the cinematography in the movie falls short. I don't want to even start about the forced jokes and the one-liners that were made especially for the cinema audience.So what was ""good"" about the movie: I thought the pacing and the story structure were actually better than BatmanVSuperman & Suicide Squad. You had a beginning , a middle part and a end part that made sense and were not all over the place. The fighting sequence and the special effects were also good enough, not mind blowing but it was nice. The acting was not bad, The only one I really didn't like was Gal Gadot. She does not have something special except that she is nice looking , but to be honest she was not bad or something I've seen worse.The story itself was OK, everything made sense and like I said it suited the pacing well.Overall the movie was slighty better than BvS and Suicide Squad because of the pacing and the movie structure, the bad guy in this movie was as bad as those other movies and it had the same problems as the other 2 movies.What I really don't understand, this amazes me, fumes me, blowes my mind, is how is it possible that the ones responsible for DCU and are calling the shots are still giving Zack Snyder & Co a chance. BatmanVSuperman was so bad it damaged the image of those 2 beloved characters, Suicide Squad was ridiculous bad and now Wonder Woman falls in the same category. I made up my mind, even if I love DC so much I will not be going to Justice League , even if it get's a 10/10, what it certainly will not seeing Zack snyder is responsible for this it will be a big turd as well.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Some criticism(s),"Wonder Woman's home isn't explained; with Superman it was straightforward; General Zod and Superman came from another planet but in Wonder Woman it's a zone that you cross in and out of. Why had no one, a sailor for instance, discovered Wonder Woman's island before? You might think I'm nitpicking but it's lazy writing and bad storytelling. Also, I reckon the writers got the idea from 'Time Bandits' (1981). When the pilot and Wonder Woman get to London (which looked awesome) there's this questionable clothes shopping scene; Wonder Woman cloaked in black seemed to be blending in; concealing her sword and shield just fine without having to change into civilian clothes. Also, the scene where the pilot, Wonder Woman and friends are sitting around the campfire before getting to the Western Front; it seemed out of place, like it should've been left in the editing room. Which brings me to the red haired lady, the Scottish sniper and the Indian chief; I found them annoying, like the writers were following standard procedure 'now it's time to introduce friends and allies'. And those sped up/slowed down leaps and kicks; great directors like Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese don't do this. Then there was that heavy metal/guitar music used in 'Batman vs Superman'; I was hoping that since the first half of Wonder Woman was free of this horrible music, it would be left out. And the evil chemist lady who wore a mask concealing part of her face; I reckon the writers got the idea from the 1989 'Batman' film; the Joker's girlfriend had something similar to cover her disfigured face. Wonder Woman had it's moments, for instance the beginning e.g. the Zeus/Aries story (artfully done) and when Diana's growing up and training to become Wonder Woman. And Wonder Woman's island was nice to look at; worth seeing for that, plus the other sets. And the battle scene where Wonder Woman crosses no man's land was good. And Aries's armor looked good, as did the other costumes. You'll probably see Wonder Woman. And it will make/is making lots of money. I think people were expecting Wonder Woman be a silly (like 'Captain America') but it was better than expected. But it wasn't that good either. Technically/production wise Wonder Woman was very good. With a better script, more editing/better pacing; dropping the heavy metal music and those slowed down/sped up fights, Wonder Woman could've been wonderful.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A decent superhero movie,"I saw WW this evening with a group of friends. J really enjoyed it. I thought it was better than most superhero movies, but that bar is set pretty low. As with seemingly every other superhero movie ever made, the ending is a tedious escalation of good versus bad (guess who wins). That part was almost insultingly predictable and unimaginative, which is why I can't see this type of movie too often. So, it was fun in pieces but mediocre on the whole.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

To be honest I have the previous DCU films quite lacking in something.For a comic book film, it actually has a decent story-line, good action scenes but still able to keep the story going in the subdued scenes and had characters you actually cared about, which is more than could be said for the film it followed, Batman v Superman.Will definitely be a movie I would quite happy to pay to see again without hesitation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Review: Wonder Woman,"The film ""Wonder Woman"" presents us the best narrative constructed for DC since the trilogy of Christopher Nolan, revealing to us with fidelity the trajectory of the unbeatable Diana Prince. The princess of the Amazons, the daughter of Queen Hippolyta, was carved from her own clay by the mother, who asked the gods to give her life (a kind of allusion to the Greek myth of Pygmalion). The girl grew up in love with the little world around her, the hidden Themyscira, a Paradise Island populated only by powerful women. Influenced by her aunt, Antiope, she soon became interested in the lives of these warriors, who train tirelessly to prevent a possible return and rule of Ares, the God of war. In order to be the best among them, she constantly trains to help protect the place where she lives. Nevertheless, the arrival of an injured pilot expands the horizons of Diana and she realizes that its fight is well beyond the island. Convinced that she is the right person to prevent possible chaos in the world, even without knowing all the truths, she sets out to confront her great enemy.The production - which features names like Zack Snyder (""300"" and ""Steel Man"") and Rebecca Steel Roven (""Batman - The Dark Knights"") - is a real treat for the fans and a big surprise for the rest of the Because it presents a work that addresses important and current issues, without having to fall into the most of it. With an exceptional work done by the team of practical and visual effects, not abusing the possibilities, the film arrives in a shocking way and puts an end to the discussion that DC does not know how to produce films of superheroes.The script written by Allan Heinberg is very well punctuated. The screenwriter respects the heroine's conception and builds a story with a beautiful dramatic structure, sewing almost perfectly every detail of the narrative. The dialogues, although well elaborated and have a cohesive line of action, become exaggerated at some points in the projection. Something that could be avoided. Patty Jenkins simply breaks through all possible quality barriers with her audacious work on ""Wonder Woman."" His deconstruction of direction is precise and pleasant to see (I would say, to analyze), since his choices of plans dialogue in an authentic, sensitive and fairly balanced way with the plot and the comics. From the brave use of slow motion to precise camera movements, she seeks to leave nothing out of place. Perhaps she misses by releasing an excess of CGI - such as the poorly collated face of the actor who plays Ares, in another person's body and in moments of the fight scenes - but architect a consistent and superior achievement to many other films.The cast is led by the charismatic and talented Gal Gadot, in the skin of the heroine ""Wonder Woman"". The actress is a great find and has been performing well in some of the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchises and various television series. However, it is here that she proves that she has come to stay. It is safe to say that by giving Diana life, she left such a good impression that it would be difficult to replace her with another actress in the future. Chris Pine (""Star Trek""), plays the pilot Steve Trevor and is also very well on the scene. The same can be said of Sa√Ød Taghmaoui, Ewen Bremner and Connie Nielsen, who exhibit strong constructions and psychological gestures that fit their roles. Robin Wright (""House of Cards""), portrays Antiope effortlessly and instigates us with yet another remarkable work. Meanwhile, David Thewlis (""Harry Potter"" franchise) delivers an excellent character to a certain point in the film that leaves something to be desired with forced intonation. Like Danny Huston and Elena Anaya, like the villains Ludendorff and Dr. Maru. At certain times they end up performing a caricature construction, much like the archetypes created for comics. But they were excesses that could easily be left out.Matthew Jensen, responsible for the photography of the great ""Chronicle"" and ""Fantastic Four"", proposes here an elegant harmony of colors. His photography direction deconstructs the various parts of the plot and correctly applies the color palettes that reconcile with each other from start to finish. The warm tones create the atmosphere of Paradise Island, showing the natural and architectural beauties of the place. But the gradations of gray reveal a London divided by the dark side of the war and the colors of the great halls. But the war fields, these are taken by a darkening tonality added to a green filter. A proposal that presents a totally psychological evolution photographic, usually used in films of more dramatic content.""Wonder Woman"" is not only one of the best superhero movies of all time, as it easily goes into gallery of the top ten (or maybe five). It's a consistent, well-developed film and puts DC Comics back on track.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wonder Woman - Review,"Ever since the DCEU started, I wanted to see a truly great film from them and I think we finally got it. This film represents what I always loved about DC, at their best, they are capable of telling some of the most inspiring and epic stories and this is definitely one of them, Gal Gadot was excellent as Wonder Woman, she sold not just her strength but also her kindness and also Chris Pine was fantastic in this movie as Steve Trevor, also Rupert Gregson-Williams' score is amazing, while some could say he had the advantage of already having the theme from BvS composed by Junkie XL, Rupert added more amazing themes in this film, Patty Jenkins also did a great job directing this movie, specially the action scenes, No Man's Land is by far my favorite scene of the entire film, seeing Diana wanting to fight just to save innocent lives, is just, it really gives a sense of hope from her character. My only complain is really the villains, I really felt they were underused and I wish they could have been better. While Wonder Woman doesn't hit the extreme heights of movies like The Dark Knight, is still up there with Iron Man and the original Superman movies, this is one of the best movies DC has done in years and is definitely the best movie in the DCEU, this film reminded why I love DC in the first place.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"A woeful, overly labourious attempt to balance the gender gap with the superheroes","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDiana (Gal Gadot) was raised on a distant planet of only women, where her mother wanted to protect her from the physical demands of fighting like all the other women there. But one day she starts to rebel and unleashes some hidden powers she was unaware of, meaning the rite of passage has come, so her mother tells her the story of a spiteful son of a God and his attempt to destroy the Earth. Then, Air Force pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash lands into their home, confusing the order of things. He reveals he has a book that contains plans by evil German commandant Ludendorff (Danny Huston) to unleash a deadly nerve gas on England. And so Diana and Steve must head to London to thwart his diabolical plan.The superhero franchise, on both sides of the DC/Marvel divide, must really be doing the rounds, as now we have Wonder Woman, who was a character in the recent disastrous Batman Vs. Superman movie, in her own more than feature length film. And after this, there is of course the Justice League film, where all the main players are having a big jamboree together. Whether this was the inspiration behind this films existence or pressure from the feminist movement to get some good ol' equality up there on the big screen is unclear, but either way the debut feature length directorial effort of Patty Jenkins is a long, joyless effort that wastes a golden chance to level the playing field for female superheroes.Like Batman, even more so, in fact, Wonder Woman has been taken from a pretty camp, light hearted source, and been transformed into something far moodier and deep on the big screen, where undemanding fun has been substituted for wondrous spectacle. But for all the awe inspiring effects and breath taking action sequences, it can't make up for a total sense of humour failure in the script, as well as any care-worthy characters or snappy dialogue, as well as a totally sloppy, incoherent plot that really fails to suck you in for the length it does. She may be beautiful and glamorous to look at, but Gadot isn't the greatest actress, to say the least, and co star Pine is equally vapid and bland. Even a support cast including David Thewlis, Ewen Bremner and Lucy Davis can't help. Performances wise, the best thing is Huston as the villain, who really fits the skin of his character, but can't make the whole thing taste any better.It would have been great to see a good Wonder Woman, but sadly this is just Blunder Woman! *",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Excellent movie, and comments on all the bad reviews","I was really surprised at all the bad reviews on a movie that has all the right elements for a good action movie: good actors, good direction, a reasonably good script, and that pinch of magic that turns all of these into an actual entertaining movie. And entertaining it is, as show its box office figures - unless you are one of the following types of reviewer:1. ""Boring"" in the title: we get it, you are a rock star who is secretly a CIA operative, fighting crime, doing high speed pursuits, exploding stuff and killing bad guys with assault rifles. But keep in mind most of us live more mundane lives and thus your incredibly exciting lifestyle can't be used as a reference that's useful to the rest of us.2. ""Insult to your intelligence"" in the title: okay, so you're both a Nobel prize and Oscar winner, we get it. You're so intelligent that to you the rest of us are like a bunch of apes. WE GET IT. Now if you would please let us apes enjoy our monkey movies that we find entertaining, that would be swell, thank you very much. Next time you write a review though, it would be best if you put a disclosure somewhere saying it's only for people with an IQ above 200 or something.3. ""Your hate clich√© here"" in title: lots of reviews giving bad ratings for various different reasons, but interestingly all of them in sequence, effectively burying the good reviews under a number of pages of bad ones. What could this be? An organized bunch of people upset with the success of a movie whose hero is a tall, lean, beautiful Jewish woman who does not hate all males, perhaps? I wonder who these people might be.So to sum things up, if you have an agenda or an ego the size of Connecticut, you're probably not going to like this movie, well, at least not admit to it. But if all you're looking for is an entertaining, heart warming and even uplifting movie, definitely go watch it. On a side note, I have always liked superhero movies because they portrait the decision of an individual who, despite having super powers and being able to use them to do pretty much anything he/she wants, still chooses to use them nobly and for the good of others. Personally I would not trust a person who fails to perceive and appreciate the beauty of that kind of attitude.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Breathe of Fresh Air for DC Movies,"Perhaps it's clich√© to say at this point, but DC has not released the greatest movies over the past few years. Man of Steel was OK at best, but nothing to write home about. Batman v Superman was pure, sloppy garbage that lacked focus, and Suicide Squad was just one big hot mess. So, naturally, I was very skeptical going into Wonder Woman. I wanted the film to be good, as I want all films I go see to be good, but I had a sinking feeling that this film was going to disappoint me as all the other DCEU films had. I can safely say that my skepticism was proved wrong because Wonder Woman was a fantastic movie.The plot of this film is as follows. A young woman named Diana, played by Gal Gadot, lives on an Island of Amazon Women named Themyscira, which is hidden from the world of men. All is well and good until a man named Steve Trevor, played by Chris Pine, crash lands on Themyscira and tells the Amazons of World War I and the turmoil the world is in. After hearing this, Diana wishes to join Steve and help him fight in the war as she believes the culprit is really Ares, the god of war.The character of Diana, or Wonder Woman, was handled very well in this film. It would have been easy for the writers to simply make her another flawless, perfect Mary-sue that never does anything wrong and defeats all adversity with the greatest of ease. However, they decided instead to give her a sort of child like innocence when confronted with the real world. She still has a lot to learn, and she does make mistakes. However, she still emulates all of the good qualities of humanity that we, the viewers, aspire towards.Actress Gal Gadot was the perfect casting choice for Wonder Woman. Looking back at her career reveals a talent that has been criminally underutilized. Her only big films have been the Fast and Furious movies which have been OK at best and garbage at worst. She also served as an ex-Israeli defense force soldier, which really shines through during the film's action sequences. Watching her dawn the Wonder Woman outfit felt like watching Christopher Reeve dawn the Superman cape, or watching Robert Downey Jr. put on the Iron Man suit for the first time, or watching Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. She is one of those actors that perfectly fits the role. When I looked up on the screen, I didn't see Gal Gadot playing Wonder Woman, I saw Wonder Woman.The film's supporting cast also brings a lot to the film. Chris Pine was an excellent choice for Wonder Woman's Lois Lane, Steve Trevor. He brings some great comedic relief to the film and has some great comedic timing, but he also serves as Diana's anchor, being more of a realist in regards to Wonder Woman's quest. He isn't just some annoying sidekick who has to be saved all the time, he brings some genuine heart to the role and has some great emotional moments as well.While many of the film's leading and supporting roles were handled very well, the film does suffer, as seems standard for many superhero movies these days, from having very poor villains. The film has 2 or 3 villains and none of them really stand out. A couple of them have some pretty cool designs, but it just feels like the standard super- villain we've seen in a multitude of Marvel films.Another major concern I had going into this film was that it was going to be preachy. I was worried that the film was going to pander to the Tumblr Feminist, SJW crowd and hammer in points about men being evil womanizers and women being flawless, perfect beings. I didn't want another Ghostbusters 2016. However, the film was very balanced and level headed with it's message. It empowers women without demonizing men. Not only are the male heroes in the film very warm and likable, but one of the villains, Dr. Poison, is a woman, showing that not only can men be good, but women can be evil. It downplays the gender of the characters and, instead, focuses on their humanity.Wonder Woman was great. It was a fresh new origin film for a DC character we haven't seen on the big screen yet. Gal Gadot was perfect casting for the role of Wonder Woman, and the supporting cast felt very warm and likable. Though the film does have a few flaws, particularly in the villain department, none of the flaws are great enough to drag the movie down. The story is simple and easy to follow, the action scenes are fast paced and exciting, the lead is bad ass but also sympathetic and easy to relate to, and the supporting cast is supportive and enjoyable. The overused cinema tropes, like the sexist ""She's a Woman and can't do blank"" trope and the ""fish out of water"" trope, are addressed during the film, as they should be, but are not used to the point of being annoying. Of the movies DC has released in their new DCEU lineup, Wonder Woman was the first that I've wanted to see more than once. It is also the first of the DCEU movies that I want to add to my Blu-Ray collection. Wonder Woman was great. If you have not seen it yet, go see it ASAP. You will not be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A good watch for the weekend complemented by amazing visuals,"Set in the backdrop of the World War 1, and an overtly dramatic interpretation of imperial Germany, the movie does a fine job of projecting Wonder Woman into the DC franchise.Gal Gadot with her god-like beauty fits so well into this god-like character, it seems almost unimaginable for someone else to be in that role. Her portrayal of Wonder Woman is exactly what one expected from the character, and she delivers it with so much style, elegance and beauty, it is almost enigmatic.The plot is pretty straightforward and does a good job of making Wonder Woman shine with all her brevity, ignorance, quirks and dilemmas.Chris Pine, as usual is full of life with his role, and his character complements the plot magnificently with great enthusiasm and hope.Special effects were brilliant, especially the perfectly timed slow- motion slices in the middle of fight sequences. Music is a bit distracting sometimes, but the Wonder Woman theme pumps up the energy levels.Nothing extraordinary has been set up in the movie for the upcoming Justice League team-up, and the movie stands by itself just fine. As an introductory movie of a major character from the franchise, it does a pretty fine job, as it focuses on the back-story of the character rather than jump right into the bandwagon of the 'team of superheroes'.Loved this movie and the shade of social message it tries to impart along with it.Good movie, average movie, bad movie, I was anyway going to watch it for Gal Gadot. God she is awesome. Even a single glance of her makes a man's heart skip a beat. Can't stress more on the fact that I love her.

I think they could not have picked a better person and actress to portray this role than Gal Gadot. She can be such a positive role model. The fight scenes are incredible and so are her moves. I disagree, also, that there was no character development shown in the movie. What about the whole beginning of the movie on the island, showing her as a girl growing into a great Amazon warrior?

I really think, after having watched this, that the film got high ratings because it was supposed to be the feminist hurrah and it is not PC to rate the first and only feminist comic movie badly. But this movie is LAME.I have enjoyed so many other comic book movies and was looking so forward to this female driven one. Have to say though, right when it started , I had my doubts. They just worsened as the movie progressed. The issues I had with the movie, were a poorly constructed script. Really cheated out there. No big words. But they made the actors act like they were saying big words. Nothing made sense either .. huge plot holes throughout, and especially in wonder woman's origins. That didn't get filled in till the end. But filled in with scraps. The Amazon island - a lesbian paradise filled with all different races , shapes and sizes , butch and femme. Apparently they do not need men to procreate, oh wait, they do, except there is no men and Wonder Woman was sculpted from clay. The island is hidden from everyone except the gods, oh and that spy in an airplane and the German navel command. Secondly ... the acting was pretty wooden which is shocking because of the talent involved. That just means that the script is that bad. My other biggest problem with this movie was that it was just so unbelievable.. not just with actual events , but the characters just seem like caricatures .. I mean I can watch an X Men movie and totally get into it. But for some reason when I see a woman clad in a bathing suit charge across the western front with what must have been hundreds of machines gun shooting at her and only have to dodge three bullets that magically hit her in the bracelets ; it's too much. Just retarded too much. like no way in heck,too much. Other issues? I appreciate diversity just like the next guy. But to have a Native American, and Arab sitting in a bar in England with a Scotsman? During World War 1, no less? Come on. Just too unrealistic and immature ... this is a great movie for teens and kids and tweens and stupid people. I am a big sucker when it comes to ideals and honor - and when Wonder Woman is giving her sermons on the mount about how great mankind is , i literally rolled my eyes. I fast forwarded through most of it just to see the end and find out if there was any god of war. Its that bad. For adults anyways. Just didn't penetrate and didn't feel anything .. the life lessons were dumb too. The entire script seemed written for a third grader. Yeah. Yeah. We all know people suck and we know we aren't going to be better and we are still worth saving kind of thing. Heard it ll before ... like for two thousand years actually. ( hello Jesus) so this was probably the worst comic book movie I've ever seen besides iron man 3. Save your money and rent it for your daughters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
(ARCHIVE REVIEW) In anticipation of Wonder Woman 2,"I am just as astounded as you by all the praise directed toward Wonder Woman. I suppose it makes sense, since the bar for DC Universe installments has been set so low by Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, and the bar for female-led superhero films even lower by the likes of Elektra and Catwoman. Now we have a movie that (A) does well in both categories, (B) constitutes the first proper Wonder Woman feature, and (C) finally puts DC one step ahead of Marvel Studios in letting the ladies take the spotlight of a solo adventure.In many ways, this is a film of triumph. It has given us hope that DC may yet have a chance to turn this ship away from the maelstrom, it has made female fans feel unusually satisfied (there was even a ""women only"" screening, which I would be far more miffed at if there didn't exist ""no girls allowed"" screenings of Logan), and it had a chance to opt for a more Xena-esque tone before it was too late and the only way out would have been tactless re-edits and randomly inserted pop songs.Directed by Patty Jenkins and screenplay penned by Allen Heinberg (who recently worked on an unfinished Wonder Woman TV pilot), the film mainly takes place during World War I. Our heroine Diana (Gal Gadot), an Amazonian demigoddess and the child of Zeus and Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), saves an undercover US Air Service pilot named Steve (Chris Pine) who crashes near the hidden island where Diana's kin reigns - she hasn't met a man before, it turns out. The island, giving me Lefkada flashbacks, is my favorite design of the film; it is a pity we don't get to stay long.As the Amazons learn of the Great War, as it was called, Diana realizes that war has returned to mankind and that she, despite warnings from her mother, must do that which her people were sent by the gods to do - restore peace. This bit of backstory is told earlier in the film to a young Diana, in a series of animated images that resemble moving Renaissance paintings.We meet more characters. David Thewlis plays a benevolent Imperial War Cabinet speaker, Elena Anaya plays the Germans' aptly nicknamed head chemist ""Dr. Poison"", Robin Wright is an Amazon warrior who tutors Diana, Lucy Davies provides a bit of comic relief I could easily have done without, and Sa√Ød Taghmaoui, Eugene Brave Rock, and Ewen Bremner make up the band of misfits that join Steve and Diana when the British military refuse to help.The film does still have Snyderian dark moments, both in terms of imagery and themes, but it works better here as Diana makes an optimistic drop of color in a grey world. It is fitting, perhaps even timely, that her enemy isn't an evil alien or scheming billionaire, but a personification of war itself in the form of the Greek god Ares - thought to be in the human form of Germany's General Ludendorff (Danny Huston). She is the hero the DC Universe needed, and was denied when Superman was turned mopey and aggressive.To be sure, Zack Snyder was still involved with the story but Heinberg evidently fine-tuned it to the point of comprehensibility and, dare I say, good quality. The film does feature some of Snyder's usual traits, such as the overused slow-motion and the brown-ish balls of fire that never look real, but I attribute this to the fact that Patty Jenkins still had to make the film fit it into the DC Extended Universe in some way.I had other problems. There is a certain twist near the end (which seemed less out-of-the-blue to me than to my theater companions, but I did know it beforehand) that at first seems to give the film a challenging ending but ultimately goes for a more black-and-white conclusion. Also, as genuine as Wonder Woman is in simply giving female fans (in particular) the exhilarating comic-book action film they've craved, there are some less than subtle moments that could have been cut for time at the expense of nothing but a few easy ""amirite"" jokes. I can assure those in doubt: a scene where a superhuman single-handedly obliterates an army of soldiers isn't ""pandering"" just because a woman is doing it.But the film is still very much that; an exhilarating action movie with exciting visuals, and characters you enjoy, admire, and root for. Gal Gadot plays her role much better than she did in Dawn of Justice and she certainly looks the part, even if some aficionados may wish she was taller and burlier. Chris Pine does well as a coward in badass' clothing and both leads are fun in their respective fish-out-of-water situations where they try to comprehend each other's cultures, even if much of it's been done.I can absolutely see why women, including those ""of color"", would feel encouraged by the fact that an Israeli lead, a female director, an age-old role model, and a genuinely good, non-pandering script would take the summer movie season by such storm. It succeeds at being a crowd-pleasing comic-book adventure that nevertheless has a beautiful vision precisely because that vision is not supplied by Zack Snyder or edited beyond coherence, and it succeeds at being a progressive victory precisely because it's not a Sony film and the plot isn't ""what if Superman was a girl?""",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Power and grace in yet another formula-made movie,"When finally it arrives, ""Wonder Woman"" delivers all the power you could wish for. Gal Gadot really shows impressive dedication to the role.Director Patty Jenkins, who directed Charlize Theron in her legendary depiction of Aileen Wuornos in ""Monster"" (2003), was offered to helm this historic screen adaptation, despite only having one feature film on her r√©sum√©. Apart from some faltering CGI (which, regrettably, seems to have become a standard in blockbusters of late, despite the technical powers at display), there cannot be much negative to say about the craftsmanship. Jenkins and her actors (David Thewlis, not the least) do what they are supposed to. The design is impressive. Rupert Gregson-Williams score is a mighty one. All in all, it's a nice ride. If only we'd not seen the formula used a million times before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Long and BOOOORING movie!,"I was generous giving it a 5 out of 10. There were 3 action scenes and the last scene was the best...and it was the end of the movie!Why the hype? Why the praise?

Yes, you need story build-up...but NOT THAT MUCH!Disappointed in this so-called blockbuster when there are many better movies that are getting poor reviews!",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wonderful Movie,"For those who said this is a feminist movie, well you can stop being d**k. As a character, Wonder Woman's innocence is lovely, her strength is terrifying, her honesty and stubbornness is adorable, and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is wonderful, thinking how many pack of punch in that average sized body is nothing but wonder.Granted, I'm in love here, so I'll give anything in this movie a perfect score, oh and that music when she's in action, good lord, I'm trembling in excitement.So if you just looking for a good movie, watch it, you won't be disappointed. If you're feminist, watch it, you'll find a lot to like, probably. If you're d**khead, go watch it, you will find something to hate, or love, depending on how helpless you're.Either way, if this movie cannot entertain you, then you can go back to your window, stare at pedestrian and judge them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
DC universe movies have the worst directors! We are in Bizarro world!,"Patty Jenkins is a terrible director for action/comic movies, and I see she's signed for the next Wonder Woman movie, too!

Pure Entertainment.  Kudos,"When WW 1 comes to The Amazon Island we see a plane crash in the ocean and Diana (Gal Gadot) who is in Amazon training, knows she must leave. Later she discovers her true powers and becomes Wonder Woman. Keep in mind she is a Goddess, but she is not aware of that yet.This is what we have been waiting for and it doesn't disappoint. This is terrific Entertainment at its best. Those of us who grew up reading comics of Superman, Batman and others are taken back into believing all this is possible and it is here that we want to believe once again. And so we do.We see a young Diana watching a plane crash in the ocean. She dives in and saves the Pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). With her Amazon sisters she helps defeat the Germans who were after Steve Trevor. Later he tells the community of the war and millions dying because of it. Diana feels she must go and help and defeat Ares (God of War) who she believes is causing all this misery in the world and once he is dead peace will come upon the world. Her mother Antiope (Robin Wright) reluctantly lets her go with Steve Trevor.It was fun seeing Diana experience some of society and learn about it. Steve had promised to take her to the war and eventually they both go. Once at the front all bets are off and Diana goes and does her thing and it is here we see her destroy the enemy. This goes on from time to time defeating the enemy, but the main goal is to find and destroy the building where Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya) also known as Dr poison is making poison gas that will kill millions more.The choreography and CGI is something to behold when Diana goes into action and we never tire of it. They are that good along with the heart rendering music. Kudos.Diana is surprised and disappointed when she kills General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) who she believed was Ares and the war didn't stop.Of course there is a twist in here and you may be surprised about it. We see the real Ares (David Thewlis) show up and he fights Diana to the death. Ares tells Diana that only a God can kill another God and does she have what it takes. These fighting scenes are like something we have rarely or never have seen in other movies. Kudos again.This was a solid production and deserving of all Awards it receives. The acting by all and cinematography were excellent.Kudos to Patty Jenkins who directed this movie. Fantastic job.All in all this was a special treat for we Believers in comic book heroes and we hope to see many sequels in time with the same Gal Gadot who we fell in love with.

"Decent movie not amazing but for sure not bad either, it does not deserve all the praise it get's when it's just okay Imo","Waning spoilers will ensue.I see so much praise for wonder woman but I don't really get it, I think Gal Godot is an average actress at most, I like her personality but her acting was very meh in wonder woman, she looked the part for sure and seeing her kick ass was to me awesome. To me the meh pretty much sums up the whole wonder woman movie, it's kinda meh. Chris pine to me was great, good comedic timing but you still bought him as a spy and a guy who knew how to fight. The general was also very meh to me. But the problem to me wasn't so much the leads as it was some of the weird plot points, the use of to much slow mo in my opinion and the poor character development for the side characters. The Irish guy had a decent arc but nothing that made me care much about him same with the Indian guy, he was charming and funny but there was no real substance to the character it was like they brought substance to one character and interesting personality to the other. I loved the guy the great sir who played Ares he was amazing and he kinda had shades of gray to him, I think that they could have handled the last act with him a little better because there was not much set up for him turning into the god of war you would expect.That is also another thing that didn't bother me about the movie at all but is something I think could have improved the movie slightly, Greek mythology, I personally love Greek mythology and the terrifically horrible nature of it which I think could have been slightly explored at least. Also the god-killer thing was to me apparent as soon as you saw the mom linger for the sword then went like OK!, her linger was enough for me to get that Diana was the god-killer, like OK she is the only child born and she was sent by Zeus, ofc it is her but they had to beat it over your head for the next 15 min of the movie with Robin wrights death and all. The reveal of her being a god was to me awesome though and the beating it over my head did not in fact ruin that, I thought she could just kill Ares cuz ya know magic or w/e but the god reveal was exciting but also made me even more mad over the fact that superman sacrificed himself like an idiot when wonder woman is literally unkillable except by another god. Random BvS side track aside the movie was just average to me and I don't get the praise it get's. Yes it was a female lead super hero movie but we have had bad ass women lead movies before so I don't see the reason for just this particular one to be so praised.Also I seemed to like the side characters action more than wonder woman's at some points, some of her action scenes were freaking awesome but all of the scenes with the military guys were equally or sometimes even more awesome, maybe it has to do with the fact that they were more relatable or maybe it was just that Patty Jenkins shoots amazing war cinema. And the weird plot points like why when Chris Pine does not let Gal Gadot kill the general does she run outside instead of running towards the general swinging her sword? The whole ball scene was kind off useless to me except to show of Chris Pine's acting skills.TL; DR Wonder woman was to me decent had some good performances some meh and the same goes for the plot and the action some parts where woo F yeah and some were... meh. Definitely not a bad movie but not the great movie it is praised to be",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best superhero movie by far this year,"I had the opportunity to watch WW early and I had to say that I was deeply satisfied with the movie. It blew my expectations. Gal Gadot is made for this role. She is stunning, beautiful yet has the aura of a great warrior. Chris portrays Steve Trevor well and has nice chemistry with Gal. Actions are done wonderfully and you can feel some of the elements of Zack Snyder in the movie. There are many heroic and epic scenes in the film that will definitely be remembered for the year to come. Music is done beautifully as well. DC always has a knack for producing great music and this one is not an exception. If you want a movie with heart, some humor, great action this will definitely be the movie for you to watch this June.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Finally a flawless superhero film, led by a woman.","Wonder Woman tells the story of Diana(Gal Gadot), princess of the Amazons of Themyscira. Before she became Wonder Woman, she was a trained warrior. A pilot named Steve Trevor(Chris Pine), crash lands on the island of Themyscira. Diana finds out about the war that mankind is waging. She leaves home, decides to fight in the war & embraces her true destiny.Wonder Woman is an awe-inspiring movie. Director Patty Jenkins has done complete justice to this iconic character. The visual effects are spectacular. The action set pieces are mind blowing. All the action scenes, are even more exciting in 3D. The cinematography by Matthew Jensen is gorgeous. Both Themyscira(these portions were shot in Italy) & London look breathtaking. The humor in the film is refreshing, after the lack of humor in previous DC Extended Universe efforts like, Man of Steel(2013) & Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016). I'm so relieved that they didn't mess this up like the previous two female-led superhero outings, Catwoman(2004) & Elektra(2005). This movie is picture perfect, right from the first scene till the last scene. Gal Gadot is outstanding as Diana. Gadot steals the show with her masterful portrayal, of the most famous female superhero in the world. Chris Pine is brilliant as Steve Trevor. Connie Nielsen is excellent as Hippolyta. Robin Wright is fantastic as Antiope. Danny Huston is impressive as Ludendorff. David Thewlis is superb as Sir Patrick. Said Taghmaoui, Ewen Bremner, Eugene Brave Rock & Lucy Davis are awesome as Sameer, Charlie, The Chief & Etta, respectively. Elena Anaya is amazing as Dr. Maru. Lilly Aspell is adorable as Young Diana(8). Wonder Woman is a must watch for everyone. Go & celebrate this wonder of a woman! I'm waiting with bated breath for Justice League(2017).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good origin story,"The story is well written, and the tone manages to match the film nicely, it establish Diana's origin very well. Gal Gadot is the perfect choice for Wonder woman, She showcases all emotions and acted nicely. Similarly, Chris Pine shines as Steve Trevor, their relationship is dynamic and more subtle, and seeing him explaining the world to her is fun. The film deals with thought-provoking themes challenging the good and evil in humanity. The action set pieces are well-staged and entertaining. The cinematography is beautiful, the score is atmospheric, overall production value is excellent. But the CGI is shaky In some places.Overall, A good origin story for Wonder woman.

A huge step up,"Patty Jenkins has done it. After we had witnessed the critical duds like Suicide Squad and BVS, we now have a film that will be truly known as the first great DCEU movie. Let me get you into the details without spoilers.Entertainment factor. The movie's greatest strength for me is in its humor and it didn't bore us like the last DCEU films. Action scenes were great with no hiccups. Editing was an improvement also from the previous DC films. Thank God.Production value. You could tell they really took the time even if the budget is much lower than a typical Marvel movie. Costumes and the film locations were chosen wisely. From the sandy beaches of Diana's homeland, Victorian London, to the grittiness of a WW1 battlefield.CGI. Much of the movie were made with practical effects but some scenes are with a green screen background. Some of the CGi were unconvincing but tolerable throughout the movie. No complaints though.Acting. Is good, everyone played their part like they were meant to be but no Oscar-worthy roles. Gadot's performance and role as the Amazonian princess definitely perfect albeit her acting needs more polishing. Chris Pine felt natural in his role as usual. Supporting characters were also noteworthy in their roles.Overall an entertaining ride from start to finish. Definitely recommend. 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

::Blazing guitar solo::,"Seeing this again... man (or woman)... I want to rate this even higher for the parts I like, even for the opening on Themyscyra (sic) because I bought in even more to the emotion of how it was played so straight by the actors and staged by Jenkins. Gal Gadot is the new Christopher Reeve, and in her own way even more badass because of how much she makes Diana a force to be reckoned with while keeping so much vulnerability just under the surface. She and Chris Pine are a wonderful 30's or 40's rom com couple, though more adorable due to Diana's mix of awkwardness and strength, often in the same breath..... But that climax is still not impressive on a technical level. I don't even mean how the conflict has to come to a head, I get all of that, and I even liked the I BELIEVE IN A THING CALLED LOVE (cue guitar lick) moment because Jenkins is not only not afraid of cheese she doesn't know what the word means, but it connects with the key theme of the movie. I know so many of the final battle scenes or fights that happen with these comic book movies have been called bullshit but a) there were less than zero stakes because (Spoiler) we know Wonder Woman doesn't succumb to evil because of her appearance in the previous DC movie that takes place 100 years after this one (and I so wish it didn't exist due to the continuity errors it places with this), and b) the CGI is laughable, with David Thewlis (who you ALL owe it to yourselves to see on Fargo s.3) not being good at turning total evil HAM.So in short: the parts I liked before I liked a little or a lot more (the 'No Man's Land' is the one part, mostly when Diana first appears, that, just iconography-wise, is cool), and the parts I didn't I felt so, so, so embarrassed.

Overrated Superhero movie of all time,"I agree with James Cameron when it comes to this movie. This movie did not bring anything new to the comic book world or with female empowerment. Wonder Woman ends up being a very bland, vanilla character going through almost no character arc from beginning to end. The realization that she has at the end of the movie, her hero's journey presented to us is as basic and ho-hum as you can get.It has a very basic and predictable plot. The fight scenes are very lackluster and few and far between. Too much slow-mo use with the sparse fight scenes too. Also, this movie has the worst 3rd act climax ever with bad CGI throughout. There was no connection with Ares to Wonder Wonder so you just didn't care for the fight scene at all or what's at stake, because Ares just comes out of nowhere as the ""gotcha"" villain in the final act. There were also no twists in this movie at all so where was all the intrigue? I wanted more mythology.With all that said I still give this movie a 7 which is very generous, there are some stuff that I like about it and I've been waiting for 20 years for this movie. This movie is an overrated mess and I think it did so well because everyone just wants to see Wonder Woman on the big screen and they had a great introduction to the character in Batman Vs. Superman. This is a chick flick superhero movie for sure, which is fine but make it more interesting. I hope the sequel 1984 will blow this movie out of the water.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Best from the DC extended universe yet but still room for better,"Well the DCEU has got off to a pretty rough start but this long gestating Wonder Woman adaptation is a step in the right direction. For a start it feels like a real film, with time to set things up properly, character development and a color pallet that looks like a film rather than a de-saturated computer game. Not unlike Captain America: The First Avenger, this has a period setting that breaths some fresh air into it. Set in World War One, Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot)wants to end the great war and is surrounded by some interesting characters led by Chris Pine (Hell Over High Water) as the love interest. The third act is where it falls apart for me, it feels messy and the support characters are given very little to do. I can imagine a handful of scenarios that would have been more thrilling while sitting on my chuff for five minutes. Still on the whole this is a good adventure and hopefully we will see some good things from the Aquaman movie...

"""The evolution of Gadot's Wonder Woman is inspiring to watch.""","Wonder Woman is directed by Patty Jenkins and stars Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, David Thewlis, Danny Huston, Sa√Ød Taghmaoui and Ewen Bremner.Before she was Wonder Woman she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained warrior. When a pilot crashes and tells of conflict in the outside world, she leaves home to fight a war to end all wars, discovering her full powers and true destiny. (12A cert; 141 mins)The DC Extended Universe (DCEU) is now in full swing. We've seen Superman take flight, Batman battling evil in Gotham, and the Suicide Squad fighting the bad with bad. Now, it's time to welcome a new hero; Wonder Woman.Patty Jenkins has received a lot of praise from fans and critics alike as Wonder Woman takes the world by storm. It's clear why; she's a very talented director and skilled within the action genre. Some of the action sequences are wonderfully captured, it's easy to follow and smooth in the edit. She understands the characters and directs the two leads well. Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends.Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are both incredible in their respective roles. Their writing is realistic, you care for them both, truly. However, the screenplay is just as bland as the other DCEU entries. It's funny and inviting, but as the film progresses in its slow pace, the layers start to uncover, revealing its generic story and predictable outcome. Gadot's Wonder Woman is fierce, bold, beautiful. She and Pine are the saving grace, that goes without saying, but the overdose of CGI and the exaggerated yet anti-climatic finale left me feeling empty.That said, it is without a doubt the best DCEU instalment yet, in terms of production and performances. The WWI setting is gritty and dark, as it should be. We get to see how Diana reacts to the evils of war and that was a really nice direction. We see her vulnerable, but we also see her stronger than ever. You'll leave the theatre thinking about one scene in particular; No Man's Land. It's beautifully crafted with some goosebump-worthy moments. I'm sure it'll go down as one of the most memorable scenes in DCEU history.Rupert Gregson-Williams' original score is powerfully moving. There's a moment where Tina Guo skilfully performs Hans Zimmer's kick-ass Wonder Woman theme in one of the most rewarding fights I've seen. Rupert's music is action-packed, but it's the grounded connection between Diana and Steve where he truly delivers. It's a delightful score and functionally superb.It's not a bad film, it's still enjoyable as a stand-alone Wonder Woman epic. Just don't go ahead with high expectations, you'll more than likely leave disappointed. Perhaps I expected too much, given the flooding positive response. There's a lot that could have gone wrong, making it as lacklustre as BvS and Suicide Squad, but it stood up and at least tried to tell a unique and fulfilling story. Above all else, the evolution of Gadot's Wonder Woman is inspiring to watch.Verdict; Gal Gadot & Chris Pine are both wonderful and deliver some truly beautiful moments, but the story lacks momentum, suffering pacing issues and becoming just as tedious as the other DCEU entries.Wonder Woman ‚Äì ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (6/10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Another Good movie that was ruined by a PG-13 rating,"I have to say is that I did enjoy watching this movie. It was a very entertaining movie for Family Friendly Audiences. However, in the end, it lacked storyline and emotional connection that it was trying for mostly because it was rated PG-13. I get that the studio is trying to pander to the widest audience as possible but in the end it doesn't pander to anyone beyond the basic 5 year old whose parents brought them to the movie because it was a 'Super-Hero' movie that they believed their kids would like the movie. Yet, in the end if this movie was indeed a 'dark' rated-R movie would have completely changed the dynamic of the storyline and how well it would have been told.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An iconic movie; a reference point for all future action movies. A Must See!,"Phenomenal! Breathtaking (I'm warning you guys, it's true! Gal Gadot as Diana sets the ultimate standard of the perfect heroine - in beauty, fierceness and heart)! Believable (in its mythical way)!I've seen numerous other super-hero movies (though I missed Superman vs Batman and think I'm glad for it, to have first discovered Wonder Woman in this primary story) but this one is on a whole other class and level. Never has a hero or heroine been elevated to such a level of purity and perfection ¬Ö which is all the more staggering that: never has a super-hero been as believable as this one. Phenomenal! Talk about buy-in: from the opening scene I was totally immersed and lost in the story ¬Ö and what a trip it was!The film-makers (all of them, all together) have made Wonder Woman come to life - in Diana! Ingenious setting and background; spectacular heroine; beautiful film-making, stunts and visual effects (this really is one to see in the best 3D you have access to). I cannot wait for the next Wonder Woman movie! I will watch everything they can throw at us - provided they can somehow keep the standard and integrity of this monumental movie!This is one of those movies that changes everything moving forward; iconic; a reference point, of which there have only been a handful in my lifetime. So I would have to rate this as one of the most amazing movies I have experienced.Go see for yourself - in big screen for the first time you watch it, and in 3D if possible! My only regret is not to have seen it in IMAX 3D! Much praise to all the film-making team for this gem.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Surprisingly entertaining,"I was actually surprised by how good this movie was. I was really entertained. Though I still think Gina Cerano would've been just as good,Gal Gadot,does a great job.What bothers me more,is the man child she have to be hampered with. Cpt Steve Rogers(I always thought he was an American,not a Brit.) He is frustratingly annoying. The way he runs around and, try to pamper Wonder Women when ever she wanna see her powers."" No,no,no.You can't do that,that's much too dangerous for you etc"" Even though he seen her crush and apc with her bare hands.I feel they could've made more use of her strength and super powers.Some of the German spies,was a bit over the top cartoonish.The whole blocking bullet with you wrist cuffs, doesn't transfer well onto the big screen.( Yes, I know she does it in the comics) It looks kind of silly, that every bullet ever fired at her, will always hit at the precise height of her wrist cuffs. They could've chosen a better actor to play the 'Ares but what can you do.It was still a good movie",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Philippus,"I will keep it simple. Philippus is a major character in Wonder Woman. So why would white Hollywood exclude her. Oh, I forgot she is Black. She is both one of Queen Hippolyta's most trusted advisers and the woman who trained Wonder Woman as a child. While all of the Amazons love Wonder Woman, it's Philippus who ultimately takes it upon herself to protect the young princess and teach her just what it means to be an Amazon.Until Hollywood recognizes the importance of racial diversity; I will keep my purse closed and all women of color should do likewise.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Solid genre movie - but still a genre movie,"I watched this before watching Spiderman: Homecoming, but wrote this after doing so. Without the comparison I was already disappointed in Wonder Woman; but after watching a Marvel film, the difference was all the more evident.Wonder Woman starts with a link to the modern attempt at a franchise before jumping back to an origin story. It is a simple affair in terms of setting up one main villain, and letting it play out. It does have some interesting and brave aspects to it, and I appreciated what it did in terms of the male lead and the ultimate villain, but there was a lot of baggy material around it. The supporting characters offer color but the film itself doesn't seem to spark. It is too earnest for the most part, and never gives the audience permission to enjoy it as a piece of entertainment (something that Marvel does well). The action sequences suffer from being too obviously CGI in nature, and some of the effects are surprisingly weak - in some moments it already looks dated and it has not been out that long.The cast are good though, and deserve more. Gadot is much more effective on the promotional appearances than she is here. At times she is limited by her range, at others she is limited by the material. Pine is good throughout but not much more than a twinkle and good humor in terms of character. Thewlis, Huston, Bremner, and others all add quality to the cast but there is not always the material there for them. Like all the superhero films, it ends up with two special effects hitting each other surrounded by lots of CGI destruction; but what matters is what it does outside of that and leading up to it. In the case of Wonder Woman, it doesn't do enough, and takes too long to do it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun if you're in a fun mood.,"This film is an oxymoron. It's so good that you wish it wasn't so bad. What?!Great casting -- you'll fall in love with the characters despite their shallow development. Great acting -- their wit and courage will engage you and make you wonder why you like the cheesy script. Great action -- You'll cheer for the heroine even tho you're wondering why she seems to be doing the opposite of what she's preaching. Great pace -- You'll understand the characters, be intrigued by the mystery and feel rewarded with the contrived timing of the battles. Great visuals -- everything is so pretty. Great superhero adventure -- If you liked Captain America, you should like Wonder Woman. They're pretty much the same movie.If you're an action super-hero fan, you'll probably want to watch this more than once. If you're looking for an Oscar worthy story, well...

Average,"I think to much is made of the female star, female director idea here. Yes, female empowerment could have made a real showing here but it doesn't. We still get the underdressed female star, the gratitoutious slow mo shots, and the humans are good really schtik that we tell ourselves. The story is typical super hero fare set during the first World War but Gail Gadot and Pine do have chemistry and they have the movie star quality that helps this kind of movie. Watchable, but certainly nothing special.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great action movie but not a history film,If you are looking for a movie accurately describing the events of World War 1 then this is not it. It is an amazingly good action film but is not very historically accurate. I'm not sure why we are watching this in a history through film class but i'm not complaining. Although the movie does not portray the events it gives great lessons about war and the temptations of mankind. The action scenes throughout the movie are thrilling and fast paced. I really enjoyed the scene where Wonder Woman is battling Ares and when she is rushing across no man's land deflecting all the bullets with her wrists. The special effects in the movie were also amazingly realistic. I was very intrigued by the effects they used for the island that was separated from the rest of the world.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good but...,"No where near as good as man of steel or bvs. Wonder woman has good acting, strong humor, plenty of emotional moments,memorable characters and a strong sense of hope. However, it is no where near as complex or thought provoking as man of steel or bvs. It is way better than that superficial piece of pandering garbage suicide squad which was neither emotional or thought provokingThis isn't surprising since most mainstream audiences didn't understand those movies which forced dc to do something more straight forward with this movie. The funny thing is that I see people are still complaining about it not having humor or character development even though the movie clearly has both of those things.Unfortunately, these people are so blind with their hate toward the dceu that they won't watch any more movies the franchise puts out. I find this funny considering that the only good mcu movie before the avengers was iron man. The rest were garbage yet you all stuck around. Oh and I don't care if this review offends people. I'm tired of not being able to voice my opinion without getting a ton of hate for it. Marvel has ruined the movie industry with their formulaic generic and safe movies. Dc is trying to do something different every time yet people complain. This of course is because people don't like to think and they don't like blockbusters that do something different",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Brilliant,"I love this movie. I have been a fan of Wonder Woman for some time and this film really does her justice. She has been around for 75 years and finally in 2017 she gets her own film! The pacing is great, the music is great, the actors are great, the colour schemes are great. I came out of the cinema so happy at how this film had portrayed Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot is a a perfect casting choice and Chris Pine is great as Steve Trevor. The WWI setting I found really interesting and unique for a superhero movie, it worked really well.

Also Wonder Woman against the Germans,"Be careful, the following review contains spoiler information..... Finally is arrived! Finally is arrived a top level female superhero (I will not use the term super-heroine for obvious reasons), Wonder Woman is here! Diana does not have anything less than her male ""colleagues"", she is capable to kick your ass twice and do it again, she does not belong to any team and she is a one-woman slaughterhouse, or at least very close to that.Diana's character has been revised and corrected compared to the ""naive"" character of the '70s TV series interpreted by Lynda Carter. Diana is definitively in step with the times and Gal Gadot's interpretation is a high level one, brava!In its entirety the movie hold the line very well and I did like it a lot, I recommend it (for what you can care about)... but there is something that keep me perplexed and lead me to some questions. Why Captain Steve does not drive the plane to open water where he could have had avoid the explosion and could have saved his life? Why a ducking idiot as Goblin can make it every time and Ares in person, or in divinity, seems to be gone after the first appearance in a movie? ... The idea of an Ares dumber than Goblin keep me even more perplex but let's move on. Why insert in the screenplay a Turkish man among the ""heroes""? Has it been made to balance the presence of the Ottoman Empire among the ""villains""? Why to save just them from a bad reputation? And the most important, why all superheroes persecute Germans? Why the duck a German soldier of the World War I shall be considered a member of the forces of evil when the English has to be considered the good guy? After Captain America endeavor in Germany I hoped that the ""bullying"" against Germans would come to an end but, ta-da, Wonder Woman just arrived and killed the fathers to the soldier killed by the puny New Yorker under doping drugs.Yes, it is fiction, it is for fun, but stop it now, please. Too much is too much. I am quite scared that a day California would become independent, you never know if the high military command in Hollywood would declare war to Germany and will send Wonder Woman in Berlin, Captain America in Munich and Superman in Frankfurt... Californian screenwriters, limit yourselves a bit, and more, wasn't America first the motto of that guy that you did not like that much?In this moment I offer all the solidarity I can express to the Germans, without superheroes in the enemy army, they would never ever lose those ducking wars!(original article at www.principesblog.com/superheroes-also-women-against-the-Germans/)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Great movie with good casting but bad plot (SPOILER ALERT),"As much as I liked the movie, I did think that the movie lacked substance in the story/plot and in character development. When we first see Diana as a child, we learn that she wants to learn how to fight and loves to fight. We don't see this in the context of a moral crusade or a belief of helping other's in the movie which leads me to ask the question, does Wonder Woman love the people she is fighting to save or does she innately love fighting? Adding some context in those childhood scenes of seeing her use fighting as a last resort to help another person I think would have been more powerful/effective in her character development.Second, I thought the movie tried to evoke emotions that it had not devoted time investing in. For example, when the village at the end is bombed with the gas and everyone dies in it, we know no one in the village so we, as an audience, are tempted not to care. Adding a scene where we see the humanity and life of the village (a few montage shots to allow us to empathize and care about the villagers) or the introduction of a few villagers whom we feel we know intimately changes the story from a bombed village to the loss of good people. I did love the investment and development of the two main characters, Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor. The buildup of the relationship between Steve and Wonder Woman makes that last scene so wrenching because we actually care about Steve and see his good heart and selflessness. We don't get that kind of emotional investment in the villagers so it isn't a sacrifice that evokes the same amount of emotion.Lastly, I think DC needs to make better villains because I was able to figure out who Ares was early on in the movie. I like the added dimensionality that Ares brings but I felt that his character portrayal, introduction, and impact on the store could have been much improved. I personally felt as though leading us to believe the German commander was Ares was a bit cheesy and needed some modification too.I think casting for this movie was fantastic and my biggest qualms with DC movies isn't the casting but rather the sub par story-telling and plot. I'm starting to see a trend with DC movies and in my opinion, the biggest weaknesses are the villains (lack of depth), great casting with bad plots/stories, and lack of emotional investment (i.e. the people Amanda Waller kills in Suicide Squad or the villagers in Wonder Woman).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Also the fighting parts and the whole lets say adventure seemed not to have any influence on her, like she can't get dirty or bruised while everybody else looked like they haven't showered for days which would actually be more accurate :) I liked the Amazons more than I like Wonder Woman :)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Glorious Manifestation of Hope and Love,"Patty Jenkins has managed to do what no other filmmaker has done in almost a decade- revive DC. You may painfully recall last year's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The only bright spot in an otherwise excruciating film was the introduction of Gal Gadot's Diana aka Wonder Woman. She walked away with the movie's best scenes set to that killer theme tune. I, like many others, was looking forward to Wonder Woman's solo film and boy does it deliver!Why did it take so long for a female superhero to get the spotlight in today's era of superhero movies? Because our society isn't quite as evolved as some would have you believe. But no matter. If the long wait results in Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman being made, I say the wait was worth it. Ms. Jenkins skillfully blends action, humor, and heart to create a character that shines brighter than any hero I've seen on celluloid in recent memory. Her star kicks the villain's ass while she lets the patriarchy have it. Hats off, Madam Director.The story revolves around Diana, an Amazonian Princess, who has been raised on an island far from the rest of the world but when she rescues a pilot from a plane crash she gets to know about the outside world and how men have brought it to its knees with war and destruction. Unable to stand idly by Diana embarks on a destiny defining mission to rescue man from all that is evil. This isn't a short film, as the genre doesn't allow it, but it's well thought out and smartly paced. Action, drama, and humor are all well executed and come up at appropriate times. The visuals and background score are stunning. But more than anything, it's the heart and soul of the main character that keeps you glued to your seat.Gal Gadot has a sparkling presence. She infuses Diana with kindness and strength in equal doses. Her screams echo in the theatre and the charm in her eyes makes it difficult for you to look away. It's the best cast DC role since Heath Ledger's Joker. Chris Pine delights as Steve Trevor, Diana's companion and guide to the new world. He's genuine and lends a hand (or shoulder) to his costar who doesn't often need it. David Thewlis (who I can only remember as Lupin from Harry Potter) is effective and does well in a relatively short part.Wonder Woman is a glorious manifestation of hope, love, and the power of good. While the character is never called 'Wonder Woman', the movie is indeed wonderful. Patty Jenkins has done complete justice to a character that will live in our hearts for a long time. As Diana's mother says, ""be careful in the world of men, Diana. They do not deserve you."" This rings especially true in our troubled times. We don't deserve this hero but we certainly need her.https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com/2017/06/03/wonder-woman/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nice movie for kids and terrible for DC fans,"It's really hard for me to rate this movie. If I start detail analysis of everything wrong with it I'll spend half a day on bashing and I have o go to work in half an hour. First, this is school example of lazy screenwriting. The story is dumb linear, full of holes and illogicalities and characters are terribly developed, without any background or evolution during the movie, which is unacceptable for an origin story. Gal Gadot is perfect for the role, but her acting is artificial and it looks like she poses for every scene. Like if the accent isn't on portraying WW character in the best possible way, but they want to decoy us and draw our attention from bad movie to Gal's unbelievable beauty and skills. Amount of slow motion in action scenes is so excessive that after some time it goes from ridiculous to tragic. I had a feeling like I'm watching ballet adaptation of comic-book on Fashion channel. Special effects are not bad, but it could be done better and more convincing. This looks more like animated than a feature film. Also, in some scenes, it is more than obvious they violently refrained from natural development of the scene only to stay within PG-13 at any cost. If I go into details I could do this for hours. And then again, Gal Gadot is magical, hypnotizing. There are some beautiful scenes and few funny moments. Although I could list its flaws for hours and I have almost no compliments for this movie, I really enjoyed watching it. Briefly, catastrophe, but really entertaining one.7/10Objectively, I would give it 5/10, but it would be hypocritical to rate so low movie that I will most probably watch again.

Wonder Woman exceeds all expectations.,"Wonder Woman is directed by Patty Jenkins and is the fourth film in the DC Cinematic Universe. It's not a secret that there was a lot riding on this film. Some people even went as far as to say that if this movie didn't succeed, the future of DC's live action movies may be up in the air. Well, good news; not only is Wonder Woman a great movie, it's one of the best super hero movies I've seen in quite a while.PlotWonder Woman follows the story of Princess Diana, who lives on the remote (and hidden) island of Themyscira. But one day, a plane penetrates the shield that hides the island from the rest of the world and crashes into the water. Diana rescues the man, and thus it is inevitable that she will visit the world of men (aka London). Also, obviously, she will kick some serious ass.I gotta say, Wonder Woman's story is one of the most well-rounded super hero stories I've watched in a while. It's intriguing in the beginning, but once the action starts you are locked in for quite a ride. There's emotion, humor, and of course there's a lot of action. I would say that Wonder Woman suffers from the super hero movie syndrome, which is basically where the story follows the origin, conflict, boss fight formula. But we do have to take into account that this is the first Wonder Woman movie, ever. That's pretty crazy when you think about it, and because of that I'm perfectly fine with Wonder Woman following the standard formula. Audiences need to be properly introduced to the character, learn to care for the character, and obviously see her kick some serious ass. It makes sense and it works well.It's not going to go down as one of the best stories in history, or even of the year, but it's still a fantastic super hero story.ScriptThe script for Wonder Woman is fantastic. There are no scenes that drag on longer than they should. The longer conversations have a purpose, and the shorter conversations aren't clunky or awkward. There's also a lot of witty humor throughout which makes the movie much, much more enjoyable.Allan Heinberg did a great job writing this movie.CharactersWonder Woman is the focus of this movie, who woulda expected that? So, as you might expect, if she doesn't win over the audience then the movie isn't gonna be all that great. Well, good news: Wonder Woman is great in Wonder Woman. She's likable, intelligent, and surprise, surprise...she can kill lots of dudes.Steve Trevor is also incredibly likable and pretty funny. He is exactly what he needs to be for this movie, and while he's not the main focus he does help the story along in a big way.The rest of the characters are secondary/background for the most part (besides the villain which I won't get into). They're all great, though, and help the movie excel to the level it does.Potential AudienceWhile I wouldn't take my five year-old kid to see this movie, I would take anyone above the age of 12 to see Wonder Woman. This is a movie that can appeal to everyone. Old men? Yes. Old women? Yes? Middle- aged? You betcha. Millennial? Hell yeah.If you enjoy a movie that has a good story and a fair bit of action, you'll walk out of the theater satisfied.ConclusionWonder Woman is the first major critical success of Warner Brothers' new DC universe, and I hope that it is not the last. It's exactly what we were all hoping it would be. Furthermore, it's exactly what it needed it to be.Heck, I'll be going to see it again soon, and I'll be buying it on Blu-Ray later this year. It was that good.Oh yeah, if it isn't obvious already, I definitely think that you should go see this movie. You won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Wonder Woman | DC Finally Gets One Right,Finally DC gets one right. Wonder Woman was very good. I'm keeping it vague not to spoil it for anyone. The story was told nicely from the very beginning. Gal did a really nice job. The ending is a bit all over the place but you wind up being forgiving because the movie until that point was done very well. I hope DC learns from that. I rated it a 9 because I couldn't do 8.5 Stars. I could've done 8 but cut DC a break for what seems to be learning from past mistakes|missteps. I would've given it a 10 if the ending wasn't all over the place. I'm also taking into consideration that this is the introduction of Wonder Woman. I'm sure Lynda Carter is proud. As the Wonder Woman introduction into the Modern Super Hero | Heroine Universe this will not disappoint at all.

But DC Comics did have one ace up its sleeve, in that Wonder Woman, the first widely recognizable super-heroine in the history of comic books, would ALSO have the potential to be the first super-heroine to launch her own truly successful movie franchise. (The first female superhero franchise would have been the ""Daredevil"" spin-off ""Elektra"" in 2005, but that film failed to launch such a movie franchise.)To that end, DC Comics has largely succeeded with ""Wonder Woman,"" a film that breaks with past DC movie titles in the fact that it's headlined by a female lead and - most important for this viewer (and, borrowing the words of another commenter) - it has a finer balance of action and levity, and the latter seems to arise naturally from the material and doesn't feel forced. Marvel has succeeded in that regard to make their films more entertaining - even if every other line in one of their films now ends in a punchline.But, I digress.Wonder Woman, who was created by American psychologist William Moulton Marston (the man responsible for creating the polygraph machine) and inspired by his wife Elizabeth and their mutual live-in lover Olive Byrne - and who first appeared in ""All Star Comics #8"" - is a character I have an unusual relationship with.I'm 31, going on 32. And I'm a guy. Growing up, I had always heard about Wonder Woman, but did not actually become a fan of the character until about five years ago, and that was by way of the Lynda Carter TV series ""Wonder Woman"" from the 1970s. I still believe Carter to be the ultimate Wonder Woman - in spite of that show's inherent '70s cheesiness - but this big-screen 2017 film adaptation may prove that that version of the character has been formally relegated to the rapidly changed times. Wonder Woman was also not the first female superhero I encountered growing up - I believe it was Storm of the X-Men, from Marvel - but she was still the most widely recognized character that I was aware of growing up. Watching the Lynda Carter TV series, I thought it was amazing to see such a positive central portrayal of a female superhero that I hadn't seen yet in television or film.""Wonder Woman"" is a film that I had high expectations for, and those expectations were largely met. ""Wonder Woman"" isn't your typical origin story, either - being that this version of the character first appeared in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016) last year. The film also doesn't waste a lot of time obsessing over every little detail, and waste precious screen-time, of how young Diana (Lilly Aspell), an Amazonian princess, eventually grows up into the beautiful Diana Prince (Israeli model and actress Gal Gadot). She already is Wonder Woman; she just has to learn to be the person that she was destined to be and realize her purpose in this world as a super-heroine.When American U.S. Army intelligence operative Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash-lands his World War I plane in the waters just off Diana's beautiful island of Themyscira, he enlists her to return to Man's World to help him deliver a stolen notebook containing valuable information on a new chemical super-weapon that the Germans are developing (mustard gas). Along with Diana, Steve recruits three friends - secret agent Sameer (Said Taghmaoui), Scottish sharpshooter Charlie (Ewen Bremner, Spud from ""Trainspotting,"" who also serves as this film's comic relief), and the Native-American expatriate The Chief (Eugene Brave Rock) - to help them accomplish their mission and stop the war-mongering German commandant General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) from going forth with his plans to launch a mustard gas attack on nearby London.Directed by Patty Jenkins, ""Wonder Woman"" has the distinction of being only the SECOND superhero film with a woman at the helm - after German director Lexi Alexander (""Punisher: War Zone"" in 2008). It would seem appropriate, I suppose, that such a groundbreaking character could only be done proper cinematic justice by a female director, and Patty Jenkins is quite the competent one here. Gal Gadot, who like all able-bodied Israeli citizens, served two years in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), and I would hazard a guess that her military background certainly helped in getting her the part to play Wonder Woman. She's a tough and formidable presence on the screen and plays the character remarkably well (she definitely IS this version of Wonder Woman) - but again, I still favor Lynda Carter as the DEFINITIVE Wonder Woman.If ""Wonder Woman"" suffers from any problems, it's in the action sequences. As someone else here pointed out, ""Wonder Woman"" suffers from the same slow-motion, gravity-defying CGI effects first pioneered by ""The Matrix"" (1999) and was way, WAY overdone in its two sequels. I honestly felt like I was watching ""The Matrix Reloaded"" (2003) and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" (2003) all over again, and I thought that Hollywood had grown out of its ""Matrix"" obsession years ago - and yet it seems like it's coming back. You could find an excuse in the fact that it's a comic book superhero film - but still, it's very jarring and can tend to slow action scenes down. Yeah, it looks cool and all, but sometimes it can be overdone and hamper your overall enjoyment of the picture in these places.""Wonder Woman"" was a solidly entertaining, if imperfect, big-screen debut solo outing for such a groundbreaking character and comic book property. Now, I honestly can't wait to see a sequel where Wonder Woman is saving the world in modern times.A ""Wonderful"" ""Wonder Woman,"" indeed.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The DCEU goes back to basics and it works wonders.,"As a character, Wonder Woman has been around since 1941, which makes it even more crazy to think that she has never had her own film released in cinemas. That is, until now. The fourth film of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), which has been pretty lacklustre so far, Wonder Woman is a film that couldn't come at a more relevant time.When American pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes on the island of Themyscira, he meets Diana (Gal Gadot), an Amazonian princess and trained warrior. Upon hearing of the horrors of World War I, Diana leaves her home to fight in the war to end all wars, where she realises her full potential and becomes Wonder Woman.The DCEU has certainly shown ambition in its short lifespan but each and every one of Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad were weighed down with either destruction porn, convoluted narratives or just plain old bad filmmaking. With Wonder Woman, Patty Jenkins, who just so happens to be the first female to direct a big-budget superhero film, goes back to basics and it truly does work wonders for the DCEU.Jenkins hasn't made a film since Monster back in 2003, which is astonishing considering how good that film is, yet it feels as if she's been an avid filmmaker since then with just how confidently she unleashes the titular Wonder Woman upon the world. Delivering a basic yet inspiring origin story, Wonder Woman is a film that does justice to such an iconic character, ensuring she remains an empowering female character and role model.Wonder Woman really does feel like a classic adventure film, where the action sequences drive the film forward however, they do so without sacrificing the narrative. Diana's origin story from her younger years on Themyscira through to her realisation of how horrific mankind can be to one another through fighting in World War I makes for such impactful viewing, Allan Heinberg's screenplay making the audience feel empathy towards Diana.Heinberg also ensures that we are watching a film based on a comic book with some delightfully funny moments between the film's characters. Seriously, I was taken aback by just how funny Wonder Woman actually ended up being, considering how dark and serious most the DCEU has been previously. The action sequences, particularly the No Man's Land sequence, are so powerful and thrilling, Diana's emotions pouring out through the majority of them, making for a film the audience can connect with more.Coming to the performances, Wonder Woman features a lead performance from Gal Gadot that certainly blew away any skepticism I had about her going in to the film. A lot was made of her appearance in Batman v Superman however, now is the right time to properly judge her in the role and she does an amazing job as Wonder Woman. She's powerful when she has to be and wonderfully funny with a fish-out-of-water demeanour akin to the one seen in Thor. I was most impressed with how effectively Gadot displays the naivety and innocence of Diana when it comes to the war, one particular moment making for one of the more emotional moments in a superhero film of recent years.Chris Pine makes for a great partner for Gadot to share the screen with as Steve Trevor, who Pine plays with a bit of the cockiness we've seen him play Kirk in Star Trek with. The chemistry between the pair makes the love story that plays a major part in the narrative feel much more natural to watch. The rest of the cast, rather disappointingly, felt a little underwhelming, particularly Danny Huston as yet another forgettable villain of a superhero film, and Robin Wright, who gets nowhere near the amount of screen time I was hoping for.2017 has been a great year for superhero films so far and Wonder Woman ensures that the trend continues, Gal Gadot and Patty Jenkins sharing a working relationship full of passion to deliver a fantastic adventure for such an important character. Wonder Woman is a massive step in the right direction for both the DCEU and women in film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
good,"Wonder woman gave hope to the DC cinematic universe. An action movie with a good story, wonder woman is above all a super hero movie plainly.
A woman coming forward seeking her destiny is the whole idea of it. Gal Gadot was mesmerizing. The scene she tasted ice cream for the first time, that was a commentable moment. Non lame graphics and a gracious Gal Gadot made it a one time watch's worth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It had some fun moments and was a good watch, too long though","This movie with the exception of Man of Steel is the best thing to come out of DC connected movie franchise so far. It has an interesting prequel to her appearance in Batman V. Superman where you get to see her history coming into being and what lead up to her becoming the super hero she is today.It takes place back in WWII which makes some ways makes one think at times about Captain America: The First Avenger, although the problem here is the non action elements in some cases draw on too long and aren't entirely interesting or even all that relevant in the end.The fights and the villain are entertaining though and it results in a satisfying ending in the end. If you can forgive it for dragging in places, you probably will like it overall.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Gal Gadot is outstanding. Loved it!,"Wonder Woman is incredible! It is very well written, edited, and directed. Patty Jenkins gives the audience an adventure they will never forget. Unlike other DC Movies, it is not slow, or just filled with action, but has the perfect combination of comedy, romance, and adventure. Gal Gadot is breathtaking. She perfectly delivers the innocence of Diana and her difficult journey as she finds out how cruel human beings can be. Another great thing about the movie is the partnership between Diana and Steve. The teammates trust each other and help each other out, knowing they are both capable of doing the same things. Steve trusts Diana's instincts, and is afraid she might get overwhelmed with how different the world is. Whilst Diana struggles to understand his emotions and his constant desire to protect her. The chemistry between the actors is obvious, and their journey together is worth watching. But, the most important thing is the lesson of the movie. We live in a world were most superheroes are male. Women are either sidekicks or damsels in distress. The world is changing, and Wonder Woman shows the younger generations that girls can also be heroes. Definitely my favorite movie of the year!

Beach fight is awesome,"Really enjoyed the scene where Amazons fought the German soldiers on the beach. Reminds me of 300 but less bloody, more elegant. Ancient Greek warriors with cold weapons bashed into soldiers carrying guns, such a collision. It is my favourite fighting scene in the whole movie, 8 out of 10 for that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Jenkins has saved the DCEU,"'WONDER WOMAN' was directed by Patty Jenkins and stars Gal Gadot, Chris Pine and David Thewlis. ‚ÄãAfter a wounder soldier(Chris Pine) washes up on Amazon shores, Diana(Gal Gadot) believes that Ares is behind it and goes with the soldier into WW1 and tries to stop Ares once and for all.Let me start of by saying that I am neither a woman nor am I a feminist. I believe all humans should receive equal rights but do not fight for them in any way, so don't call me a femenist. That said, this movie is freaking awesome. People say it empowers women but I think it empowers us as a species.I've liked every DCEU movie up until this point(yes, even Suicide Squad') but this is the only one that I consider has rivalled Marvel's standard. Gal Gadot gives the best performance of her career as Wonder Woman and commands this movie. Chris Pine plays his role perfectly as Steve Trevor and the chemistry between the two is very convincing and entertaining.The story is also pretty good and informs the audience all about Wonder Woman, and her past. Both I and the person whom I watched this movie with knew little about the character going in and are both now well educated on the character.Not to say this movie is without flaws. I will definitely say that the climax of this movie is very messy and could have been controlled a lot better and cleaner. They also try to trick the audience throughout the movie but anyone with a brain can figure out how it's going to go. I won't spoil it for you but I image you'll be able to figure it out.This is a very good looking movie and the overwhelming majority of the action was handled really well. There is a sequence towards the middle of this movie where I wanted to stand up in the cinema and cheer because it was just that good. The CGI was also very well handled, again with the exception of the climax where it became overused and bloated.The supporting cast, from Ewen Bremmer's Scottish Charlie to Elena Anaya's creepy Doctor Poison, did a convincing job and served their role to the story. That is to say with the exception of David Thewlis, who started off strong but then became incredibly comical towards the final act. Not to say that being comical is a bad idea but it didn't fit with his character and took me out of the movie.The majority of the jokes hit for me in this movie and I wouldn't say any of them felt forced or out of place. Don't complain that 'DC's Copying Marvel' because not once did I feel like this was a Marvel movie and was convinced it was DC's own thing throughout the entire run time.All in all, I definitely recommend you watch this movie. If you're reading this review while the movie is in theatre's, please watch it instead of 'Pirates 5' because this movie needs to do well and will hopefully convince Warner Bros that this is the movie is what the fans want. I very much so enjoyed this movie and will rate it 9 out of 10 Scottish Accents!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Wonderful start, ends to be the average superhero movie","Don't get me wrong: I really enjoyed the Wonder Woman movie, I think it was very well conceived: the Amazons island was stunning and action scenes, are breathtaking. Camera movement are very dynamics and slow motion is placed at the right moment.Movie is setted during the First World War. Diana is forced to see the cruelty of the it. She is a fighter in every sense, not only with her superpowers, but also with words: she always argue with humans about injustices of the world, but the only one that really understand her is Steve. The chemistry between the two is amazing, and their relationship will have many beautiful and funny moments.The main issue with the movie is the ending: after many wonderfully conceived scenes, with the perfect mix between CGI and stunts actions, the movie finishes with the classic boss fight, that we are already used to see in a Marvel movie and that was, personally speaking, completely unsettling. I was waiting for something different, but in the end director decided to play safe. After watching Shazam!, I think that the DC Extended Universe has a lot of potential, but as we already know through the years, it had many difficulties to rise, Marvel has definitely more experience, but it tends to create always those empty and repetitive movies, while DC, at least for me, has more beautiful stories. They just need to understand how to develop something that really differs and I think that with Joker (2019), they are finally going in the right direction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Incredible movie!!!,"This truly is a must see movie - whether or not you like comic book movies. From the first note of music, you are drawn into this world, these characters, the action, and the intrigue. They skillfully pack a lot of story into this movie along with refreshing character development, engaging dialogue, humor, and keen insight. You will leave this movie feeling like you are ready to change your own life, your own world.The performances are nuanced. The cinematography - stunning. The action - intense. I typically loathe the phrase ""this movie has something for everyone"" as I find that usually applies to movies that I personally find to be stretched too thin, movies that go out of their way to TRY and have something for everyone, movies that have a contrived feel. However, this movie is deep, rich, and passionate, and i believe that everyone would enjoy it.I plan on seeing it again in the theatre, and I have not done that for several years. (and I am a movie nut.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Is Diana just the Amazon equivalent of a teenager?,"I was looking forward to a badass female lead superhero movie. For the most part that's what I got. Unfortunately for most of the movie it felt like Diana was just acting like a stubborn teenager that knows better than everyone else, ignoring even seemingly simple requests by her supposed partner in action. I get that some of this may have been on purpose to show her naivety to how this world behaves or her vigor to help make a positive difference or the idea that I don't need a man to tell me what to do, or maybe just played for comedic effect to some extent. I don't know. But it just put me off a little. Like this guy is clearly trying to help, can you just listen to him for one second? Also really played up the romance angle more than I expected for what I thought was supposed to showcase the strong independent woman. By the end of the film she seems to have grown and hopefully will be less irritating in the future. Rant finished. Overall I thought it had good story, acting, action and effects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Leaps Above The Rest of the DCEU Canon!,"Wonder Woman is the DC film we've been waiting for since The Dark Knight Trilogy concluded in 2012. And Wonder Woman is EVERYTHING I wanted it to be. I'll readily admit I was incredibly disappointed with Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad when i saw them at the movies. But now the DCEU is finally gaining the footing it should have achieved with Dawn of Justice. And I LOVE this movie; Wonder Woman is finally in her own movie, after 76 years of comic-book history in the making! The story is self-contained feel good bliss, Gal Gadot is wonderful as Diana, and director Patty Jenkins has brought us the first GREAT female superhero movie!Wonder Woman is DC's answer to Marvel's Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor; and it makes an even better movie out of the two mixed together. I was happily surprised by how good this movie was. Truly good stuff to find here; Themyscira is FINALLY brought to us on the big screen and it's glorious, and then being taken to World War One Europe is just as fantastically realised as The First Avenger's World War Two setting. This whole film is like a standout issue of the Wonder Woman comic. The story's the perfect playground for developing comic's GREATEST superheroine! Besides some questionable CG in the third act, I don't have any particularly big gripes with the movie.Hopefully with Wonder Woman DC will give Justice League the narrative focus t deserves (fingers crossed on that though). This film is the first great instalment in the DCEU film series yet, and I'm truly hoping there are other films just as good as Wonder Woman down the line.The Lasso of Truth compels me to give the movie: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Wonderful,"While I am a big advocate for Man of Steel and how misunderstood I found that movie to be by many I cannot deny that since then the DCEU has had many issues with Batman Vs Superman and Suicide Squad being deeply flawed movies. While this did dent my confidence in Wonder Woman a but I was still convinced it would be a big improvement and hopefully set this universe back on the right track and thankfully my faith was very well placed.Wonder Woman is without a doubt one of my favourite movies of this year so far and a lot of that has to do with the titular character herself. Gal Gadot is brilliant as her, she brings just the right amount of naivety yet sheer will to this character, she's brilliant in the action sequences and like Ben Affleck before her has proved plenty of her doubters wrong. All the performances in this movie we're solid Chris Pine was great, even though I was a bit disappointed that he didn't enter this universe as Green Lantern he made this character his own and really stood out. David Thewlis brought quite a lot to his character and I liked the good nature of his character.Wonder Woman had a nice heart to it which I really appreciated. The tone was just right, it was good for this film to go down a more light-hearted direction, I didn't mind the dark tones of MOS and BVS but I don't want non stop darkness, there is room for some lightheartedness that this film had just the right amount of. It did have its more serious and darker moments it felt like there was a good balance between the light and dark that Suicide Squad couldn't quite find.I've always liked that the DCEU has put there characters first, even if they don't always succeed and this film was no acceptation. Diana and her arc in this film was just right, I liked her primary mission but also a lot of the obstacles she experiences along the way that show her humanity is not a perfect as she would like it to be. I loved Chris Pine's character in this movie, not only was he really funny as well as very entertaining, he had great chemistry with Gal Gadot that made you care even more about his character even if they did take him in some predictable routes. I also really enjoyed the team of men who accompany them, they weren't in the film much but shined when they were and added some much needed levity.I loved the World War One setting of this movie, it let this movie stand on its own truly apart for the rest of the universe. They didn't really shy away from some of the horrors of this war and tied it in nicely with its main plot. It also gave director Patty Jenkins a chance to really shine, she directed this film fantastically, she took to the action sequences very well making them seem somewhat real as well as gritty.My biggest issue with this movie was it's villainous characters, I liked there designs and were good in the action set pieces but they felt quite conventional and under-utilised. Often there'd just be scenes cutting back to them talking ominously about there lack of time or there evil plans, it felt a bit jarring compared to the rest of the film and most of there plot line doesn't truly come to ahead until the final act.Wonder Woman is a step back in the right direction for the DCEU, it had terrific action sequences with solid characters played very by the actors and actresses portraying them, it had a good heart to it that benefited the lighter tone while not being without its darker moments. It did have issues with its villains but that's a small price to pay for a truly fantastic experience that feels like a good half way between the DCEU's haters and its supporters.9.1/10-A (Phenomenal)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

with horrible acting.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I Wonder,"I like Wonder Woman because I grew up reading the comics and she could do no wrong plus pull her weight and it wasn't about her being a woman as much as just using her gifts, talents and abilities to do good and help others. This version tries to give it a feminist identity by emphasizing the female part instead of appreciating it. I also thought that the origin and development of her birth and rise would have been more dynamic and have more detail to it. This movie serves as a start-up for the subject but could have been so much more. I also didn't care for the supporting actors and their parts which were not plausible. I am willing to bend on Super-hero flicks to a point but not break. This one took its time getting started and by mid-way through the movie we are so glad to see some real good focused Wonder Woman action. The story lacks as does the final battle but whatever one thinks this ends up being the movie it is. Yes to watching it so you keep up.

Lives up to its Hype,"When this movie was announced, I was super excited, but at the same time, skeptical. Because all the recent DC Movies didn't live up to all the hype. However, once I sat down in the theatre, all comfortable with my popcorn and icee and watched the film, I can say that it is absolutely amazing! It definitely lives up to its potential. Once the movie was over, I started clapping and, after I left the theatre, I realized my hands were red because I had clapped so hard.The story of this film starts on Themyscira, an island cloaked from society and home to the Amazons. Diana, Princess of the Amazons, finds an allied spy who washed on shore named Steve Trevor. He tells her about the horrors of World War l and she decides to join him to stop The War to End All Wars.Gal Gadot plays Wonder Woman and, oh my gosh, she is awesome! She is courageous and fierce, but also intelligent and empathetic. She is the perfect role model for every little girl. She is the iconic Wonder Woman! But in all seriousness, all the actors are awesome and really likable. One particular character that didn't get enough screen time was Steve's secretary, Eta Candy, played by Lucy Davis. She is really funny and has some great one liners. She really deserved more time to shine.The special effects and fight scenes are also extraordinary. During most of the action scenes, I found myself leaning forward, wide-eyed and gripping my seat. Unlike Batman V Superman or Suicide Squad, I could actually SEE what was happening! To me, the best scene in the movie is when Diana, Steve and his crew lead an invasion of a German controlled town and liberate it. The action is so exciting and, when the Wonder Woman theme starts playing, I literally started smiling until the scene was over.Surprisingly, this film is also extremely hilarious. I was laughing for a good chunk of time. The humor mainly comes from Diana's lack of knowledge of our civilization. There's a really funny scene where Eta tries to give Diana a normal outfit and she kicks and rips the skirt.I definitely give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. This movie opens in theatres on June 2, 2017. I could say I recommend this movie for comic book fans, but honestly everyone should see this movie. Wonder Woman is an iconic role model and Gal Gadot definitely lives up to the part. Director Patty Jenkins lassoed this hit film and I love that a woman directed it - Girl Power! That's the truth.Reviewed by Calista B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Tripped at the finish line,"WONDER WOMAN
RATING: 3.4/5Well i have to say, Gal Gadot really owned the role of Wonder Woman. She did a great job and i think the character is totally safe in her capable hands. This movie had a really solid, arguably great, start. Finding out about the Amazons and their warrior origins, was super interesting to me. The 2nd Act, shifting over to the World War 1 stuff, was pretty good and i actually wish they did more with that, but somewhere along the way, you could just feel the suits in Hollywood get involved. The 3rd Act literally devolved into nothing but excessively bad CGI and explosions. It was kind of sad to see because the movie was on its way to being great before getting totally derailed.The quiet moments in this movie, where the characters were allowed to just breathe and be themselves, is where this movie shined IMO. Chris Pine did a solid job as Steve Trevor, definitely well cast, you could feel both characters struggle trying to work with and understand each other, coming from different worlds. The villains weren't built up very well, and that normally wouldn't be that big a deal, except the way they were used at the end, meant that they needed to be fleshed out more for it to really resonate with the audience the way it was supposed to.The movie is by no means bad, it's just painfully okay, you could even argue good and that would be totally fine, but the fact that it was headed toward being great, is what's really getting under my skin here. I feel like this movie was just outright robbed of how great it could have been, and that's a crying shame... guess i can find solace in owning the animated Wonder Woman blu ray, that one's pretty great ^_^",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

All the other characters play their roles extremely well. Everything from the environment to the sets to the special effects to the costumes. It all contributes to the nice, appealing look of this superhero film. There are funny parts, and super intense parts.

Why can't anyone monitor fake reviews?,"I mean, even if someone liked this god awful movie, you still can't proclaim it's ""The best superhero movie!"" and ""it's better than The entire MCU movie collection"". Don't make your reviews so obviously fake, especially when you're posting from an account that you just opened.As for the movie - just skip it. Gal Gadot's charm in the interviews and talk shows does not translate to the big screen. Any woman with a pretty face can recite lines. Her performance was generic at best. The entire plot was shallow, paint-by-numbers, and the jokes were cringeworthy.I really wanted DCEU to succeed, to have another cinematic world in submerge in. They may make some money and have their army of loyal fans rabidly defending them, but in the end, the quality of these movies is really, really low. Even Thor 2 had a more coherent story and more entertaining dialogues.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"DC, you should be proud of Wonder Woman.","This movie had a lot of heart, it hits the audience emotionally several times throughout the movie and in different ways, it makes you laugh, think at times and some people even teared up in some moments. I had to bring a female friend with me and I did, she enjoyed the movie so much that at times she was just dishing out laughs at times I wasn't even laughing that much. It's a truly funny movie, but when it needs to... And it is convenient. My biggest criticism of some of these super hero movies, I won't name names, is that there's a joke being thrown out every 30 seconds. Even when the stakes are really high, and the world is falling apart, jokes are being thrown everywhere. That doesn't happen in this movie, when it gets dark, it gets dark. When it touches serious subjects such as consequences of war, you kind of feel it. the chemistry between Gadot and Chris is amazing, they were really good together. This was my favorite role he has been in, sry Captain. This is the best DCEU movie so far and the best since The Dark Knight to me, easily. Whatever changes were made at Warner Bros. it worked, keep hitting that note cause I like it.Aside note: I'm sure every person who played God of War I (the game) felt nostalgic throughout this movie. I love Greek mythology, always did as a kid and before Wonder Woman, I felt like God of War was one of the few things that got it right. Well done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Comic Book Based Movie So Far,"After watching it yesterday, I must say that this movie is one of the best movies I watched! I might even say the best movie that is based on a comic book. Until now Marvel was crushing DC based movies, but Wonder Woman movie gives DC a chance to level it up. Movie has a great balance between action scenes, storytelling, humor etc. A lot of blockbusters give you more or less stuff that you see in trailers and you already know what you will get. But in this movie there was not a part that was boring, and when the movie was over there was nothing missing to show or tell. Great! I would recommend it to you even if you are not a fan of comic book based movies. I would give it a 10/10 if one of the actors did not play Stryker in X-men, casting should avoid crossovers with Marvel and DC universe in my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Oh My God!,"Probably the best DC film since Christian hung up his cape (Unless Man Of Steel was after that? I don't know? That was great, Henry Cavill is sooo hot!).I do have a lot of faults to pick with it however. For example: If Wonder Woman is not only the titular character, but also the lead part, why did it still feel like a Chris Pine film, once he arrived on screen?I did like the bad ass fighting women and the smooth moves they had, but maybe the beginning was a bit long, as we don't really get to see Wonder Woman as we know her until about 71 Minutes in (Thank you IMDB Trivia).Overall, it doesn't really have that impressive story and is quite simple with a little bit of excitement towards the end, but there are some elements that are well thought out. I especially liked the use of old art to depict the story she was told as a child and the fights were all very well choreographed.What I didn't like, was the choice of actor for Ares, God Of War. A bit northern for my tastes perhaps? I would probably have chosen a younger actor, aged him up to start and then revealed him as a young muscled God at the end.Also, I'm assuming that the Native American Guy is true to the comics, but as a Marvel reader, I have no idea if he is right or not. I do think from a film goers perspective that he was just a bit odd, but then I suppose the guy in the kilt was too?I adore Chris Pine and he does a good job here, even if there is definitely some Captain Kirk there, but I think that Gal should have had more presence and the story should have shown her as a leader from the start.Hopefully the films that follow on from here will give her the glory she deserves. After all, the girls got skills man!

Getting DCEU out from under!!,"Yes! it's about time. As far as I'm concern the tribunal over at DC is Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman. So why did it take sooo long for this movie to finally get made when the other two have been rebooted three times over?It's the best movie in the DC Extended Universe too, but that's not saying much, cause it's really not that hard to beat Man of Steel, Batman v Superman or Suicide Squad.It reminds me so much of Captain America: The first Avenger, even though they change Princess Diana's point of origin from World War II to World War I, but same premise, The Great War forces the Amazons who have not been a part of Man's world for centuries to get evolved and that came in the form of Princess Diana.The best part of the film is the relationship between Gal Gadot and Christ Pine who plays Steve Trevor, the most important man in Wonder Woman's life since the beginning. Diana coming to Man's world with this bright eyed innocence of right and wrong, and Trevor's awkwardness of trying to explain how man's world works made for some fun scenes as well as some great drama. Done so right, it really makes up the heart of the movie.The action scenes were pretty good. Sometimes a little too much CGI when trying to visual explain what Wonder Woman's power structure is, but I really like what they were doing when she worked that magic lasso (Other than getting the truth from men). It was really cool.The villains were good. Better than a lot of villains in these comic book movies, not better than Micheal Shannon as General Zod, but I really liked Dr. Poison and what they did with Aries.I will say that there were points, like during the final battle that maybe it got too corny with the dialog about the hero's journey and the villain's evil speech.But overall Wonder Woman is showing a step in the right direction for DC's film franchise, far more true to the character out of the comic than I've seen them do in this extended universe, and Gal Gadot almost became my favorite Wonder Woman (I'm sorry you can't beat Linda Carter in those satin tights but she only wins by a hair).Check it out.http://cinemagardens.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
All Hail Gal Gadot!,"Gal Gadot has charisma. A rare one. She pulls you inside her world of 'Wonder Woman' & doesn't let you go. Donning the superwoman role for the 2nd time, starting with the forgettable Batman V. Superman, Gadot brings energy, command & a whole new level to the word Sexy! She's irresistible.Having said that, 'Wonder Woman' is never as strong as her leading-lady. While she soars, the Writing never allows the narrative to remain consistently strong. Its entertaining, but far from amazing.'Wonder Women' Synopsis: Before she was Wonder Woman she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained warrior. When a pilot crashes and tells of conflict in the outside world, she leaves home to fight a war to end all wars, discovering her full powers and true destiny.'Wonder Woman' begins grippingly & holds well until our strong leading-lady comes to London with her Leading-Man (A Likable, Earnest Chris Pine) . But, soon after, the pace drops & gets sluggish. Also, despite some excellent action set-pieces, the film never Wow's you, as the Writing gets lazy. What starts off as an engaging origin story, suddenly becomes a regular Good versus Evil Fight. The villains lack the punch, so its all about upto the wondrous superwoman to keep it going.And Gadot does it with spectacular success. I was mesmerized by Gadot's heroic turn, that is sure to send the audiences into a high. Gadot is a Star & is certainly here to stay. I can't wait to see her in the Justice League Movie, which opens later this year.Allan Heinberg's Screenplay is super initially, but settles for regular stuff in its second-hour. Patty Jenkins's Direction is well-done. Graphics, expectedly, are extraordinary. And special mentions for the nicely done Cinematography by Matthew Jensen & the wonderfully done art & costume design. The Editing needed to be crisper.On the whole, 'Wonder Woman' is a Gal Gadot show all the way. Watch it for her & you'll be rewarded!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Movie - Will Try to Avoid Spoilers by Sticking to Comic Book Knowledge,"I'm reading some reviews and I see people complaining from her accent to the fact that she's too good looking to be an Amazon and what's an Amazon? Wow, people! Wonder woman is not only an Amazon, she is a Goddess created by other gods. So, being a superhero/goddess, she has to look like a top model. Not enough muscle? The actress went to the army and has more muscle than most underweight actresses out there on the big screen. Don't like her non-American accent? She's not American. Complaining about her wearing American symbols and colour? Beyond the movie's explanation for that, it's her comic book costume since her creation. They just made it more on-screen friendly.Still complaining? Have issues with the fact that she's a woman and this movie is like every other superhero movie? Sure it is, but it's like every other GOOD superhero movie out there. Don't like superhero movies? Don't go watch this one. Now, when was the last superhero movie with a woman? You're probably thinking Cat Woman, (no one remembers Electra), whose super villain was a beauty product queen with an evil product. I mean, common? Girls can't fight blood thirsty warlords or ladies that want to conquer and dominate the world? At least Wonder Woman's nemesis is the God of War, a worthy opponent.Perfect? No movie is perfect. You can always develop more this or that, but it would make the movie longer. You can argue you should've cast this or that character differently. These are normal struggles for any production. You can't please everyone at the end of the day. And making the movie longer with cause other issues such as keeping the audience with the movie. But I can't give any less that 10 here. After Batman vs Superman's disaster, this is amazing. This has raised the bar for DC movies. Hope they can keep it up and this must be encouraged, both for quality and women leads.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Super Hero movie ever,"I happened to watch it only after a month of its release in an old rural cinema house where the ticket prices are too low. I keep doing this deliberately for all Hollywood movies to save money. Wonder Woman is probably the best ever super hero movie the audience has received. Because the WW doesn't carry the usual irony, indirect references to how great or powerful the superhero is. I happened to see a new and never seen before atmosphere in this movie. The character of Chris pine was well written I have only seen him in star trek movies as I don't get to watch all the regular movies. Gal Gadot lived this character, her character WW had a unique mildness which was something new to see on the screen.Every guy walked out with a crush on her and guess what there was even a fan page in FB in which Chennai city guys claimed to sell of their everything for her, and also saw in that page that there was a massive hoarding of WW in a theater from where WW was worshiped as a goddess (This hoarding thing was first ever in the last couple of decades for any HW Actor).For me this movie had filled the void of a female super hero who the young girls and women could draw some inspiration to stand out in a world filled with biased people.Though we knew WW from the free DC comics given from Maggi Noodles during the early 2000's, the movie stood out to be Extraordinarily good or great.Few kids were also leaving with teary eyes from which I am able to be relate the impact & connect WW had already created with them.Hats off to Patty for such a wonderful movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wonder Woman - Not That Wonderful,"Wonder Woman left me wondering where does the DC universe stand? Now don't get me wrong this was a good movie and enjoyable 3 hour session (including 30min of pre trailers). But the hype it got with 90% rotten tomatoes? 70+ on meta critic? Yeah no fake ratings.Firstly this was a major step-up from previous DC installments. This was a roller-coaster ride, lots of ups and downs and a lot of beautiful action sequences. The 2 leads Gal Gadot and Chris Pine were enjoyable to watch and the chemistry between the duo bonded well on the big screen. The comedy and romantic tension between the two was well executed and put a nice tone to the darkness of the film. Final few acts were right in the feels and almost heart stopping.Not all was well. DC has been trying to play catch up with Marvel in the cinematic universe, ultimately not executing their product effectively. DC just blasted ensemble films to the audience with out building to it. Where as Marvel has been building up a backstory of a continuous villain (hydra) while at same time making a sole story for specific films. This is what DC should have done and brought this film out first, then other solo films, create a continuous back story to keep audiences engaged. This is where Wonder Woman failed. There was no real story, it was just Wonder Woman doing her thing. It was more of a spin off to a trilogy that has ended. Pacing was off too. Action scenes, though great, but came out of nowhere and stopped out of nowhere. The villain was horrible. DC is known for iconic villains and they failed here which was disappointing. In fact I'm still wondering who the villain actually is?Acting: 7/10 (Gal Gadot suits the action actress role, plays out her stunts with finesse, the innocence of Wonder Woman was well played too. Chris Pine was funny to watch with his great comic relief and charisma, but that it was it nothing too great by anyone else).Action: 7/10 (There were some great visuals amazing sequences where you would go on YouTube and search the particular scenes but some scenes had too many, overly done slo-mo. CGI in some scenes just went from Oscar worthy to a B-Grade student film).Sound: 7/10 (Wonder Woman theme played well with the action, the explosions, bullets and whips sounded decent in the Dolby Atmos theatre).Story: 4/10 (Pacing was off, lot of up and down, fast paced to really slow and dull. I'm confused to where the DC universe wants to go? They haven't developed any solid back story that will carry on and tie in to a big finale. From a solo film perspective it was great to see how Wonder Woman became a warrior but the poor use and execution of a villain was major let down. DC is known for villains they should have not gone wrong on this department. Another let down were the side characters, no development, rushed them right into the plot).Feels: 8/10 (Excellent heart throb moments towards the final act. Really felt the emotion of how it played out. Possible onion eyes for emotional romantic losers).Final Rating: 6.6/10 (Compared to BvS: 5.5/10, SuicideSquad: 5/10)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Warner Bros and DC's best film since The Dark Knight Rises.,"Finally, a film that has the charms, likable characters, coherent story line... and provides good entertainment.Gal Gadot is a great choice for Diana Prince and the rest of the cast were good choices also. It's not going to win any acting awards but adequate for this sort of film.The strength of the film lies in the main characters and how their journey and story together were told, in my opinion WB/DC have failed at this with Man of Steel, Batman vs Superman and definitely Suicide Squad, but Wonder Woman is a tier or two better in presenting this to the audience.Worthy to compare to Marvel Studio's better efforts for sure.If you like superhero films... go watch it, I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Rating: A-,"DC isn't going through a good time: Marvel keeps having huge success with most of both movies and TV shows from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) while the DCEU keeps giving the fans great disappointments since Man of Steel (including the latter) ... Well, Wonder Woman proves the hype was deserved and it's by far the best DC movie since 2012's The Dark Knight Rises!Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot. Remember these names because it's due to them that we finally have a phenomenal superhero movie with a strong female lead character.¬†Gal Gadot is one of the best casting choices ever, she's one of those few people that make me feel like I can't watch any other actress portray the role of¬†Wonder Woman. She elevated the movie in a way that I never thought an actor/actress could do, so it's easy to say that she's definitely the best achievement of the film.Chris Pine also gives a great performance and the amazing chemistry between him and Gadot makes me care a lot for the characters that are extremely well-developed in an excellent slow-paced first half of the movie, which is an unusual feature having in mind previous comic-to-movie adaptations. It proved very efficient because all that time spent with the main characters, learning about them and what they believe in, it all makes me really care about them so, when the battle arrives and they're in danger, it all feels way more emotional. THIS is what DC kept failing at: giving us characters under-developed, with no motivations whatsoever, put them in the middle of a fight and expect the fans to appreciate the excessive CGI and explosions.Patty Jenkins is a great director and this movie proves it: amazing COLORFUL visuals, the stories feel heartfelt and honest, the comedy is surprisingly great and the dialogue scenes, especially between¬†Diana and¬†Steve, are compelling and super captivating. The soundtrack is epic during the action scenes which are itself the definition of epicness. The first time that Wonder Woman goes into the battlefield (the one shown on the trailer) gave me chills all over my body, it's just E-P-I-C! Even if CGI is present in almost every single one of the action sequences, it's mostly well-used and it reached the awesomeness levels that I expected.The plot is simple, but efficient (even if implausible) and it still has a small not-that-obvious twist in the third act that's actually kind of cool.As for flaws, there's one that is common to every single comic-book movie ever: the villain. Once again, this character is weak (it's actually more than just one character), with no motivations besides ""destruction, yeah, war, yeah, let's kill everyone, yeah"" and all of the clich√©s are put together into one big disappointment.The final battle is CGI-heavy and there were some brief moments where it almost looked like a video game, but due to the fact that I cared so much about the characters, this becomes just a minor issue that I didn't even get bothered with during the action. The slow- motion looked cool, but it got overused by the end of the movie. Finally, I think that the movie is a tiny bit too long, but I guess every superhero movie nowadays needs to have at least a 2-hour runtime or it's not worth it for the studios, apparently.So, Wonder Woman is, in fact, the savior that the DCEU needed and it not only proved the hype and huge anticipation something worth going through this last few months, but it surpassed everything I expected this movie to be. Thank you Patty Jenkins for the brilliant direction (visuals, character-development, action scenes, soundtrack, just everything), thank you Gal Gadot for your incredibly honest performance and thank you Chris Pine for being a perfect companion for the emotional journey you all took me through, even if with some flaws here and there (please, improve your villains DC and Marvel).MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A tender story about coming of age--wonderful woman,"Looking over the reviews, I have come to believe that if you were looking for an 'action movie', this isn't for you.Wonder Woman is a tender, comedic coming of age film about a powerful young woman from a loving background who embraces all the things in life that young woman of education and sensitivity enjoy. And, with a driving passion to make the world a better place.The director, a woman, portrays men in the film with extreme sensitivity and respect for true masculinity. The character played by Chris Pine is a true hero. More over, he is a gentleman in the truest sense.The look of the film is fantastic, e.g. the scene in no-man's land was a tribute to the great Stanley Kubrick (All Quiet on the Western Front). The use of color was extraordinary. For its novelty, I am willing to entertain the strange revisionist history in the film, but I am sorry that the average movie goer has no knowledge of the true events.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Whats up with the special effects???,"OK so i was shocked at how inconsistent the special effects were in the movie. One great example is when, at the beginning of the movie, the young wonder woman (as a kid) jumps a few stories down and you could actually feel that there is a green screen behind, it was like we were back in the 90s. Apart from that the story isn't that great, i mean nothing special will surprise you really in the movie and a lot of parts reminded me of the Captain America first movie with all the fighting the German stuff and the hero having a diverse(nationality wise) special hit squad. Lastly, i would say that if you just want to watch a superhero action movie to pass the time, this will due. Otherwise, stick to the marvel universe",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
DCMU wonder woman review,"It's very good but very different to the rest of the DCMU. All main character have a good solid story arc of their own which is satisfying and helps tie this up in a single film. It hits a different pace to anything in the superhero market at the moment, I can see some people having an issue with that - but it works. Sound is good (if not a little standard) graphics are good with only minor rag doll issues. Some cheesy lines but it's a superhero movie and that's OK! Gal Gadot is a good Wonder Woman, she isn't the all American hero people are expecting, she is the fierce female Amazon that you love from the comics. You can feel Zach Snyders influence in the choreography and fighting style, there are some strong sucker punch vibes flowing though it.

Gadot is magnificent in the best DCEU entry.,"Warner Bros have been playing catch up with their DC Extended Universe (DCEU) for years, fruitlessly trying to match Marvel Studio's critically and commercially successful Avengers-led franchise. Wonder Woman, although not perfect, edges the DCEU closer to its goal, thanks to a refreshingly optimistic hero and a plot that is neither convoluted nor cut to pieces in the editing room. Told via a flashback framing device, this WWI-set blockbuster follows the eponymous Amazonian princess Diana as she discovers mankind during one of its ugliest eras, yet continues fighting in an attempt to bring peace and harmony. It's a simple tale, but one director Patty Jenkins manages to keep on the right side of earnest with a steady flow of action and fish-out-of-water comedy. Very much shot in the style of Zack Snyder‚Äîchockfull of speed ramping and flying sparks‚Äîthe action sequences are wonderfully choreographed, but the CGI lacks photorealism at times, particularly during the opening act staged on Diana's idyllic home island. An extended set piece in which our titular goddess emerges from the trenches on the Western Front to overrun the Nazis is captivating; the dazzling cinematography and rousing score fusing together to create one the DCEU's finest moments. It helps that Jenkins has the likes of Gal Gadot in front of the camera portraying the peace-seeking warrior. Gadot is a terrific blend of strength, passion and beauty, imbuing Diana with an unstoppable righteousness that in lesser hands could have been preachy and pretentious. Relatively free from the confines of the DCEU's overlapping storytelling, Wonder Woman is an exciting superhero adventure anchored by a magnificent central performance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Chemistry between the leads was good, and not to forget it was an origin story so setting up a character takes up a large portion of time. Yet, it never falls into the joyless narrative mess of Batman vs Superman, and certainly has more gravitas than most of the cookie cutter Marvel films.The thing that really sold it was looking next to me and seeing young family members, all girls smiling with joy.

Been waiting 40 years for this,"I grew up watching the old Wonder Woman TV show and as a little kid I loved it but even then knew they couldn't show her doing all she's capable of and looked forward to the day when they would put her on the big screen. It only took 40 years of waiting for me but I'm glad the day is here finally. I loved every minute of it, I get sick of origin stories when we've seen them over and over but since this was the first Wonder Woman to hit the big screen it was perfect. I don't know why some people say it was too long and boring, it was a perfect telling of the story and had the right amount of action in it. If I had any complaint it would only be that Chris Pine's acting in this was just like how he is as Captain Kirk. So basically some of the scenes I could only see him as Kirk the way he was delivering his lines but that's a small worry.I will definitely be watching this one over and over once I get it on DVD.

Girl power all the way,"Wonder Woman is pure summer escapist entertainment.

The actress apparently did her own stunts, including while she was five months pregnant. So she's a superwoman in real life and in reel life, also having served with the Israeli Army.The cast includes Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, and Danny Huston. How fabulous to see the ""House of Cards"" leading lady, Wright, as an Amazon warrior.In this version, Diana fights in World War I, not II, which director Patty Jenkins found more interesting.Filmed partially in Italy, the settings are glorious.Superheroes, all-powerful men and women who fight evil in the world, started to become popular during World War II, I wonder why, feeding into the fantasy of someone swooping down and solving our problems.

First genuinely solid film in the DCEU !!!,"Let me state the things that I liked first:1. Although the film uses tropes and conventions that come with the territory of superhero films, it still manages to make them feel fresh, funny and enjoyable especially because much of the film involves Diana becoming accustomed and familiar with the world of human beings which is highly different to her world which belongs to Amazonian Gods. The fish out of water element of the narrative helps in downplaying the standards tropes and freshening them up.2. The film has a very refreshing humanistic soul. Just like the protagonist, the film exudes an innocent sense of optimism and belief that is genuinely moving.3. One has to admire what it stands for and what it will do in terms of inspiring countless young girls(and boys) and stand as an example to show that a female led big budget superhero film won't always be an 'Elektra' or a 'Catwoman'.4. The DC cinematic universe, as is clear by now, will continue to deal with stuff like gods, myths, legends, etc. But thankfully unlike 'Batman v Superman' where there was a constant attempt to make a silly, convoluted fight between two gorillas wearing circus costumes seem Biblical, profound and 'important' with Lex Luthor constantly spouting pretentious, pseudo-intellectual gibberish revolving around theology, 'Wonder Woman' at least decides to have fun with this stuff by subverting these elements for the most part.5. Director Patty Jenkins clearly has an eye for visuals that have a flair to them. There are so many shots and sequences in the film that are rich with energy and personality. She makes use of Gal Gadot's physicality to give us a superhero who genuinely looks distinctive and enigmatic. The No Man's Land sequence is a great example of bravura filmmaking.6. Gal Gadot isn't giving the deepest, most complicated performance ever, but Jenkins plays to Gadot's strengths and managed to make her look as good as possible and the very aspect of the Amazonians being somewhat literal organisms ends up making Gal Gadot's stiffness in many scenes along with her somewhat one dimensional line delivery seem understandable and maybe even warranted. Chris Pine is really good and his chemistry with Gal Gadot is one of the strongest things in the film.Now let's talk about the things that I didn't like:1. The CGI isn't very good or convincing in many scenes. There are extended sequences where the green screens become easily discernible from a visual standpoint.2. Patty Jenkins unfortunately resorts to the Zack Snyder school of slow motion abuse constantly during the action scenes. I have always felt that overusing slow motion during combat sequences only lessens the impact and appeal of these scenes.3. The reveal when it comes to the real villain can be seen coming from a distance. It just lacks the impact and surprise that it aspires to achieve.4. The majority of the final act disappointingly reverts back to a live-action video game spectacle just like 'Man of Steel' did in its final act. This prolonged badly choreographed CGI fest which the film ends with somewhat betrays all the good work that preceded it.'Wonder Woman' is flawed, but it's still a good, inspirational and enjoyable film with a good heart. I like the fact that it did unexpectedly well at the box-office because of everything that it stands for. It's not the greatest film you'll ever see, but compared to the previous outings in the DCEU like the disappointing 'Man of Steel', the pretentious and bloated 'Batman v Superman' and the laughable mess 'Suicide Squad', 'Wonder Woman' feels like a much needed breath of fresh air.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Also, it's a funny movie with Chris Pine acting at his best. And no doubt, Gal Gadot seems to be the perfect choice for Wonder Woman. Still...This movie suffers from the same reason as the other two movies, which is action and villains...It's too much CGI and a lot of times it is too obvious, it just ruins many of the action sequences. This goes for the final battle as well. It's just worse, the main villain does not represent a danger in any way. It just floats in the air and that's all...wtf... It really is too bad because this could have been a very good movie...Instead it's a movie with great characters, fun,a great soundtrack, but broken by the action sequences and villains which are just so bad...It's really a shame",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A decent film, don't listen to the marvel fanboys or critics!","This film is a solid 8 out of 10!!!!Is the script a masterpiece......no, but are you honestly saying guardians of the galaxy was.....seriously.Please just watch this film, it is a million miles away from the Batman V's Superman tragedy, IMDb seems to be saturated with trolls, make your own mind up with this one, its is a decent film.Yes, there are a couple of flaws, I am not professing this to be a perfect film, but does it deliver.Corny and cheesy at times but aren't all superhero movies, based on the format they are based on.Lets give DC a fair chance here, if this was a Marvel Film there would be fewer trolls.The lead female protagonist is well casted, spud from trainspotting is amusing, the storyline although somewhat predictable (as in all superhero movies currently) but is good and is trying to set the scene for further movies by developing a backstory for the lead character.Personally I felt the captain America's WW1/2 story line and supporting characters were weaker than this film and played a cringe worthy patriotic salute to the American flag without portraying multinational view of the entire war.Give DC a break here, this is Wonder Woman for crying out loud who is technically a God created to destroy Ares, let's give some allowances for the writing, in a world saturated with superhero movies.......!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

DC is on the right way but still has to improve a lot,"""Wonder Woman"" is the latest installment in the DC Extended Universe and the first one to receive excellent critical responses. The movie is considered an empowerment for women and equality. Having finally seen the movie, my feelings towards it are unfortunately mixed.There are many aspects I really liked about the movie. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are perfectly cast in their roles. Diana Prince is a naive but fierce heroine and very likable. She definitely is the best part of the movie for me. Her character is well fleshed out and she has great chemistry with Chris Pine's character. Furthermore there are some spectacular action sequences in the movie. The stunt work is just stunning and the often present slow motion additionally helps to appreciate the action scenes. Despite the brilliant action throughout the movie, the film really thrives on its quite moments that focus on the character development, which is very present in this superhero flick.Sadly there are a few aspects about the movie that I did not like. The humor was not funny at all in my opinion and the movie could have easily gone without it. Further there were a few scenes that appeared forced to me like the conversation at the gala between Wonder Woman and General Ludendorff. These minor points of criticism did not ruin the movie for me though.However, the third part of the movie did. I do not want to go into spoilers here but one character was in my opinion extremely miscast and appeared quite hilarious to me. Additionally, the last part of the movie is quite CGI heavy which also added to taking away the tension, since the CGI was not exceptionally well done and could have been handled better. Also the big reveal at the end was kind of disappointing and felt forced in my opinion, since there has not been a single hint towards it and I had the impression that it was included simply because they felt that they could not go for a straight forward plot. For all the reasons, I was not able to enjoy the last part of the movie and unfortunately it took away a lot from the experience.To sum up, Wonder Woman is definitely the best DC Extended Universe movie that has been released yet but I simply cannot relate to the excellent reviews it receives. Most part of the movie I really enjoyed but the third part just ruined so much for me that it makes it impossible for me to say I am a fan of the film. Nonetheless, I think DC is on the right path with investing more into character driven movies instead of cramping every possible into a single film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"What DC really needed, without complexes","After the failure on criticism by Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman, DC brings us a movie of pure origins, using the same formula that led Marvel to the top. An easy to follow plot but not too simple, well stuck touches of humor and a ""recyclable"" villain, as well as the impressive special effects make for the viewer this movie all along enjoyable.Under the great direction of Patty Jenkins and, despite many wouldn't like to hear this, Zach Snyder does a wonderful job as a scriptwriter, DC brings a story centered in a flashback, where we can see the princess Diana and her development process to become Wonder Woman. The interesting thing about this story, despite focusing on the First World War and showing without hesitation the human evil, is that the values that they want to convey with this character are that there are still things to fight for. The same idea that was present in Henry Cavill Superman but with a much better result.In terms of performance, no one can deny that Gal Gadot is the perfect Wonder Woman, a flawless performance, where she shows throughout the film how her character is gradually maturing. The touches of humor fit her perfectly and makes her character trustworthy, a woman without fear that fights against any opposition and with very clear values, perfection.The soundtrack of the character that we were already introduced in Batman v Superman makes you sense very powerful action scenes and you feel every movement.In terms of special effects, CGI is much better introduced here than in Batman v Superman, but they overuse slow motion again, although, the close-ups are perfectly involved.In conclusion, it is possibly the best film of this DC new universe, but I do not think that they should be limited to this. It is a very good movie of origins but I hope that they continue working and that we see movies with a bigger plot in the future. For the time being, the to-do of the DCEU are the villains, better call Nolan for that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A big highlight in DC movie history!,"Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and even Man of Steel were all critically divisive movies in the growing DC extended universe. After each one came out, fans were hoping the next one would be the movie that would be embraced by all movie going fans alike. Now, that next one is Wonder Woman. Is Wonder Woman going to be the first DCEU film to be overwhelmingly praised? Yeah, I think it will!Wonder Woman stars Fast and the Furious actress Gal Gadot as Diana, the princess of Themiscara, which is a mysterious island of amazons hidden from the outside world. The action starts when Chris Pine's Steve Trevor meets Diana when he crashes his plane near Themiscara and recruits her to help him with the escalating World War.I went into this movie with a lot of reluctance because I love these DC characters and Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and even in some ways Man of Steel disappointed in different ways. I wanted this movie to be the first great DCEU movie and I'm really happy to say that it is!Patty Jenkins directs with grace and wonder. You can tell how much she loves the character of Wonder Woman. Patty Jenkins had said that one of her favorite films growing up was Superman: the Movie from 1978 and you can really tell because there are a few homages to that movie. Wonder Woman is a strong character and this film makes movies like Catwoman and Elektra look like a complete joke. If you mix together the fish-out-of-water element of Thor and place it into the World War setting of Captain America: The First Avenger, then you get a good idea of what this movie is.Much like Chris Hemsworth in the first Thor and Dave Bautista in Guardians of the Galaxy, Gal Gadot is limited in the amount of dramatic acting she has to do and is instead given the chance to show her surprisingly decent comedic chops to hide her unseasoned acting ability. The beauty comes from when Gadot really needs to get serious in some key scenes, she brings it and she's pretty commendable. Add on her great physicality and look and Gadot is actually pretty damn good in the role!Her Chemistry with Chris Pine is one of the highlights of the movie and may be one of the reasons Gadot is as good as she is. There are several scenes where his performance is just laugh out loud funny. In particular, a scene with both Pine and Gadot on a boat had me howling for more.At the end of the day, while I wouldn't say that Wonder Woman is one of the best comic book movies ever made by any stretch of the imagination. I would, however, say that it is a very good installment and that it is the best DC movie since 2008's The Dark Knight!4/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
IMDB needs to be shutdown...but this movie is GREAT!,"So, I first go to Wikipedia and check out it's article on Wonder Woman and see the facts. First, this movie grossed over $800 world wide, against a budget about a buck and half mil. NOT bad! I go to the 'critical response' section and find that the first statement is that this movie received 'mostly positive' reviews from the critics, most claiming it's the best of the Marvel comics movies so far. Hmmm, not bad! I check out other websites like this one, and they gave it mostly a high % with positive reviews. They don't mention this one by the way...and now I'm figuring out why. I see the audience 'exit poll' results and the movie got mostly A and A+s from people leaving the theatre. Hmmm... Then I look at the awards and find it got the best Action Movie awards from the People's Choice Awards and Gal Gadot got best female lead award from the Actors Guild awards, among others. 
So l come over to this website and start with the reviews, and all I see is bunch of whining about how folks can't believe this movie was rated so high on here and why they think this website is rigged, etc. etc. etc. 
Then I figured it out; This website either exists in an alternate reality, or it has a bunch of angry, bitter, depressed people reviewing on it that can't stand the idea that people actually ENJOY sitting down with a bag of chips and dip with your family after a hard week at work, kicking your shoes off, building a fire in the fireplace, and watching a great action movie to enjoy themselves. Because...uh, that's what NORMAL people do! It's a pretty simple word we're working with here, it's called entertainment! I don't sit down with a pen and paper and start crucifying a movie because it's not Lord of the Rings or Citizen Kane. 
Is this the BEST movie I've ever seen?...no
Do you have to suspend belief?...uh, don't you have to do that with every stinkin movie of this genre?..yes
It's a great action movie with great Special Effects and there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with the acting! Chris Pine and Gal Gadot do just fine. The story is just fine. Everything about this movie is just fine.
I keep thinking that I'm done coming to this website, but I felt I had to stand up for this movie against some of the garbage I've read folks spew about it. I'm beginning to think that this website exists in an alternate reality or something, or maybe it's just got a core of reviewers that review movies that are...well, different or something. I don't know...
But do yourself a favor and ignore the negative reviews on here and enjoy this movie that the rest of the normal world thought was pretty good...including me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Entertainment,"This is one of the best movies of the year so far. The plot is interesting and the casting was great. Chris Pine was perfectly cast and Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright were both very good as the main Amazons. Danny Huston and Elena Anaya were terrific bad guys and David Thewlis is always great. And a special shout out to Lucy Davis who is marvelous providing some comic relief. But of course this is ultimately Gal Gadot's film and she was an impressive Wonder Woman. She's very tall and gorgeous of course so you knew that physically she would fit the bill well, but she really delivered in all of the scenes including the lighter moments. There is a lot of action including some really good scenes with the Amazons in the beginning of the film. The special effects were good, but not great (I did see the 3D version). I really loved the island of the Amazons set and would love to find a place like that to retire to. Even the vintage clothing in the film looked good. The movie moved quickly (especially the first hour and a half). All in all a very enjoyable time at the movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nice superhero-movie but overly American and Hollywoodified and not much of a feminist icon,"I must admit that I'm very disappointed. The movie had been praised for being such a strong movie regarding feminism and finally giving us a non-sexualized, strong, bad ass female lead. This is not entirely the case in my opinion.Wonder Woman is strong and bad ass, that is true. I also love how all the Amazons are strong as hell and incredible good at fighting! But Wonder Woman is still sexualized to the skies! If you look at her outfit: HEELED shoes (they can't be very practical) and a tiny skirt (they could easily have made it just a few inches longer without it having any effect on her freedom of movement). I know that they were probably trying to be true to the comics, but I think they could have pulled that outfit together in other ways and still achieve that. And why would the Amazons, who have been isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of years, shave? How did they even come up with that idea? It serves no real purpose. (Just to be clear - I shave and like being shaved, but I'm 100% sure that's because I've been socialized to like it, and I think it's unrealistic that the Amazons would shave).Another thing I dislike about the movie is the whole WW1-plot. It's one of the most American movies I have ever seen (not meant in a good way), depicting the Germans as literal monsters and insane people, whereas the Brits and Americans are all heroes (very one-dimensional). It's an old, tired, American plot seen way too many times before. Very Hollywood.Besides all that it has a looot of loopholes.If you put all these things aside, then it's a nice superhero-movie - it's funny, filled with action and Chris Pine is exceptional.If the movie hadn't been so hyped and praised I'm sure I wouldn't have been as disappointed.So, if you like (very American and Hollywoodified) superhero-movies give it a try. Just don't expect too much.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

An undeniably great DCEU movie,"Comic book movies have long been underway for a few decades now. It was only until the 1990s were more properties beginning to show up. This was the trial stage for characters that were very much obscure to most. Then during the early 2000s, more properties were getting adaptations and with greater receptions. Though there were still flubs along the way, the code was for the most part cracked on making successful superhero films. After the 2010s, Marvel Studios had found a method of perfecting their films that many would envy for today. Of those Warner Brothers was struggling for a while to get their famous heroes going. Superman Returns (2006), Jonah Hex (2010) and Green Lantern (2011) all pretty much fell flat in getting an expanded universe going. It was only Christopher Nolan's Batman series that really got any attention. At last Warner Bros. made Man of Steel (2013), Suicide Squad (2016) and Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), but all were mixed. Here though we have something much better.As popular as Wonder Woman is, the character had not had a live action venture into cinemas once. Before this she had only been portrayed in fan-made shorts, animated home video films and her own TV show in 1975. That's it though. Plus seeing how things turned out with Warner Brothers few entries in their shared universe, it was a bit worrisome thinking how this might turn out. The good news is, this feature is much better than anything so far. Written mainly by Allan Heinberg, the screenplay was well crafted for this adaptation. Surprisingly Heinberg had only worked on TV productions before this. Gal Gadot plays Diana, an Amazonian who is protected by her fellow sisters and mother from Ares, the god war. The thing is Diana does not know how powerful she truly is. When a pilot by the name of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes nearby, Diana learns of World War I that's going on around her. Believing she can make a difference and that Ares is the cause of the problem, she goes where no man would ever want to.Directed by Patty Jenkins, the director of Monster (2003), the vision she had for the film is competently fulfilled. The top actors all do a great job under her wing. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman gives a charming performance, with strength and tenderness all in one. Not only can she play a likable heroine but also can really pull off some tough sequences. Her development is also handled very well. There are so many points in which she learns about mankind. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor plays an admirable soldier. He too learns off of Diana for her lack of understanding. The rest of the supporting cast act enthusiastically too. Connie Nielsen as Diana's mother can stand her ground quite well. Danny Huston as Ludendorff, the main backer behind the Great War is intimidating in his portrayal along with his mad scientist Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya). There's also appearances from Robin Wright, David Thewlis, Sa√Ød Taghmaoui, and Ewen Bremner. All of which follow Diana in her journey to stop Ares.The only thing that might pose a problem to viewers may the portrayal of some characters. One character in particular is played by someone who doesn't exactly fit the role. Although in the end, they are not seen that much, it still may be a bit off putting. The action scenes shot in this film are well staged too. Unlike the past DCEU films, this one uses a mixture of CGI and what feels like practical effects. As the film reaches its third act, it is already assumed CGI would be the biggest driver in visuals, but at least here it doesn't look like video game cut scenes. That was all too abundant in movies like Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Plus the progression of the action scenes change over time too. This gives the viewers a nice dose of all kinds of firepower. Whether that be sword fights, superhero powers or trench warfare, it keeps the experience new and interesting. The best scene was probably in ""No Man's Land"", where Diana takes over the battleground. Can't do that in Call of Duty.The camera-work was another pleasing element. Managed by Matthew Jensen, the cinematography was put together very professionally. No shaky cameras were used in the making of this production and the lens is as wide as it gets for the ultimate landscape view. The color pallet is also a great addition to the settings. Where Diana grew up as compared to the land where the war was being fought had drastic differences. This was used to emphasize the contrasts in man's corruption. Jensen had also done work for movies like Chronicle (2012) and Fantastic Four (2015). For music, the film score was composed by Rupert Gregson-Williams, the brother Harry Gregson-Williams, another composer. For his work, Rupert did an adequate job. Unfortunately as important as reviving an original theme is, Rupert brings back Hans Zimmer ugly electric cello theme for Diana. It just doesn't fit. Nevertheless the music (including that theme) work in making a unique sound for Wonder Woman. It's an effective score with a number of good moments.Finally, the DCEU has a film that can be called a great movie. The best part is, is that it's of a character who hasn't gotten their own movie yet. Aside from the portrayal of a couple characters, the rest of the film in its entirety works great. The music, camera-work, action, actors and writing are all top notch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

'I will fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.',"Director Patty Jenkins knows how to make us appreciate that once tired clich√© of Wonder Woman and in her new feminist viewpoint this Wonder Woman is indeed a wonder. The screenplay of the DC Comics perennial favorite comic book heroine was written sensitively by Allan Heinberg based on the story by Zach Snyder, Allen Heinberg and Jason Fuchs who remodeled Dr. William Moulton Marston's original creation from 1941!One of the reasons this version works so well is sharing the origins of Wonder Woman so well: her beginnings as a child ('sculpted from clay by Zeus) being raised by Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and Antiope (Robin Wright), and finally flying off to defeat the god of war Ares (whatever happened to Mars?). Gorgeous scenery and terrific special effects offer a springboard to the story that follows.When a pilot crashes and tells of conflict in the outside world, Diana (Gal Gadot), an Amazonian warrior in training, leaves home to fight a war, discovering her full powers and true destiny. Before she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained to be an unconquerable warrior. Raised on a sheltered island paradise, when an American pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes on their shores and tells of a massive conflict raging in the outside world, Diana leaves her home, convinced she can stop the threat. Fighting alongside man in a war to end all wars, Diana will discover her full powers¬Öand her true destiny. In the setting of WW I in Germany the bad guys are Ludendorff (Danny Huston), Sir Patrick (David Thewlis), and Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya), and Diana's allies are Steve (Chris Pine), Sameer (Said Taghmaoui), Charlie (Ewen Bremner). The supporting cast is excellent also.For once the CGI effects enhance rather than distract (until the final confrontation between Diana and Ares), the musical score (Rupert Greson-Williams) fits the film, and the photography (Michael Jensen) is rather splendid. There is enough pungent anti-war philosophy to make the film sail. This is bound to be followed by a series of more adventures: the public loves DC Comics ‚Äì and in this case the praise is worthy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wonder Woman was quite awesome as a female superhero movie!,"I first became familiar with Wonder Woman when watching the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series ""Superfriends"" on Saturday mornings on ABC. That network later aired a live action-version of her with Lynda Carter playing her during World War II. When CBS picked the series for a second season, the setting changed to present time. I've never read the Wonder Woman comics though I did read of her adventures in the All-Star Squadron comics during the '80s which depicted her Earth-2 (original Golden Age version) counterpart during WWII. All that I just mentioned were pretty enjoyable. As for this version, Gal Gadot certainly has both the beauty and body strength for the character. Chris Pine was also fine as her heroic partner-both in battle and love-Steve Trevor. Setting it during World War I was a nice change. The action was awesome and the occasional humor was also welcome. In summary, I highly recommend Wonder Woman.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Please don't spend money on this.,"While the action in this movie was admittedly fun, not much else in this movie impressed me. The writing was truly horrible, clich√© and very predictable. The acting was unimpressive. The plot was loose and poorly developed. The villains were a question mark. All characterisation seemed to be either absent or based on singular traits, therefore arousing no emotions or empathy. The romance seemed forced. The ending was similar to Batman v/s Superman. There was too much CGI in the latter half of the movie, and it was pretty obvious. Perhaps the only other redeeming factor is that the music score was pretty great.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Wonder Woman, a true Hero and almost a masterpiece of a movie","This is now my third time watching this superb movie and it's still as great as the first time, I didn't even know about the character before watching Batman vs Superman and now it's one of my favorite superheroes.Patty Jenkins as the director was a good choice, she made the character true to her comic counterpart and she gave her heart into the movie that paid out immensely. The cast is filled with great actors and the women is portraying powerful and great characters which is for some reason groundbreaking, I'm glad it has been done. Gal Gadot, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, Chris Pine and Danny Huston all makes great and believable performances.
The music, cinematography, choreography, production and art design and costumes are a few things that made this movie into a masterpiece. It truly feels like you are in their world, the immersion is real.

Finally a good DC movie in recent years,"I have to confess i'm not a fan of Superheros. Until i was 20 i thought there was only Batman and Superman. And i only watched the Batman movies so far. Never read a comic book except Mickey Mouse when i was 10. So when all those Superhero Movies came out i never knew what to except. i watched most of them but almost never at the movies but at home.

You got a good story, great actors, especially Gal Gadot is amazing. The perfect choice for this character.

Strong performances not quite enough to rescue muddled themes,"There is a lot of expectation going into this movie which I think has probably helped it critically. On the one hand, it is the latest instalment in the DCEU franchise, which I think even critics want to eventually give a good score to, if only to provide some balance against the all-conquering critical success of the Marvel universe movies. Then there's the fact that this is the big female-lead movie of the year and critics will go in wanting to like it for this fact alone. With these factors combined, an average movie will probably pass, in the short term at least, for a great one.And I think that this is what has happened in this case. ""Wonder Woman"" is far from being a bad movie. A lot of reviewers have focused on the fun feel to the movie as a positive. It's certainly the most cartoon-y superhero movie to come out of the DCEU so far which seems to be a response from Warner Brothers to criticism of the drained palette and humourlessness of ""Batman vs. Superman"". While it is fun, there are definitely negatives to this style, with considerably less grit in the overly bouncy action scenes. These cannot escape from Zack Snyder's creative influence and suffer as a result.The core strengths of the movie are the central characters, Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). The characters are written well, with Wonder Woman's do-gooder resolve offset by her naivety. Gal Gadot gives a great physical and emotional performance, her movements, postures and facial expressions capturing her strength and, well, goodness perfectly. Comparisons to Christopher Reeve as Superman are fitting, and she is every bit as dashing as Reeve was. Pine almost steals the show as the love interest. He has tremendous chemistry with Gadot and his character has enough depth to be interesting in his own right.I did find the setting of the story in WWI a big distraction and a flawed choice thematically. The character Wonder Woman was created in the 1940s and her origins placed in WWII, where she battles the evil Nazis alongside Allied forces. The writers' choice here to shift this back to WWI could have been justified. For such a staunchly anti-war character, in some ways WWI is a better fit. It serves as a symbol of a mechanised embodiment of war which simply consumed men and resources rather than serving any cause. Had the creators of the movie emphasised the meaninglessness of the conflict, with no clear distinction between good sides and bad sides, it would have been a great setting to test Wonder Woman's moral strength. It also fits with Wonder Woman's key motive during the film - she must destroy Ares, as it is his external agency that she believes has corrupted men and drawn them into the conflict.Sadly the writers want to have their cake and eat it, so alongside this core theme we get some gleefully evil German villains who would clearly be more at home in a WWII setting. Wonder Woman is always fighting the Germans and never seems to really question whether the Triple Entente are any better. This isn't a hard choice, since it's the Germans here, and not the British, who are out to create super death gas (never mind the fact that both sides used chemical weapons during the actual war). I genuinely don't think that the movie ever really makes up its mind about which of its conflicting ideas is right, a non-trivial problem at the heart of the film.The motivation for the change of setting appears, to me at least, to have been largely aesthetic and probably driven by a desire for something less familiar than WWII. Director Patty Jenkins showed a shocking ignorance of this problem when she said ""World War I is...not something that we really know the history of."" This ignorance of the issues raised by this creative decision only increases the validity of these criticisms.It's a real shame because, action scenes aside, so much of the hard work to make this movie great is in place. The look and mood of the film and the casting choices are all spot on and the story could really have worked with more sensitivity and courage from the writers. As it is, the film must be seen as a decent, but undeniably flawed effort.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wonder Woman: should have waited more!,"Wonder Woman? Felt more like a 'coming of age' teenage melodrama, with a DC Superhero tag draped over for decoration. Plenty of adolescent characters exist for that purpose in the DC Universe.But this is Wonder Woman we are talking about! The quintessential feminist icon from the comic realm. Feminine charm & grace going hand-in-hand with super strength and badassery.But apparently, DC has resigned itself to the fate that it is secondary to Marvel when it comes to the Cinematic Universe. Film after film dropping far below expectations, completely falsifying anticipations that have built up for decades. Continuously handing over the directorial job to people not fit for that purpose.This sheer non-seriousness on the part of the DC administration almost feels like villainous in intent; as if DC itself is the greatest villain of its universe, destroying superhero after superhero with half-baked ideas, unnecessarily long scripts, and predictable story lines.Hats off to Chris Pine, outshining everything else in the movie and for appearing more radiant than even Wonder Woman in certain scenes.Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman fits the look and personality, but with limited acting range (one could count the number of her facial expressions on fingertips!) and an unfit screenplay, she comes off as only a shadow of the 'Amazonian demigoddess'.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Plot holes covered by beautiful casting,"So to get right to the core Wonder Woman was not a great film. The plot holes were massive and the progress was way to slow. The directing was okay and the production was high budget quality (maybe a bit higher than what you would expect from the budget they had). The CGI was brilliant and the acting was spot on... So why would I only give it a 7 then?Well to put it in the words of Louie CK ""There is no such thing as an accent, it's just a whole country of people saying words wrong"". The movie starts off with some of the strangest takes on the English accent that you have ever heard, all because Gal Gadot cannot speak English with an American accent, so for that reason everyone needs to talk weird. Then there is the fact that day and night differs in areas one moment and the next they are perfectly aligned. The battles were against horrible fighters and it almost made iron man 3's battle against the falling rocks look more credible. Diana had no knowledge of who she is yet she possessed perfect knowledge of her abilities within seconds.All of this was not thought through well enough, but then you realize that this is not about a good story. It's about a beautiful woman who can also fight, and that is CLEARLY stated in the film. I think that the biggest challenge in the film was to get Gal Gadot and Chris Pine's hottest angles right every time. If you see the film you'll know what I mean. It all revolves around their beauty and granted it worked. Every guy walking out of the cinema now has a new Hollywood crush and every girl revived their Hollywood crush on Chris Pine.BUT I don't think that is what stories are about. Any two other actors that were a bit less ""hot"" would've seriously tanked this film. Good effort for a film and luckily not another attempt at making comedy superhero movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Outstanding,"The story, the Greco-Roman piece of their ancestral home, the WW1 fight scenes, the interaction between Pine and Gadot, all excellent.For the record, there exists an effort to downgrade any movies that have a strong woman. This is the American version of the Taliban, men with little whatevers who can't coexist with intelligent women. I can understand 5 or 6 if you didn't like aspects of the movie, but a 1 or a 2 says way more about the reviewer than the movie itself. Personally I loved, and I think Gal is amazing, both as Wonder Woman and as a person.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
