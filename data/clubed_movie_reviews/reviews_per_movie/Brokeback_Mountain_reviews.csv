"Six years later, it hits even harder.","I've always admired this film to a certain extent, but I think the thing that always kept me from loving it was that it never resonated with me emotionally. I would get attached while watching it, but all of those feelings would leave me fairly soon afterward. It had been about five years since I'd seen the film, and in that time I have grown up a lot, fallen in love, had my heart ripped to shreds and fallen back in love again and I think this growth personally has really opened me up to a place in my mind and heart to embrace this film more than most other screen romances that exist. Almost immediately it hit me harder than it had before and after a day since I watched it, the pain and heartache I experienced during it still remains at my core.It's a love film told non-traditionally, but not because it's two men, that doesn't even factor into the depiction of it. It's nontraditional because it's two people fighting against the love and it's accuracy in this is startling. How there are times where you can hate the person you love, hate so many things about them and hate that you are in love with them, but you can't give it up at all. You can't walk away from it because it's like an addiction and I think this film more than any before it captures that remarkably.A lot of this lies in the writing, but of course the performances from Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal certainly play a key factor in capturing it. Their characters take the love in different forms, Ennis fighting himself over it and Jack fighting the world because of it, but both actors capture exactly what they need to and bring this magnetism that really sparks. Gyllenhaal's openness is beautiful, his determination to make the love work and to just exist the way he wants to, he definitely provides the emotional anchor for the film and gives a heartbreaking portrayal.It's Ledger, of course, who steals the show though, with a kind of transcendent performance that we're treated to maybe once a decade. He becomes this character in such a vivid way that you don't even recognize the actor inside the role anymore. Gyllenhaal is Jack and hits the surface notes expertly, but you can still see Jake Gyllenhaal in there. Heath Ledger is completely gone and from the very beginning of the film we have Ennis and we have him until the very end. This character is an incredibly difficult one to take on, he could have easily been someone who was hard to like or sympathize with due to his internalizing and his refusal to fully embrace the relationship and who he is, but that's what makes it hit even harder, thanks to Ledger's brutal work.You see the pain in this person living a lie in every moment we have with him, with that turned in mouth and speech pattern that always sounds like it's hurting him to let anything out because he's afraid of how people are going to react. It's a performance unlike any other out there and in the end it's one that brings me to my knees. ""Jack, I swear,"" was always a line that floored me when I was watching it but now it's at a point where just thinking of the line and the way that Ledger delivers it brings some water to my eyes.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Finest Hour for Two Young Actors,"I have viewed Brokeback Mountain a total of three times on a 50 inch plasma. I spaced my views almost six months apart so I could grasp more completely and without prejudice, how I would rate this flick.It is beyond a doubt an American classic and looking back I regret so profoundly the death of Heath, who played Enis. The amount of acting skill and diversity it took to do such a touching and completely honest job, makes this young man, Heath Ledger, a legend.The scenes in the Brokeback were beautiful and allowed me to imagine somehow I was transformed back in time watch these young men.The truth is neither one of the characters was entirely gay, rather bisexual, but they did find each other as their own natural soul mates.Unfortunately cultural prejudice and homophobia prevented them from doing what Jack Twist had dreamed, ranching together on his father's spread.The final scenes are absolutely acted with such depth of character, the viewer is taken to tears. The Brokeback will not have Jack's ashes, since even in death, the culture denies him his final request, his ashes spread upon the Brokeback.Many of the bigots who have posted here on this fine cinema should be ashamed as they bray their ignorance for all to read.A fine film and probably one of the top love stories of all time in film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A daring and courageous story that speaks to the heart,"A really quite remarkable and moving love story between 2 cowboys that transcends any notions of what love between 2 people 'should' be. From their first raw encounter of physical intimacy, to the warmth and compassion that follows, we are taken on a journey of love and despair as these 2 men endeavour to keep alive an impossible relationship in the most difficult and unforgiving of times.Full of passion, daring, hope and despair, Heath & Jake give extremely brave and heartfelt performances in roles that not only would be a formidable challenge for any straight actor, but that will also shake and perhaps change forever the traditional stereo-type of the American cowboy. The courage required to bring this 'forbidden' love story to life on the screen is almost breathtaking, and is fully deserving of any awards that come its' way",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A jewel of a film.,"I love this movie. Really love it. Haunting score, stunning cinematography, gripping performances, timeless tale--everything. People quibble about non-essentials. I'm female, middle-aged, hetero, and I defy you to tell me that the average straight guy is any more expressive than Ennis or any less needy than Jack. Or the average gal, either, straight or gay. Deeper than their sex, their sexuality, their religious, educational, economic or historic backgrounds, Jack and Ennis are two human beings living in the world as they find it--beautiful and indifferent at best, and as they find themselves--beautiful and flawed at best. Desire is desire. The desire for warmth, for connection, for any echo at all in the vastness of time and space, is shared by every human being ever to have lived. For me, the issue is not how repressed or thwarted Ennis and Jack are, but how persistently they turn toward the light, despite all impediment. Brokeback Mountain lyrically retells a story thousands of years old: loss and grief are unavoidable; love is where you find it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie broke my heart.,"For all of those who are holding back from watching this movie because it is ""gay"" or has love scenes between two men...oh! This movie has nothing to do with sex...and to be honest, I don't feel that it has much to do with homosexuality. This is the most beautiful and profoundly sad love story I have ever come across, and the fact that it is a love between two men is beside the point. It's about a love between two people who cannot be together, but if human beings were better at being human, and if the world was a better place, they would have lived out their lives side by side. I was so, so moved. AMAZING!!!! A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not a publicity stunt,"There was a lot of talk about this film, a lot of publicity because of the gay interest in the script, and like always when there is too much talk, I don't pay for a seat because there are a lot of clever marketing scams around these days.It went away and then it was in my video store. I waited. Then it went on ""3 for a week for a fiver"" and I rented it. Ang Lee did a great job there, not only in shooting a difficult story, but also with exceptional photography (it looks like an ad for a cigarette brand, but I don't remember which) and brilliant acting and bringing us back to the US in the 1960s.The story itself, about a secret love affair, is dealt with cleverly, and with qualities in the script, in the performance, and without cheap and easy voyeurism, which in itself is admirable of Ang Lee. Heterosexual love is the subject of so many films that directors lack practise in treating homosexual love, and with the controversy around Brokeback Mountain managing to get through the minefield was not easy. I felt a bit that only one of the two cowboys was in love with the other - but this is an opinion only, but most importantly it seems to me that Brokeback Mountain deals also with the eternal topic of forbidden love, and in that way manages to send the gay aspect of this love to the background",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Heart Of The Matter,"I didn't believe for a moment that the film could live up to the hype, or to some of the comments posted here, some of them read like love letters to the film, to the director and the actors. Well, now, after seeing the film, I feel like writing a love letter myself. The film took over my senses and transported me. The tragedy that envelopes the lives of Ennis and Jack is caused by an ancestral ignorance that is part of our DNA and if you don't believe me read some of the hateful comments posted here alongside the love letters. That's the heart of the matter. After the summer in Brokeback Mountain, Ennis and Jack go their separate ways and Ennis hits a wall with his fists crying, trying to destroy his longing, self loathing, guilt, horror. Imagine in a world without ignorance and therefore without hatred, Ennis and Jack could have celebrated their love and attempt an honest life together. Imagine also if things were the other way and heterosexuals were the dark minority, imagine falling in love with a girl and having to keep it secret, never been able to tell or to show publicly your love for her. Men like Ennis, and there are many, have to curve their own emotions and conform, entering and developing unhappy marriages and why? Read some of the comments here and you'll understand why. There is one that condemns the movie and what the movie may do for his kid and his vision of cowboys without actually having seen the movie! That's the heart of the matter. I will go and see the film again tomorrow, if I can get tickets, I'm taking with me a group of people that hate the movie already without having seen it. I won a bet so they will have to. I'm taking them to diner later to talk. I intend to report the results if you let me. But for the time being let me tell you, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is an extraordinary film. Jake Gyllenhaal, Ann Hathaway and the magnificent Michelle Williams give superb performances but it's Heath Ledger's film. He gives us something that nobody could possibly have expected because what he gives us is not only, honest and moving and powerful but totally and utterly new.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A slow-burner that lingers long in the mind,"The first mainstream gay western (Warhol's 'Lonesome Cowboys' can only be described as niche or cult), 'Brokeback Mountain' was the surprise hit of 2005, another triumph for the talented director Ang Lee (who also gave us such diverse films as The Ice Storm, Sense and Sensibility, and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon).Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are the cowboys who start working together and find an intense sexual attraction which will continue to burn for twenty years. The film covers those two decades as we watch the idealistic Jack, who dreams of acceptance and a life with Ennis out on the ranch, and the tormented, disturbed Ennis (who remembers gay cowboys being murdered in his youth), who can't connect with anyone and anything other than his lonely soul.Extremely slow in pace, and all the better for it in an age of fast, rushed films for the MTV generation, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a love story just as valid as any other. For a mainstream movie to even address some of the issues looked at here is amazing, and the film benefits from sensitive direction, low-key romantic scenes, and total commitment from the leading actors. Gyllenhaal is better than he was in 'Donnie Darko', but he is overshadowed by Ledger, who shows here what a fantastic actor he was. It is a tragedy that his early death has robbed us from seeing this talent grow. Here in this film he resembles a young James Dean in 'Giant', playing older than his age with ease.Not an easy film to watch, then, but it repays close study and patience, and some of its lines and images will stay with you for a long time after the credits roll. Proof that intelligent cinema can still survive in the age of blockbuster action flicks.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An opportunity to reflect on our own lives...whichever side of the fence,"Controversial on a number of levels, yet tame by a number of standards, this is a film that will reach its audience in different ways, depending on their own personal journey - whether gay or straight. How we receive this movie - and how we relate - is indicative of where we're at in our own lives - and this is what makes this film brilliant. We follow the story of Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) who fall unexpectedly in love during a stint as a pair of sheep herders in Wyoming during the 1960's. What follows is the struggle to keep their desires hidden from a prejudiced society and the agony of remaining committed to their marriages while living double lives. There is a consistent undertone of melancholy throughout this film, from beginning to end, and some viewers will find this heavy. But this doesn't detract from the point conveyed by Ang Lee, its director. The impressive feature of this movie is the fact that every actor puts in a solid performance - in particular some of the ""peripheral"" actors - and this is quite rare in films where quite a number of the performers have very small roles. (Look at Anna Faris 'Lashawn Malone'; Kate Mara 'Alma Del Mar, Jr.', age 19; and Roberta Maxwell 'Jack's mother' for outstanding examples.) In terms of the main actors, Michelle Williams is outstanding, and Anne Hathaway almost steals the show! The only thing that seems to leave the film falling flat is the fact that there doesn't seem to be a positive resolution. Some will take this as an indication that gay men will end up facing tragedy and be confined to a life of loneliness. And we all might need to watch this with English subtitles, because for a majority of the film, we cannot understand what Heath Ledger's mumbled dialogue! This is incredibly disappointing - particularly considering that he delivers the very final line in the film and I am still unable to figure out what it is! (I'll have to get the DVD and throw on the subtitles!!) However, this film certainly does provoke an emotional response. And whether that response is one of anger, disgust, sadness, happiness, elation, denial, self-loathing, confusion, relief, empathy or curiosity, you are alive during those two hours. Highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love between two men? What the heck! They're two human beings,"Although some time has elapsed between my seeing this movie and today, I've decided to add a little comment just to show the producers, director,actors and writer, how marvelous it is to acknowledge that a certain change is taking place in this old world of ours.I'm a 69 year old grandpa who has always taken a stand against any sort of discrimination. In this case and naturally not by accident, it's about homosexuality.People love nature but they seldom respect human nature. Love is for everyone and not only for those that are socially considered ""politically correct"". Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal have shown the world that stereotypes have nothing to do with honesty, affection,tenderness and true sorrow. Beautiful, unforgettable performances which have enriched all the viewers' craving to be loved, accepted and regarded as first class citizens. Congratulations.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hire it or buy it. You won't be disappointed.,"I never write reviews. Only read others. This time I feel it's time I stopped being lazy and actually gave my opinion.Brokeback is a hell of a movie. Watched it with my teenage kids hoping I wouldn't feel the need to reach for a cushion. (Head honcho male and male underling in the wings, fairly conservative ..open minded females showing no interest to view the film, in the same audience)Silence at the end of the movie then positive review with excited debate rehashing the experience demonstrates on this occasion a top shelf movie.The movie is a masterpiece of nuances. The director's vision has seen the characters explode onto the screen and reach into our very being. The sexual struggle is enthralling and captivating.The beauty of the movie incorporates the picturesque scenery plus the understated reality of people doing their best to fit a world they are desperately trying to feel part of.Hire it or buy it. You won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One perfect summer and a life of cruel compromises - heartbreaking,"This movie exceeded my already high expectations. It's exceptionally realised - the direction is superb and the acting is excellent. I was entranced by the story from the very outset. I empathised with the characters to the point of actual heartbreak. This is a film of such honesty; tackling a topic that is still a taboo in today's ""liberal"" society. How many movies have you seen that portray gay love in a sensitive, non-judgmental fashion? There are several moments when, even if you find it difficult to deal with the physical depiction of homosexual love (even though it's not at all graphic), viewers who value love won't be able to prevent themselves from empathising with the characters - Ennis' reaction when he has to leave Jack for the first time and when, during their argument at their last meeting, Ennis says something that is heartbreaking in its poignancy.These lovers - the open-hearted Jack and the silent, suffering Ennis - shared one perfect summer and much of the rest of their lives is a cruel compromise - simply because the world won't allow their love.Like all truly good movies, Brokeback Mountain stays with you long after the last image fades from the screen. It makes you question your preconceptions and hopefully makes you want to make the world a place where all people are free to love whom they want as they please.",,Anonymous,Romance
Unexpectedly captivating,"Brokeback Mountain finally premiered in Rochester last night. Before I continue, I just want to say that before I walked into the theater, my conscience was saying not to go, because of my past view on homosexuality. My idea was that it was wrong and immoral.However, I still cleared my mind and gave myself the strength to pay attention. And I'm glad I did.'Cause I wasn't watching another gay-biased film. I wasn't even watching a new work that Ang Lee put out just to say he did something. No, I was watching an engaging, emotional, heart-felt romantic drama. Just with homosexual characters instead of the typical male-female romance.Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar deserves not only an Oscar nod, but a win as well. Jake Gyllenhaal was also good as Jack Twist.In the end, I learned that homosexuality should be tolerated, and that it's their own choice and no one else's.ACTING: 10 WRITING: 10 DIRECTION: 10 MUSIC: 10 OVERALL: 10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Powerful Love Story,"I made it a point not to read any detailed summaries or reviews of this movie before going to view it. I am so glad I did. The scenery was breathtaking and almost surreal. The cast completed each other almost perfectly. Heath Ledger's performance will be discussed for years to come, as well as Jake Gyllenhaal's. You cannot leave from this work of art without being affected by it. This was a beautiful and extremely touching portrait of a love story between two people that I can only classify as universal. Go see it and form your own opinion; I think you will be profoundly surprised. I honestly feel this movie will change cinema as we know it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Two Men In Love at the Venice Film Festival,"It was a real ordeal to get into the screening. The anticipation was palpable. The film arrived surrounded by a plethora of innuendo. ""A gay western"" ""Heath and Jake's hot scenes"" As soon as the film started every imaginable preconception flew out of the auditorium. This is a remarkable, moving and powerful love story. The setting is that of a modern western ""The Last Picture Show"" comes to mind. Ang Lee's attention to detail verges on science fiction. You can actually smell the place. Extraordinary. I'm not going to reveal anything about the story - Gian Luigi Rondi a legendary Italian film critic, revealed the ending to a television audience, what was he thinking?! - The film will be enjoyed much more allowing the story to unfold without having passages underlined and attention drawn to this or that particular. I felt compelled to write this comment because I'm overwhelmed. It has changed my perception, I must confess, about certain aspect of same sex love because I didn't think of same sex when I was watching it, I saw two human beings (amazing performances by both actors)I have the feeling ""Brokeback Mountain"" will make history, deservedly so.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
good movie ! I like it,"I think this movie is very interesting and exciting.It talks about two men work together.I think gay couple can be accepted because love is free.Although this movie is not accepted by Christians because gay couple is not accepted in the Bible but many people are very interested in this movie. Boy or girl is not a big problem,the most important is your choice. I think we should not care about how other people feel about you because of being gay couple.I think they should not give up.

Too stunned to cry,"After all the hype, i was finally persuaded to see this film. I was prepared for a ""good"" film. What I experienced was overwhelming. The sights, sounds and emotions cascading in front of me caught me totally off guard. I have never been in a theatre full of people where no one would even chew popcorn! The moment that sticks in my mind most is at the end where Ennis is standing at the closet with the two shirts, which he has switched and placed his on the outside, and then does up one last button, lovingly strokes the shirts and then says, ""I swear, Jack."" Those three words seem to hold all the anger, frustration, longing and love that Ennis has gone through in his journey with Jack.I was too stunned to cry.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Best of 2005,"Ang Lee's devastatingly beautiful ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a magnificent achievement. Early in production, the film was dubbed ""the gay cowboy movie."" The term is a tragic simplification of what is actually an exquisite love story, gay or straight. ""Brokeback"" is quickly shedding its nickname and breaking down barriers as more and more people actually see it and succumb to its beauty and heartache.The film is small in budget, but epic in scale and vision. It begins in Wyoming in 1963. Nineteen-year-olds Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) have been assigned a flock of sheep to guard on Brokeback Mountain. Ennis is a taciturn ranch hand who in one conversation with Jack says more than he has in an entire year. Jack, a part-time bull rider, is the more extroverted of the two. They make an unlikely pair, but Lee handles the developing relationship with great tact so as to make sure it is believable.One night, after a long evening of drinking, Jack and Ennis surprise themselves by having sex. The scene is an awkward experience not only for the characters, but for the audience watching them as well. Had the sex been between a man and a woman, the scene might not have been given a second thought. The fact that it breaks from tradition, presenting a so-called ""forbidden love"" unabashedly up-close and intimate, is part of what makes the film such a cinematic landmark. ""This is a one shot thing we got going' here,"" says Ennis the next day. ""You know I ain't no queer."" ""Me neither,"" replies Jack. Quite the opposite is true, however. That fateful night on the mountainside sets into motion a tumultuous romance that will span two decades.After their summer on Brokeback, both men eventually marry and have children. Ennis finds a loving and devoted wife in Alma (Michelle Williams). Jack meets a real live-wire in Lureen (Anne Hathaway), whose father owns an expensive farm equipment business in Texas. One day a postcard arrives for Ennis postmarked Jack Twist. It is the first word he has heard from him in over four years. The two reunite in a tryst of wild passion, and are once again caught up in what they thought they had left behind on Brokeback Mountain.As the years pass, Ennis and Jack meet only for the occasional ""fishing trip."" During one of these trips, Jack suggests he and Ennis buy a ranch together somewhere in the country. Ennis dismisses the idea as a fantasy. ""Bottom line is, we're around each other and this thing grabs hold of us, at the wrong place, at the wrong time, and we're dead."" Ennis recounts a childhood memory of a man who was tortured and killed because he lived with another man. His father made sure he saw the body.The rest of the story I will not reveal because some events are better left to be experienced in the theater where their power can be fully absorbed and appreciated.""Brokeback Mountain"" would not work half as well as it does if it were not for the multitude of fine performances throughout. The women are uniformly excellent. Michelle Williams, a long way from her days on ""Dawson's Creek,"" gives a performance of somber perfection. One scene in particular in which she confronts Ennis about his fishing trips is almost enough to guarantee her a nomination come Oscar time. Anne Hathaway, best known from Disney's ""The Princess Diaries"" films, shines as well. The extremely talented but often overlooked Randy Quaid, Linda Cardellini, and Anna Farris each have brief but memorable roles that, despite their brevity, are integral parts of the story. Jake Gyllenhaal caps off a great year with his superbly nuanced performance as Jack, a doe-eyed optimist who grows tired of only being able to see Ennis two or three times a year. As Ennis, Heath Ledger delivers the performance of a lifetime. Ennis is a man of few words, but when he does speak, it is as if the words are literally punching to get out. Ledger proves that sometimes less is more as he uses his body to express things that words alone never could. Ledger is, in a word, brilliant.Screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana deserve recognition for adapting the eleven-page short story by Annie Proulx into a two-and-a-quarter hour film. Dialogue in the film is sparse, but it only serves to make each word uttered that much more important. When Ennis says, ""If you can't fix it, you've got to stand it,"" our hearts break because we know there is nothing that should need to be fixed.In addition to being one of the most compellingly acted and written films of the year, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is the most stunningly photographed. The tagline, ""love is a force of nature,"" fits it perfectly. Ang Lee and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto use every opportunity they have to connect the power and beauty of nature (lakes, streams, clouds, rain, snow, hail, thunder, etc.) to the most raw and complex of human emotions. Brokeback Mountain itself is a symbol of freedom for Jack and Ennis. It is the only place they can go to truly love, and be loved, with no restraints.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a film of limitless possibilities. Its true power lies within its ability to linger and haunt long after the final credits have rolled. It forces us, as any good film should, to ask questions, questions about the world and ourselves. As I sat and watched ""Brokeback"" I couldn't help but wonder what life might have been like for Ennis and Jack had they found each other today. Would their fates be any different? I would like to think so.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good movie.,"Good movie. Enjoyed it. I really liked the scenery. I really liked the costumes. I really liked the vehicles. I really liked the animals. I really liked the loving. I really liked the laughing. I really liked the fighting. I really liked the spitting. Curious to see where a sequel would take our 'hero'. Heath and Jake have always been favorite actors of mine. I understand they are really good friends, so I expect we will see them in future movies together. If you haven't already, definitely check out Donny Darko. One of my absolute favorites. Jake is awesome! And who couldn't love Heath in a 'Knights Tale'. Anyway, I got off track here. Brokeback is very good. I only gave it a 7 because I felt it could have been shorter and they could have gone into the impact this had on their marriages a little more.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Accepting people for who they are,"I watched Brokeback Mountain for the first time 2 weeks ago. Someone gave me a copy about 2 years ago but could not bring myself to watch it. But being Australian I wanted to see Heath Ledger and also have seen a few movies with Jake Gyllenhall who I think is also a great actor.I have read people's comments about how its a beautiful love story and so on, but for me it was all that but more important it was an education about accepting people for who they are and not judge them for their preferances in life. Before Brokeback Mountain I would cringe at 2 guys kissing or even holding hands now I see it as 2 people being in love and that is because of the great performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall.I thank them both for making this great film so believable that has touched me so deeply.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
My Feelings about Brokeback Mountain,"I had no idea what to expect when I saw this film. I had seen the media hype and heard the jokes yet never read the short story it's based upon. What I saw was a movie that had a universal message, a film so powerful that it rips you to bits. The story is terribly sad and bleak and I use the word heartbreak in it's original sense because it does just that: it breaks your heart. Yet its' beauty and simplicity are breathtaking, this film will be ranked as one of the greatest movies ever made. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal deserve their nominations, they are brilliant. The film deserves to win Best Picture, as a matter of fact it deserves to win every award it has been nominated for and THAT is something which can rarely be said of ANY film! There is no downside at all to BBM, Ang Lee has created something which will stand the test of time and become a great classic. It is the only film I have ever seen where the entire audience--men, women, gay, straight, young, old--left the theater with their mouths open, and yes, it's effect IS that powerful. I can't recommend it highly enough; I intend to see it again in the theater and buy the DVD in April. Absolutely fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I could make a more compelling love story about alley cats,"The cinematography was fabulous the acting was good. Thats where the praise ends. The opportunity to make a great film was lost after the first act (literally). They failed to deliver any real emotion or sympathy for the characters. Personally, I cannot believe Ang Lee won Best Director. The movie spans 20+ years and the major players never age? The actresses that played the wives still looked twelve years old. That was painful and distracting, but the real deal breaker was the two separate Thanksgiving scenes with the long shots of the obviously cold turkeys being carved. Horrible. Definitely NOT best director material. Plus, the love story was not believable and Jake and Heath had no chemistry. Jakes character was poorly developed. I wish I could quit this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A masterpiece...,"This was a divine movie! It was just perfect, it was great! Ang Lee deals really skilfully with the fragile theme of homosexuality giving us one of the most moving pictures ever... The marvelous, heart-breaking Annie Proulx story is so tastefully adapted to the screen that it totally enchants you... Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were performing in such a spectacular way that really surprised me, with Gyllenhaal giving the best performance for the year 2005 combining love, tenderness and lust, and Ledger giving the best performance of his career creating one of the most tragic figures of cinema... This movie was nothing more than an hymn to pure love, a haunting movie that breaks your heart with its unaffectedly moving ending... and of course one of the biggest Oscar fiascoes ever...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Finally!,"I finally got to see this movie! Had definite plans to travel out-of-town this weekend with hubby to see it, because I didn't think it would ever make it to our little conservative city in Central Illinois, but one of the local theaters finally got it.It was quite delicious, though it left me aching for more between the guys. Granted, there was not room for a lot of tenderness, because the passion was so bottled up, when it got out it often bordered on violence. My favorite scene(s) were two cuddlesone from love and one from passion and frustration (2nd night in the tent, and the clinch during their last meeting at Brokeback).I don't think Jack understood the depth of Ennis' love for him, and the suffering it caused him to resist that lovethough Ennis did everything he could to hide it (including from himself).The women were great. If only Alma could have leveled with Ennis right after she saw him kissing Jack, it might have spared everybody some heartachebut she was just as trapped by ignorance as he wasnot to mention, she loved him and was devastated to find out that he did not feel for her what she felt for him. And more trapped from a cultural standpoint, being a woman in a time when women had very little power.What did Ennis mean, at the very end of the movie, what he said, ""I swear""? I have my idea; I'd like to hear yours. Nice touch that Ennis' light-colored plaid shirt, which was originally inside Jack's denim, showed up in Ennis' ""closet"" on the outside. Not a continuity error, trust me.Did Jack's parents know the score? I say mom definitely did and was pretty sympathetic to the situation. Not sure about dad (though he was not nearly so sympathetic, in any case).I was amused/touched/ vindicated(?) by the amount of surreptitious crying going on in the theater. Granted, mostly women. There was such a load of tissues on the theater floor (and you hardly ever see tissues). I used several, too, but stuffed 'em in my purse.I cried, but I was not disappointed. The movie was very depressing in its depiction of poverty and intolerance, but it salvaged what is really important, and to me ultimately proved to be satisfying. Though love was not triumphant, it was true in, and to, the end.If Ennis could live his life over, he would do it differently. He knows what he has lost, and has learned from the experience, paradoxically proving this by deciding to be present at the wedding of a daughter he lovesand damn the torpedoes. Would that he could have done the same for Jack, while there was still time! I am getting the book, for sure, because I could not catch some of the dialog. Will need to see the movie in the theater again, tooand get the DVD.For the woman who said she wondered if she was weird because two men being loving turned her on, let me say, ""If you are weird, you have lots of company!"" I have been a fan of male/male relationships for 25 years, since the advent of ""slash"" fiction in media fandom (which I believe started with the classic Star Trek and K/S). For me, it is not mainly the sex (though that is by no means excluded!); it is the love and resulting vulnerability.And for you guys who might be thinking, ""Crap, my wife wants to see this thing, but why do I want to watch two guys making goo-goo eyes at each other?"" If for no other reason, because you are about 100% likely to ""get some"" afterwards. Love is love is love--and women like to watch it. I am off to grab hubby, and lead him into the bedroom. Wanna show him how great it feels to be able to love the person you love, without societal recrimination! LJS",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
universal love,"I think this movie is universally appealing because it's about an all encompassing love--the love a parent gives and a child needs, the love between partners. It's the love of family these two boys never got until Brokeback Mountain. It's a mutual understanding and empathy they provided for one another. These were just kids who up until Brokeback Mountain, were pretty disposable. They blossomed up there just like all the other living things around them during the summer season. What a perfect setting to deliver that message. This movie was achingly beautiful, poignant. It left me wanting more. It was hard to leave the theater and say good-bye.",,Anonymous,Romance
Magical performance!,"There's only one thing that runs through my mind: WOW. The way the characters come to life is beyond words. The emotional scenes were played with full devotion to their work. The movie left me with a weird feeling for days. I didn't cry although I was happy that the emotional scenes were not blown up, you know like to much drama. That makes it so realistic. Normally when you watch those types of movies, you say to yourself ah..it's just a movie. With this masterpiece you don't get that feeling at all. The balance between fiction and real life are perfectly dosed. It's like your part of the movie..Sensational feeling. You feel sad and happy at the same time...you feel sorry for them not able to express their love. I thought America was the land of freedom!! Not as long Bush is around. Anyhow... this is not a political debate. Oscars? The answer: Definitely deserved. I hope it opens the eyes of people like them living a double life. THIS MOVIE IS A MUST TO SEE!

A Perfect Movie with something for everyone,"Brokeback Mountain.A movie about many things. But for me one thing stood out. And that was the sheep. Being from New Zealand you can appreciate my love for sheep.All the sheep gave really good performances playing sheep. I felt the cast of 700 sheep did a fantastic job portraying 117,000 sheep. Not one time was I able to distinguish which sheep were used for particular shots. Now that is what I call method acting.Casting did a great job getting just the right sheep for the meatier roles. I hear some sheep were flown in at last minute from all over. But credit to crew who obviously had to pull strings to get such a great ensemble. And a pat on the back for the producers who showed guts in hiring not only the best sheep, but taking a gamble on some of the unknowns too.Ang Lee I feel really captured the essence of sheep.He also captured that other stuff too.But really good job on the sheep. I had lamb chops for dinner that night and I must say they tasted just that little bit better. Thanks Ang!",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
They created characters and brought them to life,"I remember watching the dire ""Mission Impossible 2"" where the heroine was trying to decide whether or not to kill herself and just wishing she'd get on with it. Nothing could be more different from ""Brokeback"" where between the writers, the director and the actors they have created characters so real you seem to know them as friends.Of course it's a tragedy, but rather like a massage in a Turkish bath (in Turkey) the film hurts but makes you feel a lot better.Only one weakness, and it's the credibility of the plot.

Beautiful performances by Jake Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway. Being a gay person myself I understand what the two cowboys went through but the portrayal of this forbidden love affair, almost like a Romeo and Juliet but instead a Romeo and Julian (although only one of them passes away) is absolutely fabulous!! I cannot help but rave about this movie. The storyline is compelling although it caused me to cry (note: I never cry in movies) and caused much heartache it is such a beautiful movie.

"Not a 'fun' movie, and it is a bit slow, but still a rather remarkable film.","""Brokeback Mountain"" is a very low energy film that made a big hubbub when it debuted due to its gay characters....something Hollywood hadn't previously done in western films, apart from parodies like ""Lust in the Dust"". As a result, a lot of folks adored the film and lauded it for its bravery. As for me, I liked the movie but I wasn't as impressed by it as some...mostly because the relationship between Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis (Heath Ledger) seemed to move too quickly at first...way too fast and not especially realistic.The story begins with the two ranch hands, Ennis and Jack, spending the summer way up in the Wyoming mountains with a huge flock of sheep. They are alone and eventually the pair have sex...though as I mentioned above, the build up to this seems too quick. I wish they'd showed a more natural and believable transition from co-workers to lovers.This portion of the film is relatively brief and after this summer the two go separate ways...Jack to Texas where he eventually marries and has a family and Ennis to Wyoming where he does the same. And, because this story takes place from the 1960s to the 80s, the pair live the straight lives and only meet on occasion when they go back to Brokeback Mountain for their trysts. What's next? See the film.Heath Ledger got a lot of publicity about his performance and I was surprised at his accent and flat affect which worked well with the character. He also was rather low energy and combined with the very slow pacing of the film might make this movie less approachable to most viewers...not just because of the gay plot. As for me, I would like to have seen more emotion and more of the film focused on Ennis and Jack...and a slightly faster pace. Still, it is a very good film and well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Never Saw It Coming!  I Was Hit and Hit Hard!!!!!,"If you see this film, and you SHOULD, you will know what I mean. Of course, there are some, even friends of mine, who have seen it, even liked it, a lot, but didn't quite ""get it."" As you can probably see from the rest of the viewer comments, many of us ""got it"" and got it good. Those of us who ""got it"" (and you know who you are), well, I believe we were the chosen ones. We are the ones who will take with us a new lease on life  a responsibility to life. Never again will I allow myself the complacency of life without love or at least never allow myself not to connect with my fellow human beings. I have, for the first time, in a long time, looked into people's faces on the street, when before I would keep my head down. I talk more to people, I walk more with people, I compliment and am kinder to people. I'm reaching out when I knew not long ago that I was starting to check out. It is simply amazing what has come over me.This film is bigger than life. It is bigger than the viewer. It is bigger even than the portrayal of Jack & Ennis' huge love for each other. It is definitely bigger than the ignorant and negative commentaries by some naysayers, and it hits you when and where you least expect it.First, let me say, that I asked myself, where did these two young actors come from??!! I think I knew the Gyllenhaal name, but didn't have a clue as to the Ledger name and couldn't have put a face to either if asked. Well, I know them now! And I will never ever be the same because of their brave, dedicated and intimate portrayals of Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar. I've now heard other actors' names who were considered for these roles, and I can't even imagine any one of them pulling off the chemistry these two young men did.Knowing I needed to see it again and then again, I purchased the DVD. I have watched it probably 15 times already, trying each time to pull it as close to me as I could, but, like Jack and Ennis, I simply don't ever get quite close enough to it, requiring me to watch it, and particular scenes in it, over and over like some strange obsession.This story of pure and natural love leaped off the screen, grabbed hold of my heart and has refused to let go. It has been a month since I first saw it, and not a minute of each day goes by without my thinking about it. It didn't matter to me, somehow, that, in this movie, these two lovers were men. To me, it was just two people in love. The actors' abilities to show their characters' passion, connection to each other and intimacy just blew my doors off. I cried like I've never cried before. SOBBED during the last ½ hour. SOBBED again for an hour after it ended. SOBBED reading other viewer comments. SOBBED at the faintest memory of any one scene, and there are so many good ones, I couldn't begin to pick them out here. What on earth is it???!!!! I think I have finally decided that it must have been that the stars were aligned from Annie Proulx' raw and somewhat crass short story, to its publication in the New Yorker oh so many years ago, to Diana Ossana reading that New Yorker issue, to her and Larry McMurtry's screenplay and then placed into the caring hands of director, Ang Lee, cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, and then, finally, the casting of these two fine young actors in the lead roles. It all clicked like a fine wine or a classic work of art.Jake Gyllenhaal is everything he needs to be and more for his perfect portrayal of optimistic, wide-eyed and loving Jack Twist. He really shows his bones in the scene where he drives all the way from Texas at the news of Ennis' divorce, only to find that nothing has changed. His metamorphosis from elation to devastation is pure perfection. My heart felt as though it had been ripped from my very center. And what well did Heath Ledger go to in order to bring beautiful, introverted and emotionally scarred Ennis del Mar to life? He is simply  flawless  right down to even the remotest of scenes, such as his obvious heavy-heartedness when coming down from the mountain, early, knowing his once in a lifetime love (because he believes it must) will end. Absolutely perfect! See this movie, and, if you ""get it"", welcome to the club",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
excellent but long film,"Went to see this much acclaimed film last night and really enjoyed it very much despite its length. The acting on the part of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal was outstanding and they were fully believable. I felt the scenery in this picture was beautiful and look forward to taking a trip out to this part of the country. As much as I liked the acting I felt that toward the end of this film it could have been cut down in length, as it started to drag as the story continued.If you want to see an outstanding job of acting and beautiful scenery go pronto to see this film, I promise you will enjoy it.

"Broke""Blah"" Mountain","This was one of the most boring films I have ever seen. I really don't get why so many in the gay community are glowing over this film. This is not a good film for the community. When the hell are these self proclaimed liberal film makers going to get it. I'm tired of seeing movies where the villain is gay or the only reason you get to like the character is because he's suffering. Gays have happy endings too. That IS real life.1. Heath Ledger: Not an Oscar award winning performance. Marlon Brando could give this kid lessons in diction. I could barely make out a word he said.2. The Love scene or lack there of: I've never seen a more awkward attempt at making love and kissing. These guys should give up acting now. They both looked uncomfortable and disgusted at what they were doing.3. What's love got to do with it: When do we ever get to see these actors in love and enjoying themselves? The only time we get to see them happy, the camera pulls away so we can see the disapproving sneer of their boss."" I didn't pay them boys to do this"".4. When will Hollywood learn: There appears to be an unwritten rule in Hollywood that a character can't be gay unless he's dying, unhappy, victimized or victimizing. The Gay community is tired of being portrayed at villains, psychos, degenerates, or diseased and unfortunate ""lost souls"". In Philadelphia, we are allowed to like Tom Hanks because he's dying (never-mind the fact that you never see him and Antonio share any physical signs of affection).5. The pacing of the movie was very slow. This was not an entertaining film. It was beautifully photographed but not very entertaining.This film teaches us that Gays are doomed to loneliness and misfortune and miserable, unhappy lives and grizzly deaths at the hands of ignorant bigots. Speaking of which, Christians are actually using this movie as propaganda to show their congregation that you, too, will be doomed if you give in to their ""wicked Homosexual desires"".I hated this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"engaging, passionate, forever with you","This is a first for me, commenting in a forum like this. I saw this amazingly, beautiful movie 2 days ago and I cannot get it out of my mind,my heart, and my soul. I know that this is movie that I will watch many times. The cinematic beauty of the landscape is STUNNING, the musical score is HAUNTING and the performances of all the actors will draw you into the screen, into their lives, their pain and ultimately into their love for each other. How precious is such love, we all crave it, we want it, for that is what life is to be, shared with someone you love, your soul mate and Jack and Ennis were just that true soul mates until the end...""I swear"". It amazes me that in this time we live,more than 20 years after this movie take place we still can condemn such a love between 2 people, yet we praise it when it is of the same sex. I wonder how far we really have come? This movie is not about sex at all and when watching this you realize that very quickly. I read the short story twice and it made me love the movie even more.Annie Prolx is a master and Ang Lee has given us a visual masterpiece to match her words. I find myself in the middle of the day my eyes tearing up when I tell someone how wonderful this film is, how it has captured me and won't let me go.

"A powerful, deeply moving film.","This movie is something that cannot be expressed in words. It is a truly amazing film. Everything is so right, right from the first scene. The connection is so beautifully portrayed, the film itself is so tender and heartfelt. It is literally moving. The pace and editing are perfect and every scene has a purpose and a point. It definitely does not disappoint.... in any way. The soundtrack is excellent and really adds to the emotion portrayed on screen.The way the relationship between Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) has been handled so wonderfully. It really does show the true meaning of love and how it can stand all tests, be they time, distance or environment. Their relationship is so complex and heartfelt. You really connect with the two characters and how they feel for each other; how they handle the feelings and emotions they are going through and their situation. At times, you feel as if you are almost there beside them, feeling the emotions with them.... when they hurt.... you hurt too.... and the hurt is genuine.The images in the movies and scenes shown are just amazing; the camera work is sublime. It is a masterpiece of a film. I came out of the film and thought about it ever since, it has stayed with me. All I can say is go and watch the movie, just go and watch it. I have to wholeheartedly agree with legendary Australian film critic, Margaret Pomeranz, when she said in her review ""Do you know, this is why I go to the movies, for the possibility of seeing something as good as this.""

I left the theater doors, holding back as a walked through the crowded sidewalks of downtown Mill Valley, till I got to my car, closed the door, and wept. This was an unexpectedly powerful love story. My heart still aches for the characters depicted in this uncanny romance. Brokeback mountain is not for the weak of heart or close-minded, but definitely well-deserving of its critically acclaimed splendor. I was skeptical of heath ledger and his counterpart to pull off a convincing cowboy. I left with a greater respect for both actors. Being homosexual myself, I was affected on a very personal level by this tragic love story. This will be a movie I never forget. Leaving the theater was like leaving my own funeral.

It delivers so much feelings and honesty, and it feels so REAL in some way... It is absolutely wonderful in every way possible, so passionate and strong in every sense... And even though it expresses so much feelings and love and sadness an frustration, it's acted and directed with this great calm and sensibility. There isn't much talk in the film, but the feelings are everywhere; in the story, in the landscape, in the music and most importantly in the actors themselves; in their faces, the way they talk...

"""Brokeback Mountain"" When the Marlboro Man Goes Gay ***","Heath Ledger, in the lead role, takes on the character that would have been ideal for Paul Newman had Hollywood been allowed to make such a film years ago.Ledger is definitely the new Paul Newman. In many ways, he reminded me of the great star's performance in ""Hud."" Even the way he wore his cowboy hat was similar to that of Newman.The first part of the movie will be viewed by many as objectionable. It details how the 2 shepherds fall into a homosexual relationship which becomes a ""Same Time, Next Year"" thing. The difference is that in the latter film, the couple could go on with their everyday lives. This picture depicts how their relationship, which was destined to go nowhere, ultimately ruins their lives.Ledger, in a low-voiced keyed performance, is terrific as the surviving partner of a relationship that ruined his marriage and leaves him alone at film's end. Jake Gylenhaal is wonderful as his counterpart. Strong-willed but realistic, he set an appropriate tone by his acting.""Brokeback Mountain"" was the surprise Oscar loser for best picture. Even liberal Hollywood could not find itself in the end to vote for a homosexual based film. Instead, they chose the rather ""safe"" film ""Crash,"" which detailed racist problems in society. I guess that racism is still easier to deal with as opposed to homosexuality by film standards.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A film to treasure.,"I came to ""Brokeback Mountain"" with many recommendations from friends who utterly loved the film. This usually means disappointment because few films live up to the hype, but ""Brokeback Mountain"" exceeded my highest expectations.The film is concerned with gender, relationships, fidelity and the human need for love, affection and companionship. Ledger and Gyllenhaal, who are both painfully convincing, have both said that this is not a gay film per Se, and although I first thought they were pussy footing around the fact, I have come to agree with them. The film doesn't merely portray a same-sex relationship or sexual encounter, although it does both, it rather addresses the construction of gender. What makes a man. This is most obviously done through the appropriation of what was in the 60's an unquestioned icon of machismo, the cowboy. Ang Lee gives us a glimpse behind the rough exterior of the Marlbro Man and exposes a vulnerable, tormented and guilt stricken man trying to survive and desperately trying to punch themselves into what is acceptable. The films narrative foundations may be that of a classic Hollywood thwarted romance, but it is so affecting.The film is beautifully photographed but almost too heartbreaking to watch, with every scene filled with unspoken truths, desires and tension. The men cry and break-down, but presumably not enough to let out all that is fermenting inside. Instead the cinema screen weeps. If you allow yourself the emotional connection needed to fully appreciate this film, then like me you'll leave the cinema with a stomach ache, completely exhausted.Lee's direction is invisible, but deft enough in order to analyze, pull apart and examine what's been done. This is a Hollwood film which adheres to independent sensibilities and made by an Asian director. A film about two (for a lack of a better word) ""gay"" men who are played by two straight actors. A quiet, in all senses of the word, film which is about the unsaid, the repressed and the silenced which manages to say so much, with sparse dialog.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a film to treasure.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good--Definitely Not Great,"It's true that the photography was gorgeous and the film is deserving of a Best Cinematography nomination, but not for writing or best picture (which I'm sure it will).I read the novella, which is only 50 pages long, so that's the first indication that the film was unnecessarily too long at 134 minutes. Although adaptations don't have to be true to their original source, for the most part, this one was, and yet it still ran too long.I felt that the entire second act dragged on too long with absolutely no conflict. It was like watching Ennis's life, then watching Jack's life--skip ahead a few years--watching Ennis's life, then watching Jack's life--skip ahead a few years--watching Ennis's life, then watching Jack's life--skip ahead a few years (and so on and so on and so on). It was basically watching people breathe for an entire hour. Yes, they did have internal conflicts, but it was the SAME conflict (i.e. they want to be together but external factors prevented it) for an hour. Yes, their love was timeless, but did we really need to see them almost EVERY YEAR OF THEIR LIVES? It's not like there was a change of heart or anything on either guy's part. If the theme is that this love was timeless, then show them at a couple stages of their lives, not all of them.This film is getting so much press because of the story and its ""controversy,"" but any story about homosexuality can be deemed controversial--and yet Kissing Jessica Stein or the dozens of other similarly-themed films don't get nearly as much press and most definitely no nominations.Anyway, I apologize for this tirade but the hype this film is getting really burns me up. It was good, but not nearly as great as people make it out to be. I think people are afraid to dislike it because they think they might be deemed homophobic.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Grossly over-rated ....,"Grossly over-rated ... but PR is PR. Certainly the gay and artsy communities are happy to see the film made for the groundbreaking it does - but groundbreaking does not equal good film-making.The plot is relatively predictable - think back to Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn in ""Same Time, Next Year"". Two lovers meet on a regular basis for a number of years while living separate lives the rest of the time. Big deal, this time the two lovers are gay cowboys. Yes, it was a love story - but a poorly done love story that drags on and on and on - then abruptly falls off a cliff and ends too quickly.The acting starts off mediocre and doesn't get much better. Randy Quaid was OK in ""Category 6: Day of Destruction"" (TV) but hasn't had a really decent part since ""Hard Rain"". This was a big step backwards. Jake Gyllenhaal is weak (though the ladies seem to drool a lot when he is around) and heartthrob Heath Ledger plays below his capabilities.If you can ignore the less than stellar acting and look at the scenery, the location in the Canadian Rockies is absolutely spectacular and the cinematography is incredible. Also nice to see Linda Cardellini from ER with a minor part which she handled well - look forward to seeing more of her on the big screen.

I knew this movie was going to be an epic like all the comments said, but I really didn't know how powerfully it was going to change my life. Ennis and Jack are two characters who are so uniquely distinct that they fall into a strange and powerful, bonding love. Because of society's non-acceptance, many characters are emotionally wounded from this romance. I can't stop from going over every little detail, from beans to ""Jack, I swear..."" The ending is unforgettable. Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger along with the rest of the magnificent cast transform what would normally be a film into reality. ""Brokeback Mountain,"" is like how a good poem should be. It doesn't just pretend to be the words on the page, but is the words on the page. This film is the love and freedom on Brokeback Mountain.

Ho Hum,"Honestly I really don't understand what the hype is about this film. I went in with the best of intentions and came out truly disappointed. What I was left with was a mediocre story that tried to be more than what it was. Mediocre acting as well as dialog. Noting really special about this other than it featured two straight actors playing homosexuals and quite unsuccessfully at that. Anne Hathaway gave a nice performance and the scenery was beautiful, but as far as Oscar worthy anything this definitely wasn't it. Heath Ledger struggled with his dialect and for me his performance was lifeless and dead. He left me wishing that they had cast a more vibrant actor to the role who could truly convey the pain and confliction that his character was going through but that didn't happen and the rest of the film didn't really give much to hold anyones attention.

Great acting from the boys and Williams,"It's 1963. Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) hitchhikes and stops at Signal, Wyoming. He and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) get hired as sheep herders on the side of Brokeback Mountain. One cold night, they have a homosexual encounter. They insist that they're not queer but they continue anyways. Their boss Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) notices their relationship and doesn't hire the guys the next season. Ennis marries Alma (Michelle Williams) and they have a young family together. Jack goes back to the rodeo circuit and has a family with barrel racer Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway). Both find married life deficient and reconnects. They just can't quit each other.The story is a bit slow and uncomfortable. The most compelling aspect is that being gay isn't the usual flamboyant over-the-top act. They are hidden and fear of discovery is palpable. There is one great scene from Michelle Williams. She does some superb acting. The boys risk a lot in these scary roles. Ledger's speaking style does get a bit muffled at times. However his acting is great and his fears are written all over his face. The superior acting and the risky subject makes this a worthwhile watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Reviews and Awards Truly a Case of Hype over Quality - Save your time and money,"After the hype and awards, I expected to see art, passion, professionalism. Instead I saw a poor quality product with poor direction, poor diction, unconvincing (or absent) passion, hurt, and a broken story line. In a few years, maybe the glowing critics will relook at the movie and reflect that their hype and hope for glory was not repaid with either art or a quality performance. For now, some of us will be the only ones to realize that it was a boring, poorly crafted, inarticulately presented movie that leaves the impartial viewer empty and disappointed. I'm glad I saw it, to make up my own mind--but I should have saved the time and money.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brokeback Mountain: a state of mind,"I am only 15, and i just recently saw this movie. I couldn't believe how good it was! After i saw it once, i had to see it again and again, and finally buy it on DVD. The characters in this movie are amazing. Brokeback Mountain isn't a made-up place, it is a state of mind that we all have in us. You just have to find it. It's not just a gay place in a gay movie,as some may want to think. It's a place of love that is not forbidden, and peace, all is equal, and happiness overflows. For those who haven't yet seen this movie, I highly recommend it. For those who have seen it, and loved it as much as i do, i recommend that we keep the story alive, and get others to do the same. I will always keep this movie close to my heart and it has changed me in such a way that i can not describe it. My mind is Brokeback Mountain, and I wish everyone could find that place in their mind, heart, and soul!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
a rite of passage for characters and a viewer,"""Words get in a way of communication"", said Exupery in Little Prince. This is how I feel about the film: it is indescribable, it has to be felt. If you get to this review, you probably know what the film is about, but to feel it through is worth much more, so watch it and judge for yourself. We are taken through many different emotions: joy, longing, anger, confusion, despair, and regret are among many. And most people can relate to at least a few of those, no matter what age, gender, race, sex orientation, religion or political views they hold. Here is the impact the film had on me: interestingly, the first night I watched it (at home on DVD) I thought it was a well-made tragic story with superb acting, and so on, I did not cry, I went to sleep... Woke up next day unable to concentrate on anything else, as it was slowly sinking in deeper and deeper, to the core of my humanity. By the daytime I was devastated, replaying parts of it and thinking about my own life and only a handful moments of raw emotions (blissful and aching) that I experienced, emotions unmixed with its' ""yang"" of rationality and logic. Emotions that shake you and take you on a rite of passage, and after you are not the same again. The next night I got up at 2am and saw it again, this time crying over tragedies of human existence (imagine a story being told from Ennis's wife's point of view, or daughter, etc.); and thats the whole thing: it's not a good guys vs. bad guys type of film; If only life was that simple!.. This film became personal. And in fact, I am reluctant of recommending it to my husband, friends, and family, since I know that either negative comments or indifference on their part might shatter my image of THEM. Thank you, cast and crew for this rite of passage.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'll remember it as the spark.,"I think it's safe to say that when 2006 and 2007 are filled with more and more gay-themed films, Brokeback Mountain will deserve credit as the spark that lit the fire.I hear lots of straight people, namely my parents, complaining already that now every sitcom ""has to have a gay person on it"" and I respond, quite truthfully, ""There was a time when every TV show had to have a black person, too. Now it's nothing to even think about. It's a process of acceptance, and the media is just acting on it like they're supposed to."" As a young, gay male living in Kentucky, I suppose I'm lucky to be in Louisville, the northernmost, not to mention, most diverse city in the state. But it's sad I still have to be ""lucky"" that I'm hated to a less degree... I shouldn't be hated at all. Politics aside, on to the film.I had been hoping for a triumphant love story that left me beaming. I didn't get that. As a lover of cinema, I have to say that this is one of the most well done films in the last 3 or 4 years. I was thrilled to be there on opening night.Jake Gyllenhaal, best known as Donnie Darko, fulfilled one of my personal fantasies in this role, Hahaha. His acting was absolutely stellar. I admit, the accents were thick and the surround sound was echo-y, so I had a little trouble understanding some of the lines, but he was fantastic. I'd read so much about what the leads thought of this part, and I have to say, he managed to hide any trepidation while on screen. I believed it. That's all I can ask of an actor.Heath Ledger apparently claimed he did the role because, after three box office flops in a row, he didn't have anything to lose. Again, he left that sentiment at the door. Thank God. I thought ""Ennis"" was the more complicated character here. The one who had a harder time admitting to himself he wanted a man romantically. He was the one who desperately needed a wife and children to submerse himself in. Of course, the discovery of why he had that attitude was so well-played -- by Ang Lee, most notably.Of course, the bitter irony there is the ending to the film. I was shocked, and I certainly didn't get to leave the theatre beaming with a smile... But I think I got a lot more from it. I think, because I was forced to do some soul searching and find my own happy ending, I was able to still love this film with the intensity I do. It was absolutely unforgettable...While I know that for every 2 good gay-themed movies we get in the next few years, there will be 4 crappy ones and a bucket-load of unwatchable comedies, I welcome them into the world. It's high time ""gay"" becomes overused, and therefore ineffective as an insult, and generally accepted. And there's always that side of me that is a little biased and will watch anything with a gay person in it... but maybe that's just more about wanting it in my life, because it hasn't been there yet.You must see Brokeback Mountain. It's an incredible love story, so powerful I can't stop flashing to it in my mind.",,Anonymous,Romance
"A good film, but don't believe the hype!!!!","This film is getting a lot of attention for obvious reasons, the film has been adopted by people with agendas that have nothing to do with the film itself. It is of course about 2 cowboys that fall in love and have a secret homosexual relationship over a 20 year period. I went into this film wanting to see if it was as good as all the reviews are saying. Needless to say it is a good film, Heath Ledger gives a great performance, Jake Gyllenhaal is good but doesn't match the intensity of Ledger. They meet on a job during a summer,where they are alone, and have a sudden strong attraction towards each other. The movie is not really concerned with the physical part of the relationship. Director Ang lee should be credited with not dwelling on the obvious sexual encounters of the men. The movie believe it or not has a very tradition Hollywood structure, 2 lovers meet, realize they can't be together, and decide to have a a secret love affair. The fact that it is between 2 men is the reason that the film is garnering such attention. If the film's love story was between a man and a woman, the film would not be as highly regarded as it is. It bothers me because I think that as a film it is done with such care for its story. I do feel that the film does not focus on the wives of these 2 men enough. The truth is these 2 men are lying to the 2 people that love them, the movie really doesn't deal satisfactorally with that. The film will not change anyone's mind about the subject of homosexuality, I believe it is a compelling story. What I don't agree with is that it is being touted as a masterpiece simply because of the fact that the lovers are 2 men. The move is good on it's own merits, but it is really not what it is being made out to be. To call this the greatest love story ever as I have read I think is disengenious, it is a compelling human story, but it bothers me that this movie is being treated as if it were a masterpiece for political reasons.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Simply Suberp ""BRAVO MAESTRO""","What an wonderful drama. Tremendous performances. This movie shows how love doesn't know anything about genders. Two starts have been born: Heath Ledger & Jake Gyllenhaal. It's impossible not to feel touched by this awesome film. God bless Ang Lee, the only one able to do history... Oscars won't be enough to recognize the incredible value on this gem. Gyllenhaal adds the perfect element to make Jack Twist credible, Gyllenhaal makes an outstanding performance. Heath Ledger, well what can I say?, there are no words to qualify his job.Surely, Brokeback Mountain has proved how love become into an addiction. After you watch it, all the movie cross over your mind during all days 'cause it has been showed to us a different kind of reality which has never been assumed by film industry because of silly fears. This is not about queers or sexual behaviors, it shows the pain of two simply mens who seem to have lived in the wrong period. Brokeback made the difference, all stupid clichés have been ignored by the director. When Jack dies we feel a sort of sadness and it proves the great quality of the director.

Will be remembered for its impact in cinematic history,"At the core of Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain' is a portrait of a love story that at the time could not have been, but still managed to be. While it's a reflection of a time and place that feels very far away from present day, the film still goes against the grain of what is considered mainstream, even 15+ years after its release.What 'Brokeback' has going for it is a picturesque setting of the American west and the story of a unique relationship between two cowboys who must conform to societal norms. The way things unfold over the course of decades, with Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack and the late Heath Ledger's Ennis, makes for an interesting storyline, as these two characters experience similar yet different tracks that test the strength of their bond. One can argue that Ledger out-acts Gyllenhaal, as he fits the role much more authentically, although you can barely make out a word he says through his chronic mumbling.Yes, it's a sad story that is hard to watch and is pretty boring at times, but 'Brokeback Mountain' will always be remembered for its place in history and impact on American culture.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Utterly Brilliant,"The true marking of a great film is how it stays with you long after you have vacated the theater. Less than twelve hours after seeing Brokeback Mountain, it haunts me like no other film I have seen in recent memory. The film represents an uncompromising vision of unfiltered passion and unparalleled love I feel has yet to previously radiate from the screen as transparently as it does here. The film works because it touches some level or another inside all us. No matter the viewer's orientation, everyone can somehow relate in some fashion or another. It's brutal, it's honest, and it represents the struggle of love and hope and perseverance long since overdue in modern cinema. A true masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very overrated film,"Brokeback Mountain can look like a good film. From a technical standpoint, its pretty well done.But all the hype and glowing reviews from a mostly liberal and pro-gay media only came about because the story was about two men who had gay sex. That's it.There's nothing really remarkable about Brokeback Mountain. Its not a love story and in fact it seems to be anti-love. Both the main characters betray their families and reject those who do love them.The plot is somewhat dull and the overall feel of the film is depressing.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

A love story above all,"Where does one start? With the beautiful Wyoming mountain scenery? With the beautiful Jake Gyllenhaal? With the desperate plight of 2 gay men in a society that will ill judge them if they are true to themselves?

The two principle characters share a passionate and loving summer together on a mountain, protecting a herd of sheep. That tranquil and beautiful experience is about to be shattered, however, as they return from the mountain to the reality of a homophobic society that is just not ready to condone their love for one another.

Extraordinary love story about two men who find the love of their lives in each other,"I saw the movie it two times, and it's the first time a movie keeps me thinking all through the day. It's a magnificent, tragic love story about two men who find the love of their lives.I think what keeps me thinking about the movie is the fact that I can imagine how awful it must feel to find the man you love, and then can't be with him the rest of your life.It really is a movie about people who find the love of their loves, and then can't live it. That's the bottom line of the story. And then it's made into a movie with beautiful sceneries, magnificent landscapes and a cast that makes you dazzle with excitement.Especially Jake Gyllenhaal, who deservedly has won a BAFTA-award for his performance, plays like he's never played before.

Broken by a film...,"I'm 23, and I find it hard to write this review. I saw the film exactly  one week ago today and not a moment has gone by when I don't ache. It  finds me in the shower; it haunts me in bed; it has filled my mind and  clings to my thoughts, and it won't let up. I try to lie to myself, to  find some solace by saying that it's just a movie, but I know better.  Jack and Ennis are alive, and they represent so many aching people, so  many untold stories. There is no contrivance, no manufactured  importance; there are no tricks. Brokeback Mountain tells, with painful  honesty and frankness, the story of two men's lives and nothing more.  Whether you are gay or straight, it doesn't hit close to home: it hits  you. Brokeback Mountain is a place we all most desperately yearn to go.  It's where we can be free.  It feels funny to say that Brokeback Mountain is my favorite film of  all time, because I think it almost an injustice to call it a film at  all, or to critique its incredible technical sophistication. Somehow  Brokeback Mountain transcends that. I could hear a thousand speeches  celebrating diversity or read a hundred love stories and not be  absolutely broken in just two hours as I was after this film. I've  never felt waves of nausea come over me as I did sitting in that  theater, my face contorted as I watched truth and honesty spill from  the screen and onto moviegoers who had no idea what they were in for.  I am usually the first to point out bias, so I know my words might be  mistaken for favoritism or blind loyalty. They should not. This movie  will change your existence. I find so many things in my life trivial  now in the wake of this film---for me, watching it was truly like  having a near-death experience. And am I better for it? Yes. Broken and  undone, but better.  For once in my life, I feel hope, and I've seen love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Haunting and affecting,"Have been wanting to see this for months. (Don't go to the theater much anymore.) Have read many of the raves here and concur with them. Don't know that there is much more to say for the excellence of acting, directing, and the pathos of the story = first love, forbidden love, dangerous love. Don't know that Ledger's acting was any better than the rest of the cast's. All were top flight. It was the depth of his character that was so affecting. Who knows what would have become of these two men if they had ""ranched up"" together. They would have faced long term poverty, social isolation and the cooling of passion that is inevitable with all couples. Happy lives don't make dramatic stories. Can't say this is the best movie I've ever seen, but it is one of the top 30. It is haunting.",,Anonymous,Romance
Bodacious Cowboys,"A fine example of compositional film-making. Ang sets this up from the get-go by framing the world of shepherding with the titular mountain as the background, a 'current' of activity in the middle, i.e., the sheep or the river current itself, and the passionate bits right up close in the foreground.This is mirrored in the story composition; the central relationship depends on those infrequent 'high altitude' trysts appearing way up close and tightly framed; the lives of married men and their families carry the middle current; the spectral backdrop is 'homophobia' (if such a charitably restrained word can be used to describe the disgusting inhumanity displayed in the Matthew Shepard murder, to which this plainly alludes -- it looms at least as large as the mountain).Kudos to Ang for getting the stance right -- no treatises on the minutiae of a cowboy's existence.And he got the musical accompaniment right...repeatedly iterating that minor-key waltz to punctuate the visual narrative and then move us forward.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Unforgettable Film!,"Silence speaks louder than words... Love speaks louder than words ...I'm a university professor and I tend to consider myself as a rather rational-intellectual and somewhat stoic person... but then came Brokeback Mountain which caught me off guard and has generated in me unforeseen emotion.Brokeback Mountain is at once the most lyrical, powerful, inspirational, yet heart-wrenching film in a long time, without doubt one of the most important and greatest films of the last few decades. This is truly an exceptional achievement, a landmark film with an amazing story/script, outstanding and exceptional acting, masterful direction, unhurried and controlled pace, breathtaking cinematography, simple yet excellent and beautiful music, and most importantly, unprecedented emotional impact. Its treatment of human nature, loneliness, longing for love, self-repression, intolerance, is done with admirable subtlety and sensitivity. This story is simply universal. Images of this film and stirring emotions will haunt you for days and weeks. This is an extraordinary deeply moving film... simply unforgettable!Brokeback Mountain is a rare work of art in which silence speaks louder than words. Eyes and smiles can be very eloquent. Sometimes words are not necessary and are simply obstacles to the truest expression. In a very important scene in total silence near the end of the film, Ennis is alone and no word is uttered. Yet, this is surely one the most powerful and probably one of the most unforgettable scenes in recent cinematic history for its meaning and emotional impact... love speaks louder than words. Ang Lee realizes the full power of image in his exploration of the most intimate human emotions. Avoiding facile and superficial stereotypes, the great author Annie Proulx and director Ang Lee have created truer-than-life characters and, thanks of course to the unforgettable and heartbreaking performances of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, ""Ennis and Jack"" now live forever, they are now undeniably part of the American literary and cinematic culture. How many other films have accomplished this in recent years?Brokeback Mountain will remain a milestone in cinematic history and is already considered a ""reference"". This film has been talked about all over the world and has attained unprecedented internationally acclaim - the ""Brokeback phenomenon"" has significantly crossed borders and, through the media and the Internet, has reached numerous foreign countries. Rarely did a film have such a strong impact on society, in the media, and with the general public. Brokeback Mountain has undeniably been the ""Most Acclaimed and Honoured Film"" of 2005 (and, as a matter of fact, of the last decade) and will of course be remembered as ""THE"" movie-event and most important film of 2005 despite the inexplicable absence of an Oscar for Best Picture to its already impressive crown.It's sad to say, but the recent disgraceful Oscar scandal proved how ""important"" and ""necessary"" this film is, and how many boundaries there are still to be conquered. After receiving dozens of prestigious awards worldwide, Brokeback Mountain might have been too subtle, too true, simply ""too good"", for the LA-based Academy... yes, the more I think of it, the feelings expressed in BBM are probably much too sincere and too profound for the Hollywood peanut gallery who often seems to prefer car crashes, car chases, explosions, fire, violence, rape, theft, gun shots, murders, etc. In any case, the newly released DVD of Brokeback will stand as a permanent reminder of how great this film is and how unimportant, irrelevant and meaningless the Oscars and the Academy really are.Countless people from all walks of life around the world will never forget Brokeback Mountain. This film is not pushing a specific moral, instead, it makes us think, it makes us feel, it makes us reflect on the true meaning and value of our lives.If you haven't seen this film yet, get the DVD, enjoy this truly exceptional masterpiece, and ""live the Brokeback Mountain experience""!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Lovely scenery, story a bit weak","The most outstanding part of this movie is the outdoor cinematography --- it really shows the beauty of the back country. The story, however, is stretched too thin. All you get is a brief peek to see that ""yes, this is happening"", but you don't really *feel* it happening. To be fair, I got the same feeling from the short story when I read it a few years ago too, and it is a hard thing to do. But that's what this story is about, so it has to succeed on that level for me to give it a 10. The acting was a bit uneven as well: Heath Ledger gave the most moving performances in the movie, though the first breakdown scene didn't quite pull me into it. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also get a chance to make us feel for them; they pull it off well, though Anne's scene has no background as to why she should feel that way. I see in the ratings that it's a ""love or hate"" situation, and I think those people are voting for or against homosexuality and/or Ang Lee, not the movie itself --- it isn't terrible, but it isn't perfect either.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best in it's kind?,"Well, I saw this movie yesterday, although I didn't want to. Read about the plot and thought it sounded strange. Didn't think it sounded interesting at ALL. But my friend convinced me, and during the movie I was totally swept away. Swept away by great acting,(not to forget) great scenery and a great plot. And my God, what a tragedy. Forbidden love with a sad ending. I nearly had to laugh, watching Heath Ledger as the quiet and tough type. Confused about his feelings, and the playing and ""fighting"" between ""Ennis"" and ""Jack"" I will never forget. Some kind of fear of their own feelings. All in all, this is a story about true love, and following the hearts desire. But in this story, it was ""impossible"". At first I thought it was strange, watching two heteroes acting gay, but I forgot about it fast. Because of great acting, and like I mentioned before, this is truly a love story and it goes straight to the heart, whether you're hetero or gay.

No role models here,"As a gay man I was not impressed with this movie as it portrayed weak characters who could never face their own truths - even when their truths caught up with them. In this day and age of love against all odds these guys were no heroes. They had their ""love"" whilst others they involved themselves with were dragged in. Is this a message we need to see on screens today. OK so they could not be ""out"". I get that. Did they then need to get married. OK maybe, but then lie in those relationships??

Pity and Fear,"Okay, sorry, but here's another one of those reviews that start: ""I've never been moved to comment on a movie before like this, but...""Folks, there's a social phenomenon going on here, plain and simple. Just about everybody with an open mind who sees this movie seems to get swept right away by it. Read the previous user reviews - a sense of grief, sleepless nights, lines of dialogue popping unexpectedly into the mind, the desire to revisit the movie again and again - and make no mistake: this movie has become an instant classic, and we're privileged to be bobbing up and down in the wake as it spreads across the world.Brokeback Mountain is going last for a long time. In 50 years, writers will be hunting down the last surviving members of the cast and crew in an effort to squeeze some new detail out of them to add to all the other books that will have been written about it by then, and those of us still alive will be thinking, ""I saw it when it first came out and, boy, it really messed me up for a while.""Different people have different ideas about this movie. That's how it should be. Great art is always ambiguous. People have been arguing for 400 years about why Hamlet procrastinated or about what the smile on the Mona Lisa's face really means. The funny thing about great art is, all the different interpretations put up against it seem to work pretty well, no matter how different they seem to be from our own view.Brokeback Mountain is full of this ambiguity, and that's why it has affected so many of us, so much. No matter who we are, we've all felt some of Jack's hurt and Ennis's pain some time in our lives - and if we haven't yet, we know that one day we probably will.In that great last scene, we are confronted with our most profound fear: that no matter how secure and good life feels right now, one day we may find ourselves totally alone and crippled by regret. You don't think so? Well, just wait until you lose someone you care about and you suddenly realise that no matter what you do, it's just too damn late now to tell that person how much they meant to you.""Jack, I swear...""Swear what, Ennis? That you didn't know how much he loved you? But you did. That you didn't mean it when you said, ""It's because of you I'm like this."" But you did. That if Jack were still alive, you'd stay with him forever and to hell with other people? Friend, it's just too late for that.To see Ennis in his cruddy little trailer, devoid of hope and certain of only one thing - that the one person who ever loved him with passion is gone forever without knowing he was loved in return - well, it practically broke my heart. Yours too, I guess; that's why you're reading all these reviews. Sure, when it happens to us maybe, like Ennis, we can bury our face in some tangible piece of the past, like an old shirt, but we know eventually even that will lose its potency, and then we'll have nothing left but memories.There are other movies that have dealt with rejected love and appalling loss, but surely few that have touched peoples' hearts with such power. The irony of it is that Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal seemed to be pretty average actors up until now. Who would have thought they had this in them? Same for all the costars. There's only one possibility - whether they realised it or not, they were all lifted and inspired by this story, just as we all were, and this impelled them to reach into their souls and produce the performance of a lifetime. Who knows, maybe none of them will ever be this good again - but then again, they don't really need to be, do they? Producing one masterpiece is enough for any life. Take a bow, all of you who were involved in making this fine, cathartic film. You did well.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not Only the Best of the Year, but the Best of All-Time","I recently had the immense pleasure of viewing Brokeback Mountain; I had very high expectations and I was completely blown away.This film is as close to perfection as movies can get. The acting, directing, and multi-layered, beautiful story are top-notch.Starting with the acting, the performances are all fantastic. Heath Ledger completely ditches his image as a teen heartthrob with this mature, complex role. His voice pattern is notably different, as he has achieved a consistent tone of voice for his character, Ennis Del Mar. Ledger deserves the Oscar, at least in my book. Emotionally, there is not a false note in his performance. Jake Gyllenhaal is equally incredible in his part; he plays his character, Jack Twist (or ""Jack Nasty""), so very, very well. One of the most beautiful aspects of the two leading males' performances is how beautiful and realistic they make their love for each other seem. If you pay attention to the way they look at each other, how they place their hands, or the ways they react to each other, you'll see how wonderful and romantic their love story is. The two leads, who give AMAZING and heartbreaking performances, have genuine chemistry. I also loved how the writers spend time allowing you to get to know Jack and Ennis and feel for their relationship, and before their first sexual encounter, their true friendship.As for the supporting performances, all are above-average -- to say the very least. Michelle Williams plays Alma Del Mar with stunning grace; she reaches emotional heights you wouldn't expect from a former Dawson's Creek star. She also provides one of the films many memorable lines -- ""Jack Nasty."" Anne Hathaway also does great things with her part. Her performance is very subtle and she's wonderful in her part as Lureen. The attention-to-detail that is paid to her character is remarkable and makes for another reason why I deeply adore this movie. Ang Lee, as director, easily deserves the Best Director Oscar this year. I commend Ang Lee and the writers for making this movie honest and real; they did not tone down any of the gay themes. They didn't try to sell it to a PG-13 audience (thank God). They've made this film with breaking grounds and if you cannot handle it, then this is not the movie for you. I am very pleased with the representation of the characters; they are beautifully-written, wholly-developed, and are presented authentically. Lee brings this incredibly heartbreaking story to vivid life in such a powerful way. Watching this movie, I felt like I knew the characters, like this was a true story and the events happen to people I know -- *that* is how incredible his work is. A joyous bonus is the gritty and breathtaking cinematography. The look of this film is almost as beautiful as the emotion at it's core -- and that says a hell of a lot for cinematographer Rodriego Prieto.Another excellent technical aspect, aside from the fine editing, is the musical score. The score, like Ang Lee's direction, excellently echoes the tone and feel of Annie Proulx's desolate and beautifully-written story. Gustavo Santaolalla composes a wonderful, haunting, and brilliant score that is used effectively and flawlessly in the film. His heartbreaking score, ""The Wings,"" is as fine as music gets. The spare stylings to the score fits very well with the film.This story has stayed with me for days. You've probably heard people say this movie is ""haunting"" by now, and they are absolutely correct. Never has a dramatic film so deeply touched me, or lingered in my head for this long of a time. This movie has repeatedly moved me tears -- AFTER I've seen the movie!Because this movie is such a powerful tearjerker, I've been depressed for days; remembering the stunning events in this movie is like remembering the spirit of a deceased loved one. Brokeback Mountain got me good. Somewhere, deep inside, the pain will always be there.Brokeback Mountain is a flawless, unforgettable film with many layers. The characters are unforgettable and life-like. The nuances and metaphors in this film are incredible and thought-provoking.

Simply one of the most touching and beautifully rendered films I have ever seen.....,"little further comment needed... other than a thank you for the commitment and bravery of the cast and director in delivering this amazing film. Both male leads are superb.... its a shame that Heath Ledger has such competition for Lead Actor from so many others (eg Hoffman in Capote) as in other years he would have walked the awards for his part. Jake Gyllenhall I am delighted to say has already won the UK award for Best Support... and the film has won well over here. Please let it succeed also in the Oscars... it is such a poetic and measured piece of celluloid.. so tender, so meaningful, so important and it deserves as wide an audience as possible.

"Definitely not what you'd expect from a ""gay cowboy movie"".","Last night I saw the movie Brokeback Mountain. I have so much to say about this movie, that I don't even know where to start. It is seriously one of the best movies I've seen in a theater in the past year.I'll start with the cinematography. It was fitting, and never distracted from the story. The beginning shots are long and drawn out, the pacing is slow. But it makes sense. The movie starts in the 60s in the west. Cowboy life is slow, and so are the shots. The dialog is minimalistic. The scenery is amazing. It is just shot after shot of beautiful mountains, forests, and sunrises. It doesn't distract from the performances though... which, by the way were nothing short of amazing.While the movie tends to be subtle and slow in the beginning, bluntness takes over. Jack Twist (Jake Gylenhaal) and Ennis Delmar (Heath Ledger) are assigned to herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain and fall in love and furiously attack each other in a tent. Yeah, one strange way to get it on... All of this is sudden. And the audience is taken by surprise ( although everyone knew the plot before watching the film). The people in my showing were very verbal and would laugh when surprised and yell and such.While watching, you constantly want the two to tell each other they love each other. But it never happens. Their relationship is strictly for Brokeback Mountain, and they insist on keeping it that way. ""I ain't queer,"" Ennis says from the side of his mouth. When the summer ends, they have to go on with their lives. They both know that they have to, they would never be accepted. Ennis even brakes down at one point, and punches a wall.They both get married and have kids. They decide to go on fishing trips biannually, and although you know it's wrong that they're cheating on their wives, you are relieved once you hear a few strums of a guitar: the leitmotif of their relationship. They are happy together, and often talk of what they want to come of their relationship and reminisce of their first summer at Brokeback Mountain.I won't reveal the rest of the movie. But I will say that this movie was harsh at points. This is good though, because it strips the movie of any cinematic flourishes. What you are left with is a rough, real story. And in the end it leaves you with a feeling that doesn't leave you for a while.Happy endings are for fairy tales.",,Anonymous,Romance
Elegant; Beautiful; Important; Did Not Move Me,"I expected a lot from ""Brokeback Mountain."" Pre-release buzz has been overwhelming, and overwhelmingly positive. Ang Lee is a favorite.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a beautiful, elegant, important movie. The performances are first rate. Randy Quaid, Roberta Maxwell, and Grahm Beckel are particularly brilliant in small roles. ""Brokeback Mountain,"" as a whole, just didn't move me.I know that professional and amateur reviewers have emphasized how moving and ""haunting"" this film is. I know there are often audible sobs in theaters.I thought it was a beautiful, intelligent, very, very classy movie.But it didn't move me. I've seen a lot of stupider, less beautiful, less classy movies that reduced me to tears.My specific problem was: why are these two people so much in love? We've all had attractions like that. You're in your twenties, you're in the middle of nowhere, the person next to you becomes the be all and end all of existence ... but, still to be hankering after that person twenty years later, with no one else taking their place? That hasn't happened to me, or, afaik, to anyone I know.The one moment of high emotion for me in the movie was when Jack's mom shows a kindness to Ennis that involves a piece of clothing ...those who've seen the movie know what i'm talking about.But the love between Ennis and Jack is the fulcrum of the movie. If that doesn't convince and compel the viewer, you're left looking at two hours plus of sheep, mountains, and horses.It's not Gyllenhaal's or Ledger's fault. They are both beyond reproach. I just wish director Ang Lee or scriptwriter Larry McMurtry had created some scenes that would communicate more clearly, and more devastatingly, the depth and complexity of this human bond.I can think of numerous movies that depicted bonds between males that convinced me more thoroughly than ""Brokeback Mountain"" did that the two males on screen, if separated, would be deeply wounded by that separation.Some, like ""Bent,"" depicted gay male couples; many, from the Robert Redford-Paul Newman and Walter Mathau-Jack Lemon movies, to Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in ""Good Will Hunting"" and Jay and Silent Bob in their eponymous film -- depict straight male couples.I experienced intellectual admiration for the movie. Its well-conveyed central irony is that the cinematic wide-open spaces of the American West, iconic as the ultimate site of human freedom, becomes little more than an emotional cage for the main characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Well Written and a Must See,"When the subject first came up about this movie, all I kept hearing was ""you honestly want to see a gay cowboy movie?"" Yes, I wanted to see it, but after the preview was shown at another movie, I knew it was something I had to see. I saw the movie with my boyfriend, and I was moved and brought to tears.The honesty of the subject matter was written in a way that was non-offensive and showed the public what real love is all about. Although there were parts I'm sure were offensive to some, to me it was shown in a loving and beautiful way. The bond between the two main characters was so real; it made me want to be a part of it and know exactly how these two lives were changed. And I know they were. They shared something special and ended up as lifelong friends.I would personally recommend this movie to anyone  it will change how you view people and situations that are different from what you are used to. I am very comfortable around gay people, having friends and family that are. And this movie only showed me more of the reason why these people should be able to live their lives to the fullest and in anyway they see fit without the discrimination and hatred that the world has for them.Ang Lee - I congratulate you on an honest portrayal through a beautiful film. Keep the great work and bring more like it. I am now a fan for life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
my brokeback experience,"after months of hype about this movie, i finally saw it.my first impression? the movie was OK. not the ""epic"" love story, it's been made out to be. very quiet, honest movie. there were a bunch of boring scenes, and before you knew it it was over. i guess the lack of emotions and the quiet tone of the film had to be there in order to bring out the realism of the characters and place and time, but i was just like ""is that it?"". just didn't engage me very much. the quiet, accented, mumbled dialogue was frustrating. i couldn't make out half of what they were saying. Especially the last line, i had no idea what ennis said. i had to come on IMDb to find out.speaking of IMDb, that's when i first noticed that this movie has touched a lot of people greatly. was i missing something, i thought? i went over the threads to find out what happened during those ""I can't hear what they're saying scenes"" and found out that there might be some more meaning to this film than i thought. i then read the short story online. pretty good. i noticed that the movie was very faithful to the source material. almost all the dialogue remains the same from word to film. i like the author's writing style. very plain with spare details, but powerful nonetheless. after reading her short story, it really touched me.i went back to the movie again. the words from the short story and the praise from reviews and filmgoers alike kind of made this movie better for me. i still don't think it's that great, but i must agree with everyone that it's very poignant and afterwards, when you think back on it, it brings back thoughts and emotions of loneliness, regret, and quiet despair, which we have all gone through.with all that's said and done, this movie is undoubtedly VERY original and not in a weird, stupid independent movie kind of way. i don't think i've ever seen a movie where the gay characters are taken so seriously and where the focus is on the actual love between the characters. acting-wise, everyone is good. i really like anne hathaway (guess that differs from most other viewers). she had too few scenes. every time she's on screen though, she brings a much needed energy and spunk to the film. even in that phone scene. a nice balance between vulnerabilty, coldness, and compassion.so in conclusion, watch this movie. it's thought-provoking and haunting.PS: like the rest of the music in the film, that willie nelson song in the end is very sad and depressing, but fits the ending to a tee.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best produced in a very long time,"While Brokeback Mountain is a very controversial film (when it first came to Charlotte, it was only at one theater...soon it was at three...now it is showing at all the theaters in this area), it is truly one of the best I've seen in quite some time. The usual run of movies doesn't keep my interest, I leave the theater shaking my head and wondering why I came, or I just think about going and decide it isn't worth my time. This was a WONDERFUL movie...insightful, moving...truly a work of art! I think it portrays real human beings with real emotions...trying very hard to understand those emotions and come to terms with them. If, for just a few minutes, those who have a problem with the homosexual content, could forget that part...just see the raw, human emotions being portrayed...and see the depth of love ...well, I think they just might realize that it is truly a great film!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Heartbreaking, beautiful, vital","The movie or, better said, the ""piece of art"" is able to overcome any stereotype regarding the relationship between two people of the same sex. The construction of the love story through time and life relates to any human being and the way we are born as. It's a heartbreaking moving love story about discovery, passion, denial, rejection, love, hate and loneliness. And most of all, it's a story about dealing with the external barriers others impose and how they affect the way our lives will be. Ultimately, the movie deals with the most deep feelings a human being is capable of, the wonderful sensation of being loved and the staggering feeling of absence of our loved one.

Brokeback Mountain--A True Love Story,Brokeback Mountain to me is one of the most moving love stories of all time. The fact that it focused on homosexual affairs that involved lying and deceit may cause judgmental feelings from the United Statesand the world but the true artist looks beyond the biased opinions and views the score and acting art as a masterpiece. Heath Ledger and JackGyllenhal were perfect for this part. The drama is in this movie is inspiring to the human soul.

Great movie and I don't care if it is about gay cowboys.,"BROKEBACK MOUNTIAN is a great film and even though it has been made fun of by some (even in the film industry) , it is a heartfelt film from start to finish. It tells the story of 2 sheep herders who have an affair that spans over 20 years. They meet at the place they originally met, Brokeback Mountian, and have their dalliance every so often even though they both marry two attractive girls and settle down with children. The story is simple really, but Ang Lee directs with a softness and tenderness that is both poignant and sad. I felt sad for these two that don't seem to connect with anyone;including their wives. Heath Ledger is especially good as Innis. He's got the walk, talk and mannerisms that I would expect a cowboy to have. Jake Gyllenhall is good, too as Innis' ""friend"". The film is not boring or dull but a fascinating character study of lonely people in lonely places that few fear to tread. This was a close second to CRASH of the choices that we had.

I didn't understand why they loved each other. I felt the movie was a slow, long drag. The first half hour of the movie was just ridiculously boring, i found myself actually wanting them to do it haha. The film to me lacked emotion and character development.

A mountain of a masterpiece.,"Hailed as breathtaking and an instant classic, Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain based on the sort story by Annie Proulx, with outstanding performances from lead and supporting actors alike, a spectacular yet haunting screenplay, superb cinematography and a beautiful score, certainly does not disappoint. Few can rise from their seats after enduring the 2 hour 14 minute magic that is Brokeback Mountain with their hearts free from pain and their eyes free from tears. Labelled as 'the gay western' this movie pushes all boundaries. Ennis Del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) the mysterious and reserved ranch hand from Riverton spends the summer working for Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) shepherding on Brokeback Mountain with bubbly Texan rodeo cowboy Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal.) Their friendship and feelings toward each other develop over the summer with one drunken night resulting in sex and the wordless revelation of their love. The relationship remains intimate throughout the duration of the summer until life gets in the way, the summer is over and they go their separate ways, to get married and raise a family, leaving behind Brokeback Mountain and a secret love they once shared.Eventually after 4 years the urge to see the man he loves is too much for Twist who arranges a visit. Upon meeting it is clear the passion they once held for each other has only greatened during their parting. However due to a haunting childhood memory and a strict code of masculinity to which he feels he must conform, Ennis Del Mar is not prepared to leave his wife to be with him one true love Jack Twist. Heath Ledgers' portrayal of Del Mar is breathtaking. This demanding complex role is pulled off with consummate expertise. 'Gay cowboys' would be easy to camp up yet Twist and Del Mar are not the stereotypical feminine gay characters you see in Hollywood, but are like real cowboys; as masculine as they get. Having to portray masculine yet gay cowboys, of a time when homosexuality was thought of as a mental illness, demands outstanding skill yet Gyllenhaal and Ledger are flawless. The women of Brokeback Alma Del Mar and Laureen Twist were also performed with remarkable talent, by up and coming young stars Anne Hathaway (The Princess Diaries) and Michelle Williams (Dawsons creek.) All round acting was spectacular. Also spectacular was the cinematography, this movie is simply a casket of beautiful shots, strewn together with beautiful backing music. Twice I noticed the lighting was a little dark but overall it was superb. Makeup and costume departments alike also went all out. Although spanning over 20 years on screen but covering considerably less in real life they managed to turn 4 youthful beautiful stars gradually into the old (and slightly less attractive) you see by the end of the film. Although fantastic this film does have one major fault. It is too fantastic, too heartrending, too moving. Never before have I been to a film and not been able to get the story out of my mind for days after the screen goes black. It is haunting. Though I could not personally relate to any of the characters being neither gay or a cowboy or ever having been in a similar situation, I was indescribably moved. This is a beautiful piece of cinema and a break through for gay acceptance. I only wish that homosexuality was accepted in Jack and Ennis' time, but of course then this movie would not have been created. Go see it, however be warned, you will cry, you will have a pain in your heart and your mind will be possessed by Jack and Ennis' story, but you will also have witnessed what in my opinion is the most stunning film in cinema history.Brokeback Mountain: brilliant, beautiful but heartrendingly haunting.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Well-Crafted Gay Propaganda Movie,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is not just the title, but also a character in the movie. The beautiful and lavish shots of nature, trees, animals, water, sky, snow - all these are skilfully employed in the attempt to convey to viewers a sense, that what takes place between the male characters is ""natural"". The tag-line (""Love is a Force of Nature"") underscores the director's intention to persuade us that, not only is gay sex ""natural"", it is also beautiful and loving. In doing this, Ang Lee is almost successful, and will no doubt preach his message mostly with the results he desires, convincing both the already converted and many among the undecided. The dark shadow of gay sexuality barely shows through this film, in a single, rather ritualistic encounter between Jack Twist and a male prostitute in Mexico, and also in the amusing scene where Jack and his wife Lureen meet another Midwestern couple, and the ""husband"" arranges a sexual meeting with Jack on the pretext of going fishing (again - how many women are going to wonder about their husband's fishing expeditions after watching this film?!). Joking aside, the film does do a good job of portraying the deceit which accompanies such empty and unhappy marriages; what it fails to do, however, is to explore the motivations and psychology of the characters in real depth. Jack and Ennis come across as two rather flat and ill-defined personalities who are little more than the director's mouthpieces. They are both sympathetic in many ways, but something's missing. What have they really found in each other? Why is their bond so strong? Ang Lee has directed a film which reinforces current stereotype notions of depathologised homosexuality. If this was a movie about a man and a woman with the same plot and setting, would it get so many awards?",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

I'm straight but still deeply moved by this movie. And I am so sorry that not many people are going to see it.The first part of the movie for me was a nice story, watching two guys having fun their own way, enjoying the time together at a place were they can feel free. At first I didn't understand what was it about Ennis feeling sick after returning from the mountain and letting Jack leave just like that, but after the whole movie, I know exactly what was that and how hard it really was. The second part, after they meet again after four years is a real heart-breaker. The emotions, looks, sadness, guilt, love, pain, it all there. I tried not to get too emotional, and not to cry, but I just couldn't! You have to feel sad, you just have to! And angry of the whole world for being what it is.

A true depiction of forbidden love...,"It's been a while since I saw Brokeback Mountain, but it's emotive content still resonates to this day.To over-analyse this film would do it a disservice, as it is in it's simplicity that the story revels.Although focusing upon the forbidden love of two men (set in the ultra masculine world of cowboys and rodeos), it manages to convey the warmth, devotion and unrequited emotions of essentially a couple who happen to fall in love.Here's lies it's magic; the two leads (played with exceptional restraint by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall) quietly invite the viewer into their relationship, gradually making one feel they are watching an intimate piece of reality.The essence of the story could be transposed to any supposedly socially forbidden coupling (bi-racial, lesbianism, etc) but it's core message is one of sustaining a love that has to be hidden and never explored to it's full potential.Ang Lee (as always) provides a beautiful cinematic back drop to the evolving epic and clearly allowed the actors to freely explore the range of their characters.I could go on but I feel the best way for any potential viewers to embrace the magic of this film is to pick a quiet afternoon, rent the DVD and settle back to enjoy what is truly an exceptional piece of movie making.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

There were lots of efforts to present homosexual topics in the younger film history but none like that. Two cowboys in the near prototypical Western provincial backwater which stands for conservative attitudes and intolerance. The ways in which one can handle this situation may differ and are (perfectly) exemplified by Ennis and Jack.Because this is a very brave and, as I already said, new way to approach the topic ""Brokeback Mountain"" deserves its status as ""The gay Western"" and will go down in (film) history.Film lovers, don't miss it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

There is always something new that I discover, and the final scenes always move me emotionally. Never has a film affected me so viscerally that I simply can't get enough of it. The fact that Oscar snubbed this incredible film by denying it the Best Picture award is far surpassed by the effect this moving film has had on countless thousands of people worldwide who have been similarly affected.

Hmmmmm,"I went really excited at the prospect of seeing this movie. All the reviews were promising and I love to look at heath ledger. I came out faintly disappointed. The film is OK, but quite slow. The relationship between the two cowboys happens quite quickly and there is no evidence of any sexual tension prior to their first coupling. I think that if this film was not about two men falling in love and their lives etc, then no one would pay any attention to it. I just expected more to the story. The movie is based on a short story and that is quite evident as few of the ""where something actually happens"" (quite rare) scenes are ever played out to their full extent and could certainly be expanded on. To make room for this, scenes of heath ledger barely talking and Jake gyllenhall pouting could be trimmed dramatically (quite frequent).",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Is praise for this film a result of political correctness?!?,"My lover and I watched this movie in anticipation and at the end asked one another what the fuss was about. Oscar contender! The only reason we could see for the praise for this film was that Americans thought it a cutting edge movie involving gays. Hey, Europeans have been making such movies, and far better ones for decades - it's only that the USA is so homophobic that this is making any noise now. Even much better American films dealing with gay and mixed sexuality have been made during the past five years. It was filmed well, and had some nice touches, but was ultimately BORING. I think I must add that Ang Lee seems to be a critic's favourite at the moment for I also thought that 'Crouching Dragon' was again completely overrated.

A long-awaited masterpiece...,"Wow. That's pretty much all I can say after having seen this film two times within a fortnight! 'Brokeback Mountain' - starring Jake Gyllenhall as Jack, and Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar - openly explores the concept of gay love in the early 1960's. Throughout the film, we follow Jack and Ennis as they try to deal with their families, their separate lives, and their ongoing attraction for each other.When I first saw this film, the thing that grabbed me the most was its individuality. The actors, and the characters they portray are just.. incredible. The storyline is modern and the popularity of the movie proves that homosexuality is becoming more accepted within our society.As a lesbian myself, I attended the movie expecting to see only those who found the ""gay"" life to be of interest to them.. Instead, I saw the elderly, people of different ethnic backgrounds, and many others. In this way, 'Brokeback Mountain' has achieved something that no other gay film that I am aware of has achieved - it has allowed for those of an older generation to see the concept of sexuality from a more modern point-of-view - hence, helping them to understand it better. Yes, the film has had its controversy - but it's achieved, and will continue to achieve some great things.Overall, I give this film a 10/10 for its individual outlook, its openness on a controversial issue, and, from my own personal perspective, the inclusion of Anne Hathaway in the film - she tends to perform the best of them all!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brokeback Mountain 'broke' my heart!,"Today I saw this absolutely magnificent film and I am still weeping! I can't recall a time when I felt so moved and emotional after watching this classic love story. I could not stop crying at the end of the film. My heart is still aching and feeling so sad. The film is brilliant! The scenery is breathtakingly beautiful! Having travelled across Canada by car several times, I've seen the Rockies; I've been in Alberta numerous times but never have I seen this area of Canada illustrated in a film so incredibly stunning. The film is a masterpiece! Heath Ledger's performance was superb! At the end of the movie Willie Nelson performed especially for the film singing 'He Was a Friend Of Mine', (originally by Bob Dylan). The song is both poignant and lyrical, it could almost have been written with the film in mind. Go see this movie......and take lots of Kleenex! I didn't have enough tissues to dry my tears.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awesome Movie,"This movie was SO good! I saw it for the first time this week, and I went back to see it again I liked it so much. It really touched me at heart and it just sucks you into every thought and emotion through out the whole movie. I am a country girl, and I love the setting, beautiful Wyoming, with all the horses and open fields. It is a realistic movie and I love the story line. Even with such a sad ending, the movie just really made me happy. Even the music was good, the actors, Heath Ledger and Jack Gyllenhaal amazing job, and good looking! There wasn't a moment I got bored...I am definitely buying this one the day it comes out! It was awesome and I would recommend it to anyone, anytime.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Broke my heart!,"When I read the short story many years ago, it completely broke my heart and so I was tremendously excited to hear that Ang Lee had made a film. I hoped desperately that they would do the story justice and I was overjoyed to discover they excelled themselves in the translation from book to film.I don't believe I have ever seen two actors get the sexual tension, love and chemistry as completely as Heath and Jake and this includes male/female on screen couples. The label of 'gay cowboy movie' is absolutely outrageous as this film is about all consuming love between two people which is so confused and pure and doesn't deserve to be compartmentalised in that way.I am delighted to say it completely broke my heart again. Congratulations on a wonderful film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Just Gay Cowboys..a Laughing Audience too.,"Although that is, of course, what's got all the attention, this is very much more than a story about two gay cowboys. This is a story about unfulfilled and frustrated lives in general. And it's also quite a stark appraisal of hidden rural poverty, because if there's one thing most of the characters apparently share in this look at 1960s Wyoming, it's lives defined largely by their poverty, in contrast to the much more affluent Texan characters. It's a tragic story, beautifully filmed, perfectly scripted and wonderfully acted with a good soundtrack. Heath Ledger (Ennis Del Mar) gives a terrific performance as a gruff guy living a life of constant frustration and suppressed anger and passion, torn between what he wants to do and what society expects. I can forgive him the mumbling, which meant a few of the words were lost, because somehow you still knew what he was saying. Jake Gyllenhaal (Jack Twist) is equally good in a slightly smaller role, and the supporting cast members are all perfect. I loved this movie, and everything that can possibly be said about it has already been said on this web site and at many other sources, so what I'd really like to assess is the rather strange reaction of the audience with whom I shared the viewing experience.I saw this movie in an art house cinema in an ultra liberal, west coast, university town, amongst a largely young audience, many of whom I suspect were local students. The show was sold out. This was an audience ready and primed to embrace everything this movie stood for. At one of the most tragic parts of the movie, when Ennis Del Mar's young, unsuspecting, wife first discovers that her husband is attracted to other men, (she sees him furtively kissing Jack), a large proportion of the audience burst out laughing. I sat in utter astonishment as the kids around me chortled and guffawed, apparently thoroughly entertained at the idea that this poor woman's life was falling apart. It could have been a sitcom, judging by their reaction, with wifey saying ""Oh gosh! Silly me! Fancy me not realizing dear ol' Ennis is gay!"" As we watched this woman's confusion and distress unfold on screen, they laughed! Many times. In truly inappropriate places. As she checked out his unused fishing gear, to see if her worst fears were confirmed, as she eventually confronted him, they laughed.I've puzzled about this reaction ever since. Have we really come so far in 40 years that kids can't imagine a world in which homosexuality was not just dangerous but illegal, and now they think it's some kind of joke that many people hid it within marriage? And if we have come that far, is it a good thing or a bad thing? Have they really no idea how horribly innocent women were back then (my mother's generation  I remember it well)? Are their senses so dulled by the over stimulation of modern life that they have lost the ability to empathize with other people's personal pain and tragedy, even when it's so well presented to them? I was astonished by the laughter, and a little disturbed. Fortunately, as the movie progressed, they ""got it"", finally seeming to appreciate that this was indeed a tragedy, of Shakespearean proportions, not a fall-about comedy. They were silent by the end, and, I hope, moved.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Stunning and Devastating - yes, but what is this film actually about?","**SPOILER WARNING**While I suppose I can see the critical acclaim (especially here in Britain where the film has offered people a re-assuring alternative to the alarming legislative agenda of the Christian Right in America), I can't honestly say that I enjoyed ""Brokeback Mountain."" It came across as a lavishly filmed, two-hour public service announcement about the twin dangers of homophobic violence and repressed sexuality (and the relationship between the two) in the red States.But the real problem with this film lies elsewhere, and I am surprised that no one has pointed it out. This isn't actually a love story. It is a period piece, but one that uses a mental model of male homosexuality that was current in, maybe, 1964. Ennis and Jack aren't presented so much as characters as psycho-pathologies: two emotionally crippled teen-aged boys. What little we learn about their background turns on their relationships with their respective fathers: for Jack, it's a story of rejection and disapproval; for Ennis, one of devastating loss. As Ennis admits, he hasn't spoken more than 10 words in the past year. What they discover, together, that summer at Brokeback Mountain, is the ability to feel. It's touching, for certain. After a frantic tumble, they start to thaw out. But they're also (understandably) confused and overwhelmed by their emotions and have no way to understand them. So for the next twenty years, they keep re-enacting the same primal scene on Brokeback Mountain. The NYTimes reviewer recalls Proulx's prose to make a somewhat different point: ""What Jack remembered and craved in a way he could neither help nor understand was the time that distant summer on Brokeback when Ennis had come up behind him and pulled him close, the silent embrace satisfying some shared and sexless hunger.""And that's the problem. The central tragedy of the film isn't so much love denied as life denied. For various reasons (framed mostly as societal, but also Ennis' own traumatic childhood encounter with homophobic violence), they don't have an opportunity to find out if they really do want to spend their lives together. No surprise then that the first summer has the hold it does over their lives. But this isn't adult male homosexuality. And I am not sure it helps the gay rights movement to have people thinking it is.This presentation of male homosexuality as a sanitized, hermetically-sealed adolescent experimentation is probably why - quite contrary to the predictions of Conservative pundits - people in places like Texas, Montana, Colorado and Wyoming are running off to see it. The story is sad, but it's not challenging. I suppose if it convinces a handful of people to discourage their neighbors and teenage sons from taking tire irons to other people's skulls, then it's probably not the worst film of 2005 by any stretch. It's just not half as thoughtful as it pretends, or all that penetrating.The film loyally preserves the narrative voice of a character whose fragile emotional stability rests on a determined lack of self-understanding. Heath Ledger did a good job of conveying the emotional desolation. That part, at least, is compelling, and I hope he gets an Oscar for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
So excellent... so moving...,"Brokeback was the single most beautiful film I've seen since the note book. It was so moving, and unpredictable.... if you haven't seen it then see it, especially boys you should all take note.... it shows you how love is meant to be.... Some of the love scenes were a little too detailed, but there was only one and it showed how much they were in love and wanted to be together... so can be excused! Heath Ledger was also amazing in it. Its so different to all his other roles, it really shows how good of an actor he is, and Jake was really really the most brilliant and handsom thing ever!

Disappointed,"I cannot begin, to express how disappointed i was by this movie, it was so fake and forced that i was truly disgusted. Every single minute was another forced emotional sentimental act, it was like, look America gays have feelings too. AHHH!!! it was horrible, lets not forget the fact that ever damn time one of them would ride off, the other one would stand there for a good few minutes awing and gaze lovingly at the other partner riding off in the distance.. it made me want to vomit. It was so forced everything, every second of this movie was so incredible painful to watch. the plot was this... being gay, and a cowboy, and hmmm that's it!!!! Oh and being scared of getting caught. this was all to fake and forced for me to handle, i was truly expecting a thicker plot... that was obviously not given at all!!! p.s i'm not homophobic.. my best friend is gay... he was also disappointed by the plot line.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
People really watching the movie?,"I think Brokeback Mountain is one of the best movies I've seen. I noticed a lot of people are voting this movie bad.. From my own experience in watching the movie, I noticed a LOT of people laughing at some of the most emotional parts.. I believe the people who voted it so bad were not really watching the movie.. As for myself I got into the characters and felt their pain and the pain of the others around them. I believe some people go to the movies and don't pay attention to whats going on.. they would rather laugh to their friends or make comments. These are the people voting it so bad.. but this isn't fair to the movie. If you didn't watch the movie honestly and didn't take something deeper from it, then you have no business rating it! This movie takes a lot of understanding. Remember this is NOT your average love story that involves a man and women so don't compare it to that!!!.. This is why it is so important to WATCH the movie and get into the characters.. if you do, you might just learn a thing or two about others hardships and how hard it is being homosexual and have a little respect for others being deferents.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing achievement for Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal,"This movie was absolutely unbelievable. I have never had a film stay with me for so long afterwards. I hear the music from the soundtrack and score and I can feel the emotions of the movie in the music. The unaffected true love story of these men is astonishing and passionate. As you walk in the first time to watch this film, you hear everything from ""the gay cowboy movie"" to much much worse comments. And honestly, in the first love scene, I knew I was watching two men. But as the movie went on, and I have mentioned this fact to many colleagues and friends, you forget that this is supposed to be forbidden or wrong according to society. All you see is love in it's absolute truest form and nothing can escape that fact.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Devastatingly beautiful love story,"It's been a long time since a film has affected me in this way. It was so beautifully told and so heartbreakingly sad. Love is love and it is truly a force of nature. These two boys (when they met) had no clue that this meeting would change their lives forever. They grew into men and ""accepted"" their lives (at least Ennis did) as for what it HAD to be not what it COULD/SHOULD have been. They knew no better than what life had handed them and never thought of taking each other and making a run as far away from Wyoming as they possibly could. I found it more a love story than anything else. Truly a work of art on the scenery and the direction of these two wonderful actors.

Manufactured Emotion and an unrealistic tale,"I read comments on this IMDb, most with 10 out of 10 rating. Therefore my expectation was high, but I came out with an annoyed and disappointed feeling.The characters are very likable but the story is very weak. The love between these two main characters is idealized, in my opinion. First of all, such love cannot survive over 20 years. In the movie they are still deeply in love with each other. While such love is plausible but it is simply not real. With 50% divorce rate in this country in mind, and as someone who has been through such process, I see how love can change over time, drowned by daily mundane tasks and familiarity between two people. It is a miracle that a romantic love can survive 10 years, not to say 20 years. In the movie, the two main characters maintain their love through secretive meetings once a while. Such love may be able to survive because it contains no daily context, and no struggling through life through shared effort together.I do like the music and cinematography very much. Every shot is very powerful. However, the writing and story is so weak that a skilled director cannot save it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautiful, deeply moving, well written and acted.","Well I finally got to make my own mind up, I really didn't expect to be impressed, I've seen plenty of other films that have been praised by the critics and been unimpressed by them (21 grams, anyone?) This film really is EXTRAORDINARY, and the oddest thing is I can't really say why. Although all the parts that make up the film, the script, scenery, acting, soundtrack etc are all excellent, somehow they fit together to make a film far greater than you would expect.By the time the film finished, I felt like I had been hit by a sledgehammer, I couldn't even think straight (no pun intended). I'm considering going again, but actually I don't know if I dare. Crazy reaction, its only a film! Don't let the ""Gay Cowboy"" tag put you off, this film is about far more than that simplistic view.

Nothing happens,"I'm not sure that there's much in this movie for the average straight guy. However, other demographics (including straight women) will enjoy it since it is, at heart, a simple love story. And ""simple"" is the operative word. The storyline is basic. Nothing happens. It plods along at a majestic pace with a brooding atmosphere - and nothing.Some people have said that the gay aspect of this movie is incidental - that it a love story between two people. But this film would have sunk without trace had it been about a man and a woman.The storyline is the problem. Great movies (""Shawshank Redemption"", ""American Beauty"" and Ang Lee's own ""The Ice Storm"") have great stories to tell. This one doesn't. Unless the fact that there are gay cowboys comes as news to you.But I don't want to be too critical of this movie. I enjoyed it. It's visually beautiful. The acting (especially by the two leads) is fantastic and the direction flawless.

What's love got to do with it?,"In the meantime I have become really cautious to view any movie which has been hyped a lot.Nearly every time I regret having spend the money and time.Unfortunately I do like movies and the pickings got so slim. So I decided to see Brokeback Mountain, despite that the reviews made me suspicious.I love Canada. The scenery shots were worth the admission price. No regrets there.I am female without homosexual love experiences. I could relate to the sex scenes in-between the two men, I could not relate to the fact that they were supposed to love each other. It is easy to keep up sexual tension if you meet only from time to time in a recreational atmosphere. It has nothing to do with a love which has to survive the daily grind.The story told in this movie(I have not read the book) is not a love story, the story told is about a love affair drawn out over twenty years, hurting a lot of people on the way. In many of the reviews I read a regret. A regret of not having had the courage to live a love. But if these two would have lived their love consequently, the story would probably have been even more depressing.I left the theater a little bit frustrated. Frustrated because I had not seen the moving love story I expected, but an all too familiar tale of human shortcomings, well portrayed.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Heartbreaks of Brokeback,"The film about two young cowhands who are hired to herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain by a sheep rancher played by Randy Quaid. They find solace in each other to cope with the harsh weather conditions by turning to a mutual love, which in time becomes mild affection, then unbridled sex. Only the Canadian connections of Focus Pictures could have pulled off a spectacle like ""Brokeback Mountain"".One of the more powerful scenes is when Jack stands up and orders his domineering pappy-in-law to turn off a TV football game at Christmas dinner! In the Dallas theatre where I saw the film, the audience actually applauded this scene for one of two reasons! Either because Jack told the ol' boy off, or the more likely reason: The switching off of a 1970s CFL Grey Cup game between the Edmonton Eskimos and Montreal Alouettes! (Canuck football on Texas TV? What's a Buckaroo to do?)The cowboy lovers keep each other going through some hellish personal circumstances and at great risk to their social well-being. The depressing plot is saved by some spectacular photography and some terrific acting. At the time of writing, this was considered a strong Oscar contender.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
We do exist!,"It took a while before I was able to see this movie as I live in a remote area in Australia and I only go to the city once a year. Apart from what I thought was great acting by all of the characters, the film really hit the spot with me because finally there is a film which portrays homosexual men who live in the bush. It's a good feeling to be acknowledged! I never got married myself, but during my life I have 'lost' a few partners who I loved very deeply. Just like Ennis the prospect of them being found out was just too overwhelming and they got married. One of my friends committed suicide because he was unable to cope with the denigration of being a known homosexual within a bigoted community.The cinemas in the town nearest to me refused to screen Brokeback Mountain, I suppose they just didn't want to accept the fact that yes there are gay cowboys hidden amongst us.So I'd like to thank everyone who was involved in getting that story out into the mainstream, it's going to make it just a little easier for the thousands of rural and outback men like myself to accept and feel proud to be who we are.

Breaking 1963 Societal Taboos On Brokeback Mountain,"Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are two down-on-their-luck cowpokes looking for a summer job as they silently meet outside a dusty ranch trailer in 1963 Wyoming. Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid), ranch boss, gives them the duty of moving a herd of sheep up to a spot called Brokeback Mountain where they'll wile away the hours protecting the flock from predators and allowing them to graze. Their lives are pretty boring and tough, each having to cook, keep an eye on the sheep, and suffer their daily routines. Until one night ...Ennis comes down from the mountain and is too drunk to go back up, so falls asleep outside Jack's tent. Ennis' shivering awakens Jack and he tells Ennis to get inside the tent before he freezes. It is here that something extraordinary and frightening happens: they have sex. It isn't the soft, touchy-feelie kind either. It's rough and earnest, as though they had hidden something deep down inside each of them that finally was allowed out for some air. But their activities don't go unnoticed ...Their boss, Joe Aguirre, catches sight of the two of them ""wrestling"" and decides to pull them off the mountain. Their summer is cut short and as they part ways, Ennis and Jack are awkward and hesitant. Jack drives away and Ennis walks down the street, watching Jack's truck vanish down the road. And as this happens, Ennis suddenly become overwhelmed and crumples to the ground, acting as if a part of him has been ripped out.Jack and Ennis won't meet up for another four years, during which time they both become married, have children, and develop a semblance of societal normalcy. But when they do finally meet up, they run into each others arms and are immediately back on Brokeback Mountain.But can their relationship survive in a time when ""alternate lifestyles"" were taboo? Can Ennis give as much as Jack wants (Jack continually asks Ennis to move with him to a quiet cabin spot and help with a herd of their own, but Ennis can't break away from what his family and society expects of him)?Ang Lee (HULK, 2003) delivers his best film to date. The panoramic shots of the mountains were awe-inspiring, and the period vehicles, saddles, and other props were excellent.Much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance, and I must say that I was highly impressed with his excellent portrayal of a quiet cowboy in conflict with himself and the world around him.Jake Gyllenhaal does a fine job, too, as the more earnest love interest, wanting more and more each time they meet up.The only issues I had with the film were its pacing and the ""love"" the two feel for each other that some other reviewers have so adamantly pointed out. The pacing was very slow, like the lives of these two men, so if you're expecting a bang-bang (no pun intended) action, don't get your hopes up. But if you don't mind a very leisurely pace (I'd say it's about on par with the film SIDEWAYS, so if you didn't like that film's pace, stay away from this one), you'll probably love it to pieces.The ""love"" should've been ratcheted up a notch. The scenes took on a sense of paramours meeting rather than two people truly in love.But the upside of the movie can't be denied. It touches on relationships in a way that most films can't get close to, and does so in a dramatic and thought-provoking way. And ogling at the stunning mountain backdrops added that extra bit of flavor, too.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Real love between people,"Admirable director, fantastic scenery, great love story, and excellent actor! I'm waiting for so long time to watch Brokeback Mountain,and it doesn't let me down.

It symbolizes forever in the real life.The film was realistic but the love it represent is ideal. I was thinking may be every single person is longing for this perfect love, but under the real-life pressure not many of them could make it. The whole film is covered by low sentiment and make the audiences feel sad for the lovers all the time, except the bright beautiful mountain scenery is impressive.

I felt every emotion they did, and the whole experience left me in tears (for all the right reasons). I have never left a movie theatre with streaming eyes before, and what's weird about it is I didn't even care, didn't try to hide from it or didn't give twopence if anyone saw me in my helpless state. That's the type of movie this is. Forget the theme for a minute, and just go experience this wonderful, brilliant, stunning, powerful masterpiece. Because that's what it is - a totally moving experience. And one you're not likely to forget in a hurry.

Brokeback Mountain reflected my own life and struggles,"I was so impressed with Brokeback Mountain, it was so refreshing to see a well produced movie with the reality of two men falling in love with each other, yet struggling with society's pressure of forbiddingness. While watching Brokeback, I relived my own life with meeting a person like Jack, changing my way of life, and loosing him the same way. I was so touched by the moments in the movie where no words were said, just the raw emotion of this heart felt passion for someone else. I remember dearly of clinging to a few scraps of my partners clothing for years, saying it was okay to be with this person and share that special time with them, despite him being a man.The horror of Jack's death, was the same of my partner, a victim of a brutal beating that lead to death. A time where you could not show grief in public, but learning to cry alone in some out of the way place, where no one can see you, so you don't have to explain. I was Ennis in my life, I remember the pain of dealing with this emotion for another man. I was in the military and I remember the tragedies and horrors inflicted on people who were suspected of being gay.But to relive my life on screen played by two actors and a director who took the human aspect of this type of love without making it dirty or nasty. I applaud you and your faith in providing and producing a movie that made this cowboy cry. And yes I was so proud to walk out of the movie theater with tears in my eyes.

"Great taboo-buster, good film","A good movie, with a stunning performance by Heath Ledger, but not really deserving of the rave reviews it's been getting. I'm guessing it's been overpraised because it's a ""brave"" film that breaks taboos. About 20 years ago on TV I caught a heterosexual equivalent starring Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn. It was called Same Time, Next Year and was, I think, adapted from a stage play. In any case, it covered much of the same ground, i.e. two lovers take the occasional break together while carrying on a family life with someone else. I should mention that I find Ang Lee's films awfully slow for the most part, and lost the will to live during Ride With The Devil. By comparison, this one's fairly compelling.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gay Cowboys.  What more could you ask for?,"The cinematography in this film is truly mind-blowing. No really, the best I've ever seen; forget LOTR.The acting is great. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall are totally believable as two bisexual cowboys in love. Ledger has gotten a lot of praise for his role as Ennis, and deservedly so, but I think in this Gyllenhall's performance has not received the praise it deserves. If anything, his character is even more believable than Ledgers, but since I've already said they are both totally believable saying that would see me contradicting myself. Oh well, I'll say it anyway. He's great in it, and both of them deserve the Oscar for best actor.The story is just that, a story. If you expect it to be realistic, your expectations are not going to be met (note how I refrained from saying you'd be disappointed). The short story by Annie Proulx, on which the film is based, was a highly praised piece of work when it was first published. The film doesn't stray far from the story and consequently the story of the film is great too. If, however, you're going to be put off this film, or if you don't like it, because of it's theme (love between two people of the same sex), then you do not deserve to see a film as good as this. It made me cry. And I don't cry - not even at funerals.You may have guessed by now that I quite like this film. Well you'd be wrong. I don't like this film...I love it. I love everything about it. It looks great. The acting is great. The characters are great. The story is great. But not everything in this film is great . The accents are so strong, I probably only understood about 50% of what was said....Oh what the hell...the accents are great too! That said, I might be wrong. I think everything was great, but I was so caught up in the whole film, enjoying every single second of it, I might not have watched it objectively. But then again, surely that's a sign of greatness? Yes, I am sure, the film is well and truly...great. (PS> I won't say great again, promise).Maybe I'm over-reacting to this film because I can relate to the story really well. I don't care if I am. This is my favourite movie ever. It's really great.Doh!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Film About Relationships,"I went to see this film out of curiosity more than anything. I knew very little about it other than the usual media tagging of it being that 'gay cowboy film'. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about, was it truly a great film, or was it just getting media attention due to a mass-media perceived controversial subject matter? I was pleasantly surprised.From a cinematic point of view, Ang Lee has done a fantastic job of capturing the beauty and the desperation of parts of rural America. Showing the magnificent natural scenery to great effect and convincingly transporting his audience to the little farming communities and cowboy towns of Wyoming and it surrounding regions. The music is moving and fits perfectly with what you are seeing on the screen. An understated score perfectly adds to the atmosphere and feeling that the story generates. The costumes and sets create a convincing backdrop to the period of the story.Heath Ledger absolutely excels in his role as Ennis, a man of very few words with a lot on his mind. I came away from the film with the idea that Ennis was a man who had extreme difficulty communicating his feelings with others. This is most likely why when he experiences what he does with Jack on Brokeback that summer, he fails to cope with his own feelings, let alone those of the ones around him. Ang Lee has made this film cleverly, he never thrusts an opinion upon his audience about the characters or the decisions they make, he concentrates on analysing their reactions to the events which unfold and the way they deal with them. It is fairly obvious that homosexual relationships met with far more suspicion and disgust in the 1960s than they are in more modern times, especially in more rural areas.This film could have easily been about two men who fell in love in a time when it was not accepted. Brokeback Mountain however, goes much deeper than this. It does not just show Ennis and Jack and victims of the time they lived in, but shows the decisions they made and the impacts it had on their lives. Jack throughout the film comes across as more accepting of his nature, where as Ennis appears to struggle more with it. But as I said before, this film is not just about 'gay cowboys', it is more of a film about relationships. The relationships between two worker who become lovers, the relations ships they both form after their season together, the relationships they would face with society and their relationships with themselves in a less understanding era.Heath Ledger is in outstanding form throughout this film. Playing almost a tortured soul character with many difficult decisions to make about his life and himself. Jake Gyllanhall is also very good, but HEath just steals the show. Playing a man who says very few words, but he manages to convey a volume of emotion through his expression, body language and tone during the limited times he speaks out.Of course most people will think of Brokeback Mountain as that 'gay cowboy' film, but my advice to them is go and see it. In all honesty, this film is about relationships between people, it could have feasibly been made with two sets of families involving a 'straight' affair. The homosexuality of the main characters add more depth to this film, rather than detract from the story and the themes of communication, commitment and human nature.Most people will go and see this film and enjoy it, some more blinkered people will see it and be offended by it, worse still some damn ignorant people will refuse to see it and spout abuse and disgust purely because they are not open minded enough to enjoy a film on its own merits. I recommend you go see Brokeback Mountain, it is an intelligent, poignant, sometimes moving and sometimes sad portrayal of two people trying to find happiness with others and within themselves.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful film wrong story,"I truly wish I could be singing the praises of this film. But it's the wrong film, the wrong message, the promotion of an image that needs to pass from our culture.I've grown weary of the message that because people are different, they are pitiable and must be consigned to a life of tragedy. In mainstream films with gay subject matter, the homosexual in question either winds up dead or crazy,or both. (The Talented Mr. Ripley, American Beauty, the list goes on) This is a beautiful love story, yes. It was a wonderfully written short story I stumbled on several years ago by Annie Proulx, and the screenplay has Larry McMurtry's masterful fingerprints all over it. I've no truck with Proulx, McMurtry, or Osanna. I have no issue with Ang Lee who made a beautiful film. Nor do I have issue with the talented cast who gave us wonderfully crafted performances.My issue is with the pathetic notion that people are less than because they are different, that they must be denied happiness just because of who they love. I've listened to it for almost 50 years and it's not true. Does this kind of story happen? Sure! All the time. Is it the byproduct of a culture afraid of its own sexual shadow? Yes. Is it the byproduct of a culture that would rather let its children see people being blown to bits rather than loving each other? Sadly,yes.Where is the film in which Ennis Del Mar has courage? The film in which Jack and Ennis win? Stop telling people that their sexual orientation determines their worth in this culture from the time they're born. Tell them they are valued regardless of who they are. Show me that! Celebrate that! That I'll sing the praises of. That I'll pay ten bucks to see. All that's been done here is someone has put attractive people in beautiful settings, and promoted an empty myth.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Pretty disappointing movie, all in all...","Ignore all the hype that surrounds this movie. It's been one that produces vastly differing opinions at either end of the scale, but not because of the qualities of the film itself - there's far too much political nonsense wrapped up in the way people are viewing this movie and it should be judged on no more than how efffective it is at portraying the story in question. Too many people seem to have gone into this having already made up their mind that they were going to hate it or that they were going to be mesmerised by it.In truth, it's a fairly ordinary film. If it wasn't about homosexuality it would barely have gotten a mention, but as it is everybody feels the need to show how enlightened they are by writing melodramatic stories about how it's changed their life. That's just another bandwagon for people to jump onto though. In reality, this has a few decent moments, a decent premise and some stunning cinematography; apart from that it's badly put together and ignores far too many details.When I say 'details', I'm talking about the fundamentals, the foundational stuff. For example, the accents start out pretty bad and by the end of the film they're just plain awful. Jake Gyllenhall doesn't know how to ride a horse which - given that he's playing a rodeo rider - is just sloppy directing by Ang Lee. Apart from that though, I thought Gyllenhall was the better of the two main parts. Apart from the accent and the riding he did a very good job with it. Heath Ledger just mumbled a lot.The main problem with this movie is that it was about their struggle to come to terms with what happened up there on Brokeback Mountain - about their inner turmoil over it given their strict, traditional upbringings. With that in mind, they jumped into the sack with each other WAY too easily. It didn't build - it was far too easy a transition for them to go from nothing at all to stroking each other lovingly, and when that's what you're building a film on top of you need to make sure it feels authentic. This just didn't.So overall, some really nice camera-work, some mixed acting, a flimsy plot and a criminal lack of attention to detail adds up to a pretty ordinary movie. I wouldn't bother with it if I were you, but if it's one you want to have an opinion on then then don't expect anything spectacular. The scene with the fireworks is pretty cool though.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
So much more than romance,"Hollywood excels at representing romance, seduction and thrill. But Ang Lee sets himself a higher goal with this movie. Brokeback Mountain is a story of love, simple requited love, but one of the most inspiring and enduring kind. Although the obstacles the lovers meet are important, their love is not really put to the test. It is the ineffectual and fatal way they face these obstacles that the movie tells the story of. Although they love each other with the same irrepressible urge, Ennis and Jack have been affected very differently by the prejudices of their society. Whereas Ennis has an overwhelming sense of duty and makes a habit of keeping his desires under control, Jack cannot deny his impulses. Ennis's sense of responsibility to his community and Jack's way of dealing with grief and loss will work on separating them in a society that pits duty against desire. And Lee is a master at illustrating the manifold ways human beings give rein to their contradictory emotions. While Ennis at times gives way to violent outbursts, Jack quits the game early and surrenders his life to chance. The movie deals with the impossibility of resolving these differences in a society that opposes their love. With the logic simplicity of a tale and visual intelligence, Brokeback Mountain characterizes for example the wives according to their contrasted relationships with their spouses. But the incredible soberness of the ending leaves the viewer with an optimistic sense that love is all powerful despite the violence that so often surrounds it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love!,"The movie is about a cow boys gay couple......so what reaction that would have on people???Funny smile,no reaction.....possibly a very intellectual discussion on how the movie has brought a reformation for thousands of gay & lesbian couples....but truly speaking how many of us will really be comfortable when approached by them or even in there presence? the movie surely makes a scene where we are made to feel what gay's actually feel....like me & you....not superficial love or any mundane comedy where gays are acting like eunuchs..godly dressed but like how harry loved sally...how romeo loved Juliet....how Neo loved Trinity...like i love some guy.Its a love story about people who were in love but because of their love could never be together nor could even think about as they both are married that too during in a wrong period of time.But the scene where Ennis(Heath Ledger) first accepts his love for jack( Jack Gyllenhaal, the passion& wanting for that one person is so real that i get goose bumps.

Beautiful,"This is a powerful beautiful film about love, in whatever form it takes. The acting is all superlative, but the film making itself is what sets this apart.Here is a film maker who is not afraid to take time, to show you images with music, it's not fast paced (that's not to say it's slow) and it loves itself in a good way, if that makes any sense at all.Ang Lee is truly a gifted film maker, he crafts this film from a simple story into a deeply thoughtful and moving testament to love, and a political comment on our world as well.Yes, it features some of the worst wigs seen on film since Everybodys All American, but no matter. It's a beautiful piece of work, and one of the few films that you should actually see on a big screen- it's vast.",,Anonymous,Romance
Good but not great tragic love story,"This the story of two men who fall in love and can't come to terms with the relationship.I'm probably going to be in the minority, but I find this movie to be very over rated. Its not bad, but over produced and so incredibly pretty that this film struck me as being more of a lets pretend than a real life story. Its very artificial in way that makes me think that perhaps the producers and the director didn't truly trust the material to draw people in, so spiced it up. If you tell a story correctly the film will cross boundaries and move people regardless of the subject matter or sexual orientation. This movie never moved me. As I sat there and watched the film I kept wondering what this would have looked like had some one like John Huston or Sam Peckinpah would have done it as a small gritty western ala The Misfits. (Then again nobody would have probably noticed it) Sure to win a good number of Oscars this is not a bad movie, just a very over rated one.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie will be part of you forever,"I avoided seeing this movie when it came out. I thought I would be uncomfortable seeing it with my husband, and I don't like sad movies. Then I ended up on plane where it was being shown. I thought - ah well may as well watch a bit of it while I chew my plastic chicken. That decision changed my life forever.My whole life will be divided into before Brokeback and after Brokeback. It quite literally changed my life. I was rocked to my core. The movie took over my head and my heart and I will never be the same. No movie has ever or will ever impact on me like this.You don't even think about the fact they are men. The love scenes are some of the most beautiful ever.Heath is absolutely brilliant in this but on further viewing Jake Gyllenhaal blows you away. He is the more comfortable with his sexuality of the two but still a rough cowboy.I can't say much more about it because I am still shellshocked, ages after seeing the movie.

Failed to Meet Our Expectations,"With all the hype, I was not anxious to see this movie because I felt I knew what it would be like. As a liberal, I was not offended in any way by the movie. However, I found the movie to be very slow moving and too long, as well as short on entertainment value. I had recently seen Match Point and The Squid and the Whale and found them to be extremely well acted and much more enjoyable.The acting was uniformly good, but I expect that in a high caliber movie. The real plus of the movie is the Director was able to convey extremely well the emotional turmoil that the characters felt. However, there is a lot to endure to reach that end.I hope I don't sit back and see this movie take a lot of awards because it was so hyped by the critics. I haven't seen Munich yet, but of the movies I have seen this year, there are a number that I liked much better, including the aforementioned, and Crash, I Walk the Line, and Hustle and Flow.If you have to see all the movies that will be nominated for best picture, you'll probably have to see this one.

Camera work is good but that's the only thing it has.,"The story line is relying on shock and awe to carry this show, however there is little depth to the characters. I don't know why this has received such great reviews, other than for some strange reason if you object to the film you are dismissed as a homophobe. I simply didn't see a quality movie, the story line was shallow, and did not deserve the acclaim it received. The camera work was good, but little else was worth seeing. With the acclaim and the academy awards it's plain to see that the Hollywood crowd is much more focused on their agenda and political statements than they are on producing quality films. As a movie enthusiast, I am disappointed by this movie, but more so I am appalled by the folks that put poor movies on a pedestal simply because they portray a controversial concept that they might agree with. I suggest you wait until it is available for rent for $1and then spend you dollar on something more worthwhile than this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Things sure do change when you're up on 'Brokeback Mountain'...,"I have to say what really impressed me the most was the scope of it all. I expected it to focus by and large on the immediate aftermath of Jack and Ennis' first coupling, but to my welcome surprise the whole film had a real sweeping, epic quality to it. When the bond that they shared survives such change in their circumstances it made the whole tale that much more evocative. It shows that regardless of your gender or your approach to relationships, love is like a tick that gets under your skin and won't ever stop affecting your mental processes throughout all of your time on earth (and don't I know that that sure is the truth... !!)Helping to emphasize these developments is some gorgeously languid direction by Lee - his camera seeming to caress the landscape he films - and also a wonderfully subtle turn from Ledger, especially. This shows Heath in a different light to any of his other films, and if he can transform himself this well, then maybe he isn't as much of a risk as I thought for Nolan's 'Joker', after all!I don't feel qualified to say whether it was the best picture of its year, but I certainly thought that it was braver and more emotionally genuine than ""Crash"". If you're anybody who's going to give ""Brokeback... "" a shot (and I suggest that everyone does) my advice is not to concentrate on its differences, but to instead take a clearer look at the smaller intimate details that can bring us all closer together if only we choose to let them.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A monumental film with heat-wrenching performances,"I know this is the umpteenth rave review to be posted about BBM, but I feel inexplicably compelled to express my gratitude to Ang Lee for creating such a masterful piece of cinematic brilliance. The film is undeniably one of the most touching and sensitive human portraits I have seen in a long time. The performances are transcendental, heart-wrenching, brilliant. The quiet moments in the film are the most heart-wrenching of all; the love shared between the two characters is expressed with a tenderness and tranquility that leaves viewers anguished by the reality of their situation.

So unbelievably beautiful,"It has never happened to me to watch a film a couple of times and to continue NEEDING (painfully) to watch it again and again. This is how I feel about ""Brokeback mountain"". About this extraordinary and overwhelming film. You'll probably think that I'm exaggerating or overreacting. The truth is that I left my heart and my soul in the Brokeback mountain along with Jack (fuckin) Twist and Ennis Del Mar. I can't change it and I'm not capable of reacting differently. I don't even know how it really happened. Was it the enigmatic atmosphere of the Brokeback mountain, the performance of the two so young but BRILLIANT actors, the words or the moments without words and action, all that was hidden beneath the surface and in which I was slowly and deeply sinking... Let my try to explain the unexplainable. Just a few symbolic words to embody my inspiration. And PLEASE, watch the film.So powerful. So painfully penetrating. So original, strange and provocative. Deeply emotional and unbelievably beautiful. I was mesmerized by the characters performed by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, their love for each other ""put a spell on me"". Their acting was too good to be true. They made me SEE and FEEL the love. Not only the passion or sensuality but the extremely strong and pure emotional (and spiritual) connection between them. And also the great depth and intensity of sorrow and solitude.Forget the trivial and ordinary love stories. This film has nothing in common with them. It has nothing in common with MOST films. You can learn from it about the nature of love in such a strange and profound way, also because of the delicate and specific circumstances. Was it possible not to feel envy of this deep and unexplainable relationship? And not to be swept away by it. To be obsessed and absorbed. By the Brokeback mountain, the melancholy, the fate. So much severity and tenderness. Unpredictable and uncontrollable - the powerful nature of LOVE.I know I probably sound too emotional and dramatic. But it's not easy to explain the unexplainable. It is almost impossible. So, forgetting the words try to feel the divine inspiration. Believe me that these are not just superlatives. There IS something really enormous in this film. That stays with you and is not leaving. It is not just unforgettable, it's unforgivable. That I'm not still in the Brokeback mountain with Jack and Ennis and their love. Back to reality? Well, I refuse to accept it. I still refuse to accept it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Brokeback Mountain -- good, but a tad too long","It seems that after reading the reviews of this movie, that I am the only one, besides my two friends who saw this movie today, who was not blown away by this movie. While the acting was fantastic (Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams in particular) and the cinematography was breathtaking, the movie dragged in places. I do think that the movie is haunting in it's imagery and also in the heartbreaking forbidden love between the two main characters, but should this movie take home a best picture Oscar? I honestly don't think so. I do think that Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams should win awards for their performances --especially Heath Ledger. Locally and nationally, there has been a lot of press regarding the ""Gay Cowboy Movie"" and I want to note that my Luke warm reception of the movie is not based on any homosexual phobias whatsoever. I, and the two friends I saw the movie with, are women in our early 40's who are about as open minded as you can possibly get. We all walked away from this movie with the same ""what's the fuss all about?"" look on our faces. Still, it's a good movie, beautifully shot and acted, but, in my opinion, not worthy of the high praise that it has received.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
don't judge before hand,"I read the short story by Annie Proulx many times before I even knew they were making a movie. But when i found out they were I was extremely excited! I told everyone I knew about it and they said it was disgusting and wrong, especially some of my strong Christian friends. I never let them influence me differently. I stayed a huge supporter of the movie and when I saw it I was blown away. I never thought it could be like that. It is the most incredible, raw, passionate, and heartbreaking story that has ever graced the theaters. When people began labeling it as the 'gay cowboy movie' I became extremely upset! How could people judge it before they had ever even seen it, or even knew what it's about! I defended it until one friend gave in and went out and saw it. When they came back, they cried because they admitted they were wrong, and that they shouldn't have judged it! but still nobody listened. For a while I abandoned the 'campaign' if you will, for Brokeback and began spreading the word to people I knew very well that it was a spectacular movie. When the men I knew heard about it they scoffed and said that it was sick, and any chick who wanted to see it had major issues. I just told then to shove their opinions up their a***, pardon my french. I simply didn't care what they said about it. But in general this movie is the best movie i have seen in my entire life. It gives you a different view on human function, and how people see other people. I say that you should watch the movie and do not judge it before hand.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tender and Heartfelt,"""I wish I knew how to quit you""There are hundreds of romantic features being made in Hollywood every year, but you know what makes one stand out from the crowd? It's the characters, or their chemistry, to be more precise. Yes, the writing needs to be on par, and the story in itself must have some significant things to say, but it's the individuals who make the narrative work.Even if you have a fantastic story, it won't be as effective as it could be without the right chemistry. However, if your protagonists have a great deal of rapport together on screen, even a severely restricted narration might work a treat. And in this case, I suppose the same transpires.While the story has many gaps to fill, both Ledger and Gyllenhaal's honest and committed performances elevated it to the next level. You will be touched by affection just as much as by pain. You will feel their anguish; you will feel their dilemma; and I'm sure you will shed some tears as well!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Do not waste your time.,"From an audience point of view, this movie was not enjoyable.

Just because the story's content was controversial for its' time, does not mean this movie was good by any means. Do not believe the hype, this movie was not well done and should not win any Golden Globes of Oscars.

A very powerful film,"Like Ennis and Jack, Brokeback Mountain got me good. I don't remember a recent film where I forgot the leads were actors playing roles. All of them have major emotional scenes and some have more than one. How often does that occur in a film? Not often. Unlike some of the other reviewers on this site I never checked my watch even once during the several times I saw the film. With advance apologies if I belabor the obvious or inadvertently include ""spoilers"", here's what I think.Though Ennis and Jack are gay this is not the reputed ""gay cowboy"" film that has generated so much hype. Rather its a human story about love, loss, the choices we make, and the choices that are made for us. These dictate our lives, and it doesn't mean that we live happily ever after because of them. This goes for Ennis's and Jack's wives as much as for Ennis and Jack themselves. I drew a parallel between this film and Casablanca. Both films have love, loss, and choice. The difference for me is that in Casablanca the choices that were made felt right. In Brokeback Mountain that's not the case and that's the tragedy. You feel that Ennis and Jack should have been together. Given the 1963 Wyoming time frame it would have been dangerous for them and heartbreaking for their families. Even as things actually turned out there was heartbreak aplenty to go around.A couple of striking things about the film1. Lust vs. Love. What began as lust wound up as love. Initially Jack wanted Ennis more than Ennis wanted Jack. The first tent scene had a good deal of lust in it. The much more important tent scene was the second one,where Ennis took the initiative to come to Jack. I thought it was a marvelous character touch that he came in tentatively, holding his hat between him and Jack as some sort of barrier that Jack has to (and does)remove. That's the beginning of the love story, and it lasts over the years of ""fishing"" trips. And remember that the tender second flashback scene, though it occurs late in the film, chronologically occurred in 1963 and forms part of Jack's acute sense of loss.2. The Ending. Though the circumstances are tragic, I felt that the ""epilogue"" left some room for hope. Ennis's question to his daughter (""This Curt fellow, he loves you?"") indicated he has been able to process his own loss and hold on to the emotion so apparent in the shirt scene. Its even more apparent when he says he will give up his job to attend her wedding--something he was never able to do with Jack, to Jack's desolation. And what exactly did Ennis want to swear to Jack? Leaving this unsaid and up to the viewer was a wonderful ending.3. The Acting. The most expressive eyes and non verbal acting I've seen in a long time. My very favorite (though by no means the most powerful) is Heath Ledger's ""guilty child"" look (complete with gnawing finger) when Ennis tells Jack at the last minute that he can't make August.4. Review comments about the story being and ""old"" one. Yes it is--as old as human nature.5. I did not find Ennis's mumbling to be the problem others did. He's SUPPOSED to be that way--repressed and inarticulate. Its a part of his character and how he grew up.6. My favorite (most moving) scenes: the second tent scene; the meeting after Ennis's divorce; the final meeting between Ennis and Jack; Ennis's phone conversation with Lureen; Ennis's visit to Jack's boyhood home; and finally Ennis's conversation with his daughter and his last words.This film deserves all the awards it has already won and may yet win. It is an incredibly well written, acted, poignant, and heartbreaking film (and I didn't even mention the cinematography, which is awesome). Kudos all around to Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway, and Director Ang Lee. Don't let the ""gay/gay cowboy"" label intimidate. If Monster didn't turn you into a mass murderer, chances are Brokeback Mountain won't make you gay. There's MUCH more to this film than that.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A ""Key Moment"" in Cinematic History","Brokeback Mountain is the most extraordinary, moving and powerful film I have ever seen. I had read the set of Annie Proulx's short stories months before the movie came out so I knew the storyline and was familiar with the characters. Nonetheless, I was not prepared for what awaited me.I will never forget how I felt after viewing BBM for the first time in a cinema last January. I was floored, crushed, speechless. I was in a state of emotional shock. I returned to the theater about 10 days later to see it again and the emotional impact was even stronger. I could not hold back my tears and was sobbing as I was returning home. I was haunted by the images of Ennis, alone in his small run-down trailer, and in Jack's room. These were exceptionally powerful scenes with very few words uttered, if any.I think this is the perfect film: the pace is controlled and reproduces perfectly the feelings of waiting, hoping and longing for two long decades. The treatment is so ""true"", and nothing in this film is artificial or contrived. The actors are just exceptional and give unforgettable performances.Brokeback Mountain simply tells a story. It's neither moralizing nor preachy. It tells a very moving love story and touches our hearts like no other film. I saw this movie 9 months ago and I am still haunted and affected by it. Brokeback Mountain will be with us forever.This landmark film does not fit the typical Hollywood mold and indisputably represents a ""key moment"" in cinematic history.Simply unforgettable!

Very Strong -- Definitely Worth Seeing,"I find it interesting reading the comments regarding this film after having seen it for myself. I can see some people thinking it was more moving or intense than other people, but these ratings of zero or one star with little relevant commentary on the actual content of the film make me think that many of the people posting these low ratings are posting here after never having even seen the film. That is really a cheap shot to come on to a movie site and make negative comments after never even watching a film! Unfortunate to be honest.....Regarding the film itself, I found it to be very unique in its subject matter. The underlying story is very strong, the acting is very credible and very good, the camera work and scenery captured is excellent and the directing is really strong. At first I was going to say that the feelings of the two main characters towards each other was not well enough explained or developed, but after thinking about it I don't think such feelings really can be truly explained in any movie. The looks, glances, expressions and the few words show the feelings a lot more than a ton of dialog or history ever could. Note: this film gets you thinking a lot after you have seen it, at least it did with me. It is very moving in many ways.In conclusion, I was very pleasantly surprised by this film because of its force and because it does not fall into any stereotypes or predictable scenarios. It also covers a subject that is almost never covered in film. Thank you to Ang Lee and the rest of those involved in creating this film! It is one of the best films I have seen in many years. Although I have not fully come down with my final verdict for the long run, as of now I rank it up on my all-time list with The Deerhunter, The Natural and a few others. Really great.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I was silenced, but now must speak out!","After the movie was over, I just wanted to go home and be alone. Heath and Jake silenced me. They pulled at every emotional cord that I have. I left the theater wanting to weep for both characters. Besides the love story, ""Brokeback Mountain"" also showed how close-mindedness affects more than just those who are discriminated. It's arguable that society's pressures to marry and raise families caused just as much grief for the wives in the film as the cowboys themselves. And the setting...breathtaking! Yes! This movie will remain with me forever.I often tell people that a movie isn't worth the price of the ticket. For ""Brokeback Mountain"", however, go buy five tickets! I will definitely go and see this film again before it goes off the silver screen. I'm also hoping to buy the book tonight. I only hope that the pain and sadness I've felt these last two days will wane over time. There was something so beautiful, yet sad and lonely, about the semi-routine ""fishing trips"" that Ennis and Jack take. Unfortunately, for some of us, whether gay or straight, we've lived such romances. Perhaps this is one reason why so many people are so deeply touched by the film.I wish to also thank the cast and crew for finally portraying gay men in a light different from the routine stereotypes that we see. I wonder if Heath and Jake really know what a mark they've left in American cinema. Thanks guys! It meant a lot to me and I'm sure it will mean a lot to anyone who is struggling with their sexuality. God bless the cast and crew of Brokeback Mountain.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Superb,"This movie was somewhat boring during the first half, even though there is beautiful mountain scenery. Maybe if you're gay, you think the interaction between the characters is interesting enough. The movie is about this interaction, and after their first summer together, it follows their relationship is a serious and intelligent manner. Their relationships to their wives is shown in the same manner. The difference between them is also portrayed with detail and sensitivity. Heath Ledger does a superb job in his Gary Cooper-like non-talking cowboy. I did enjoy the movie very much. It was about the development of a romance, but the fact that it showed scenes of them getting together every few years made me think it would have worked better as a long novel (yes, I know it was based on a short story).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just watched it last night.,"After watching this movie I have come to a conclusion. I totally expected this movie to be all homosexual behavior and all this stuff. But to my surprise I was totally taken in by this movie. I spent half of last night just laying in the bed thinking about what it would mean to me to lose a friend like that. Of course I am not that way with my friends but to each his own. My point behind this post is to actually say I think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. And to ask everyone else if this has ever happened to them.I was driving in to work this morning and on my CD player came ""Whiskey Lullaby"" The sad thing is the first thing I thought about was this movie! For some reason the song actually fits in perfect with the movie except that the song was about a girl/guy.What do you think??",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Outstanding acting but not an epic movie,"Any movie that keeps a consistent 8.0 or above score on IMDb must be outstanding, right? I hesitated to see Brokeback Mountain because I'm not into same-sex relationships, but I'd heard the acting was superb and the cinematography beautiful. I wasn't disappointed with either of those 2 aspects of the movie. All of the actors did a fantastic job portraying their characters. And, to my surprise, it was the heterosexual sex scenes that left me wondering why they included what they did (bare breasts on both female actresses-totally unnecessary in this movie) The homosexual scenes were treated with delicacy and discretion in my opinion.The movie made you think and yes, it did make me tear up in 2 spots. Love is love, I guess.I wish things had ended differently and the characters hadn't lived such tortured lives. But that's up to the writer! This movie wasn't a ""life-changer"" or one I ""won't be able to get out of my mind"" as some reviewers felt. It had poignant moments but it wasn't quite ""epic"". I do hope Heath Ledger wins some awards. Jake Gyllenhal deserves recognition too. Brave men to take on these roles.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brokedown Film,"This film was SLOW. The plot was mostly that of two angst-filled men (who were possibly bisexual, possibly gay, possibly mixed), neither of whom got what they wanted.If people think they are going to see ""gay sex"" they should forget it. There are better shots of Anne Hathaway's tits (which are impressive and do not look like the work of aftermarket manufacturing) than anything on the guys.However, if this film had been about a man and a woman, it would have been relegated to the dust bin. It simply doesn't have much to it. It is barely a love story, mostly a tragedy of how two people can fail to get what they might want.Fair at best. The acting is good, but the script is only fair and the pacing is awful.""Far From Heaven"" is a MUCH better movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Best Movie I've Seen in a L-O-N-G Time,"Prior to writing this comment, I read over the 2006 Golden Globe nominees once again. I wanted to be honest with not only myself, but with the people reading this review that Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"" was in fact the best movie of the year. Indeed, I would be lying if I said I preferred any other movie from 2005 more.I love film. I love the art of cinema -- the writing, the acting and the directing. Unfortunately, the Tinsletown bigwigs often produce movies that, more or else, serve the purpose of raking in our dollars and little of our ""sense."" I'm not going to bash any particular movie because I fully understand the hard work from every angle that it takes to make a movie. However, it is rare that such a movie as ""Brokeback Mountain,"" with all it's aesthetic beauty, is made.""Brokeback Mountain"" is just that -- beautiful. Perhaps no other word could describe the film in a panoramic way. From Ang Lee's sharp, point-made directing to Rodrigo Prieto's mouth watering cinematography (most notably the Fourth of July scene) to the dream-like performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, ""Brokeback Mountain"" does what so many films fall short of doing: It captures the heart.It doesn't take but a few of Heath Ledger's emotional grunts and Jake Gyllenhaal's lonely smile to be catapulted full-throttle into what this movie really is: A love story. By the films peak, I was so lost in the love story that I forgot I was watching two callused cowboys fall in love.I did more than watch this movie; I felt it as Ennis del Mar's (Ledger) heart slowly suffocated, as if a boa constrictor were tightly wrapped around it as it painstakingly gasped to beat, as he tried with all his might to dump his love for Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) into a storage bin somewhere far, far away. Ennis wants so badly to confess his love, but his brain and his heart move forward like trains going in opposite directions.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a movie that one sees for his or her love for the cinema, for storytelling. It is fictional, but drives home non-fiction emotion into anyone who watches it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
painful and beautiful all at once...,"The fact that I have signed up to write this review speaks volumes... as much as the fact that I have read the last 32 pages of reviews before deciding to add my two cents.This is a movie that I had been anticipating to watch since I saw the trailers earlier in the year for a couple of reasons. The first because the great Ang Lee was coming out with a new film and the story intrigued me.This story has resonated with me the way that it has with all of the reviewers that I have read so far and I echo their sentiments in that it haunts you long after you have left the theater.To love and lost or never loved at all, is the question that I posed my friend that I saw the film with on my first viewing. Her answer was simple... to love and lost. I asked that question because of the fact that Ennis' pain at the end of the film is so apparent that you wonder if it was worth it but you realize that it is completely out of his control. Another important question for me that this movie brought to mind the second time that I watched it was the role that fear brought to Ennis and how it stopped him from fulfilling his own happiness with Jack.The performances were exquisite and Ang Lee is a genius for bringing us this remarkable and haunting love story.It is quite obvious that this film has resonated with a cord in the majority of the viewing public, and we all have our own views on what that is. This love story was heartbreaking, gut wrenching, but beautiful and thought provoking at the same time. I highly recommend that you go see this film and leave what you think you may know about this film at the door and be prepared to be brought into the tragic and forbidden love of Ennis DelMar and Jack Twist.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
movie that may make you weep with grief...,"I thought, when I 1st saw this movie, that this movie is about a sweeping love story between 2 men over a long period of time...the struggles & conflicts they faced (from society & within themselves)...men who could only love each other openly when they were alone together out in the middle of breathtaking nature (with nature symbolizing unlimited freedom from expectations & freedom to explore love openly)... Brokeback Mountain is really not about those issues at all...this movie is about one man's intense loneliness...a man who doomed himself to a lifetime of loneliness despite the love that was given to him... this movie is near perfect... Jake Gyllenhaal was magnificent... I can't get my head around Heath Ledger's absolutely stunning performance...he almost stole the movie...I hope with this movie he never has to act in another empty & shallow movie ever again... I knew some cowboys...Heath was exactly like them...in mannerisms...the way he walked & kinda slouched over...he lived that part...and when his character (Ennis Del Mar) was allowed to be human for a moment instead of a strong & silent cowboy Ledger was achingly real in showing the vulnerability of that character... if this movie doesn't make you weep after an ending that will haunt you forever then nothing can possibly make you cry...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Love, For What It Is","""Brokeback Mountain"" is a story of love, passion, sadness, hidden feelings, (self-) prejudice. It seems that everything that could be said about BBM already was, and I don't think I've got much to add myself. This is truly a milestone in film history, and I'm sure it's gonna be seen for ages. As a friend of mine said, BBM is, overall, A TALE OF MISSED LIVES. A Love That Will Never Grow Old indeed. It could never grow old because of Ennis' fear of accepting himself. More than an extraordinary cinematic experience (Ang Lee's sensitive direction, magnificent performances, amazing screenplay, beautiful cinematography and unforgettable music score), this is a life lesson. I'm extremely happy that BBM was made. Not only myself, actually, but millions of people. Thanks a lot Ang Lee, Annie Proulx, Larry McMurtry, Diana Ossana, Jake Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger (I loved your small role in ""Monster's Ball"", but I had never thought you could do anything better than that), Michelle Williams (farewell to Dawson!), Anne Hathaway, Gustavo Santaolalla, Rodrigo Prieto, and all of the others involved.

"Great acting, OK plot, Overhyped","People seem to either hate and ridicule this movie without ever having seen it, or praise it to high heavens. I haven't yet met many opinions of it being just sort of OK, which is where I stand. There are things to praise about the movie and I have some issues.The acting is superb and keeps you engaged and interested. The cinematography is done very well. What I have an issue with is the directing in the first act and the overall plot of the last one.Plainly put, when the two main characters get together for the first time at the titular Brokeback Mountain, me and my wife both felt like it was out of no-where. Perhaps there were hints, that homosexual members of the audience could catch, but I can not judge that. Up to that point they were two characters together on a secluded place without ever building any tension between them. I blame direction for that. The movie made it seem as if two people in a secluded place inevitably allways have to end up in bed together, and that is even without any build up of chemistry or attraction.The second act focuses on the characters dealing with their newfound feelings while trying to manage a ""normal"" life of marriage and kids. That part of the movie is what I found interesting, well done and worth the praise. The movie would have been better if this second act was preceeded by a better realised first.Without spoiling what happens at the end of the movie, I will just say it sort of disapointed me. Not because of what does happen, but instead I felt like there were supposed to be at least 10 more minutes of something, but the movie was just cut short. It just sort of ends, without a point, without catharsis... I've stayed up late on a work night and had to settle on just 5 hours of sleep and I feel like that ending was not really worth the wait.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Why ""Brokeback Mountain"" got me so good...","""Brokeback Mountain"" is an extraordinary film, a haunting, moving masterwork from Ang Lee. This film is a love story for the ages, and contains an amazing performance by Heath Ledger. I've never seen a same-sex relationship presented in a mainstream Hollywood film as it's presented here...this is a film about two people, painfully in love, and really, it's only a secondary concern that the two people involved are both men. Heath Ledger gives a career-making performance as the deeply closeted, withdrawn, tortured Ennis del Mar, and Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding as the more open-minded, gregarious Jack Twist. The Score is melancholic and unforgettable...the music is almost another character in this film. The last 30 minutes of this film pack an emotional wallop that's hard to shake for days after. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a triumph for Ang Lee, and an unforgettable movie. Incredibly moving, what an achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A love story for this century.,"This film has to be(in my opinion) in contention with Romeo and Juliette as the most beautiful and heart-rending love story ever told, it takes you through every emotion from the first thrill of love through sorrow, jealousy and anger and leaves a lasting impression on your heart and mind. It makes you realise that when you are lucky enough to find the kind of love Ennis and Jack do then you should grab it with both hands. The whole film is beautiful to watch and the acting is superb, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall are both amazing and capture the spirit of the characters perfectly. The script is fairly sparse compared to a majority of films, but this just adds to the overall appeal.

And when you settle for less than that because of fear or other pressures, you won't find contentment in life. OK, it's been a week - I'm ready to see it again!

"Brokeback stays with you - Best film of 2005 (but as with all films, watch without expectations)","In a year of good movies, Brokeback Mountain stands out as the best of 2005 -- the one that will probably last with you the longest. But don't watch it expecting that. No movie benefits from such expectations, especially a small, soft-spoken one like this. Just sit back as if you've heard nothing and let it wash over you... then wait a few days and see if you can shake it. Odds are, you'll find yourself wanting to see it again. And you'll get so much more out of it if you do! Brokeback is a film about things unspoken. An aching love story told mostly between the lines. The beauty of it is that it trusts the audience. It lets us sympathize with everybody, even when they do hurtful things. There are no villains or heroes, no perfect people. All the main characters are driven by love and fear, and we understand them.Brokeback won more Best Picture awards during awards season than any film in cinema history, and was on more Top Ten lists and #1 on more lists than any film of 2005. Even the world-renowned Sight & Sound Top Ten list from world critics put Brokeback at #1 (the ONLY Oscar-nominated film on the list).But some have praised or panned Brokeback merely for its subject matter. Both agendas belittle the greatness and scope of the film. It's an expertly told, subtle drama about many things: the irrepressible power of both love and fear, the clash of idealism and rigidity, the pull of family and responsibility, and a particularly masculine inability to express emotion. It's also about scraping out a life in the rural American West -- which is at once jaw-droppingly beautiful and stark as hell.Brokeback is also wonderfully funny. Like many, I actually found myself affected by it more the day AFTER seeing it, and much more upon seeing it again. It sank in, played over and over in my imagination until Ennis, Jack, Alma & Lureen felt like people I knew and wished I could help.The movie can also make you treasure love more -- both lost and found.NOTE: If you prefer highly stylized, high-octane dramas or romances wherein every emotion is gushingly spelled out in saccharine dialogue over sweeping violin scores and the lovers have no major flaws, this film will either be a revelation or beyond your level of interest. See Titanic again (2005 DVD release is great). But if you also love subtler, more mature drama that unfolds believably and honestly, at a smooth pace that lets you discover nuance and emotion between the lines, Brokeback is a rare, powerful treat. The pitch-perfect dialogue never talks down to you. Every tiny detail works in concert under Ang Lee's observant, Oscar-winning direction to create a painfully accurate reality.Heath Ledger's brilliant, aching performance is mesmerizing. There's more brewing beneath the surface in his Ennis del Mar than we'll ever know -- and that restraint is what allows us to keep discovering new layers. It's as if he capped a volcano and never lets more than a wisp of steam out here and there, yet we always sense the smoldering in the depths. Rarely has an actor evoked so much with so few words. Add to that the subtle ways his voice and body change as he ages 20 years, helped by equally subtle makeup, and here's a performance that will go down in film history as one of the Greats. The New York Times rightly compared it to the best of Brando and Penn.Jake Gyllenhaal, whose Jack Twist is a little less hidden, also delivers a stellar performance of alternately bottled up pathos and spurts of idealism. His aging is also remarkable, down to the slight paunch and shifts in posture and expression he develops. The interplay between the two leads (from rage to quiet, loving tenderness), as well as between each of them and their families, is magic. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway shine equally bright as Alma and Lureen. Their performances and transformations are absolutely absorbing. Not a false performance in the whole movie.Brokeback is far richer than one might think upon first viewing. More is going on in most scenes than we initially realize. Each time I've seen it, I've discovered fascinating, moving nuances. Normally I'm less emotionally affected the second time I see a drama, but Brokeback truly gets better and MORE powerful every time.Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana so faithfully adapted and artfully expanded Proulx's story in their Oscar-winning script that Proulx said she felt like they and all the filmmakers had reached inside her head. Gustavo Santaollala's Oscar-winning score (follow-up to the great The Motorcycle Diaries) is spare, haunting, and beautifully evocative. He packs more emotional punch with a single guitar backed by pedal steel guitar and bass than another composer could have with the London Philharmonic. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is stunning and appropriately unadorned. Judy Becker's production design is so dead-on it's hard to believe it's not all real.I honestly can't think of another film that ever held me in its grip like Brokeback Mountain. While no art affects everyone the same way, this reaction seems to be common. Like Proulx's original story, the film powerfully knocked me out of my own life and has haunted me ever since.The danger of such praise is that it leads people to expect it to be more than it is. It's a simple, quiet tale about a handful of sympathetic characters. Its own isolated story. It can leave you wanting more, in a good way.Brokeback Mountain is plainly honest -- to the last. The typical Hollywood catharsis, atypical of real life, does not infect this story, thus Brokeback does not let you go after it's over.What greater wish could a film lover have?",,Anonymous,Romance

"Confronting & Personal, a story extremely well performed and presented","I waited a whole year to get to see this film. It was worth the wait. The story is one that was very ""taboo"" back when it is set, 1963 & onward, and in a region that would probably still find the subject matter ""taboo'. I found the movie very confronting, moving, and quite personal. The story is exceptionally well framed. The movie is admirably directed and beautifully filmed. The lead roles, particularly Heath Ledger & Jake Gyllenhaal are superbly acted. Well done all involved!!! I grew up in the period when the movie begins, a teenager of the sixties, knowing I was ""different"", that I felt differently to my mates and family and trying to come to terms with those differences and rationalise them with a reasonably religious upbringing was a long and difficult road to follow. Falling madly and permanently in love with a 'best mate', knowing that could never go anywhere was a bitter, confusing and frustrating emotional time. As you get older it is put into a clearer perspective, no less painful, but clearer. You still love, but life must move on. I thank all concerned in the writing and making of this story for telling a tale of true love, against the odds. I'm sure that it touched a personal and private place in many hearts. A special thanks to Heath & Jake for showing their bravery portraying the main characters in such a genuine and deeply moving manner. Thanks again.

(The couple we were with agreed.) We see a lot of movies and we've seen some great performances this year. This wasn't even close to being one of them. The question I have to ask is ""If this love story was NOT about gay lovers, how would it rate as a movie and love story?"" The answer is ""poor."" And that's what makes me think this is a great movie for people who have a particular interest in the subject matter, but not a great movie for other people.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Cold Harsh Mountain,"Brokeback Mountain Directed by Lee Ang Screenplay adapted by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana Based on the short story by Annie ProulxStarring Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway & Michelle WilliamsHaving read the original short story by Proulx a few years ago, I was surprised by how well a tale of love between two cowboys set against a panoramic Wyoming backdrop was told. When I learned that the 60-page short story would become a film directed by celebrated director Lee Ang, I hoped it would be made soon.By now, most people would have associated Brokeback Mountain with gay forbidden love. The truth is, Brokeback Mountain is just a very simple tale of arduous love and anyone with an ounce of emotion should watch.The union of director Lee Ang, scriptwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, and the cast results in one of the most exquisite and endearing films made in the last few years.Lee Ang possesses the talent for slow, intricate and subtle film direction. He pays attention to almost every aspect from simple small gestures to complex emotional strife set against the magnificent mountain view.McMurtry and Ossana also adapted the story faithfully except for the fact that the two male leads were originally much less desirable than Ledger and Gyllenhaal with bucked-tooth and stocky bodies.The assembled cast is the third link which leads the film to flight. Heath Ledger, the stoic straight-man type is caught unexpectedly in a tangled web of emotions for a fellow cowboy, something that had never crossed his less-than-queer mind. A man of few words, Ledger plays Ennis to perfection when he displays the inner turmoil that Ennis encountered trying to live his life the way it is and learning to love Jack. Every time Ledger breaks down and cries in the film, it's when you'll feel him.Jake Gyllenhaal is the hopeful companion who prays for the day that the union could yield the type of permanence he so craved for instead of ""one or two of high-altitude f**ks once or twice in a year."" And he waited for 20 years until the audience shares his anguish and unfulfilled yearnings by the time he lashed out on what they ever have left is Brokeback Mountain.Michelle Williams plays the silent, long-suffering wife who witnessed the earth-shattering and ultimately heartbreaking kiss shared between Ennis and Jack after 4 years of separation. Williams is exceptionally sorrowful, swallowing her unspoken hurt until she could hold it no more that she wanted to hear the truth out of Ennis' mouth years after her remarriage. Williams' acting prowess is certainly validated by the expression she showed at the instance of that unexpected kiss and the heart-wrenching exchange with Ledger.Anne Hathaway plays a rich girl whose expertise is in making money not relationships. Given her short screen time, her change from a brash rich girl to a high-society career woman and finally a emotionless and grieving widow expands her acting abilities beyond her impish Princess Diary-self.Many unions, liaisons and break-ups later, Brokeback Mountain emerges as a tragic yet bittersweet and endearing tale of love between four suffering people afflicted with varying degrees of attachment but all not willing to let go. To me, this suffices as more than a gay cowboy story. To enjoy Brokeback Mountain, an open mind and eyes are definitely pre-requisites. (A+)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another beautiful masterpiece from Ang Lee,"I have been waiting to watch this film for months. And when I finally watched it, I was so moved.The plot itself was very touching. Acting was excellent too. Jake Gyllenhaal's soft side and Heath Ledger's rough side were displayed in the film. The shock of Michelle Williams when she saw the two guys making out was very memorable. The ending was so touching. If you don't know what was happening, then you should read the book. The book gives you a clearer idea of what happened in the end.The cinematography was also excellent. The scenery itself was very impressive too. I felt I was watching the National Geographic! I found that this film was not just a 'gay' film, but it also explored the issues of homosexuality as a social taboo, and how homosexuals live under pressure imposed by the society and by themselves as a result of the societal pressure. I am so glad that this film was made, and that it is making a great impact all around the world. This film deserves every praise there is!",,Anonymous,Romance
It takes two guys to show us love,"What is love? Looks like a simple question..But when we bring ourselves to look at the male-female relationships around us closely (and even more honestly!), we will discover that in very few cases love is the main reason for them to exist. Relationships are often build on factors like comfort, addiction or the fear of loneliness. But the main reason for a relationship is an other: Picturing a 'normal' couple that marries, gets children, sees their children grow up and have families themselves while they get old together, gives us the feeling those people live a complete life. Something tells us that this is the reason why we exist.And it's in our nature, of course. Mens urge to spread his DNA, woman's urge to give birth to a child, the urge to leave something of us behind before we have to go.Even today, even as modern people, we are primitive beings.That is what stands behind almost every romance we witness. It's so much part of our image of a complete life, that even every movie has to have a romance in it to seem complete, may it be the next best superficial action flick or a more intellectual drama (the exception proves the rule, of course).So what is love then? Does this romantic image that we have in our heads when we think about this feeling exist at all? Or is it just a trick of nature to make us reproduce, to ensure mankind's survival?One single movie, called 'Brokeback Mountain', shows us brutally that love DOES exist. And it's two average guys who make us feel it all. Those two are forced to experience a strong affection towards one another, and through them we realize what this feeling looks like, ripped of all patterns. That affection is not explainable. It is not even wanted. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. Every justification for it is taken away.What's left is nothing but pure love.It's an assault on your mind, body and soul. It is raw and violent. It's a force of nature.That movie holds a firm grip on my heart ever since I watched it the first time, and I don't think it will ever let go of me completely.

Manipulative And Dire Despite Some Strengths,"This caused a commotion several months before it had even hit cinemas "" John Wayne would be spinning in his grave at the very thought of this movie "" whined one right wing critic who failed to point out that The Duke once starred in an early Western called RIDE HIM COWBOY which despite the title had absolutely nothing to do with this movie . As it hit cinemas and more and more people saw it people on the other end of the political spectrum started to lavish praise on it and used adjectives like "" Groundbreaking "" "" courageous "" "" A masterwork "" and "" revolutionary film making "" and started to pick up every film award until the Oscars where the Oscar for best film went to CRASH which had a great number of critics and commentators screaming that this was the greatest travesty in Academy Award history . After finally getting to see both movies I have to say BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN didn't deserve many of the film awards it did receive never mind the ones it didn'tI have to say this is highly manipulative film making . I don't have a problem with its theme of two macho cowboys falling in love with each other but I do have a problem of the way they suddenly just find themselves falling into a sexual relationship . Is this a common occurrence in real life where people suddenly enter a same sex relationship because it seemed like a good idea at the time ? The whole set up seemed far too sudden to be credible to me but I guess if you're ultra liberal you'll just have to go along with it same as when their relationship is established you have to empathize with the characters of Del Mar and Twist instead of other characters . I guess their employer is in the wrong because he's concerned about the livestock and doesn't like what these two cowboys are getting up to during work hours or that there's something wrong with Alma when she finds out her husband is gay and is disgusted and shattered by this ? Hey you don't want anyone to accuse you of being a homophobic reactionary after all do you ? Are we to take the side of Del Mar and Twist simply because they are gay ? I think if the story had been slightly reconstructed so we see it from Alma's POV this would have been a far better movie since she's by far the most sympathetic character in the movieIf that had been the case then we'd certainly have had a more dramatic movie since we'd get scenes of Alma throwing things around the kitchen screaming "" WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU WERE A... A .... YOU MADE LOVE TO ME AND YOU NEVER ONCE TOLD ME YOU WERE A... A... I,M SO DISGUSTED I CAN'T EVEN SAY THAT WORD "" because if there's one thing lacking in much of this movie it's drama . Instead of heart wrenching drama we're subjected to a couple of gay cowboys mumbling stuff which is difficult to hear because the sound mix is so bad and Ang Lee hasn't done his cause much good because there's a distinct lack of cross cuts which makes some scenes in particular and the film in general feel far longer than the just over two hours running length . This film feels far far longer than it really is and is often an ordeal to sit throughThere are some plus points . Certainly the cinematography is excellent and the beautiful isolated landscape is captured so well I almost felt like rushing off to visit Wyoming if it hadn't left me with the impression that it's over run with gay cowboys , violent rednecks , trailer trash and sheep . And despite my criticism about the lack of incident or drama the ending is genuinely sad , certainly not as sad as many of the more liberal commentators have suggested but sad enough to give BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN a higher mark out of ten than I genuinely feel it deserves",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
So human,"I'll start by telling you that I've seen this movie twice, and that I loved it even more the second time. There were in short five main reasons why I loved so much:*The actors: Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal both did a tough job (in all meanings of the word 'tough') and delivered two of the most fragile and human character in film-history-- Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist. Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams (my new goddess who, after her incredible performance in this film, made me follow Dawson's Creek) are glowing with just as much competence and professionalism as Gyllenhaal and Ledger.*The screenplay: The writers have actually managed to write a screenplay that is far better than the original short story that the movie is based on.*The director: Ang Lee has managed to both remain in complete control in the making of this film and being, as well as being really brave; it is evident that he among other thing has had complete faith in the actors and the casting of them (who would for example have connected The Princess Diaries-Anne Hathaway with a role like Lureen Newsome-Twist?). Brokeback Mountain has forever showed me what a master he is!*The music-score: The first time I saw Brokeback Mountain, I didn't really notice the music and was in such a hurry afterwards that I didn't stay to listen to the music that was played during the rolling of the cast and so on at the end of the movie. But the second time, I noticed the perfection of the music. And then, at the end of the movie, the whole audience stayed and listened to Willie Nelson's version of He was a friend of my. All in all, the music-score was so good, that I kept humming it all the way home from the cinema.*The cinematic photo: Every frame, from the stunning view of Brokeback Mountain to the shabby little town of Riverton, helps driving the movie all the way through.Everyone, absolutely everyone should see Brokeback Mountain. It's not a film about two gay men- it's about love, how it can be ruined by the restrains and hypocrisy of society, and about unbearable loneliness as a result of the former. And if all the world's bigots and racists can't stand one lousy sex-scene (that's right, there's only one!) between two people who love each other, just because they happen to be of the same sex, then it's their loss. Eight academy awards-nominations. Three wins! That's just pure robbery. I've heard that because Phillip Seymor-Hoffman won the best actor-award for Capote and Crash became the best film of the year, this year's academy awards was really controversial. I beg to differ; it is not controversial, if the jury clearly still has a problem nominating and giving the Oscars to people who plays Hitler (I'm talking about Bruno Ganz in Downfall two years ago), or who's character has sex with another man!Like I said: Pure robbery...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good film--if you like melodrama; if you don't: avoid.,"The movie has its moments of great cinematography, acting, and direction. It's great to see a gay movie that doesn't involve dance music, gay lisps, and endless promiscuity. However, the movie was way too long, and talk about melodrama! It seems like every other scene had to involve people breaking down with emotion, which is not necessarily a bad thing (I guess that's why they call it a love story). But, after a while, the emotional scenes gets to be a bit repetitive and, sadly, predictable. If you like that and melodrama, then you'd probably like this film. Another thing: spanning the film over such a long period of time (20+ years of the characters' lives) was a bit distracting. As a result, the film felt a bit unfocused. To sum: I wouldn't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't great. The film had the potential of being innovative, but ends up being just another artificially inflated emotional love story that we've all seen before (minus the gay cowboys).",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Disappointing,"I felt that this movie is bastardization and commercialization of a very intimate experience that requires great attention to the detail and the process leading up to the actions / decisions brought to life through the characters. I would assume, based upon what I saw, that the director has not had this experience and approached the topic from an ""outsider"" perspective. I feel that the director, and the lead actors, did not achieve the true essence of the inner workings of the storyline within each of the characters.I feel that the director spent more time on showing the decisions that each male character made regarding the sharing of the sexuality / passion / trust / love / etc. than the process leading up to those decisions. You cannot have the bread without the peanut butter and jelly to make a sandwich. Otherwise you have bread. The problem with this movie is that both men did not spend enough time developing the center of their characters and having that energy radiate outward to the representations of men going through the process of love and reconciling whatever religion, environmental, masculine, machismo standards that have been imposed upon them since their birth. I would agree that Heath Ledger was wonderful in showing his age and progression through the movie.I have to give kudos to the make up artist and the way in which Heath was shot as the movie progressed. However, I was disappointed in the amount of Wyoming scene shots that were used in the beginning of the movie and that the interactions between the two did not have an escalation leading up to the consummation of passion and deep-seated feelings brought to the surface by the other character. Additionally, I did not care for the amount of ""sappy"" music throughout the entire movie and felt like the movie on the whole was a series of still shots linked together and did not have the fluidity in the development of the idea and the execution of the idea to quench my taste. It all made me think that an ""outsider"" was attempting to capture an intimate experience that is full of real and raw emotion and substance that would give great material for an actor to really hone some methods and skills.Unfortunately, the details were not attended and the attempt, in my opinion, failed. It is a clear representation that the director tried to replicate a story that was not familiar to him and you can see / sense / feel that throughout the film. On the flip side, I appreciate that the subject matter is put out into the mainstream for others to witness and view. I realize that I have placed a hyper critical eye / perspective on the film and its presentation of the subject matter. However, I do find value in the larger scope of what we are presented everyday.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"stunning, hauntingly beautiful, pretty much says it all","I have noticed that several people have questioned as to whether Jack and Ennis really loved each other and have indicated that they feel their relationship seemed to be based on sex. I would remind them that these are people who do not express emotion of any kind verbally and that a lot of people are not going to be used to the way things are expressed between men in the emotionally repressed Rocky Mountain West.Bearing in mind that the words ""I love you"" are never used in this film, which is typical of the people depicted within it, let me point out some scenes where that deep and profound love is shown if you just look for it:1. In the flash back where Jack is sleeping on his feet and Ennis comes up and embraces him from behind and tells him it is time for him to go to bed is an incredibly tender moment. When Jack turns and watches Ennis ride away, the love in Jacks eyes is just breath taking.2. On the lake shore during their final confrontation Jack tells Ennis that he ""wished he knew how to quit him"". The incredible agony that pours from Ennis as he collapses to the ground and Jack enfolds him in his arms portrays a frustrated love so deep, so profound that words simply cannot do it justice.3. The two shirts, which Jack had lovingly placed one inside the other was simply Jack's sweet, quiet way of saying ""I love you Ennis del Mar"". Ennis's wonderfully tender way of bringing the shirts to his face when he found them was his quiet way of saying ""I love you Jack Twist"".4. In the final scene of the film Ennis adjusts the collars of the shirts and says with his eyes full of tears; ""Jack, I swear"". It is an act, an expression of love again so deep it simply defies description.No love? NEVER have I seen so much love pass between two human beings in my life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Beautifully written stories were crafted using alternate universes, that enabled many to live, in our minds and hearts, what could have been...what should have been. - I am forever grateful to AP, AL, DO, LM, and most especially JG and HL, for bringing the rough, grit, blood, bone, wet, heat and passion to those of us willing to be fed.

A mirror,"It is a bizarre film.In first part is common, occasionally boring. Same recipes, magnificent images and old story between two cowboys. Nothing new, nothing important.In the second part-a different story. Symbols, gestures of love, fear and desire,ambiguity of feelings and chimeric expectations, truth and vital lies, memories and strong sin, slices of time and hypocritical existences, words and far worlds and shadow of a mountain.It is not a gay movie or pledge for tolerance. It is not a tale about the brave heroes and their silence. It is not a lesson of life or a touching moment of a Sunday evening. It is a mirror.The lost, the hope, the desire, the responsibility like cage are realities for every existence. In every life exists a seed of a great and secret guilt and a nostalgic favor.The image of farm is only the ordinary Arcadia. The perfect refuge and the place of reason of existence. And this guilt is more and more bigger, with every hour and every year.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a magnificent film. Not for the art of director or casting but for the science to transforms the silence in only dialog. To create a small and anonymous catharsis in the conscience of audience and to make questions.It is a tale about the price of sacrifice. About illusions and about the image of the other. Only victory is touch of a blue shirt.After his end, I considered this film a splendid piece of Extreme Orient cinema.

Good Film...Not the Best for 2005,"This is a well-structured, simple story about two cowboys that engaged in a love affair that started during a job they had done together sheep-herding. After the job, the two lovers are forced back into their own individual lives, both in 1960's Midwest America, where their love affair would never be accepted. They had to pretend to be into their wives and have children while the true love they had was in each other, far away. Things become more complicated for one of the characters when his wife finds out about his intimacy with the other man.Brokeback explores homosexuality in ways never seen before ""by me"" on film. However, it's not as daring as people make it sound in it's exploration. In fact, I think it's overrated in that aspect. There have been dozens of Foreign films that took stabs at the subject matter of homosexuality. Most recently was ""Bad Education,"" which was a truly complex, multi-layered story that held no bars in it's telling. ""Bad"" had not only explored the prevalence of homosexuality, it also focused on the issues of the catholic church and the accusations against it involving sexual abuse against children.Ang Lee does a great job directing this film. The cinematography was first rate, with epic views of the mountains in Middle America. Lee did lose points from me in some moments when the film started to feel pretentious.Also, there were some holes in the screenplay. There were some things that were totally unclear, which was also very vital to the climax of this story (I can't give it away). At the end, I felt I had missed something that had me scratching my head, baffled. I also had trouble believing the beat for beat actions of Ledger's character when he related with his wife. It seemed absurd to believe that any man, straight or gay, would make himself look so obvious in his involvement in an extramarital affair. There were moments that even sunk to the level of ""Soap Opera"" as the truth about Ledger's character comes to light more and more. I never believed Jake's wife in the film. She seemed so cold and withdrawn, makes me question her involvement with what happens in the end because she didn't tell the truth about it when we find out. And if there was any involvement on her behalf, then why were we robbed of experiencing the progression of her change from loyalty to betrayal against Jake? The movie didn't fully work for me. I think Hollywood is unsure about the best film they had produced last year because there were too many bad and mediocre films. The critics are just happy to see a film that deal with homosexuality in such an intimate, realistic way that you rarely see from ""American"" films, straying away from stereotype and dealing with deeper issues of self-hate, self-deception and self-betrayal. It's not bold and nothing about it, for me, was memorable. Some originality in American Cinema? Yes (never seen gay cowboys on screen for so long in one film). Great performances? Absolutely. Best film of the year. No way.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
angst does not equal depth,"While the acting is superb and the filming is beautiful, this movie falls short before it even begins with a story that has no point. The point of a story is to have a beginning, middle, and end. The point of a movie is to take people where they've never been and share something with them. Perhaps there are people out there who have never felt hopelessness or depression, and maybe those people can learn something from this movie, but other than that I really don't feel this movie brings anything new to the viewer. The entire point of the movie seems to be ""life is pointless and will never get better, no matter what."" Angst does not equal depth. The characters angst quite a bit, but never do anything to improve their state in life. Instead of having obstacles and overcoming them, or at least TRYING to, they simply exist in a horrible depth of ""poor and depressed"" for the entire movie, and never pull out of that at all.As someone that's read far too many badly written fan fiction and writings by angsty teens, I can assure you that angst does not automatically equal depth. ;) It never, ever does. I would expect more from Ang Lee than what I get out of fiction written by angsty emo 13 year old girls, but this movie falls into the same category as most slash fiction does, which is massively disappointing.This movie was not sad or tragic, it was simply depressing. If you want to feel depressed and hopeless and leave the theater feeling as if nothing matters, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise I'd avoid it. Depression is a real part of life, and it is something that a lot of people can relate to, especially in a society where being outed and gay is practically a death sentence. However, a movie where nothing happens except the characters are depressed the entire time and nothing changes doesn't seem to have much point to me. I guess the main point of this review is ""Wow, that was a downer.""",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Orientation....my take.,"Oh how to make comment amongst so many, and not sound trite or repetitive and indeed, disrespectful to others views. After reading so many takes on this wonderful movie, I'm repeatedly drawn to a quote of Annie Prouix herself which I would like to share at this point; '' How different readers take the story is a reflection of their own personal values, attitudes, hang-ups. It is my feeling that a story is not finished until it is read, and that the reader finishes it through his or her own life experience, prejudices, world view and thoughts''. My initial reaction to the movie though incredibly impressed was marred by what I thought to be a huge deficiency of tangible expression of love between the 2 men. Even before seeing the movie I sensed that reading the short story might not be a bad idea. So, the next day I did just that and returned to the cinema for a second showing. Whilst I'm not saying that to read the book beforehand is essential for all, in my case, it made all the difference. Instead of dictating my wishes on the storyline I was able to sit back and drink in all the riches of the performance, cinematography, screenplay, sound etc. So many questions answered, a better understanding of the subtleties of text and direction, all came about from knowing the story. Now, whenever I revisit the film I see a myriad of detail that put this story into a sharper focus making it the most profound cinematic experience in my lifetime. ( I'm 53 and remember only 'Maurice' making me want to see a movie re homosexual love again ). And now I look back at the movie and have some comments that I would like to share. The discussion raging about the true orientation of the 2 men is answered in the repressive atmosphere of the times and my own experience. ( tx Annie for the prompt).I can see them both going thru puberty and in their own ways and timing discovering their attraction for boys and not girls. In Jack's case, a progression not greatly marred or scuppered by any event, allowing him to become an adult man sexually attracted to other men and who knows, losing his virginity a couple of years or so before this story begins. As for Ennis, the traumatic experience of being shown the mutilated corpse of one of the 2 ranchers puts a ton weight of fear and dread upon him concerning urges that by the age of 9 when the event happens may already have begun. I believe his orientation is established by the time we pick up the story but it's buried so deep that only someone special will be able to lift the lid.And that orientation isn't necessarily all homosexual but sufficient for the connection between them to happen as it does. After the drunken sing song and Ennis' claim on entry to heaven based on having not yet done anything to deserve otherwise, we see a dropping of guard sufficient for Jake to feel hopeful in something happening just around the corner and what must be a ground breaking instance of flirting or at least wishful thinking from Ennis. One of a few instances of mutual attraction that confound those who don't see the reason for them coming together in the first place. Ennis has opened up to Jack in a way that anybody knowing his character would not believe possible.At the point in the story when Ennis and jack trade places with the sheep tending and before their coming together Prouix writes ''They were respectful of each others opinions, each glad to have a companion where none had been expected. Ennis, riding against the wind back to the sheep in the treacherous, drunken light, thought he'd never had such a good time, felt he could paw the white out of the moon ''. Ennis came to Jack a virgin in so much more than sexual experience and Jack came to Ennis with enough same sex experience to know that that was his lot and he was gonna go for it. Added to all this a chemistry that no amount of fine prose can define, the basic requirement to a relationship that was gonna go through all that it did. There should be no surprise at the lustful passion of their final coming together and Ennis' subsequent confusion before returning to him who had just lifted that lid albeit just a tad. On a personal note, I remember the ecstasy of my first kiss with another man, the subsequent fleeing after the pleasure and the accompanying fear and confusion but it was I who returned for more and without looking back. I fear that space prevents me from rambling further so would close with the hope that the effect this movie will have on society will be profound and long reaching 'though my pessimistic view on the improvement of human nature tells me not to hold my breath. In a quote from E M Forster's 'Maurice' read 'the world' for England;''....England has always been disinclined to accept human nature''.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Exceptional Piece of Art,"Despite all the negative comments out there (each person has their opinion, of course), this film was an amazing experience. One of the best films I've ever seen (and by 'best' I mean the most touching).The cast performed wonderfully and courageously well, the drama was intense, and the story was moving. This film really manages to get most people, whatever their sexual preferences are. To most people (including me), the tears are impossible to avoid at certain scenes, and not every film can do this.This is a true representation of our current society, its hatred against people's sexual preferences, and its despite for their the ones that actually suffer deeply inside. I didn't need to see this film to change my mind about this subject, but it intensified my thoughts, making me a better and more understanding person with other human beings.As the film's slogan says, Love is a Force of Nature, and that is a fact. The main reason people NEED to have a relation with the opposite sex, is that so it will be possible to have children of their own. Excluding that, everyone can (and should) love whoever they want no one should (and can) judge them for who they love. This film has made its point, and I truly believed in their love for each other. I believe that at some point, everyone will be able to understand this matter, and everyone that still opposes or thinks this this is a big joke are the ones that will be rejected in the future. So, every person that already accepts the natural way of how love works, is one step ahead of the ones that don't, and they're certainly more human for that.I recommend watching this film, and please don't comment it unless you've actually watched it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

My mind won't forget this film,"As a screenwriter, how I wish I could have written this film. From the deepest part of me this is a beautiful, beautiful masterpiece which has been wrenching at my gut for days. It has left me with the thoughts 'why didn't he say this? Why didn't this happen?..but ultimately the only consideration is: 'if only they could have been together, which is what both men wanted.' How deeply I felt for Jack who, despite all his efforts, cannot realise his simplest dreams. (not even in death when his old man refuses to send his ashes to Brokeback)It is criminal how humanity treats what is the most divine thing of all: love (no matter between which adults) and how it has been turned into something salacious by certain individuals. eg. the religious right in America who really glory in making everyone feel miserable sinners and who believe people have to live the way they have chosen to. Nor should they be allowed to dictate how this love should be depicted on screen -so 10 points to Ang Lee for his refreshing honesty.I also applaud a film which shows real men, as it happens in real life and not stereotypically versions of camp gays. It might be uncomfortable for the straight men among us, but why should it be? These are serious flaws in society that need to be examined once and for all. I find it all the more difficult to understand those that have given one star - we're all different, I know, and sometimes a film speaks to you and sometimes it doesn't but in this case I can only assume they have closed their hearts they have been indoctrinated by the MTV 10 sec pop-blurb sort of film where you need the concentration span of a fly. (What is revealing is the anger they have inside)I have spoken to nearly all my male friends, straight and gay, and all have said they have experienced a love and longing for, maybe, their best mate, that they might never have expressed or else a deep regret that it was never taken further. In the film we are talking soul-love here, spiritual love which, when it cannot be denied, will spill over into true physical expression. This impression is shown admirably in the strength of two wonderful performances of the actors Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. One, more accepting and braver to ignore what others might think to experience the only happiness he has with Ennis, the other deeply hurt as a young man and thrashing about internally trying to come to terms with the desire to just follow Jack on his path but not allowing himself to (his inner mind's thoughts and criticisms that really belong to others weighing him down) He knows he is happy with Jack, he knows that he would want to be with Jack because love is an energy and transcends the two protagonists; it's a soul mate thing. Not for one moment did I think about the sexuality of these actors or of the characters they portrayed, I just saw two men's love for one another. And what is the utter beauty of the film is a complex story told so simply in the most natural of surroundings.

It Is What it Is....,"Postcard perfect cinematography and impeccable direction (Ang Lee deservedly won his Academy ""Reward"" for this film, as it sits nicely alongside his more potent ""Ice Storm"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" to put him near the top of the cream of the crop of modern directors) highlight this film about gay cowboy romance in 1960's Wyoming.Plotting and character development are glacially paced to the point of banality in the early portion of the film as the melodrama slowly unfolds into a sappy star-crossed romance amidst gorgeous mountain scenery. The drama really heats up in the middle portions of the film as our two lovers (a very good Heath Ledger as Ennis and a slightly annoying Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack) try to hide their true feelings and lead normal lives with wives and children. It's interesting to watch how the repression manifests itself differently in the characters' lives, as Jack's pent up frustration allows him to finally stand up to an oppressive father-in-law while meeting with other men on the side keeping both his wife and Ennis completely blind, while Ennis' repression leads to a complete disintegration of his life highlighted in powerful scenes with Michelle Williams as his all too-knowing wife as she delivers a shockingly raw and emotive performance.The film lurches on into its strained later portions as it becomes painfully clear to even the most patient viewer that this was based on a short story. The flawless direction of Lee and some delightful cameos (with Linda Cardellini very effective as Ennis' later-day waitress girlfriend and Anna Farris serving some comic relief as a loquacious ranching high society Texan) keep the film engaging. However, it eventually deteriorates into the art-house equivalent of a Nicholas Sparks' adaptation complete with dialogue more memorable for its unintended comedy than for any deeply moving undercurrent, which is why I suspect the film succeeded so well with mainstream female audiences. Unfortunately it left this movie lover wishing for something a bit more meaningful.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love,Anyone would like to see how is love should watch this movie. The story is amazing and the performance by both actor have done great job. It's not just about gay cowboy. It's just simply LOVE story and that's what made it one of my most favourite movie ever made. Ang lee captured of both the story line is so classic and simple. The hot scene surprising has been done only once and both actors really delivered what the movie needs. The rest of supporting actress also did very good performance. I personally enjoyed the movie and hope the Oscar would recognise and give proper appraisal. A classic movie will always last forever. Ang Lee did one of his best movie ever. I would like to give lots of thanks for his inspiration and courage to made this movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
High expectations where not reached,"I had very high expectations for this movie, and they were not met. I can say, that overall, there were about 20 minutes of this film that were worth watching. There was no flow to this film, and it was outright boring. I have never fallen asleep while in the theater, but I almost did this time. This movie just seemed like an American shot at foreign ""gay"" films. There are, by far, much better ""gay"" films out there than this one. The one on the top of my list (from the ones that I have seen) would be ""The Sum of Us"". For those of you who do not know, this was an Australian film, staring Russel Crowe, which told the story of the relationship between a father and his gay son. Honestly, a very good and touching film, whether you are a Russel Crowe person or not (it was before his Hollywood days). Overall, this movie was garbage, but maybe this garbage will help every closed minded American to open up a little bit. We usually love bad movies in this country either way.(this holds no reference to my review, but I am gay, and I think that the only reason this movie was given good reviews was so that GLAAD wouldn't get ticked off that the first American gay film to contain Hollywood actors, and hit somewhat big, would flop)",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quite Possibly,"This might be the best movie ever; certainly one of the most potent.A thank you to the actors, the director, whoever was in charge of cinematography, and Ms. Proulx. Simply amazing. Honestly, Brokeback Mountain has ruined all other movies for me. This is a rather happy shame.While it is obvious anyone involved in the project invested in it completely, Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams gave absolutely legendary performances. I found myself hoping Ms. Williams would end up in other scenes throughout the film. She animated Alma and gave her to audiences without any sort of reservation. Mr. Ledger's performance was nearly flawless as well. The story and the movie are both powerful. I don't know if I can say that about any other movie I've ever seen. And I'm afraid I've seen too many.As for the film's ""controversial"" nature, what controversy? It is a love story. Love is messy, wrong, and destructive. Love can be shared between two men, and whether that is wrong or right, the movie provides no commentary. Homosexuality is far from glorified in this movie. That would be grotesque. It is, however, shown as a reality. Love has consequences no matter its makers. This movie is beautiful, and should be watched. I don't care who you are.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cast Aside Your Prejudices and Enjoy this Great Human Drama,"It took me a long time to actually give this movie a chance. I watch its nominations for the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards and i scolded. I made fun of it, the ""Gay Cowboy"" movie. I thought the homosexual theme was the reason it was getting nominated. And I stayed bitter for awhile.But as months passed, id see the advertisements, id see it on the rental shelf. I kept getting curious. I kept having the assumption, that yeah know maybe there's more to it. It took me till the start of August to shake off my friends and my own criticisms', prejudices, and such.The movie that played on my TV in front of me, was not the ""Gay Cowboy"" movie i had made up in my head. It was one of the most beautiful movies, one of the most beautiful human stories I have seen in awhile, at least out of modern cinema.Heath and Jake give the performances of there careers, by taking possibly the best role's of there lives. Both do sensational jobs, and yet Philip Seymour Hoffman, deserved the best actor Oscar that he received. These two men though, fully deserved there nods.The movie is about two lonely people. Broken people, broken from there past who end up fatefully on the same job tending to sheep on Brokeback Mountain. Heath plays Ennis, a quiet, soft spoken young man, and Jake plays Jack, more out-spoken. The two seem opposites but somehow there are similarities that they share.One fateful night the two end up in bed together, and a romance begins. But the problem is that its a forbidden romance, its shunned upon, even dangerous, and Ennis knows this, to a fault, and possibly dwells on it to much, and the two part ways after the summer. They meet there future wives, marry, have kids. But there lives remain unfulfilled. I don't give anything away from saying that, cause there is so much depth so many things that go wrong, and Ennis is hard headed, as much as Jack wants him, it tears him apart, because of Ennis' fears.And essentially that is what the story is about, but what happens on the mountain, or in there personal lives, is bread and butter of the story. Where do they make it after years and years of secrecy, what happens to them, will anything change, can there love exist like it should, without destroying these men.Perhaps this review isn't very clear, but the movie is incredible, cast aside what religious or personal prejudices you may have, and enjoy a great human story.

All around great movie!,"Well, I was able to see Brokeback Mountain on opening weekend in Houston. All in all I thought it was a terrific movie. As a gay man, I am very excited to see a movie like this come out, and also very happy to see it doing so well. This movie is true to the fact that not all gay men are drag queens. Many are just as masculine as the two men in this movie, if not more. It's just that you do not recognize these ones out on the street, for you automatically assume they are straight. The movie really touched on a lot of emotions, from the excitement of falling in love, to the fear of what may happen to you if you come out as a gay person, to the sadness and heartbreak that coming out can sometimes cause others. Although I found myself feeling so sorry for Michelle Williams' character, I could in no way blame Heath Ledger's character for causing her pain. This is, and always has been, societies fault for forcing gay men and women to live lives God did not intend for them to live. If gay men and women were able to happily live their lives in the open without any fear, just like straight individuals, events like this would not happen. It does not matter if you agree with this or not, it is still true, and very sad. I feel this movie is very true to real life in many ways, and Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are to be commended for their roles!",,Anonymous,Romance

The pictures and the clutching feeling hunted me days after. Perfect performance, picture and structure. The best part that I love and hate most is the scene when Ennis lost his last control of tears. Out of desperation, he cried "" Because of you, I am like this, I am nothing, I am nowhere"". This is just heart-breaking! I love the superb performance heath gave us here. And I hate him for this, because my heart sank after watching it and for a long time, it refuses to light up.I wish that I know how to quit seeing this movie again.

"In Heaven, you can be yourself","I just saw Brokeback Mountain last weekend, for the first time, on DVD; it's been several days, and now I'm here - and glad to see I'm not alone.A Canadian friend exhorted me to see this in February; she also lent me the Annie Proulx story on which it's based. I was prepared for this movie to be very, very, VERY sad.But 'sad' doesn't do it. This movie is truly devastating.I've been crying for days; a blossom of evening sky, a guitar lick from the score, a flash of a pregnant image from the movie, and my whole frame convulses. - I don't do much Hollywood, or movies in general; never reviewed a movie before, like many on this site; but this is a *phenomenon*.I don't think there are words to describe the effect this movie can have; mention of sleepless nights, inexplicable longings, addictive reactions, the spontaneous memory of an image causing a sudden tsunami of emotion: the experience is really beyond telling, reflected in the multitude of reviews. It's all happening to me: I'm glad to know I'm not alone.There may be critical 'holes' in it, here or there; but they disappear in the overwhelming effect of the whole. Performances invisible; visually mesmerising; gracefully paced, and unerringly spare. Ennis'/Ledger's story is mythical in its depth and classical in its tragedy: to know, only when it's gone, how fulfilled your life was with something, and how empty it will be after.Highest praise all round; the Academy was wrong. This one meteor-ed right into my top 10 films list; and it's by far the most affecting film I've ever seen. By all means see it, if you have the openness to cope with the subject matter; but be prepared to be undone.

My all-time favorite film,"Until this year, I had never seen a film in a theater more than once. By this summer, I had seen this film 33 times in different theaters and traveled a total of at least 1,700 miles to see it locally and in cities as far away as 180 miles. Even since it came out on DVD, ""Brokeback Mountain"" absolutely has not lost any of its power.It's quite simply a kind of story I'd never seen before--a story of a love between two non-stereotypical, non-urban men. I relate to their environment to some extent, having grown up in a rural area and now living 20 miles away in a city. It was refreshing to see gay men in a way of life that so many--including many gay men!--see as totally foreign to them and an impossible occurrence in real life.But it's not foreign and it's not impossible. Gay men really are everywhere--in Wyoming, in Texas, in the world of cowboys and rodeos, in the world of cattle and sheep ranching. If even one person has come to realize this, or changed his/her mind about how ""normal"" it is for someone to love someone of the same sex, because of ""Brokeback Mountain,"" then this film was very much worth making.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sensitive and Inhibited LOVE between two men,"BBM is truly a sensitive movie. It makes sense with the general look on Ang Lee's face. i firstly could not figure out why Jack suddenly got intimate with Ennis by putting his arm around his body in the tent.Because until then the conversation between them did not seem to be that much warm. However, as the story unfolds itself, it made me believe that there is a very passionate love between them and especially at the union and the shirt scene were quite touching. It was a very sad ending and made me CRY! and think of how love can be that much strong just like the one in ""Angels in America""Finally, i must say that this film will not be forgotten not because it freely tells about two men's secret relationship in a world where most of the people say that is wrong, but because it reveals love in a much sensitive way than the other films where the love is between a man and a woman. congratulations to Ang Lee.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The eloquent silence of love,"I've read here that some people cannot see love between Jack and Ennis, only lust. I feel that the power of this film is in all that was not said. BM is an intelligent film that allows us, the audience, to fill in a lot of the blanks, and that is the power of this film. Much in the way that Hitchcock in the famous shower scene of Psycho never shows the knife striking Janet Leigh, we see the blood and see her scream, but he leaves the knife penetration part up to the imagination of the audience. Each viewer reacts to their personal perception of that horror. BM succeeds in similar fashion by allowing Jack and Ennis's actions, glances, and silences, to be interpreted by our own individual perceptions. I know for me personally, the scene when Ennis opens the door to Jack's room and looks around, moved me to tears because I realized then how lonely Jack's boyhood must have been. Jack was a sensitive and beautiful young spirit growing up alone in that room, in that house, with an uneducated, primitive father, in the middle of nowhere. All of that powerful imagery conveyed to me without one word spoken. Then of course, comes the famous shirt scene in the closet. Jack truly loved Ennis, enough to keep his shirt all those years enveloped and guarded by his own shirt. All of this powerful emotion is conveyed without one word. There are no words that can describe love, so no words were necessary in this film to convey the love between Jack and Ennis, but we knew it was there because there is love in us.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Haunting Performance by Heath Ledger,"OK, say what you will about Ang Lee, but he is a solid filmmaker. With the possible exception of ""The Hulk,"" he has always performed above and beyond. Occasionally, however, he reaches the sublime...""The Ice Storm"" being a prime example.I was really, really looking forward to ""Brokeback Mountain."" The reviews, which I normally avoid, were singing its praises. I succumbed and read too much. So, when I hit the cinema, my expectations were over the moon.At first, I was disappointed that I didn't slide right into the story. I was just too excited. Ledger's Ennis Del Mar captured me immediately, though. What was rare about this ""career-defining performance"" was that I did not see Ledger on screen at all. I saw Ennis from beginning to end. I had more trouble with Gyllenhaal--I just kept seeing Donnie Darko. But, eventually, I was able to suspend my disbelief and accept him as Jack Twist.For me, this film was a haunting one...meaning that it didn't settle into my heart right away. I didn't leave the theatre saying ""that was a great film."" I was more like ""hmmm."" But it haunted me for days after watching it. Ennis would pop into my heart at odd moments (still, even now), and it's hard for me to describe the feeling...of having loved and lost something that can never be recovered. I connected with him as I have connected with characters in novels. I miss him.Re: the gay stuff. I can't really comment on is this a ""gay"" story or a ""love"" story or whatever. I do know that it didn't really matter to me that they were two guys. What I was more interested in was Ennis' inability to commit to Jack (and everything else in his life) and Jack's desire to commit. The gay thing was almost like a plot device...an excuse for Ennis not to commit. But, that's all it was...an excuse.I'm not sure if this film is at the level of ""The Ice Storm"" in the eyes of the critics. But, personally, it affected me more deeply. I guess it's because I'm a romantic at heart, and this is a romantic film.It still haunts me.",,Anonymous,Romance

Strong performances and solid direction are ultimately dogged by a weak screenplay,"'Brokeback Mountain' is a love parable set over twenty years, focusing on two men as they yearn for each other. The film has picked up a strong amount of steam and is likely to win at least one major Academy Award. The film features, undeniably, extremely strong performances along with some nicely done technical awards. It is in the screenplay and story that it falls apart.Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) is a quiet cowboy from Wyoming who is looking to get some money for a job watching over sheep. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a gregarious, youthful man from Texas who wants the same job. At first the two just drink a beer together then go up to the mountains. As they quietly observe the scenery of Brokeback Mountain they slowly unravel their lives to one another - only to have a sudden sexual experience that neither of them can understand. The men can not deny or accept their passion for one another and once the job is done Del Mar goes off and marries his sweetheart Alma (Michelle Williams). Twist goes back to rodeo and there picks up the dashing and wealthy Lureen (Anne Hathaway). The two eventually settle down and start families until one day Del Mar receives a letter from Twist, reminding him of their passion. They each make excuses that they are ""fishing buddies"" while they go up to the mountains to share the passion amongst themselves. Things go awry as the two men are heartbroken over the fact that they can never be together even though they crave it so. An interesting idea, but one that unfortunately doesn't work out as best as possible.'Brokeback Mountain' is based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx. Short is the key word here. The screenplay by Larry McCurthy and Diane Ossana feels stretched out. The film covers the personal tales of these two men over a span of twenty years as they fade in and out of bitter relationships and fight with those around them. The film feels like a replay of everything - running at 2 hours and 15 minutes it's not exactly short. The problem is that after a certain period of time the audience understands that these two men will never be together, even though Twist may come up with an idealistic future. The photography of the mountains is well done by master Rodrigo Prieto ('25th Hour', 'Alexander') although it seems the imagery of the mountains does most of the work. The film has a melody to it's visual technique but that's not enough to save the flawed script that overreaches. This is not to say there aren't any positive elements to the film.The performances are nothing short of great. Ledger gives a strong, somber performance as a man who has dirt because he doesn't know how to get what he wants. Also sublime is Williams as the tormented wife who loves her husband but only wants him to love her back. Similarly impressive are the other two cast members. Lee, as a director, has established himself already. Here here adds to his filmography, providing a subtle view to the story. His ability to get strong performances out of his lead actors is unfaltering, as is his ability to tell a story about outsiders.'Brokeback Mountain' is interesting. It's a slow, quiet film that takes it's time. But what exactly is the right amount of time? With some strong performances, neat technical details, and solid direction 'Brokeback Mountain' had a recipe for something better... too bad it didn't quite take it.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I had a similar reaction at the end of (also) Ang Lee's ""Wedding Banquet"", when Winston Chao's father raised his hands over his body in response to the airport metal detectors, and that was the final shot...taking wing into eternity.Even more compelling was how that same actor in a different and later Ang Lee film was the one who bagged the young, elfin mom much to our surprise in ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman.""Ounce-for-ounce, I think Ang is one of the most talented directors working today.

The little film that could...,"I have never before seen a movie that compelled me to write something like this. I've seen a ton of movies; some were great, some were good, some were pretty terrible. In the end, they all just became another film I saw. Brokeback was the surprising--and I suppose long awaited--exception that I never thought would come...I am incredibly thankful to have seen this. Honestly, and it's a little shameful to say now, I'm not sure I would have seen this if it didn't get all the attention it did. Thank goodness for all the awards! :) In 4 words: blew me away--completely. Go see it now...run if you have to! Not convinced? Then let's continue this review, eh? I have never felt so devastated by a film, so alone, so heartbroken. I can't remember ever crying all out in a movie (a few lumps in the throat for others that would quickly pass), but this did it. So many of those scenes...their power and emotion, they were just simply too much.Forget all your pre-conceived notions about this movie: it is NOT a gay cowboy movie, and there is not an instance where the supposed ""gay agenda"" is promoted. It simply presents to you a raw slice of a few tormented lives, and leaves all the conclusions for you to consider. And think you will.I was haunted by this film. Not really noticeable at first, it faded, even the feeling that accompanied the burst of tears in-film, so I assumed Brokeback was just another great film that, in 10 year's time, I would only recall that I had watched and liked thoroughly. But suddenly, yesterday in bed, images came unbidden, dialog echoed up from my abruptly aching heart...and to hell with how guys should act, I cried a little more! What inspires all this praise for Brokeback? Never mind the flawless scenery shot here in Alberta in the Rockies, never mind the sublime story it is based off of by Annie Proulx, ignore even, if it is possible, Ang Lee's masterful direction: it is the acting that carries everything, hands down. Heath and Jake are absolutely convincing in their depiction of two people utterly in love, and the supporting women are just as nuanced in their performances.There is such a great emphasis in this film in the importance of what is not said and what is not done; movies typically garner reactions based on what happens. Here, the most poignant moments are what could have been, because it is ever the sadness of regret and missed opportunities that tear most deeply. Here, silences articulate more than any words could, whole stories can be written about each glance, and each little gesture carries immense weight.This is a movie of subtleties that beg for discussion afterwards. It deserves all the accolades and awards, and deserves more. Brokeback Mountain is a landmark film, yes, mainstream in its appeal, universal, honest, and best of all, unforgettable.In summary: this is a film made for repeat viewings. Open your mind, and give it a shot--there is nothing to lose, but so much to gain! :)",,Anonymous,Romance
best movie to be released in recent years,"I didn't know what to really expect going into this movie. I saw it a few months ago after all the awards hoopla. Generally a cynic, I have to say I was taken completely by surprise. The movie is very slow moving compared to most major movies nowadays. At the beginning I wondered if I would be able to stand sitting through all of it. However, it became completely enthralling. I really was drawn into the characters of Ennis and Jack. Heath Ledger's acting was superb. It's rare to empathize so deeply with a character in movies these days, like you do with Ennis. The cinematography was beautiful. Seeing it on the big screen I really felt I was sitting on the Wyoming mountain watching them.

"Great directing, good actors, lousy story","THere's been a lot of talk about ""Crash"" winning best picture and how the academy awarded it out of homophobia. Frankly, I can see why they would award it to that picture over Brokeback Mountain.Brokeback Mountain is a good film. Brokeback Mountain won Ang Lee the award for best director and he definitely deserved it. However, I found the story itself to be downright depressing. Both Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are great in their respective roles, and so are the actresses that play their wives. I'll go as far as saying that the acting in this is wonderful, especially on the part of Ledger.However, the short story and the script are both very, very depressing. The film goes from racy to just plain sad through the film, ending with the final shot at the end. Were this a story about a man and a woman or a woman and a woman I would be writing the same thing. If anything this film is saying ""homosexuality leads to sorrow"" which is especially sad. I know several homosexual couples where this is the exact opposite. I wouldn't really praise this as Hollywood's coming out. It's more like a well dressed gay bash.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Leave your prejudice at home and go and see it.,"I saw the film in Basel, Switzerland. The first evening the film was in town, completely full room. Adolescents, couples, older and younger. All there to see a film about a secretive relationship, a forbidden one between two men. I heard no nervous laughs in the room during the less common scenes of sex and love between two men as a friend had told me she heard in another town. I think most felt like me: the story took me with it. The characters are well built, strong and simple, their love was real and complete as their suffering with all that prejudice stuck in deep ignorance. They also suffered and made people suffer around them for trying so hard to live the so called ""normal"" lives. I believe this film may help many people to realise that homosexual relationships can be as beautiful and deep as any beautiful and deep heterosexual one and of course as superficial as the later as well. The main difference may be the freedom we all give it to happen and to allow it to be accepted and to grow.

Relationships,"Based on Brokeback and Crouching Tiger I believe Lee is better showing representational relationships than the real thing. Westerns, gangster movies, teenage love films, have used this method for years to bypass building stories. Viewers assume the lone cowboy and rancher girl will fall in love, the hard-bitten gangster moll has a heart of gold, etc. Lee wants us to assume facts about the marriages of the two cowboys but gives us little more than cliché. Neither marriage succeeded as a relationship I could believe in and that removed the reality of the cowboy's love for each other. Did these guys really love anyone? It might have been better to make their meetings strictly sexual trysts (as they were portrayed when in action) and skip the love angle because I couldn't figure out if they loved each other or loved the sex or loved being loners and used that to get out of facing the world, another unexplored angle. A pet peeve: reaction shots to show us what to think about what is going on. Such shots tell me the director believes that the characters and script need help, as in the closeup of the daughter's face toward the end of the film displaying adoration of her father. If she had shown a fraction of understanding of him, empathy, even sympathy, it might have worked, but why use that shot at all? Let us think what we think.

The Blind Men and the (Brokeback) Elephant,"Putting aside for a moment whether ""Brokeback Mountain"" is or is not a good movie, it has certainly stirred up a fascinating (and in some cases, disturbing) range of conflicting reactions. Reading the various reviews, I keep thinking of the old parable of the blind men and the elephant: one grabs hold of the trunk and thinks an elephant is like a snake, one grabs a leg and thinks an elephant is like a tree, another feels the body and thinks an elephant is like a wall, etc. (In the case of ""Brokeback Mountain,"" there are also some who've never touched the elephant at all but are nevertheless adamant that it must be a foul and disgusting creature!)Frankly, I'm more than a little puzzled by the intense controversy surrounding an Academy Award nominated film dealing with homosexual content within a decade of a movie such as ""Boys Don't Cry,"" and a couple of decades after ""The Crying Game"" and ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" (not to mention FORTY YEARS after ""Midnight Cowboy""!). By now, can't we all accept that it is possible to make good, artistic, meaningful films about the human condition that deal with homosexuality? And isn't the only ""agenda"" that really matters whether or not the treatment is honest?""Brokeback Mountain,"" both Annie Proulx' short story and the movie adaptation, is an attempt to create an honest, powerful but starkly unromantic love story. Two macho ranch hands find themselves caught up in a profound and inescapable love for each other that is the great passion of their lives. For reasons both personal and cultural, they are never able to come to terms with it. Their needs, their desires, and their responsibilities are in conflict for the rest of their lives, and the imperfect decisions they make have painful consequences for themselves and their families. Apart from the obvious requirement of at least a minimal amount of open-mindedness toward the subject matter, the movie requires that a viewer be able to respond to a love story without the traditional romantic elements; to a pacing that is often slow and langorous (which allows the environment to mirror and magnify the emotions of the characters); to reticent characters who are uncomfortable and usually awkward at expressing their real feelings; and to drama that is often conveyed through non-verbal communication and what ISN'T being said. (In my case, it was also necessary to shrug off a couple of false-note scenes -- such as Ennis heroically punching out the grotesque biker on the 4th of July, or Jack putting his obnoxious father-in-law in his place at Thanksgiving -- which seemed too contrived and stereotypical to fit in with the stark realism of the rest of the story.)For those of us who touch this aspect of ""Brokeback Mountain,"" it is a great tragic love story: original, honest and extremely moving (and also the best film nominated for an academy award this year). If enough people respond to ""Brokeback Mountain"" in this way, it will be regarded in years to come as one of the few classic American films of this era.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Very powerful and moving, one of the best films of 2005!","I have just heard so much about ""Brokeback Mountain"", it is crazy. People were either excited to see it or protesting against it's homosexuality theme and all the awards this movie is going up for, the girls at my work and I had to see it and saw this movie last night. You know, I really liked it. I've said it before and I'll say it again, 2005 wasn't the best year for movies, and I'm not just saying this, but I felt that Star Wars, King Kong, and now Brokeback Mountain so far are the only real decent movies to see.The great thing about Brokeback Mountain for those who are uncomfortable with it's themes, the love story between Jack and Ennis is not rubbed in your face in any way. For me, I thought it was extremely touching and real, they had a very strong love for each other. I felt awful for Jack, probably because I can understand since this has happened to a couple of my friends, because he loved Ennis so much and wanted to make their relationship work, but Ennis kind of rejected that thought and just wanted to get back to his normal life. Only seeing Jack 4 or 5 times a year and then going back home to his wife and two girls and just acting like nothing ever happened.The performances in this movie are terrific, all the actors gave it their best shot at becoming who their characters were. The pictures of Brokeback Mountain were just beautiful and relaxing to watch. The whole story is a wonderful one and I would highly recommend this film any day. I hope it does win an Oscar or two. :D10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A bit too slow perhaps but engaging, beautifully filmed, well acted and touching in a low-key and repressed way","1963. Two men meet for the first time as they enter the employment of Joe Aguirre to tend his flock of sheep as they graze over the coming months. Although forestry rules establish set camps across the land, Aguirre wants his flocks guarded against predators day and night so, while Ennis tends camp and prepares meals etc, Jack stays high on the mountain with the flock, returning only for meals. Few words are exchanged between the two as the weeks go by. Despite this though they develop an easy chemistry and, one night when they have both had too much whisky to go back to the flock, they share a bed together for warmth. One night of rough fumbling and spit-lubricated sex later and they wake the next morning with assurances of it being a ""one shot deal"". However, the first time done, it becomes easier to do it again and the pair become lovers. The season ends early due to impending storms and the two split with barely a word; Ennis to his marriage and Jack back to his rodeo riding. However the events on the mountain stay with them both.Perhaps it says more about me than anything else, but when I heard a year or so back that someone was making a ""gay western"" I assumed that it would be a horrid attempt at camp comedy. As to why Ang Lee was doing it seemed beyond me (although he had done Hulk so anything seemed possible). However watching it I quickly caught on that this story is not beyond him at all and is in fact an area he has touched on in several of his films thus far  repression, desire and hidden longing from people trying to be one thing in public and another behind tightly closed doors. The film opens with barely a word and continues in the same vein, although it engaged me with this approach from start to finish, I must admit that I felt the story was a little slower than it needed to be and was being a bit self-indulgent with all its pauses and silences. However the viewers mostly likely to be put off by the requirement of patience are most likely to the same ones already put off by the subject matter.The story is simple and exists in the hearts of the two men. The film is enjoyable as it builds to the sex and, although unconvincing in ""how"" and ""why"" it happens, it gets passed it well and before long it has become more about the feelings than the sex. This makes the film last because it makes it work regardless of sexuality and regardless of the audience's view of homosexuality. Essentially it comes down to the effect on the two men of living a form of lie and this makes the second half of the film as engaging as it is heart breaking to watch. Again, going slower than it needs to (but still covering a couple of decades in about 80 minutes) the film shows Ennis and Jack trying to fill the gap left by the other but still finding nothing better than one another, despite the risks. There are no dramatic falls or even that many high-volume confrontations but it does just show the pain inside them really well and Ang Lee allows the actors the space and the wide frames to work within to show it.Ledger is excellent and dominates the film with a quiet pain that is tangible. Working with mumbles and few expressions of emotion, he shows so much with his eyes and his body language that it makes his character very easy to feel for. The times where the emotion does spill out is just as convincing and compelling. Gyllenhaal weirdly has a showier role but is less interesting. His story is less interesting and his more animated performance doesn't set as well as Ledger's does with Lee's direction and the restrained tone of the film. The two have a good chemistry together and have both done well to keep their relationship natural and easy to care about. Support is generally very good despite having a few famous faces in roles so small that I wondering if some of their material had been cut out (Quaid for example). Williams is very good, initially confused but gradually angry and hurt at being cut off; like Ledger she does a lot without saying much. Mara's performance suggests that should Julia Roberts ever break, we have a replacement already tested and ready to go. Lee's direction very much suits the material and he uses the washed out landscapes to give the film a cold feel that compliments the performances and contrasts nicely with the moments of passion and emotion experienced on the mountainside.This won't be to everyone's tastes and many audiences will not even try to get past the ""gay western"" badge; likewise even some watching it might struggle with the glacial pace it consistently has. However the story and the pace is in the characters and they (and their relationship) are drawn out in painfully real terms. The performances are strong and, considering the pin-up credentials of both men, brave. Lee's direction is slow but the result is a story that is engaging, painful and quite touching despite the fact that everything is delivered in a very muted and low-key way.",,Anonymous,Romance
The best film of 2005.,"I first saw ""Brokeback Mountain"" when it first opened in theaters, late last year. I left the cinema shaken, and not exactly sure what to say. As I lay awake that night, my mind remained stuck on this film. No matter how hard I tried, I could not shake this tragic and powerful tale. I began to wonder: What happens to these characters after the credits begin to roll? When a movie buries itself so thoroughly into your subconscious, you know that it is something special. In the summer of 1963, young ranch hands Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) are signed on to work together on a Wyoming mountain range. At first, their relationship is strained, with Jack having to coax the shy Ennis into speaking. Soon, their bond deepens into something that neither of them expected: they fall in love. Once the summer ends, Ennis marries his fiancée, Alma Beers (Michelle Williams), and Jack weds spoiled rodeo queen Lureen. Through the eventual unhappiness and heartbreak that follows, the two risk their careers and lives by trying, once and for all, to follow their hearts in a time of discrimination.Plain and simple: This film is a masterpiece, as only a sturdy and brave filmmaker like Ang Lee could deliver. He's in control at every turn. The pacing, the silences, the tears... Not since ""Ordinary People"" have I seen a movie that so truthfully and beautifully embraces the human spirit. These are not characters, these are real people. Real enough to make legions to moviegoers around the world care, listen, and feel.The performances are uniformly strong. Michelle Williams's startlingly moving work may be just what she needed to have a long and healthy career. She is brilliant as Alma, Ennis's unhappy wife. The expression on Williams's face when Alma discovers Jack and Ennis kissing is chilling in its accuracy. Williams builds the character's growing angst, cumulating in an outburst that feels organic. I don't know how Williams prepared for this scene, but it has to be seen to be believed. Anne Hathaway also shines as Lureen, Jack's trophy wife. As we see Lureen's gradual descent into animosity, Hathaway's performance reaches its peak during a phone conversation between Lureen and Ennis. She's excellent.The rest of the cast is great, too. In a textbook example of ensemble acting, there are no slouchers here. Randy Quaid is stern and cold as Jack and Ennis's boss. The luminous Linda Cardellini, with approximately 15 to 20 lines, creates a believable human being in Cassie. Kate Mara is astonishing as Ennis's loyal daughter, leaving a lasting impression with only a handful of scenes. Anna Faris is refreshing and hilarious as LaShawn, Lureen's talkative friend. Finally, Canadian actress Roberta Maxwell makes a brief yet unforgettable appearance as Jack's mother. In a later scene with Ennis, she puts her hand on his shoulder, and whispers something to him. What she says, and how she says it, will send shivers down your spine.However, the film belongs to Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Jake Gyllenhaal is spirited and earnest as Jack, playing him as a caring soul. Jack wants nothing more than to be with Ennis, knowing full well that it's impossible. It is when Jack becomes bitter and angry that Gyllenhaal's portrayal hits its stride. At the risk of sounding like a cliché, Ledger's Ennis del Mar is the soul of this picture, and he could not be more stunning. Who would have expected Ledger - whose credits include ""10 Things I Hate About You"", ""A Knight's Tale"", and the acclaimed ""Monster's Ball"" - to deliver a performance of such depth and frightening understanding? Ennis is a man who lies to himself for so long, only to realize that he has wasted his life, and possibly ruined the life of those he loves. Ledger makes this internal variance feel palpable and transcendent, using masterful choices in voice and body language to create a man who is conflicted with himself. This is a focused and thrilling performance that will go down in history.Technically, the film is flawless. The costumes are well-suited to the characters, and are carefully aged with the story, as well as the make-up and hair. The cinematography, by Rodrigo Prieto, flawlessly captures the breathtaking landscapes, as well as the nuances of the story. The sparse score by Gustavo Santaolalla is haunting in its simplicity. The editing, by Geraldine Peroni and Dylan Tichenor, is smooth and the pace is neither rushed nor sluggish.As great as the production values are, none of it would matter if it were not for Ang Lee. Lee wisely starts the movie on an awkward note, illuminating Jack and Ennis's uncomfortable connection with one another. Once the plot finds its direction, the story moves swiftly through the decades, without ever feeling either static or intermittent. Lee finds the genuineness and clarity in the story, and gets miraculous results from his cast and production team. The themes that the film sets itself upon are tricky. One wrong look, one wrong note, and the whole thing could collapse under its own weight. Lee does not let this happen. It is also to his credit that the love scenes between the two men are as tasteful and romantic as they deserve to be.As the film draws to a close, the final scenes are played with a perfect, bittersweet note that subtly hints at what could have been, and what may be. And it all occurs without ever coming off as histrionic. Every once in a while, a movie is released that, for all intents and purposes, is flawless. A movie that is poetic, profound, skillfully made, and deeply felt. A movie that so diligently shakes the viewer to their very core, that is seems all but destined to become a classic. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is one of those movies. It's the best film of 2005, and it should not be forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's a good movie, but...","Yesterday I saw Brokeback mountain, and sure, it is a good movie, but not an extraordinary one. I don't see the fuss this movie has risen all over. Up points: The gay topic is told with respect, and quite normally. It's the common love story, but where lovers are both males. Photography is astonishing, with broad angles and breathtaking landscapes. Down points: There is some abuse of landscapes. The big fault to me lies in the time line: while Twist and Del Mar have kids, they don't look like significantly older, even after years of hard work by Mr Del Mar. Mr Twist grew a mustache, and that should be it, says Ang Lee. It's a good movie to watch, but it won't go to my favorites.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautifully crafted, poignant drama","Brokeback Mountain is a beautifully crafted, poignant drama. It has a strong, uncomplicated, unsentimental story line with rural settings and themes. According to Annie Proulx, the author of the short story upon which the movie is based, the overriding theme is destructive rural homophobia.I put Brokeback Mountain into a very special class of movies that I call simplistic yet powerful rural dramas: The Last Picture Show, What's Eating Gilbert Grape?, and The Trip to Bountiful. The specific plots have little in common, of course, but each has characters whose actions are dictated by values of a changing rural society within a given time frame. All of these movies have realistic dialog within an uncomplicated story line, are well acted and directed, and have affected me deeply. They are movies I watch again and again.The main characters of Brokeback Mountain are young, poor Wyoming ranch hands named Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist. During summer 1963 while working on the mountain, isolated and carefree from the rest of the world, they become good friends and eventually fall in love with each other. Once they come down from the mountain, they are confronted with a rural society that shuns such a relationship. They go separate ways, find wives, and have children. They meet again and struggle to keep their love alive. Their decisions, or lack of them, to circumvent the perceived wrath of society, affect not only themselves but their families, the results of which constitute the remaining dramatic action of the movie.Seemingly ordinary conversations and often subtle interaction among characters carry the movie along. Although the action may seem slow at first, you must remain observant or you will miss the nuances, the clandestine glances, and the caring smiles that foreshadow a growing intimacy. The pace quickens after they come down from the mountain, but nothing is superfluous; each new scene and character provides more insight into Jack and Ennis and works to move the plot toward the climax. I attribute the effective transition to Ang Lee, the director.The major actors (Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, and Anne Hathaway) are very convincing and have received much praise for their contributions to the movie's critical success. Also very impressive are the actors in the minor roles. Linda Cardellini, Kate Mara. Roberta Maxwell, and Peter McRobbie have very few lines apiece but deliver them effectively and allow us to embrace four well rounded characters.Brokeback Mountain touches upon many other themes: true love, regret, masculinity, infidelity, repression, denial, loneliness, family relationships, and sexual orientation. Gorgeous mountains, impoverished small towns, and lonely ranches serve as backdrops. The movie has much to offer.It is, however, NOT an easy movie to digest. You have to think about it, internalize it, and maybe see it more than once. I have already seen it many times and I like it better each time. I always see something new in the acting or the depiction of a scene.It is not an action movie. It is a drama. It is poignant as well as a beautiful work of art. If you let yourself become involved in its story, Brokeback Mountain will deeply affect you.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Dull, boring, and amazingly overrated.","I wanted to watch Brokeback Mountain for one simple reason. I enjoy watching movies that have a big buzz or controversy surrounding them. This had both. I read some amazing reviews from many different critics as well. Being a straight 17 year old male, I obviously took a lot of grief from my friends when I mentioned wanting to see this movie. However, I still sat down and watched it...What a huge mistake that was. It was the longest and most torturing 134 minutes of my life. I mean don't get me wrong, I've seen far worse movies, but at least they were so bad they were good. They half way entertained me. This movie did nothing for me.What was good about Brokeback Mountain? The film making and cinematography. Ang Lee was better here than with Hulk, that's for sure. The sets and the way it was filmed were done really well. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were good in their roles. I mean, anytime an actor plays a role that's something they're not, be it gay, handicapped, a serial killer or a drug addict, they have to be a good actor to pull it off believably. They succeeded with that.What was bad? Everything else. The story, the dialogue, the way it flowed, everything. Nothing happens throughout the movie. I could sum it up with ""They meet, they fall in love, they continue to meet until the movie ends"". Really, everything else was just stretched from there. I'm trying so hard to think of how to put this like an actual critic would, but I can't. It was boring! It sucked! I couldn't wait for it to end, and when it did I was relieved.I can't believe all the amazing things that were said about this movie. I think people just gave it praise because they wanted to fit in.

Brokeback Mountain is the only one that keeps in our minds for weeks and we are still talking about it: the characters, the dialogs, and the ending.There are some questions left unanswered in this movie, but that's the beauty of it.

Entire Movie,"To quote Ennis, ""You know I ain't queer"", so I reluctantly watched this movie. (I don't mean to imply that you are gay if you wanted to see the movie.)

I can't help believing that if all of the academy voters had actually watched the movie (some critics a say many don't) it would have won every award it was nominated for. Jake's expression when Ennis rode off the next morning expressed more than a 1000 words could. Ennis' emotions when he broke down, telling Jake ""You're the reason I'm like this"".

"An Incredible, thought provoking and beautifully acted piece of Cinema.","Like nearly everyone who has seen this film it left me sobbing for about an hour after it. Since then it has affected everything I've done in the past 4 days. When I sit at work, talk to workmates, speak to family, eat my meals, lie in bed at night, it is there on my mind.I've seen it twice since and although I am still so sad I am beginning to feel that there's some sort of hope in the end for Ennis.In the moment he agrees to go to Alma Jnr's wedding he opens up to her for the first time, asking her about love. I feel this is a redemption for him and hope that:1. He'll realise that they and their mother loved him too. 2. That he'll maybe make a life which will include Alm Jnr & Jenny 3 That he'll make his peace with Alma Snr 4. That he'll visit Jacks Mother again.I don't think he'll look for another Jack, I think that was his one true love.It saddens me to think about it all , but I get hope when I read the many warm and heartfelt comments on this and other sites. (just take a look around the net and you'll see gay, straight, male , female old and young people saying how they were moved to tears by this film.I think in time this film will be hailed as the one that changed so many people's perceptions about not only gay love but LOVE in general.

"Unpredictable and uncommon love that last the times, and remains even when it ends in tragedy.","This for sure is not your typical cowboys story as it may seem when it starts out, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is something much more special. Starting out in 1963 in rural Wyoming a simple summer friendship is formed by two innocent cowboys by the name of Ennis Del Mar(Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist(Jake Gyllenhaal) only this summer encounter will turn into a lifelong connection of love and friendship. After the summer course of work ends, both return back to their old grounds and each begin new directions. Jack returns to Texas to enjoy the life of a rodeo cowboy and falls in love and marries a sexy and wealthy female(Anne Hathaway) and he begins a family. Ennis stays in Wyoming and marries his old school love(Michelle Williams) and a family of children begins right away, and Ennis has to continue to work hard as a ranch hand. Ennis then four years into his normal world receives a postcard, then him and Jack revisit and again start to have wonderful encounters every so often at Brokeback, this finally costs Ennis his wife. Anyway this strong bond continues year after year as each man goes along with the changes joys and heartbreaks so commonly associated with everyday life. When tragedy strikes and Ennis finds out about the fate of Jack, the emotional love lasts and you get an emotional feel at the tribute that Ennis gives to Jack at the end. I must say great movie and well done especially good acting from Ledger and Gyllenhaal who make both Ennis and Jack such likable characters that you feel emotions for and you feel their hurt. Also way to go for director Ang Lee for having the courage to take on the topic of gay cowboy love, especially the way he directed in the setting of a conservative Wyoming in the 1960's. Lee really proved that love is possible for anyone and that any human being can love another human being no matter who they are.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Heath Ledger's performance is quite impressed, he seem to be really grown up when comparing to his old movies. Although Jake Gyllenhaal dosen't really look like a 39 years-old man, but in the movie, he and Heath did act like they love each other and really want to be together. Most people say Michelle Williams did a brilliant job, i think she's average.

Love is true in this movie!,"I went in to see Brokeback Mountain with an air of skepticism because I was very uncomfortable with seeing two men on screen in a romantic movie. But I went in to this movie not realizing how profound and amazing this movie truly is. After the first half hour you feel completely at ease about this movie and you are successfully sucked in to the storyline and the love between these two men. Ang Lee really made this movie a picture of accuracy and real world situations that documents how being a gay man, especially a cowboy, is not socially acceptable and how this effected the two main characters of this movie. The story is touching, moving, upsetting, and exciting all at the same time and the movie was beautifully shot, put together, soundtrack is amazing, actors took my breath away with their amazing abilities.

It washed over me like the tide, and left me speechless in it's wake. And I was not alone- the entire cinema sat still, motionless as the credits were rolling.With every tiny detail, carefully and skillfully constructed by Ang Lee, his vision for this story not so much sprung to life, but burrowed deep into your reality. An intense feeling of longing and eventually heart wrenching despair builds, but still, a sense of simple beauty remains.The reality that these two star crossed lovers are men becomes irrelevant.

the movie is missing many things,"I just finished watching Brokeback Mountain. I really enjoyed the film and felt for the characters. However, I found some problems throughout the film that I would like to point out.First off, they jump into this raunchy sex scene for no reason. When the movie starts, both of the characters are in the wilderness and don't even seem to really like each other. There is no flirting whatsoever. Even if the writer intended to keep their love for each other a secret, after the secret is told they still continue to not display any actions that express their love for one another. It's just strange how the movie jumps from two men just having to work together to a surprise sex session in the tent. There was only, perhaps, three scenes of actual flirting, when they were wrestling, when Ennis put his arm around Jack, and towards the end right before Jack is hurt by Ennis not running away with him. However, they just end up talking like two friends most of the movie, just not enough holding each other, kissing, or staring at each other. And Ennis is impossible to understand, he just mumbles everything.Another problem I had with the film was when Jack visits Ennis. Filled with joy, Ennis grabs Jack and pushes him up against the wall making someone watching this movie believe Ennis is grabbing Jack to push him away from the house to share a passionate kiss. But, the push just ends up putting Ennis and Jack in front of his porch for Ennis' wife to catch them kiss. I feel this part sort of tricked viewers and was just too soon for his wife to find out.I'm surprised in the end that the parents didn't realize that Ennis was Jack's gay lover. But, maybe they did, I'm not really sure. I felt that it wasn't made clear what happened to Jack, did he die from a beating because someone found out he was gay or because of the accident Jack's wife describes? Was that just a painful thought Ennis had about Jack's demise?Despite many problems with the film, I still did enjoy it overall. There were just a few problems with it, but I think the cinematography was spectacular and the talented two actors saved the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Powerful and poignant. I wish it knew how to quit haunting my thoughts,"""If you can't fix it, Jack, you gotta stand it""So goes the adage that Brokeback Mountain's tragic central character, Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger), lives by. In the summer of '63, two aspiring ranch hands with little to no prospects find themselves work herding sheep upon picturesque Brokeback Mountain. It is a place of desperate loneliness, and as much to their surprise as ours, the two men form a connection over that summer that develops to a lifelong relationship. ""Brokeback got us good,"" remarks Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), during their first reunion that occurs only after four years of longing have passed since the day he and Ennis bade each other gut-wrenching goodbyes. By this time, both men have moved on and married: Ennis to his sweetheart Alma Beers (Michelle Williams) and Jack to rodeo queen Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway). They are marriages more of convenience that anything else  society would never, ever accept a relationship such as the one they share in secret.Ennis knows this better than any other, having been forced by his father at the tender age of nine to look upon the dried up corpse of a man beaten to death by tire iron when it became common knowledge he was living with another man. Over the next twenty years, we watch as Ennis and Jack retreat for fishing trips on Brokeback Mountain, where little fishing is done and where Ennis discovers that he is never as fulfilled as when he's in the company of Jack Twist, drinking whiskey under the moonlight. Despite any romantic ideas Jack might have that the two could settle down together, Ennis, scarred by his experience as a boy, repeatedly pushes Jack away so as to deny himself the happiness of being with the one person he truly, deeply loves. By the time the film closes, you cannot help but feel your heart has been ripped out of your chest: raw, same as Ennis.With Brokeback Mountain, all the aspects of film-making combine coherently to paint a visual expression of Annie Proulx's sparse prose under Ang Lee's delicate, consummate guidance. Writers Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana don't just adapt the 30-page short story; they expand upon it to fill a two-hour feature, by adding crucial moments that flesh out character and underline drama. Against a backdrop of Rodrigo Prieto's picture-perfect cinematography and Gustavo Santaolalla's emotive, expressive score, the young cast impresses. Gyllenhaal's frustration is palpable, Williams' devastation is incredibly powerful and sympathetic, but the phenomenon here is Heath Ledger: all clenched fist and clenched mouth. It's such an impossibility for him to express emotion that when he does, with his final promise to Jack, it breaks your heart.After leaving the cinema screening of Brokeback Mountain, I was haunted for weeks by its emotional resonance. Upon a second viewing on DVD, it elicits an even greater reaction. I simply cannot comprehend how, as Ang Lee's obvious masterpiece and what has developed into the most acclaimed film in motion picture history, the Academy could fail to honour this touching, tragic, universally powerful story that carries with it  but never preaches  an important message about love it's own Best Picture statue. It's a travesty we can't fix; a shame we have to stand.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is the best film I've seen in 20 years.  It is first-rate cinematic storytelling.,"I've seen this film three times and will probably see it at least once or twice more in the next few weeks. I haven't been able to get it out of my head. It is a story of unexpected passion, intimacy and the lack of it, poverty, what it means to be a man, thwarted lives, and the infinite ways in which human beings bring sorrow to each other. I have thought about it, written about it at length and sung its praises to everyone I know.Heath Ledger gives a jaw-droppingly moving performance as Ennis Del Mar, a deeply repressed and wounded soul. Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist is more open, less repressed and more opportunistic, but equally tragic. Watch everyone carefully in this film, as all of the acting is top notch.This film takes one of our country's most defining myths--the wide open promise of the West, and the heroism of the rugged individual as embodied in the image of the cowboy--and turns it upside down. BROKEBACK gives us a whole new look at these old stories that we've told ourselves about who and what we are, showing us a new perspective on what it all means. The story illuminates the dark corners where the myths break down, where rugged individualism means keeping your mouth shut and staying out of the way, and where the wide open promise of the west means isolation, loneliness and limitations. And as the story unfolds, we see how this myth celebrates and simultaneously strangles our understanding of what it is to be a real man.I've been sadly disappointed in the response I've heard from many so-called ""straight"" men, who, when I've encouraged them to see the movie, have dismissed the idea outright. They're frightened by the idea of seeing gay sex on the screen. All I can say is, they're damn fools to let their fear keep them from seeing this first-rate film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The gay issue is simply incidental.,"Let's be clear about something. Late night talk show hosts can poke fun all they want at gay issues but this film is simply a well made and leisurely paced film about love and its consequences. The gay issue, as far as I'm concerned, is simply incidental. I didn't care if it was a story about gay love, straight love, animal love, alien love, materialistic love or any other kind of love. And if you doubt this, ask yourself one simple question. Would Heath Ledger's wife in the film have left him if she discovered he was in love with another woman instead of with another man? Probably. Adultery is adultery. Director Ang Lee took hold of this material and deliberately took his time to tell a story about two lonely and extremely ordinary people and articulated the sensitivity of the perceived issues on screen and treated them with brief visual images of the controversy and made solid acting and acceptable sentimentality rule the screen.",,Anonymous,Romance
Can't stop thinking about it,"I went to see this a few months ago. I was fairly exited to see it, since Ang Lee was the director. (One of the good ones, in my opinion). I was the youngest person in the movie theater, but lost all interest in the fact as soon as the movie started. The movie captured me at once, from the every first minute till the last. The film was like a beautiful, slow dance. My eyes refused to even blink, it was so pleased with the beautiful photographing of nature, cities and people. The acting blew my mind! Jake Gyllenhaal was a playful, wild but sweet rodeo-guy. Heath Ledger hands down won the whole movie as his role as the quick guy with a deep inner pain. The story was heart breaking. It was a beautiful love story about fear, confusion and hopelessness. The love-couple knew what would make them happy, but it was too frightening, to odd, that they refused to do it, they just couldn't accept what would make them happy, so it was just a affair full of despair. And that, my friends, was painful to watch. That's what struck right through me. I left the movie theater amazed, and my head filled with thoughts. Till this day I can't stop thinking about it. In my opinion, this might be one of the best movies of the year of 2005. I was talking to someone my own age just yesterday, and told her it's one of the best recently made movies. Jake Gyllenhaal has done spectacular work before! I recommend you to watch this movie, along with ""Donnie Darko"". I give this movie 4 stars out of 5, but the whole film is, to be honest, 5-star-aqulety. Go see it if you like movies and films, in other words, a cinematic!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I remembered it was kind of slow drama, but actually this time we didn´t even manage to watch it all at once... we took several days.It is still great movie, with strong topic. Back in the days (yes a decade anf half ago), the homosexuality was still quiet a shocking topic... But somehow now, it is much more common, much more discussed... less shocking.. taking the biggest aspect of the movie away...If you have time and patience, I can recommend you watching the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
People feel obligated to like this movie,"Okay, it's a barely better than average movie, but I'm sorry. it's not great.First, am I the only one who has noticed that Heath Ledger's speech patterns are about 90% plagiarized from Billy Bob Thornton in Slingblade?Secondly, I'm sorry but it's talked about as a ""love story,"" but I didn't see the love. All I saw was two guys wanting to get into each other's pants. Two guys so obsessed with sex that they'll endanger all of the other relationships in their lives.(SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW) We learn that on their later fishing trips they didn't fish. Presumably they were humping. When people who truly love each other go on a fishing trip, there is some fishing in addition to the lovemaking.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A lifechanging movie.,"I must admit, i did not expect this to be great. I mean, i heard about the Oscar nominations, i heard people loved it but i still wasn't really psyched to see it. Last weekend changed it all as me and my girlfriend missed ""Walk the line"" and caught Brokeback Mountain instead. I just loved it, every scene, every line and every expression in this film is just so moving and drives it to new heights. From the beautiful scenic scenes down the the everyday life scenes just makes it so likable and moving. From my point of view Brokeback Mountain is not only an Oscar front runner, but a movie that can change lives and change narrow minded people.Nothing bad can be said about anything in this feature, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall is amazing and bring out the best in each other. The supporting cast is exactly that, supporting the main characters and the director Ang Lee has really outdone himself and made what i as of February 2006 declare the film of the decade. The 90's had Shawshank Redemption and the 2000's have Brokeback Mountain.Congratulations to all the involved and thank you, thank you for taking the time to perfect it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love and tragedy,"Brokeback Mountain describes the beautiful scene in which much of the story takes place. I loved it so much that I have seen it in theatres 3 times and will buy it the moment it is available. A man on the radio yesterday said parts of it pulled him in almost uncontrollably, I feel the same way and now feel like I live in it. The love story teaches us that love is universal and prejudice creates harm and fear, and tragedy. The acting was just incredible - Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were superb. I am grateful that this movie was produced, also to the writers and the director. And, to the casting professional who selected the actors.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Homophobics should watch this film!,"I think this movie is wonderful! Beginning from the plot, the very good (and good looking) protagonists, the emotional scenes and ending with the fantastic photography and the views of American environment. The meaning of the film too is touching and involve the spectator in this beautiful love-story where sexuality isn't important as some critics want to tell us defining this movie ""scandalous"". The cast on the whole is very good and dialogs are convincing notwithstanding some long periods of silence at the beginning of the movie. The last things to add are that it is a very good movie that makes people reflect about love in its noblest form and above all that this is a movie that makes people cry so bring with you many handkerchiefs!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A masterpiece!!,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is a masterpiece of a film. Everyone involved deserves kudos for bringing this brilliant film to the screen.The Academy Awards showed Hollywood's ugly side when it did not name ""Brokeback Mountain"" best picture.Most of the praise for this movie has gone to Heath Ledger and his brilliant performance. However equal praise needs to go to Jake Gyllenhaal for his amazing work in this movie. Many people have only given Jake's performance a brief mention. Well, I say pay equal attention to Jake. His Jack is the heart of this love story. He is especially amazing in their final scenes. He captures the words of Annie Proulx in their most tender scenes. While some may think it is easier to play the less intense character, I say that is not true. Jack's love, hurt, pain and bitterness come through in equal measure. He says so much with his eyes it is heartbreaking. Also, the Jack character should get attention because he is brave and is willing to live his life with the person he loves. He is not afraid of his feelings and that is so important. And while some think his aging job was not good, it is exactly accurate to the time period. And praise needs to go to Anne Hathaway. While her role is not as big, it is very important and her last scene is fantastic. Along with the wonderful Michelle Williams and her heartbreaking Alma.Overall a brilliant film that deserves all the accolades and awards it has received. Heath and Jake both make this heartbreaking and beautiful love story come to life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
True Love Story,"Being in a similar situation in my life, this movie took my heart and breath away. Ever since I first viewed it two weeks ago, it has been on my mind. It amazes me how far people will go for the love of their life; these men both knew the consequences that awaited them for their ""alternative"" life - but in the end they knew their love was a stronger force that could never be destroyed. This movie truly gave me the hope that I will one day find a love as precious as they found each other. No other movie has moved me in such a way as ""Brokeback Mountain"" - if only those ignorant and close-minded people in our world would stop to see this film, I believe many of their eyes would be opened. It is an amazing thing how this one movie can do so much. I am so satisfied and happy within the fact that they portrayed these two gay men to be in LOVE (as it truly is with most homosexual couples), and not just as some promiscuous men. This movie has truly made an impact on our time and society - may future generations see this movie and be moved by the relentless spirit of tolerance, acceptance, and more importantly - LOVE.",,Anonymous,Romance
better than Heath or Jake,"Heath Ledger did do a good job, but certainly not worthy of an Oscar! See a more realistic and intense performance by a better actor. Please see Eric Bana in ""Munich"", and, gay or not, if you like men, he is a feast for the eyes!! I do not understand why he is not mentioned as an Oscar contender. ""Brokeback"" is getting better reviews than it deserves. Anne Hathaway was not believable as a 30-something Texan, and the horrid fake blond hair she sported was very distracting. See ""Munich"" instead, for its take on relationships, and for what it has to say about our world. Please support movies that have something to teach us and get us to think.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Globe's Best Picture in Oscar Award,"Despite all the globe's choice of Brokeback Mountain as their favorite movies, the results still went crashing to the ground.We went to see this movie when it was first shown in Taiwan. At first, I still remembered that the media here promoted the movie mainly because of a Taiwanese director Ang Lee. Surprisingly, at the beginning the audience was usually straight couples, and then quickly, the movie widely spread and hit the box office in Taiwan. Who would think about it as a hit compared to those mainstreams of Hollywood popcorn movies? Later on, the Annie Proulx's novel followed on and became so popular that it's no way to get her Brokeback Mountain and Close Long in the bookstore. There was even a Brokeback Mountain syndrome that described the audience would be downcast whenever thinking about the end or listening to the soundtrack and the song.A happy-ending love story will definitely makes you smile in the cinema. But you won't remember what exactly the scene is after few months. Although I do wish these cowboys would happily live together, the ending of Brokeback Mountain seems to be much powerful and memorable for all of us, and the days in Brokeback are the most beautiful encounter. Nevertheless, Brokeback Mountain is still our Best Picture in Oscar Award.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Solid but unspectacular ...,"I must be the only person in the world not wowed by this film. It was a good film, with solid acting and decent cinematography. Based on what I heard about this film I expected a film as powerful as Mystic River, as well acted as A Beautiful Mind, and as beautiful to look at as A River Runs Through It. This film, to me, was none of the above. Don't get me wrong, the film is strong in all those areas, but does not excel in any. I suspect my underwhelming attitude stems from the fact that I am not awed that someone would write/produce/sell such a film in the U.S. I am too old to be shocked by this and too old to be impressed with the entire body of work simply because the lead characters are gay. In fact, I would hazard to guess that many people are afraid to criticize the film, fearful that they would be labeled homophobic. Call me ignorant, but I just don't get it. In addition, I suspect much of the kudos comes from Hollywood muckety-mucks patting one another on the back going, ""gee, aren't we daring and controversial.""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stays with you forever,"I saw the film months ago, a few weeks after it came out. Initially I was too numbed to cry, or even react. I knew it was a good movie, but I couldn't begin to express its beauty and heart-wrenching poignancy in words. There are aspects to this film that only reveal themselves to you when you are alone in bed, longing for someone you can't have, or wondering about that one person you could have been so happy with. It's what made me think about the film so long after I'd watched it only once. It's what made me feel longing just hearing the melancholy twang of the guitar solo theme song. It's what made me read pages of comments about the film just to know I wasn't alone in loving the characters. The tears came only afterward. I know I will still remember the longing look in Jack's eyes and the tears Ennis produced but refused to shed for the rest of my life. That is when I realized this wasn't just a film-- it is a truly transcending love story.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overrated,"I saw Brokeback Mountain and it was a good film. The acting was amazing and the story line was important, but the writing and the directing were overrated. Some scenes which were supposed to be touching were funny because the directing was awkward. The writing was cheesy, and could have been better. All in all, the film was good, but it was overrated. Still, it is worth seeing at least once because it is a film which will hopefully help the gay rights movement progress for the better. If you see the film you won't loose anything, but if you don't you won't loose anything if you are already for gay rights but if you are not then you should see it because it might give you a new perspective.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Upon second viewings, it's now one of my favorite films. I was afraid that I would get the same reaction from Brokeback. Luckily, i realize as i sit here trying to hold back the tears from a movie that ended 30 mins ago, it didn't happen. Instead i get a movie where i'm able to connect with both Jake and Heath: their quietness, their love, his unwillingness to go for what he really wants, and i'm scared. Scared that i see so much of myself in Ennis that i'll end up just like him. It scares me. Only two films have made me cry, this one and The Laramie Project. Both have effected me in different ways.

A true work of art - makes you both think and feel,"I was blown away by this film. It's so powerful and full of raw emotions that I can't shake it even several days later. I like it better and better.The story develops slowly and I started out thinking that the characters were pretty unsympathetic, but all of a sudden I was 110% emotionally invested in the story which then seemed so much more powerful exactly because no idealisation had been done.The film is tricky to read in several places and the ambiguity and the unsaid speak louder than the dialog. The attention you can feel has been paid to minute details forces you to pay attention and think both while and after you've seen the it.

Conservatives Should See this Movie,"I saw Brokeback Mountain yesterday. Although it was playing here in the suburbs, I went to see it in the city. I didn't want to hear people going ""euwwww"" during the sex and kissing scenes.I cannot add to what has already been said here in previous posts. The characters certainly were not stereotype gay men. Hollywood should show more men like this. Not all gay men are like those in Queer Eye for the Straight Guy! The thing here is that neither Jack nor Ennis chose to be gay (or bi). It just happened. Conservatives who say that being gay is a choice should see this movie. It is a story of love, loss and wanting. Unfortunately, there are millions of Ennises and Jacks out there who are attracted to men, but have gotten married and had children, because it seems that is what society and the churches say is right. They live their lives in want of what they could have had. How pitiful.I look forward to Brokeback Mountain cleaning up at the Golden Globes and at the Oscars. Bravo Mr. Lee!",,Anonymous,Romance
Ride hi-....on second thoughts; nevermind...,"Romance films aren't really my thing at the best of times - so since this is one about two men falling in love, I think I was justified about not wanting to see it. And if it wasn't for the fact that I've seen the other four 'Best Picture' nominees for 2005, I probably would have stuck to that. Anyway, I did see it; and surprisingly, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Naturally, the technical elements of the film are all spot on; acting, directing, locations etc are all good enough, so I wont bother mentioning those things too much. This isn't really a western, although it is set in the land of cowboy hats and people who drink whiskey out of the bottle; and this location choice offsets the central theme of the film. Films set in this place are usually macho affairs...which helps to make the plot line as bold as possible. The film follows the story of two ranchers that are sent up Brokeback Mountain to look after some sheep. However, the sheep quickly fail to be number one priority when the two men realise that they're more interested in each other...The angle of the film is actually quite predictable; these two 'love' each other, yet they aren't allowed to be together; thus meaning that we have a tragic film. The way the plot handles this theme with regards to the characters is rather black and white; and while they both suffer mental trauma which surfaces in violent and teary outbursts - it all feels very one-sided, and the characters don't flourish as complete wholes. I realise it's difficult to create well rounded characters in a two hour running time; but the film would have benefited immensely if we were allowed to learn a little more about the two men, besides the fact that they want one another. I can't say I cared too much about their relationship either, as it seemed a bit too cold and it's hard to believe that these two have built up such a passion for each other over a few intervals. The film seems to profess that the relationship is about each other, not just about being gay - but that doesn't actually come out until the end, and by then it feels tacked on. I'd have loved to have seen Elton John and Boy George in the leads; but those roles have gone to Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, who both act to their best under the assured direction of Ang Lee. On the whole, this film is an interesting way to spend two hours - although I can't say I'm overly impressed with it, but at least it didn't go overboard with 'tender' scenes between the leads.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Disturbing yet enchanting,"This movie was very sad and dramatic. It was awkward to see the love scenes that seem like they would never end, and to some hear how the men talked about homosexuality/bisexuality in such detail in some cases and how they were hypocritical to the idea of it when in fact they were. But towards the end, the viewer really gets a personal view of one of the gay cowboy's tragic love for the other. It was kind of scary because one of the men reminded me A lot of my father, and made me wonder...what he is doing when he goes with his friend's on trips or has to work away with them. For those with 1 sided views on how all gay/lesbian/bi people are completely ridiculous, it makes you see somewhat their side of things and the force that pushes behind uncontrollable love. However I also believe now this movie has been made which it needed to be, it doesn't need to be used as an excuse to turn gay/lesbian/bi. As seen in the movie, that is something that just happens, it is not just created.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's nice enough,"The state of drama today is frustrating. The Academy has proscribed a certain tasteful treatment of topics, with high-production values and the thrust is always ""We should be more thoughtful and polite to (the hyper-intelligent, the sub-intelligent, the misunderstood criminal, the underdog, the outcast, gay cowboys)."" Every recent drama can be inserted into that sentence. Even if I agree with those sentiments, it doesn't mean I want to sit through ensuing groups fed through the formula; or that I'm satisfied with that narrow recipe for drama. Life and people are deeper than that rubber-stamp allows. It's tiresome. Brokeback Mountain is the next entry in that contest. It's the kind of issue movie that the Academy loves.As far as drama goes BBM is at the rather simple end of the spectrum. The plot is as modest as this kind of movie event can bear. You've already imagined all the scenes that it could possibly cover before you go see it. It suffers from a few small problems; increasingly bad aging make-up and a peculiar stingy, puritanical need to move critical bits of drama offstage at odd moments (usually reserved for movies directed by Robert Redford). And a major flub in which a character dies and the the sub-text receives a confusing, inept visualization not in the main viewpoint of the movie. It had my crowd asking ""Who the hell's viewpoint was that?"" I thought it would skimp on scenes where love grows from small bits of intimacy, but they're here and they're nice. What it does skimp on is the female characters who receive token coverage and have nothing to do.It's what the culture needs right now; an utterly safe polite movie about the topic. If it wins the academy award it's going to have the kind of shelf-life of something like Guess who's Coming to Dinner. A look back at it from the future will present a pleasant, mild curio that wasn't as important as it seemed.Dramatically it has some ""Oh Come on!"" duds like Jack popping his wife in the butt. Mmmm. how literal. And the fact that Ennis doesn't even know the sightlines of his home that offer enough privacy to make out.I expected to dislike this movie but I didn't. Heath Ledger is quite good. It's a nice movie. It lacks a climax. But it's still in my head after two days.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't waste your time...,"""Brokeback Mountain"" had a lot of potential, but misses the mark in a lot of ways. In fact, it misses the mark so badly that I'm still left wondering what it's actually about. Is it a story about how men sometimes give into urges that are deemed ""wrong"" or ""unnatural"" by society's standards? Is it a film attempting to show us that love triumphs all, regardless of gender? Or is it simply a character piece detailing one man's slow breakdown as he loses everything by refusing to give into his homosexual urges? I still don't know.When I judge a film, these are the things I look for (in no particular order): 1) Have a point. As I mentioned above, I don't know what the point of the film is, but I'm pretty sure the people who created think they've presented one. Personally, the closest I think it comes is as a character study. However, if it is a character study, then the writer fails his characters. Which leads me to...2) Be well-written. Well-written does not equal Shakespeare. It does not equal elaborate sentences or even perfect grammar. Well-written means creating a story that interests the viewer in some way and writing dialogue that's believable and natural. Where the writer fails is in assuming that we will care about these characters simply because we're watching them or, worse, because they're involved in a homosexual relationship (taboo = interesting). The first 20 minutes of this movie reek of someone who said to himself ""Okay, everybody's waiting for the two guys to get together, but we can't lead with that. So, I'll go through several scenes of ranching, being a cowboy, etc, to set a mood, but I don't need to establish characters or chemistry because everybody already knows they're getting together and are waiting for that to happen."" This lazy attitude continues throughout the entire film straight through to the end when the writer constructs a series of scenes that are the equivalent of a flashing sign that reads ""You should feel sad now."" The characters (and the audience) deserve better.3) Acting. Even great writing can be derailed by bad acting, so you can imagine how mediocre writing suffers. On the whole, the acting isn't bad in this movie. Jake Gyllenhaal has the more interesting character and, as you would expect, does the most with it. What brings this film down, however, is Heath Ledger. First and foremost, Ledger has decided that cowboys in the US in the latter part of the 20th century talked in second-rate John Wayne impressions that require you to mumble and speak without moving your lips. The mash of Ledger's Australian accent and his ""US accent"" results in missing half of what he's saying. Further, he's chosen to play his character as brooding, which apparently is synonymous with sulking (which is synonymous with one-dimensional). Since it's ultimately his story, it's Ledger's responsibility to provide us with a character worth caring for and one that has more texture than his monotonous portrayal provides.4) Does it hold my interest? This is something of a trick question because the fact that I sat through the whole thing would indicate that it did hold my interest. However, the reality is that I watched this movie the way you watch a car accident. You don't really want to look, but you can't look away.Many people have dismissed comments that this movie will ultimately be remembered more for the fact that two of Hollywood's more successful male actors made out on screen than for anything to do with the story, but that's the sad reality. This movie is a blip on the radar only because of the homosexual aspect. The story, the characters, the writing, and the acting all indicate that, as a movie, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is simply not as good as the story it's trying to tell.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Brokeback Mountain, the first great film of 2006 (In England)","Brokeback Mountain seems like a film just designed to be different, two men falling in love and trying to make their relationship work as they have other relationships.

Brokeback Mountain,"Finally got to watch the 'Brokeback Mountain' movie on DVD, and I have found it to be one of the most inspiring love stories - especially gay love stories. I have already watched it two times and plan to watch it some more! Heath and Jake did a very great job portraying these characters of Ennis and Jack. I strongly encourage that everyone watch the movie, and I hope that it will help whoever looks down on gay love relationship realize that there are many different kinds of love for everyone in all aspects. Gay love relationship should not be considered as a taboo, but as a pure love beyond imagination. The movie made me think of how gay life must be like in the early 1960's and how it has changed in the last 40 years. More and more societies are starting to accept gay love relationship, and I am sure this movie will make everyone think. Ang Lee did a superb job making this movie, and I hope he and other directors will make more movies like this one in the years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Best Movie Ever,"this film is far the best one I've ever watched for one simple reason. It is about a love, a deep and strong love, of two men who grew up in an environment where all men should be unaffectionate, tough, and not allowed to be sensitive,to express their love even to their wives, and if they do so they are severely criticized for it and become finger pointed. So, in such a hard reality two men have the guts to fall in love with each other and even though they can imagine the impact of their choice to their families they can not pretend to be happy in marriages which become the prisons of their soul and feelings. The circumstances lead them to hide their love because in that time and in that particular place the easiest thing to do was to point your finger and laugh at two men's love. Jack & Ennis were not quires. None of them. They were MEN. And that's what makes me congratulate them for the way they showed their love cause they didn't go around holding hands and kissing, they just wanted to share the rest of their lives together without anyone criticizing them.Except for the excellent script the direction of Ang lee is amazing too. Also, heath ledger and Jake gyllenhaal proved out to be very good actors by giving an astonishing performance full of strength and sensitivity. It seems to me that they were born for the characters. Michelle Williams is great too. Anne Hathaway is satisfying. Excellent the work of Rodrigo Prieto and Sandiago Santaolala.(sorry for mistakes in my writing-I'm Greek)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A true American Love Masterpiece. One of the best of the decade,"I saw Brokeback Mountain yesterday, and it left me very emotional...First off, this is a Masterpiece. It really is. There is no other words to describe it. The screenplay is very well written. If anyone wants to write a very well-done love story, this should be their guide. The screenplay allows us to connect with both Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar. Ang Lee's direction with this film is amazing. I think him as the director made it what it was also. He was not afraid to do a homosexual film like this, and I approve of him for that. He was able to control both Ledger and Gyllenhaal's actions, and actually make them have a lot of chemistry on-screen. This film would not have worked if they didn't have that 'connection'.The acting in this film is totally ensemble, and they are all great. Heath Ledger as Enis gave the best performance. Probably because every scene he was totally in-character. He has a sort of 'look', a western cowboy accent also. He showed compassion, but confusion at everything happening. He showed sadness, and despair, and anger at his situations. His nomination was very well deserved, and in any other year, he would have won. Jake Gyllenhaal was just as equally great. His character, Jack Twist, had less screen time, and less things to work with, but in great scenes, he really shows his acting abilities. Even though Ledger was also amazing, he sometimes gets overshadowed by him. He showed his eagerness, and in some ways, he was more desperate to be with a man, and his acting helped in that. His later scenes, when he was older, scenes when he was living his life, and when he burst out in the mountain to Enis, surprised me. Michelle Williams gave a very subtle and very in-depth performance. Her pain she had to live with was too much to handle for her, and her acting really surprised me. I never knew she could act that way. Anne Hathaway, gave another effective supporting performance. Her accent I found was very well done, if not a little too showy, but it was her acting was fit her situation better. Just like Gyllenhaal, she also gets overshadowed by Williams. This was definitely her best performance.The film is also a wonder to look at. The cinematography was simply beautiful. Ang Lee really knew how to direct to capture great scenery. The original music score I found to be very fitting to the tone, and I found it simple yet very effective.Overall, this is definitely one of the most effective, best-done films of the decade. i find it sort of sad that the Academy would actually give Crash the Best Picture win. I think that, knowing this film now, that has been their biggest mistake of the last 10 years, if not longer. Seeing as what the material is, some people will not want to see it, but there really is no harm to it, and I think this film shows a true love that two unexpected people had. A true beautiful film, a very sad ending, yet fitting ending. A true American Love Classic.",,Anonymous,Romance
Much ado about nothing,"Maybe it is a better movie when you actually watch in the theatre and not at home, like I did... at home it was certainly not very entertaining. I had a hard time not hitting the fast forward button on my remote control. Can someone please tell me what the fuss was about, or better yet, why it has won several Oscars? To me the story line deserved more elaboration than it was given. I was not quite convinced of the genuine love between the two main characters. And come on, to me a love story does not need to show a lot of flesh, but a bit of fumbling in the dark is very, very prudish. Great scenery though....would have been even better on a large screen",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A strong love that ain't so strong,"I thought this was a wonderful and moving film about forbidden love and intolerance, however at the same time, as a 53 year old gay man, I would like to point out that this is also a film about two gay men who didn't have the strength to come out of the closet and fight for their relationship. The fact is, while these two characters were ""struggling"" with their ""secret"" love for each other, there were other gay men (and women) during the 1960's and 1970's who risked everything (rejection from family and friends, discrimination in housing and the workplace, mental and physical abuse, danger to their very beings) to openly love each other and to find a way to make their relationships work, but Hollywood doesn't make movies about these brave people. Rather we have a film about two sad and tragic characters who's love was not strong enough to keep them together. Think about it, if all gay couples were like Jack and Ennis, we wouldn't even have movies like ""Brokeback Mountain"" today!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""If you can't fix it...you have to stand it.""","This movie completely blew me away. The first time I seen it was about a week ago, and I caught it on TV. I didn't get to see the start of it, so I missed Jack and Ennis' time on the mountain. But, expecting a ""gay cowboy"" movie, I was pretty sure what had happened. But, as the story unfolded even more,I felt so guilty for labelling it such a simplistic, shallow, and cruel title. It is so much more. It is a heart-breaking, gut-wrenching, love story that whether you like it or not will move you deeply and stay with you for a long long time after watching it. When Ennis says, ""I ain't queer,"" and Jack replies, ""Me neither,"" I believe them. They're just two confused young men who only know that they shouldn't be feeling what they are feeling for each other.The characters of Jack and Ennis to me, are not just charatcers of fiction, but have been portrayed so well that I believe them to be real people. I don't know why this movie affected me as I did. It's not relevant to me, I'm not confused about my sexuality, but this movie has stayed with me constantly since watching it about a week ago. After watching it on TV, I immediately went out the next day and bought it on DVD, and every night since buying it, have stayed up till roughly 2 in the morning, in order to watch it. And, of course, after watching it have lay awake for what feels like hours afterwards thinking about it. It feels like my ""fix"". I think about it during the day, but knowing that I'll watch it later on makes me feel better about it. And I'm always left at the end with the credits rolling, sobbing quietly to myself. I guess this is me not fixing it, but standing it. This movie just won't get out of my head. I feel united with everyone who seems to be describing the same 'sympthons' as me, with random scenes flashing into my head, and quoting it to myself. Sometimes this makes me smile, and other times I just want to go away and cry.It's like it's become my obsession which I can't share with anyone else, because they'll think I'm weird. I did make my friend watch it with me the other day, but she didn't seem too bothered about it, which amazed me at how she couldn't be affected. But, she's one of these people who thinks that when no-one is talking, that makes a movie boring.Every time I hear the first two notes of the completely brilliant and beautiful score, I break into sobs for what I know is coming over the next two hours. The music which accompanies this movie is brilliant, and captures the feel of it amazingly. All of Gustavo Santaolalla's score is outstanding and tugs at the heartstrings like nothing I've ever heard before. The song 'He was a friend of mine', and the lyrics 'Every time I think of him, I just can't help but crying"" sums up how I feel about Jack and Ennis. And Wainwrights 'Maker Makes' another thing of beauty. The strange thing is, Brokeback has never made me cry tears, I sob dry-eyed watching the movie that has made me feel broken inside. Even though it sounds bad that it's making me feel so negative, this has become my favourite movie.*SPOILER* My favourite scene in the whole movie, is the 'flashback' in the final scene that Jack and Ennis are in together. When Ennnis comes up behind Jack and holds him, it makes me smile, because they both look so happy and content with each other, having nothing else to worry about except the sheep, and it seems they have come to terms with what they feel. But, on coming down from the mountain this certainty wobbles and leads to the lie of the rest of their lives. The come-back to reality and the change in Jack's face from a look of happiness to one of utter brokenness is crushing.And whenever the letter came back with 'deceased', I was in complete disbelief, I could not believe it. It felt like losing someone I had known.I just feel like I had to leave a comment to try to get all of this emotion out of me, and help me ""get over"" this movie which has really messed me up, and left me with what feels like a grieving process, like I'm mourning the loss of Jack and the utter sadness Ennis is living in. The last three words, ""Jack, I swear..."", and the look in Ennis' eyes says so many things that words can't convey, and followed by the sorrowful strumming of 'The Wings' is something that breaks my heart even to think about. I don't think this movie will ever leave me, nor it's effect, but I think I need to get all this out of me somehow.I would like to end with a Thank You to the people who made this movie what it is. If anyone else had tried, it could have been done so badly, but this movie is a beautiful masterpiece which will be remembered forever, by the people who felt its effect the most. The acting and the directing, the scenes accomplished are incredible.The End.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Competent but over-hyped,"Well I missed it in theatres, but bought the DVD last week and watched it last night. But I seem to have missed it again. I'm really really sorry, but I found this ""masterpiece"" hugely disappointing. The acting is good in parts, particularly that of Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams as the bereft wives. Jake Gyllenhaal was a little disappointing after a magnificent turn in Donnie Darko, and although Heath Ledger is capable of excellent work I found it difficult to tell if it was just his character's emotions that were stilted, or if it were his acting as well (a tittle unkind, but how do you portray a stilted character without appearing stilted - one moment of emotional breakdown thumping a brick wall isn't enough.) Ang Lee is a very fine and exceptionally versatile director, and E. Annie Proulx a wonderful author, but nonetheless this film fell very far short of the adulation heaped on it by friends and reviewers. In fact it was ever so slightly boring, and my wife (who had also been looking forward to this) actually fell asleep towards the end.I think what it comes down to is this: it's a story about star-crossed lovers, but it's hardly Romeo and Juliet (they had feuding families and an inescapable situation to contend with.) The twist in this story is that (shock, horror) the lovers are of the same sex (I hope that doesn't count as a plot spoiler) but it's their own perversity and inability to communicate openly as much as the social mores of the time that keeps them apart and causes them to lead somewhat barren and futile lives. Their perversity and lack of ability to communicate exists just as much in their married relationships as it does in the relationship between the two - they're not fully formed men, and neither of the characters are somebody you'd want to spend your life with.And after that, so what! The story is somewhat sad but entirely predictable. SPOILERS AHEAD. I thought that the flashback treatment of the killing of Jack Twist was inept, and robbed the climax of the emotional power it could and should have had, although Ennis' discovery of the event, and the deceiving phone conversation he has with Lureen Newsome (which was interwoven with the flashbacks) was exceptional. I found the last 10 minutes and the final scenes with ""the shirt"" and Ennis' long-suffering daughter moving and uplifting - but the rest of it - Titanically pappy.Most people's reaction to the film seems to be that, gosh, it was a relationship between men that dare not speak it's name, but that's hardly a new concept, and this story doesn't have the depth and complexity of love, betrayal, and tragedy of Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas. Get over it people, this is 2006, and although same sex relationships may cause volcanic eruptions in middle America this was a small tragedy not a great drama.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A lot of hype--VERY  little in the delivery.,"I saw this film fully prepared to ache for the two main characters. I looked forward, in that awful/sweet way, to my heart breaking for the 2 hours or so i'd spend in the theater. I was sure i'd identify with that primal unrequited-love-pain we've all felt at some point in our life, tho i was SURE mine would pale in comparison to these two character's plight. I was sure i'd feel all of that when i saw how desperately they yearned for one another. Not carnally, but for one another's soul and heart. But most of all--i wanted to see and feel that they were truly 'in love' and devoted to the ideas of one another for the 20 odd years this film spans.What i got instead was a dull, drawn out, not NEARLY as well acted as expected, lack-luster film that was way too long, and way too empty. First let me say--i admire both of these men as actors. Though I found Ennis to be well portrayed by Heath Ledger, after the first 45 minutes of his chronic mumbles and grunts for answers, and Jake's (Jack's) VERY fake country accent--i was reduced to eye rolls and the occasional snicker. As the film progressed, I was looking for them to finally connect in some emotionally poignant, or at the very least enlightened, way. And that does NOT mean over a bottle of whiskey, and a romp in the tent. I believed, thru other reviews that i'd read, that these two men would fall deeply and completely in love with one another's souls--not just the excitement of their bonking. If this was to be just the starting point of a truer and deeper love that was to evolve from that first romp, i wish it had been portrayed better, because i never felt any emotional connection or bond between the two, until the very end...over two very old and bloodied shirts, and it even that was pretty weakly done, at best.While Heath was better at displaying a man agonized by feelings he'd never imagined could exist for him, Jack simply struck me as a gay man--determined to push his wishes and desires into Ennis' life--right from the get'go. Jack's relentless pursuit of Ennis was both frustrating and sickening for me, especially as he expressed that his ""needs"" weren't being met when Ennis had to postpone yet another 'weeklong fishing trip' because of his job. Jack was both needy, and manipulative--and i never felt pity or compassion for him...not once.In fact, his famously quoted ""I wish i could quit you"" sealed the deal for me. Ick and double ick--and get the ""bleep"" out of Ennis' life, you loser! He further disgusted me by his open ended eye-lash batting at other men--whether it was the Rodeo clown he offered a beer to, or the husband of his wife's girlfriend. I mean--for cryin' out loud! If you want to be with men--DIVORCE YOUR WIFE, and be with men. Don't torture Ennis into believing he's 'the only one' OR your wife into believing SHE has your fidelity when you obviously yearn for something else. He was a selfish, self indulgent man who couldn't possibly have truly 'loved' Ennis as Ennis loved him. Thus--any idea of this being a ""great love story"" were foiled for me.Ennis' struggle was at least palpable and real. And tho i wish the direction of his character hadn't been quite so much of a ""strong and silent"" cliché, i was moved by this man who was truly tormented by his self-imposed purgatory, and his knowledge that he was not strong enough to live any differently.So, in the end--the film was bleak (despite the beautiful scenery) and disappointing. I really wanted to love this movie. There have been so many other indi films made covering similar subject matter (tho not filmed with head-lining cowboys, mind you) with much more finesse, and more heart. I'll stick with small budget films for my thought provoking media in the future.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
profound,"There is a scene about 3/4 of the way through this movie where the two main characters are passing a joint back and forth while camping on Brokeback Mountain. But you would have to pay attention to notice it. They partake in this behavior only once during the film, and no attention is drawn to it as it is never spoken of. To me, this is what makes the film so moving. The movie itself is about a homosexual relationship between two males living in the Midwest during the 1960s, but never does it force the issue on you. It is a love story where the characters just happen to be homosexual. In doing so, they make a statement far more profound than a movie like 'Crash' does, which is so obvious about its message. You feel for the characters not as homosexuals, but as people. This isn't a story of homosexuality, but of love. To me, this makes the audience understand the issue instead of just seeing it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
beautiful story,"I thought it was a simple and beautiful yet tragic story and am pleased with the success its had. It was so moving and especially in our society it takes a lot to have a gay love story to be seen as just a love story. :-) I don't understand what all the conservative huff was about, everything was really tastefully done and nothing ever stooped to being vulgar, there are so many other movies where the sexuality is just gratuitous and yet no one bats an eye. I was disappointed it didn't win the Oscar for best movie but America does tend to be conservative so it wasn't to surprising. I suppose they'll be lots of poorly made spinoffs of it to capitalize on its success, but they can't be controlled.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Passion and Love Flow Freely They Are Not  Bound By Rules,"Two men with similar lonely and painful backgrounds find themselves alone on a mountain herding sheep. On a freezing night, one man, who is in a tent, invites the other, who is freezing outside, into the tent. No one really knows what causes the heart to love, or the bodies to be physically attracted to others, but this happened to these two men, and the love and attraction were so deep that I felt the would suffer in this world because I knew they would never be able to sustain the beauty and force of their love and passion. I feel such passion has nothing to do with sexes. When someone touches you, man or woman, you will love them, What is so amazing is that realization came to me from the earnestness and force of Ang Lee's direction, and the truth and depth of the actors portrayals. There were few scenes, but each scene was a stone of pain in my heart and in the depth of their love. We knew from the beginning when his father showed him the dead man who had been killed for living with a man that he would die. There was no space in this world for their love. As they said in a begging scene, they were not (as they put it)queers. They were two people who fell in love. Their love was so passionate that they had no control over it when they saw each other. Little by little their lives were destroyed. To me most profound image in the movie was the scene of the opened closet door with the two bloodied shirts and the postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked next to it. I actually cried at the pain of their lost love. I have seen other of Ang Lee's movies, but for me, this was his bravest effort and as a writer, I applaud him. It surely should have won the Best Picture Award, but we here in America have not reached that level of wisdom yet! Perhaps one day... L. W. D. A Poet and Writer",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie is awesome!,"This movie is very universal. Anyone who has ever had a discrete relationship can understand, such as different racial/cultural backgrounds, religious differences, social statuses, families' disputations, age gaps, and so on. Society tells us that certain relationships are wrong and unacceptable, that's why some people who are engaged in these relationships keep it a secret.""Brokeback Mountain"" pin pointed out this forbidden love. Like ""Romeo and Juliet,"" tragedy breaks out.Finally, a ""gay romance"" film which *Isn't* stereotypical ""faggoty or feminine-like,"" compared to most others out there! Because of this, the audiences aren't just gays, less homo-phobic attitudes, and more open minded. I'm pretty sure this is the first of its kind to go mainstream in America's theatres, and i hope this is the lead ice breaker for others to follow. This film isn't just romance or western, its also comedy, action, drama, and suspense.I commend Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger's performances. Before this project, i thought they were both just any other pretty boys that are not Oscar material. I never even seen a single film by Jake Gyllenhaal previously. In this film, they're break out actors, and the new journey has began. However, there's just a tiny downside; Heath Ledger's acting was just a tad too stiff during the entire film. Jake's performance was flawless, (*and being drop dead gorgeous didn't hurt either* ;)!.) ""I wish i knew how to quit him*"" now, lol.This film makes you want to be in a relationship just to have someone special. You feel as if you're missing someone, even though you might not know who it is. The first thing i did when i got home was I hugged my dog tightly! (I know, that was pathetic.)

It is great thing to bring Brokeback Mountain to cinema. I am sorry this wonderful film does not win Oscar that is stupid mistake by Hollywood.

More than it seems,"The biggest shame about BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is that it was, and may forever be known as, the ""gay cowboy movie."" Is STAR WARS ""that space opera""? VERTIGO ""that dizzy cop picture""? The phrase simply became a shorthand for the controversy -- an easy way for conservatives to dismiss it, but also for liberals to make it clear that the words ""gay"" and ""cowboy"" are not mutually exclusive. Certainly they are not. Gays are everywhere, every style and age and profession; they have a variety of characteristics, from flamboyantly flighty to brutally macho. It is no more unlikely that there were gay cowboys in 1960 than in 2005, merely that no one talked about it back then. That said, Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar are not ""gay cowboys;"" they are cowboys who happen to fall in love. Does it matter that it is with each other? Haven't stories about forbidden love been around since Tristan & Isolde, or Romeo & Juliet? Isn't the real question, How well is the story told? Does it resonate for the audience? On that score, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a marvel of storytelling. Ang Lee uses silences as well as anyone this side of Jean-Claude Annaud, telling his story visually, and setting it up so no one person is the antagonist: Society is. This is deeply felt movie-making that transcends the label ""gay cowboy movie."" It's a career performance for Heath Ledger and a brilliant revelation for Michelle Williams.

ONly good because it's controversial,"I saw this movie, extremely excited because it was a groundbreaking movie. I came out of shaking my head in disbelief, not at the sheer audacity and boldness that the writer and director had, but at how overly hyped this movie had been. I give this movie a 6 only out of kindness and because of the groundbreaking nature of the film. I was bored immediately and truly not enthralled by it. The writer did not create a film that drew you in, even as a romance. I'm a guy and stereotypically we don't like romances, but I don't mind them, if it's well written than you can get into the relationship. This movie seemed hastily written, and instead of spending a lot of time on the script and dialogue, the writer simply wrote a movie to become noticed.

"Stunning, Beautiful, Moving - Will stay with you long after the movie has ended.","I have heard things about this movie, and after reading a plot synopsis of this movie a couple days ago, I decided to rent it yesterday, and since then have watched it three times. This movie so beautiful in so many ways. It grabs a hold of you early on and won't let you go, leaving you starting at the screen, and leaves you thinking about it and the two main characters - Jack and Ennis - long after you've walked away, touching you so deeply that it feels more real to you than a simple movie, because it ceases to be that, and becomes so much more.In this movie, Heath Ledger portrays Ennis and Jake Gyllenhal plays Jack. They cease be Heath and Jake, and become Jack and Ennis. Ang Lee takes you through a journey of nearly twenty years that will leave you stunned and moved beyond words. Never before I have ever seen something that has touched me so deeply like Brokeback Mountain does. Heath and Jake are fantastic, and the ending will leave you teared up, wanting more, sad yet understanding about the sadness and tragedy of it.To name this the ""gay cowboy movie"" like it has been in the past is grossly underestimating the beauty and power of this movie. I advise everyone with an even slightly open mind to go see this, because really it's about being gay, it's about forbidden love of a romance in which you love someone like no other, but can never be with them - understandable when it takes place in the 1960's and 70's. It's about the power, beauty, sadness and tragedy of love, which after seeing this, you can truly say is the most powerful and mysterious force on Earth.Superbly acted, directed, and written, even the score of the movie helps tell the story and the emotions involved - simple, yet powerful, moving and haunting all at the same time. This movie touches you on a deep level, leaving a permanent mark. It is beautiful and moving beyond words as you wrapped into the sadness and tragedy of Jack and Ennis' lives on a personal level that, at least I, had never felt before for fictional characters, because it's so real on screen that it feels real to you, and I honestly think, and so will most that understand what I'm saying, that Brokeback Mountain is one of the greatest love stories of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I think when a piece of art is exceptional you just know it without having to explain why.To say that the setting, the actors, the soundtrack and the story are exceptional should be enough. But this movie reaches down inside of the viewer and evokes him to want more for the characters and even from ones own self.The theme in this movie transcends a simple gay relationship story and expands to greater universal themes of love and the confines of society. One can sympathize with the characters as they grapple with the reality of the world around them while struggling with the conflicting forces within themselves.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A little bit overraed,"I see that this movie gets so many 10, and I'm not sure why. It's definitely not perfect, or a masterpiece. It's pretty good, it is exciting at times. But it's also pretty slow and the plot is a bit messy, in my opinion. Didn't work on me entirely. But still pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing,"There's something about this film, I saw it a week ago and I still can't get it out of my thoughts. This film reminded me how I felt after seeing ""crash"", a brilliant film, but not one to make you feel good. In some places, not much was left to the imagination and in parts I did feel a little uncomfortable. My best mate and me, being the girlie girls we are even shared a few childish giggles. But this is what made the film, without it, it wouldn't be as strong and create such a deep and powerful meaning to the audience. It is another great love story, but different in so many ways to those we would expect to see. At first it was quite difficult to except two well-known actors (especially after recently watching ""Jarhead"") in completely different and unexpected roles, but soon you look past this and the film is very realistic. You really feel for these characters. Just because it may not be the ""stereotypical"" image of a happy couple, these two are deeply involved and very much in love with one another. Watch this film alone or with your best friend, it's a must see but not one with a group of lads or family members!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Gay or Not Gay, Beautiful as it is","Some movies you can watched for one time and forget all about it. Yet some will live deeply into your mind for years to come. This is the one that you will always remember. The lovers forbidden love fragile yet strong. Sad yet warm. Gay or not gay is no longer a question here. Even if the gender is ""Corrected"", it still is the most remarkable way of translating a beautiful romance. It is unfair to call it ""Gay Cowboy Movie"" or some sort of shallow titles. In weird ways, the lover that you never get is the lover you love the most. Such pure love is beyond age, gender, race, nationality and time. Ang Lee, as a Taiwanese director, to direct a movie with so much complex background and timeframe, is magnificent. No wonder Oscar validate the movie as well as the director. The music and the story is still in my mind, even now. I was not offensed by the gay scene but was deeply moved by the true love. Wonderful movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
BBM A Serious Work Of Art,"Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal put on an Oscar winning performance that is more real and true to one's heart than any other love story of this past decade. It is a complete revolutionary step in movie making, and will not be soon forgotten. Heath and Jake truly have put on THE performance of their careers. For the first time in a ""gay"" movie, have the actors not perpetuated the typical stereotype of a gay man. There were no weak wrists or lisps of any sort. Only two guys, profoundly inflicted with hard-to-ignore emotions.I have never experienced a movie like Brokeback Mountain; It has captured my heart and refuses to let it go. Many movies come and go, but few make as big of an impression on me as Brokeback Mountain has. Thank you Ang Lee and the entire cast!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brokeback mountain,"I was told the film was very good but had my doubts it.Cowboys and stuff no way ....it appeared to be one of the best movies I saw in years filled with situations and emotions that are so very real and by all probability has a part in many people's life.The choices in life we have to make and with regret don't always make the right ones because of comments from people around us that make life only this much more difficult.

Not Only A Fair Portrayal Of Two Men In Love But An Uplifting Story About The Greatness Of Love Itself.,"Profoundly honest, wonderfully crafted, brilliantly performed, beautifully scored & arguably the boldest film I've ever seen, Brokeback Mountain is not only a fair portrayal of two men in love but an uplifting story about the greatness of love itself. The film is amazing to look at, is shot in beautiful locations & director Ang Lee left no stone unturned in fusing this nicely adapted narrative with his calm & controlled artistic flair.But the biggest contribution comes from the strong performances by both Heath Ledger & Jake Gyllenhaal. Ledger truly nails his character of Ennis & although he didn't speak much throughout the runtime, his body language effortlessly conveyed everything about Ennis' stuffed up emotions, fears & love. Gyllenhaal plays Jack Twist & delivers a knockout performance and so did Michelle Williams. Anne Hathaway didn't have much to do unfortunately but she was no disappointment.From start to finish, it is a roller coaster ride of powerful emotions & although some moments might be difficult to watch for few people out there but by the time it ends, it will hopefully end up changing many viewers' presumptions about this film or its characters or its theme or even modern society. On an overall scale, Brokeback Mountain isn't only one of those films that will stand the test of time but it's a cinematic gem that will keep resonating the power of thought-provoking cinema in changing viewers' perspectives, forever.",,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderfully scripted and photographed.,"When I first heard of the movie having a gay theme, I thought ""oh no, another one of those gay movies without substance."" I did not see it at the movie theatre because of that. I borrowed the DVD from a friend and watched it at home alone. I have now decided that I want to buy and keep it. The story is wonderfully scripted, the scenery is awesome and I became glued to the movie until the end. The actors did a wonderful job of bringing the characters to light and you just could not help but feel what they were going through as if in real life. My straight friends got a good insight into what being gay is like and they realize the struggles of young gay people coming to terms with their sexuality. I will forever be grateful to the author of the short story on which this movie is based on.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I swear?,"I missed this one at movie theaters...so I tried DVD on Sunday...then again on Monday. All I knew about this movie was it's a cowboy love story, and directed by Ang Lee - the one I admire.From the production story, I found Ang lee loved the script because it sounded like an epic. I think his movie is like an epic..if you watch his previous ones such as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.Anyway, I really loved the film. It was beautiful but sad, and made me end up with crying...though I knew some men I know really can't stand like this movie...but indifferent to me, I just felt those scenes were beautiful, sexy and sad.A question... why did Ennie said ""I swear..."" .. for what?

Forbidden Love...How many ways can you tell it.,"First of all the acting in this is very good. Especially Heath Ledger. He did a fantastic job.However the storyline is a bit trite. It is after all, a story about two people making a connection and then facing a situation where they cannot keep it going...i.e. ""Forbidden Love."" It's been told numerous times before and in my opinion the story is here does not present it any new or novel way. I think ""Lost in Translation"" was a more clever way of showing the same thing. The metaphor is not that complex and I think it is more a function of the writing and overall story rather than anything else.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
wonderful,"I honestly didn't believe that a film could ever touch me the way that this did, ever since it first come out I wanted to see it, but I thought that it would be.. Just a gay cowboy movie but it is so much more. It made me laugh, cry, smile and gasp. I never once believed that it could be as good as everyone said it was but it was and more. I have watched it 4 times already and I still cry. It is about two men that set of into brokeback mountain herding sheep, at the start they barely talked but after a drunken night, Ennis decides to stay on camp rather than go back up with the sheep, he starts of sleeping outside but as the night gets cold he sleeps in the tent with Jack, the two men have a brief but intense sexual encounter which is the start to a long heartbreaking sexual and emotional relationship. Both men get married but after 4 years Jack gets in touch with Ennis and the pair meet up, their love is once again rekindled and the pair spend time together back up in Brokeback.

amazing,"This movie didn't wow me completely until I went home and found myself thinking about it later. An amazing achievement in cinema, especially in the performances. This proves that amazing effects and cheap laughs aren't the only attributes that Hollywood recognizes anymore and it's great to see that two people can have a gay relationship without being the total metro stereotype of gay. The acting of the two wives goes largely underrated, as Michelle Williams especially becomes a cornerstone of the storytelling. Jack Twist and Ennis Delmar should go down as two unforgettable people in movie lore. The powerful ending really suggests what could have been and leaves you thinking. It sort of yearns for a sequel that could never come, (and shouldn't come as it would really be a disservice to this film). The only thing i can think to do now is to watch it again, and notice all the clues to what is about to happen. Some may say it's overrated or perhaps morally wrong, but I doubt they saw what I saw- which was a film of amazing quality all around. I also doubt they saw the impact of it in the theater I was in, with more than a few adults in tears near the end.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Destined for top 10,"It has been a year since I first saw Brokeback. I have not had the emotional courage to embrace it again before now. I knew straight away it was a masterpiece but was so devastated (how many movies do that to you?) that as good as it is I would allow some space, my head to clear, before a second viewing. And.. you guessed it.. I am as affected now as I was back then. The many postings before me have said all there is to say. I thought this time, knowing the narrative, I could distance myself from the drama and appreciate the great acting, screenplay, editing, indeed nearly everything about this production.

Brokeback was as good as Ice,"""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005): There was never any doubt that I would like the photography, sound, scoring, and, most probably, the acting and casting. After all, this is the same man who made ""The Ice Storm""  a great film. Then again, I was nervous that this could somehow be another ""Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon"" somehow and boy did I dislike that one of his. ""Brokeback"" is as good as ""Ice"" in all the ways I expected. What had me concerned was the story. I kept asking myself if this was ENOUGH of a story anymore after all, the minority-on-the-outside/in-the-closet is a well-trodden subject. Was it getting all its attention merely due to the ""cowboy"" context, and would this film be of ANY interest if set in Miami, San Francisco, or New York City, and the men were urbanites? What Ang Lee did was walk a very fine line, and present the specifics more as environment than subject. This was more about love, obsession, truth, responsibilities, honor, and honesty the Big Stuff. Although a few, tiny errors were seen in the film, I've already forgotten what they were, and I'm left with the feeling I've seen a very high level of film making. Having finally seen it, I can say I will see it again.",,Anonymous,Romance
Everyone has their own Brokeback Mountain,"Exploiting love as an extremely profitable theme, the film industry has gradually reduced its primal significance to nothing but a couple of hackneyed platitudes. Adapting 'Brokeback Mountain' for the screen, a short story by Annie Proulx, Ang Lee not only breathed new life into the ossified genre, he managed to elevate an intimate relationship between two men to an unprecedented emotional level.The movie tells the story of two young men, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), whose paths cross in Wyoming in the summer 1963. Two strangers hired as shepherds are sent onto the harsh slopes of Brokeback Mountain, where after some time they experience an unexpected and sudden burst of affection. What Ennis at first calls 'a one-shot deal' will appear to be the beginning of the long-standing relationship whose symbol will remain the mountain.Ang Lee's movie is a classical, though gay, love story, and consequently the characters are not entitled to love. The fear of the narrow, small town mentality of locals is the reason why Ennis and Jack desperately try to forget about the affection and lead a normal life, getting married and starting families. However, the unfulfilled, secret desires impossible to satisfy become the source of drama.The combination of the picturesque scenery and the outstanding performances given by Ledger and Gyllenhaal substantially contributes to the emotional atmosphere that Lee managed to capture in the film. The high artistic level is not even for a moment eclipsed by the very subtle intimate scenes, whose aim evidently is not to shock but to emphasize the depth of the characters' love. Surprisingly, the fact that two main characters are male makes the story is so meaningful and unpretentious. Watching 'Brokeback Mountain' one cannot resist the impression that such story could really happen.Considered from a broader perspective, the story can serve only as a starting point for more general deliberations on the sense of our fulfilment in life. The inability of liberation from social or cultural constraints may become a human drama and Ennis saying 'If you can't fix it, you gotta stand it' hits the bull's-eye. However, it depends only on ourselves if we really have to stand it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
offended by nomination,"being from Holland i completely have to agree with BjornEdstrom. Having just seen the movie I don't really get what all the Buzz was about. In the theater there were some iel!! and grose!! but the general public (most of them gay men or just women) went to see a love story which happened to be about two very repressed gay men. Brokeback Mountain is a rare movie, a mainstream movie about queers...oooeeeh..what a eye opener. I feel offended that the academy nominated the picture for best film. It's like positive discrimination all over again. I'm not saying that the movie was bad, because most of the acting in the film is pretty darn good. Maybe for middle America this movie will give the chance to change the general opinion about gays, but here in Europe the movie is a step back. gay men generally die or end up in trailer parks or end up having a very scary decease, this movie ain't different. First of all the gay men are repressed and don't come out of the closet and the only love-scene in the movie looks like a rape. Not liking the characters would be considered homophobic and I think this is part of the reason why the academy nominated the movie.this movie ain't a 8/10 but at the highest a 7/10 and people giving this movie a 10 ain't helping the gay community so stop being so darn PC..the movie confirms the repressed state the community is in..Respond..",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Devastatingly beautiful and true, a must-see for all mankind","Jack and Ennis... two young ranch hands, used to hard living and going nowhere fast, take jobs tending sheep on Brokeback Mountain one summer. What results of their partnership is not something that either of them expected, but their fall into lust and then love changes the course of their lives irrevocably. Their story has the power to change your life too.It's easy to label this film as ""the gay cowboy movie."" Though the fact of their sexuality is what drives the plot, creating obstacles and heartbreak throughout Jack and Ennis's lives, it is not the central theme here. To box this story up as a tearjerker about marginalized minorities is a frustrating oversimplification, and more importantly, it is a serious misapprehension of the sheer scope of this film.No, this film is about love, longing, and bitter regret. It is a universal affirmation that no matter how hard it is, love is the only thing that life is worth living for. It is both a plea and a warning to those who may realize this truth too late. This is a film that absolutely shattered me, but I came out of it with the knowledge that the only way to live is to love fearlessly and without hesitation. Years later, I still count this as one of the greatest lessons I've ever learned.How some people could completely miss the point of the story is something that really bothered me for a long time, until I watched it with a certain friend of mine. She is, to put it bluntly, childishly naive and had never known romantic love. When the movie ended, she remarked rather lightly, ""Oh it's so sad that they couldn't be together because they were gay."" So perhaps it's necessary to have some life experience as a context for this story... and no movie, no matter how amazing, can teach you what true love feels like (however, anyone who has ever been in love already knows the pain of heartbreak, even if their hearts have yet to be broken).Ang Lee is an artist, a maestro, a wizard in the way he creates this world for his characters. It is a world that is simultaneously intimate and desolately vast, and Lee doesn't miss a single detail. You don't just see the landscape, you feel the wind howling through your bones. This is all the more remarkable considering how foreign the ranch life in 1970's Wyoming must be to a man who grew up in a big city in Taiwan. Somehow he knows this place as if he'd lived there all along.I suppose it helps that he had utter faith in his actors. I firmly believe that no two others could have done it - the chemistry between the two leads is electric. Jake Gyllenhaal is perfectly lovable as the boisterous yet sensitive Jack, buoyant and optimistic despite the many harsh blows that life has dealt him, and he deserves utmost praise. However, critics couldn't help but overlook him in the face of Heath Ledger's tour de force performance as Ennis Del Mar, a man whose emotions are so repressed that the weight of them is evident in every motion. The difference between the two performances is that Ledger's Ennis becomes a real person. He so completely submerges himself in the role that you no longer see Heath Ledger acting as Ennis, but Ennis come to life.The supporting cast is no less impressive than the leads. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway play the wives of Ennis and Jack respectively, whose own lives become lies through the deceit of their husbands. The story doesn't gloss over their anger and grief, and these very young actresses give performances that are far beyond their years. The actress who plays Jack's mother also stands out to me. In a pivotal scene near the end where so many questions are answered, and all these answers are conveyed between the lines, it's as if she and Ledger are speaking directly to your heart.Finally, I highly recommend that you read the short story by Annie Proulx after seeing the film. You will be all the more impressed by how well Proulx's spare, honest prose was adapted to the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An one-horse town.,"The New York Post film critic was dead-on with two of the most overrated movies of 2005, one was ""Cinderella Man"" (by Ron Howard, the most overrated director in history) and the other was ""Brokeback Mountain"".This movie, efficiently shot, acted and maybe even paced, has nothing new to offer other that the romance happens to be between two male cowboys. See over that, and there's nothing really interesting about it. Some of the lines uttered by the actors go from corny to simply laughable (""I wish I could quit you""). Some of parts of the romance defies logic. If you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about.It's not a terrible movie. It's not even a bad movie. It's just totally overrated. It doesn't deserve the awards it has, in a year of jewels like ""A History of Violence"" and even Peter Jackson's flawed, but touching and spectacular ""King Kong"".If you're looking for a compelling gay romance/drama go to the video store and rent Pedro Almodobar's magnificent ""La Mala Educación"".",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
For Straight Women & Gay Men,"I'm a 40 something wife & Mum. I love movies and I really wanted to see this one, I waited until it was shown on one of the movie channels. It was well worth the wait! I do believe, however, that this movie, as beautifully done as it is, is best for straight women and gay men. There was so much love and tenderness in it, so much truth and honesty that would appeal to both these. I cannot imagine there being anything there to see for gay women, and my husband has said that he does not want to see it, especially after I told him about it. The cinematography is stunning, the acting the finest. I had only seen Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead before, I thought he was very good in that too.

One of The Best Films of all Times,"When I saw this movie, I was moved deeply. Not only did the emotional love story between the two characters affect me emotionally, but also caused me to arouse many questions about my own love life. I feel as if this is one of the first films in what seems to be forever to touch the surface of homosexuality and make a huge success out of it. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal achieved an outstanding performance in their roles of gay lovers which many actors fear to come close to.As a result of Brokeback Mountain's huge success and dramatic movement of many of its viewers, many people have begun to question their own relationships. I know this to be true because after I watched it and discussed its epic story with other viewers, we felt the exact same way about it. We deeply desired for a rare and unusual, powerful relationship like that of these two lovers in the film.Although this epic love story received several Academy Awards, amongst these awards I think should have been included Best Picture. The film is so moving and if it would have never been produced, many soul-searching minds would not be so deeply moved by its heart warming and emotional, tear jerking journey.",,Anonymous,Romance
Mixed emotions about Brokeback,"To have a ""Refugium"" like Brokeback Mountain must be a nice thing; that is one of my thoughts after seeing this movie. The camera captured its magic very well. Having a place to hang out with your friend/buddy/lover or whatever to swim, drink, smoke, penetrate...and get rid of crying babies and talking wives ;-).But it was not easy to see and feel the love between those guys. And thats what the whole movie did to me; it gave me a painting, and I had to fill out a lot of emotions by myself. That isn't bad, thats what a movie should do, even the best ones; but i expected a bit more in portraying a gay couple.It was hard to go emotionally with them; felt more sorry for their wives perhaps. That thing made it more believable on the other hand. The aging process was not build up stringent; I found myself being more attracted in seeing make-up artists work.""SPOILER"":Strong scenes where there, and they worked out well: visiting the parents and going up to the room, finding the jacket,.... the loss of his love stroke your heart.Summary; if the movie was about a man and a woman, I would not want to see it. So far the ""gay-gimmik"" worked out well to stand out of the rest. The development of ""falling in love"" was too often left to the viewer; not much fantasy in creating real love suspense there; even when they are playing guys who are not able to talk about feelings. But the overall tone created with music and images summed up in an enjoyable cinema- experience like there was no other before.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

If this movie was made 40 years ago, it would have been shunned by the mainstream and branded as one of those eccentric 'art' films (because at that time it would have been politically incorrect).

A Beautiful Story of A Simple Love in a Complicated Time,"In Brokeback Mountain, I found myself watching a ""love story"", in every sense of the expression. The sort of plot that will fill the lining of any Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan tale of love lost, found, and perhaps lost again, only to be found once more. As clichéd a story as any film the world might define as a ""chick flick"". However this is not any ordinary ""chick flick"". This is a film that serves a greater purpose. As simple as it is complicated in its idea; how hard is it to love someone, regardless of who they are? Sitting in the theater, I was not fifteen minutes into the film before I saw someone stand up and declare what they were seeing to be ""disgusting"", before walking out of the theater to where I have to believe they demanded their money back. Talk of graphic sex scenes have been blown out of proportion. This is no more than any films traditional unseen ""under the bed-sheet"" intention. It is simply the subject that I believe offends some and changes their perspective.I don't pretend to fully understand the world that was in 1963. However, in today's day and age, to see people walk out of a movie theater in disgust over the idea of two men embracing, I can only imagine the perspective of a world forty years earlier. This is more than Capulet and Montague's familial angst towards one another (Romeo and Juliet), this is an entire civilization that outwardly condemns your feelings to the point of violence.Ang Lee is one of the most versatile and subtle directors I have ever witnessed. His work would not be apparent to most as they sit and watch. There is little expressive cinematic choice. No obtuse camera angles or editing tricks that cry for anyone to say ""great directing"". Lee performs his job in its purest essence, creating a world from start to finish and a vision that cries for your attention.The acting by both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal is superb. They bring those characters to life. There is no doubting the feelings that they have both for each other and towards the world. They support each other equally. I would say that I wouldn't pick anyone else in Hollywood to have played these roles, but I don't know who I could have chosen to begin with.The supporting cast simply cannot stand on screen with the performances of the leads. So much thought has been put into the two lead characters, and they take up so much of the screen time that other characters barely deserve mention. They don't have to. This story is not really about anyone beyond the two men, and in that frame of mind, the film brilliantly succeeds.I have seen few films that may have opened my eyes to a perspective I had not yet seen more than Brokeback Mountain. It is a movie well deserving of praise, both for its story and its message.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Frustrated desire, intolerance and love","It was a coin toss between Jarhead and Brokeback just before purchasing the ticket and the film Gods must have been with me. My worry about this film was that it would merely be about gay rights and wrongs. Thankfully I was wrong and it turned out to be a film that transcends gay issues. It is a film about frustrated desire, intolerance and love. You do not have to be gay to get this film just human.The basic premise is that Jack Twist(Gyllenhaal)and Heath Ledger (Ennis Del Marr) are in love in a world where being openly gay is a death sentence. They each marry and have families but are only truly happy when with each other. They meet up once or twice a year on Brokeback mountain over a twenty year period and share their frustrations at not being able to be with another.The sentimental moments in the film are genuine and not forced. It is easy to empathise with these characters if you have ever felt destructive love, frustration or a feeling that you do not fit in. The direction of the film by Ang Lee is fantastic. The film is suitably paced; the scenery is fantastic and the score is poignant.The performances across the board are superb. Right from the two main leads to their long suffering wives and the rest of the support cast. However, a special mention must go to Heath Ledger's portrayal of Ennis Del Mar who is a hard uneducated man who does not understand that their is a wider world to the one he is living in. Ledger's performance is understated, raw and genuine. Another actor may have over acted the part to the detriment of the character.The final scene of the film is one of the best that I have seen in recent times. There is no dramatic twist but their is a realisation on the part of Ennis Del Marr that not all desires need be unfulfilled; that if you are wise enough to see the wider picture all possibilities are open to those who are brave enough to take them.This film is highly recommended to those people who are bored with the run of the mill garbage that Hollywood seems to produce these days. If your a fan of run of the mill garbage, give this film a miss. This film is effective because of the fine cast, good direction and the visualisation of human nature at its best and worst.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
My heart is full up,"Old Brokeback Mountain has sure grabbed hold of my heart and seems in no hurry to let go. I'm not one who habitually sees movies multiple times, but this one I just can't shake off. In all my long life I've never experienced anything like this: seen it at least five times, re-read the Proulx story again and again, finally was able to buy the soundtrack just today (2/14). Powerful, classic, spare, spacious, filled with silences, a metaphor for all life's disappointments and tragedies and great loves lost, and just about as perfect a film as I've ever seen.The director lets each viewer connect the dots for him/herself, contemplating the ambiguities (like the flashback scene) and involving them in the film in a way no obvious telling could do. Each time I see it, it reveals more exquisite little details. It took four viewings before I noticed Ennis, in the very last scene, folding his daughter's sweater against his chest, holding it to his face and carefully placing it on the shelf in his closet. What a telling gesture, revealing the deeply loving heart of his character without a word. And then the shirts.Kudos to Ang Lee, and to every one of the fine actors and writers who brought this masterpiece to life. It deserves every award, and seems to me to be a film that can heal wounds and bridge gulfs between people, if it is allowed to. The tears we shed viewing it may be our own griefs and fears leaking out.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lonesome Love,"This film is highly recommended.Ang Lee's mediative and powerful film about a love that dare not speak its name, even with a western twang. Set in Wyoming during the early 60's, two cowboys, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, feel an intense but natural bond as they become drawn to each other over the years. Their initial rapport starts off quite physically before becoming a special but secretive relationship, one that could jeopardize their more conventional relationships and their own lives.Nominated for 7 Academy Awards ( Winner of 3 Oscars including screenplay, original music score, and Best Director ) the film lost out to Crash that year which many say was an injustice caused by homophobia. The film is a tragic and, at times, haunting masterpiece regardless of that outcome. Director Lee's frank yet sensitive treatment of a developing same sex relationship starts off very leisurely with a tad too many scenic atmospheric images of sunsets and mountain vistas, but build dramatically as the romance begins to deepen. Just as the characters are swept up into the romance, so is the film-goer.The acting is superlative by its cast ( including an up and coming young Anne Hathaway as Lureen, Joe's girlfriend ) with star turns by Michelle Williams as Ennis' lost soul of a wife, Alma, and Jake Gyllenhaal as his sexy and confused boyfriend, both deservingly nominated in supporting categories. Yet it the late Heath Ledger that transcends his role as a married man yearning for love and finding it too late. His performance is so nuanced and touching. He conveys the anguish and passion both in what he does physically as an actor and what he does intuitively with his hesitant actions, his halted speech patterns, and his far-off introspective stares. It is a completely masterful performance. ( His final parting scene is so heartfelt and gut-wrenching to watch that it leaves one moved to tears. It has also become an iconic moment in modern cinematic history. )The screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana captures the era well and contains many memorable moments of dialog as the film depicts an unorthodox affair with such refreshing honesty and raw emotion. Production values are top notch also.Lee and his cast accomplish a wonderful blending of melancholy and genuine artistry. Brokeback Mountain will break your heart as it illuminates the human condition.",,Anonymous,Romance
Let's be honest,"Ang Lee's a fine director. Any intelligent person knows this. The photography was great, dialog seemed realistic, the acting...Well, what do you expect when the basic premise was envisioned by a character on South Park? To be fair, I found Ledger to be surprisingly convincing. On the other hand Jake's ridiculous accent, prop comic-looking mustache and ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" were pathetic. When this movie was released (you're welcome: I didn't say ""came out""), it was promoted as a love story and about how people don't understand the community involved. Awfully preachy for a movie that got so many angry at the ""hypocritical"" religious community. Beyond that, little time was spent showing how the actions of the characters affected their families. The wives take up all of 15 minutes of the movie it seems. Neither is offered an explanation or apology as far as I can tell. They're relegated to shame--whenever someone cheats on someone else whether they're gay or straight it's the same universal idea--for being left behind, not good enough. If the two really loved each other and if it was really a love story, not politically motivated, then it could've been shot as a married hetero couple having an affair...oh but that would've been wrong (which IS true). The wives have to feel shame for trying to change men who are in effect cowards because they refuse to ""be who they truly are."" It's effective in making you feel for characters involved, but for me it was more for their families. There's a touching scene at the end that has an odd uncomfortable resolution where you'll feel this no matter what. Still, Gyllenhal's out of place acting (the rest of the cast do quite well) and the awkward push for the viewer to accept this as a pure love story are too much to make it anywhere near the masterpiece it's proclaimed to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
This one was all about Heart.,"I grade movies on how the affect me as much if not more than artistry, content, editing, etc. This movie has haunted me for weeks, and was the first movie that made me cry since I was about ten years old. Not just choked up, and not like I felt like I might cry and resisted; there was no resisting about this one. That's enough for me right there to put it in my top ten all time films as far as personal effect. When you add in amazing spare storytelling and editing, amazing sparse shooting, fascinating lighting and production, nuanced acting, and incredible music, or rather an incredible all around matching of editing, production, and score, with overall social impact and an important and timely message...you have a classic; Oscar or no Oscar. That is why the few flaws tend to fade in my mind...and why any flaws tend to seem insignificant, and mentioning them churlish, in the face of such impact...and why they have so little to do with my rating. This one was all about heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyed movie but was disappointed again,"I agree the movie is visually stunning. I was drawn into the story even though I felt it began too slow. I was disappointed that the movie really did not go far enough into the ""true"" relationship of the main characters. I know I have seen the same reasons in other movies about the gay relationship. I would have enjoyed the movie more if the people would have evolved after twenty years. The main characters were still young enough to have enjoyed a long healthy relationship. Why does one of the gay characters always have to have a bad ending. I would have enjoyed the movie better if the author and director had taken more chances and not played it safe. If this movie wishes to win an Oscar, I believe it should have done more...much more. I do not feel this film advances the concept of ""love.""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Waste of Time,"I watched for 1 hour. I wish I knew how to quit the movie earlier. Even Randy Quaid couldn't save it. I wanted to see it because I heard the action was intense. They meant the action was in tents. I knew their preferences were suspect when they hired on to watch sheep. The movie was not realistic. True cowboys jump in the river. They don't take sponge baths. This movie should have been called ""Beans and Franks"". I do give the characters credit though. It must have been tough getting in the saddle the next morning. Heath Ledger's mumbling dialog was interesting. Did he take the marbles out of his mouth for the kissing scenes? Seriously, just because a movie addresses controversial subject matter doesn't automatically make it good. It was boring and bad. To make sure any personal homophobic bias hasn't crept in. I imagined one of the cowpokes being a pretty female. The movie still failed my test.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A revelation about human love.,"They told me this was a movie about gay cowboys. The ads for it read ""Love is a force of nature."" How confusing, I thought. So I went not knowing what to expect. First thing that struck me was how quiet the audience was....man, what silence. The actors looked pretty tough and rugged, like they always did in westerns. Then came the tent scene ...and right there it hit me with a wallop. Man, I don't think I've been this glued to the screen in years. The first thing I felt was how the West could never be quite the same anymore. The next was my amazement in how they got two such tough guys to portray sensitivity the way they did. The answer had to be director Ang Lee with such an expressive Americana I have not seen since George Stevens' time. What a craftsman. Another answer lies with the two stars. Jake Gyllenhaal and his doe-like eyes filled with devotion. So vulnerable and such human vulnerability. But if a masterful director and a congenial, gifted actor weren't enough - - and these are plenty - - my greatest impression from the movie is Heath Ledger. What a treasure trove of talent! He is simply amazing. A repertoire of voice, walk, gesture, glance, grunting... and he breaks your heart with them. His portrayal of a lovesick cowboy is unforgettable. He just grows and grows on you! Not since James Dean or Monty Clift has there been one like he. Playing a man of few words who handles his quiet moments on screen with sledge- hammer effect. But I'm straying from the story. Because for all their strengths and toughness, life throws them a curve-ball. I wish I could tell you more without giving the movie away. Suffice it to say that one of the men must struggle with his inner demons, a struggle so fraught with pain that it exacts a heavy toll not only on them, but delivers much collateral damage to the women in their lives. They too suffer over some things that are no fault of theirs. But it's the men, Ennis and Jack, who endure the most misery, a misery that cannot even be articulated by either man due to their isolation; neither afford to say the words ""I love you"" to each other. This happens because these are the rules society has made for them. Cowboys, especially. It's drilled into us from when we're little boys that a man can't have a romantic interest in another man. Even for lonesome drifters.After witnessing these hardships and struggles most Americans know so little about, I leave the theater and go home, not in the mood to go shopping. I thought of myself as a kid wearing my cowboy hat, holster, and six gun, and how I realize my view of cowboys will be forever changed because of this movie. I even wondered what Randolph Scott, my favorite cowboy star, would feel about Ennis and Jack riding along the Chisolm trail with him? You've come a long way, Randy! Let me finish by telling everyone they have nothing to fear from this movie. They do only if human love is fearful to them. If they forget that love is truly one of nature's forces...and a transcending one. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a momentous movie I tell my friends. Especially when viewed more with the heart than with the eyes. It's a pivotal event in American cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Perfect Insight into human character and emotional struggle,"A masterpiece of situation and emotional analysis. Seeing the movie takes you back to the emotional uproar of your own emotions, makes you remember what you went through in a similar situation. A dive into melancholy and nostalgia supported by the perfect scenery and great soundtrack. The performances of Ledger and Gyllenhaal are unprecedented: Very natural and very pragmatic. Ledger's emotional struggle between own desire and what society imposes is a landmark and a milestone of performance. Gyllenhaal's character on other side gives another side of the coin. Ledger is the scared person who does not dare to accept his reality and Gyllenhaal is the revolutionary, ready to give everything up for what he believes, for what he feels. A presentation of human values long forgotten. A milestone in the cinematic history of homosexual love. A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
At least you get to see it...,"I find it frustrating that no theater within 180 miles is even showing it. I love Ang Lee as a director! I live in the Florida panhandle, and would have to go to New Orleans or Jacksonville to see it. I'm a heterosexual married woman, and it irritates me that I cant see an Oscar nominated film because of fear of the churchgoing backlash. The threats of theater boycotts have kept anyone from showing it. I'm simply amazed because many showed Farenheit 911, and that was a blatant political doc. It's just irritating, and makes me want move back out to the West Coast.ARggghhhhhh",,Anonymous,Romance
"truth is beautiful, but it can hurt","Friends said Brokeback Mountain was a bit slow. From the start I knew I was in Mahler territory - a symphonic structure was unfolding on the screen. Like great music, this film lives outside time but is shaped by time. It stays with you, living in your soul.I have always struggled to enjoy Romeo and Juliet. But in this great film I can at last feel a work is expressing and presenting with power, and in an inward way, the dreadful inexorable struggle between the individual person and the society he/she lives in. Ennis says if you can't fix it you gotta just stand it, and that is one of the most enraging, truthful, and bitterly fulfilling things one can say about this life. This is why, apart from its great visual and musical beauty, the film has such universal appeal, why teenagers and old men find it reaches into their being and stays there (I'm nearly 57, nearly twenty years on from Jack Twist when the story ends - hey, we're almost contemporaries!).Hats off to the actors. The women carried a huge burden in this film and I cannot imagine stronger performances than Ann Hathaway and Michelle Williams gave. They both were in a situation, to use Jack's heavy word. Mr Ledger reminded me of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, finding ways to express the inexpressive. But Mr Ledger goes deeper.The guts and feeling and truth and beauty are all there in Annie Proulx's short story masterpiece. The film is a great interpreter of the story and a masterpiece in its own right - like Guernica, like the Kindertotenlieder. Many thanks, Ang Lee and Larry McMurtrie and your colleagues.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Complex love-story,"The reviews about this movie convinced me to see it, although I had some resistance that it might be just a gay-cowboy-movie in which I would not be so interested. When the story developed it became clear that this movie could not deliver what I was hoping for. Apart from that, I consider it to be a lot better as ""Million Dollar Baby"" from Clint Eastwood. Both movies are about USA-sensitive subjects, but Brokeback Mountain is more balanced and has a much deeper developed storyline.The first half of the movie is a bit disappointing as it does not show anything new and surprising. Half-way the movie the characters became more interesting as the complexity of their situations increased. This complexity is also, for my opinion, the most interesting thing about the movie.Although there is nothing wrong with this movie in the sense of ""Oscar-values"", for my opinion it is became a bit over-rated by it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie was a waste two hours of my time.,"""I wish I knew how to quit you."" How about, ""I wish I could go back in time and un-watch this movie.""Okay, this movie went from mediocre, to insulting, to dull, to depressing.The only characters I really sympathised with were the wives Ledger and Gyenhaal's characters and the parents at the end.It's essentially a movie in which Ang Lee attempts to glorify, or at least excuse, dishonesty and infidelity on a grand scale. The scripting and dialogue was dull, the plot was vapid and uninspired, and none of the scenes really flowed. The sex scene was nothing short of ridiculous - what was with those idiotic grunts? And why did they have to beat each other up just to make out? Because they were BIG TOUGH COWBOY men? Ridiculous.Even the soundtrack was a letdown. The only thing I particularly enjoyed about this movie was the cinematography - the visuals were excellent, and some of the pans and tracking shots were excellent. But a movie being ""pretty"" isn't enough of a reason to watch it.Anyways, in summary, don't watch Brokeback Mountain.

Fascinating movie!,"It is very difficult and it is really hard to write something about this movie. The first surprise for me came when I entered into a movie theater auditorium. It was ten minutes before beginning of the performance and nobody was there. However, the auditorium was full during several minutes. The age structure of the people was interesting. I expected almost young people, between 20 and 30, but it came surprisingly also older people, between 40 and 50. By the way, the movie was also rated like in the U.S.A. (age 15 and older). The typical noise was heard during the advertisements, but at a time there was deep silent. No talking or no rustling of popcorn bags or something like this. From the first minute, I was fascinated and ""absorbed"" by the movie. Wyoming is really beautiful and fascinating. I was never there and in America also, but I felt me like in my home country, because I love mountains. One can say that there were kitsch pictures, but I don't think so. The camera was wonderful and very sensitive. I am not big fan of country music, but it was very nice. I am looking forward to a soundtrack. Finally, the actors were all fantastic. However, I would like to pay a compliment to Heat Ledger as Ennis Del Mare. He surprised me. Your interpretation of Ennis Del Mare was so realistic that I believed him all what he said. Your mimic face reactions were really believable. With minimum of the words he can express every emotions that were either on the surface or very deep inside and the tried came up. It is also due to Leadger's very interesting voice with fascinating timbre. Keep it up! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An excellent movie that everyone should see,"This movie was released on Dec 9th 2005 with all the hype and press of any other movie. You would hear people talking about the ""gay cowboy"" movie and are you going to see it? Most straight people would say no politely though some would say hell no or something more offensive. Give the hype and press about this movie, I think the only thing to say after reading all of the bad reviews about it is plain. If you don't want to see a movie about homosexuals, don't go this this one. When ""The passions of Christ"" came out not long ago, I didn't rush right out to see it. Mainly because all the churches and religious right-wingers were saying how grand and wonderful that movie was. If I needed to know the story about Jesus and how he suffered, I would pick up my Bible and read it. I didn't need Mel Gibson telling me his version of what happened. People want to protest and boycott things that are different and maybe not their viewpoints in life but if they don't want to watch a wonderfully made movie about true love between two grown adult individuals then just don't watch it. NO ONE is forcing you to go and pay to watch it. I read one review where someone stated after watching part of the movie they got up and left because they figured out what it was about. Well DUH, I think the media had covered that one pretty much well in advance. I read a review that the people who made this movie were the same people who didn't love this country and family and things to that nation. Well, I didn't make the movie but I loved the movie and have seen it a few times with various friends. I love this great and wonderful country that allows us the freedoms and rights that to not only make a movie that might be somewhat controversial but also allows us to voice our opinions in praise or denial of said movie. A great philosopher once said ""I might not agree with your beliefs, but I will defend your right to voice them"". I think this movie will changes minds about love and realize that people no matter their gender, race, sexual orientation, can and do fall in love and that everyone has that inalienable and unequalled right.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rule of Twos: What Wives Know and Allow,"Larry McMurtry is a good writer, but a lazy one. So he sticks to one of the most common formulas, the rule of twos. When used well, this compounds. So we start with two people in love, natch. That will split so that we have two pairs, two husbands and wives. The husbands will be where the story happens and the wives where it is watched from.Then on the other side, you'll need a pair of external watchers. If the two wives are internal watchers, you'll need two almost-wives as external ones: here, the newly betrothed daughter and the almost fianceed girl friend. The center of the thing is the pair of watchers, the wives. Even though all the attention is on the guys, the thing revolves around the two wives.(At the end, we encounter a third wife who simply echos the deal: what wives see and know, what they allow and what they govern.)Lee's projects all exploit the rule of twos. It was obvious in the first one I saw, his love/food movie, and every one since. He seeks out scripts structured this way because he knows how to exploit them. Quite apart from the human dynamics, look at how he handles the scenery. A hack will give us full-blown, high octane beauty against which you'll contrast mere humans fighting or flowing.Hacks like Robert Redford in ""River Runs Through It"" where we are assaulted by the beauty of the place. Or if you want a western, ""Open Range"" which not only grinds the scenery into our eyes, but gives us an encyclopedic tour of all the impedimenta of ranching. The worst example I know is ""Proof of Life"" where the agenda was most obvious: vast openness, claustrophobic confinement.Look what Ang has done. The mountains are glorious but photographed dully as if seen by someone who grew up there. In fact, when you see the postcards, the difference is obvious: the cards are romantically unreal. He's included all sorts of genuine gear and methods but in no case has he veered off to show: hey look at this article of truth. No, his truth and scope are amplified because they are assumed rather than tutored.(There's only one place where the power of cinema is fully unleashed. A juxtaposition of fireworks and Ennis when he 'explodes."")Now, knowing this, and that the thing rests in the two women, look to see the two moments which form the fulcrum of this thing. Most good filmmakers have one scene in mind when they conceive the movie and everything grows from that center. A rule of twos man will have two. One is the moment when Alma first lets her husband go off knowing why.The more powerful sun around which everything revolves is a scene where Ann Hathaway as Jack's widow recounts his fate. The makeup is extraordinary, worth a dedicated comment. (Teeth.) But watch how many emotions go through her face as she tells the story. We discover what she knew, even what her culpability may be. We discover the existence of her own closet of secrets and rivers we'll never see.Sure, Ledger is good. But you have to understand how carefully this internal/external no- speaking notion was set up and sustained in every element that surrounds him. Every single element is congruent with this one philosophy. That's what makes this great film-making regardless of what you think of the movie.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Romance
Music Missteps,"I give this film a seven (high for me) just merely for the IDEA of it as well as superb acting moments and the middle finger it extends to the narrow minds of Middle America. However, the music was a big disappointment to me. The time period covered included some amazing country music; especially in the early 70's when social commentary in country music songs by writers like Jimmy Webb, Kris Kristofferson, Tom T. Hall, etc. was the rule rather than the exception. With so many scenes set in honky tonks, the bands and jukeboxes could have featured so many gems that added authenticity and subtly colored the conceit of this film. Perhaps the biggest gaffe was having Steve Earle's ""Devil's Right Hand"" pour out of a jukebox in 1978 which is AT LEAST 10 years early for that song. The acoustic guitar cues adding atmosphere to the Brokeback Mountain scenes were nice, if not perfunctory. Also, I don't think the word Vietnam was mentioned even once. You could argue that this film was not about Vietnam and to do that would have distracted from the central issue, but to NOT mention it seems to miss an opportunity to harness the irony and anger of the era.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Cinematic Landmark,"The feeling lingers. The images come back, not to haunt you but to reassure you. There is an element of hope within the melancholic sadness of this Ang Lee masterpiece. There hasn't been such a limpid definition of love since the world was still innocent. Limpid, yes, that's the word that comes to mind, remembering the shy lopsided smile of the extraordinary Heath Ledger. Who could possibly have predicted that Heath Ledger was such a giant, unquestionably destined to a legendary career. Well, Ang Lee I guess. Lee seems in total control of his canvas. Every frame is a moment, the silences are exquisite, the humans are as humans are and we're allowed to dive into their hearts without tricks without illusions.

Ang Lee showed that love will not be denied. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall made me believe this was their story, not a film, but their real, gritty, hard-edged lives. Their passion and desire, love, angst, anger, confusion, all their emotions, leaped off that screen and blew an entire audience away. My 16-year-old daughter and I witnessed it! There wasn't a dry eye in the house amongst us women. Although no men cried that we could see, they looked as though they'd been gut-punched - they were numb.

Well made but with no mainstream appeal despite the hype.,"Brokeback mountain is a character study. It has no antagonist or protagonist, unless you consider society and history's established view on homosexuality as evil. The visuals are spectacular, and heath ledger deserves credit, he is a rare talent. The director should have edited the film more sedately. The scenes involving sex are uneven which reeks of agenda. If you want to show vivid graphic homosexual scenes, don't chop the heterosexual scenes before they become vivid and graphic. There are also scenes involving Ledger's gay lover that are completely irrelevant and silly. This movie has no mass appeal it was allowed to run in theaters for over 4 months. The Hollywood establishment was orgasmic, and it was lavished with award after award at the expense of other far more deserving films of the year, including other romance movies like Must Love Dogs, blockbusters with opposing messages such as The Chronicles of Narnia and even The 40 year old virgin which where far more memorable than brokeback mountain. 2005 was a terrible year for movies, especially for dramas. Perhaps it was by design, nothing Hollywood does these days surprises me. The characters aren't likable, but as I said it's a character study and it was well made. That much said it is completely inappropriate for Hollywood to prop it up in an obvious attempt to give it mainstreen appeal, far better movies have been yanked after a month. It has no mainstream appeal. Strictly for the artistically astute.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Regardless of the sexuality of the characters or the viewer, the movie was amazing","I just returned from the theater and I thought BBM was an amazing, touching, frustrating, depressing, wonderful film. I'm neither a gay rights advocate nor a homophobe. I'm just a straight guy who believes in living and letting live. BBM was a sad movie about loss and denial and not being true to oneself and suffering the consequences and not being able to get what you really want and feeling pain and hurting others intentionally or unintentionally. That's all. It was about life. I'm feeling bad right now - not because the Academy snubbed this ""gay movie,"" but because the characters felt a lot of pain, just like in real life. This, to me, is the mark of a good movie: it makes you see and feel things that you see and feel in real life, regardless of your gender, sexuality, race, economic status, political beliefs or other traits.

Why bother?,"At the time I write this there is already some 1500 viewer comments, and I doubt anyone will read that many posts to finally come to my own comments. So I don't really know why I should bother. But in case there is that one person who does get this far....All I can say is that this movie hits you hard - and it hurts.The first thing that caught my eye was the broad variety of people in the theater... the very old, the very young, groups of girls, straight couples, gay couples, blacks and whites. I saw old men with their wives, I watched them cry. I felt the audience suck in a collective nervous breath when the first love scene occurs, but by the time the second love scene occurred the audience was leaning forward in their seats as though they would fall into the screen. This is not a movie you can effectively comment on because it is not one that is meant to entertain. It is an event, an event that grabs you by the front of your shirt and shakes you and forces you to realize that the real barter of life is love and relationships.But if any comment of value is to be made about the awesomeness of this film, it is the testimony of untold numbers of heterosexual men who are clearly mesmerized and captivated by it. It is not because they have suddenly felt homosexual feelings, but it is because men have been forced in society to keep all emotions and feelings locked away inside, and I think this movie touches them in that secret place of emotion and shows them that they are not alone. They are shown that they can show their love, they can show their emotions....if only life would back off and shut up and finally let them be a real person. I almost felt an urge to hug every straight guy in the theater just to tell them I know how they feel.I have a feeling that this movie will have one of the highest video sales of all time - not only purchased by those who saw it and loved it, but by all those men who wanted to see it but did not have the nerve to publicly attend a theater screening. I for one hope this movie helps people become better humans and more focused on the thing that matters most - love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gay agenda what exactly does that mean?,"Both my parents were Pentecostal ministers. My father was gay and my mother's mission in life was to save/change him. At one point around the age of 14 or 15 I babysat for my father's boyfriend's son. My father died a deeply depressed, broken unfulfilled man still blaming my mother for protecting me from him and preventing our relationship. The marriage was what they thought God wanted a marriage of duty not love. I came out to my parents at 18. My father knew I was gay but never sat and talked honestly with me about his situation. Around the age of 26 I became depressed and my mother swooped in hoping to succeed where she had failed with my father and talked me into entering a (teen challenge) sponsored program that claimed they could change gay men. For one year I worked hard, did as I was told, read or viewed nothing from the outside, memorized scripture, abstained from sex of any kind, fasted for 11 days while cooking for 16 people and prayed. After one year they told me I was changed and released me into the world. I was being encouraged to marry a girl from my parent's church but no one asked if we were in love. After a few months of honest reflection I ended the relationship and went on my way to live my life as intended.Gay people are accused of having an agenda. Just read the above and tell me honestly who really has the agenda. The gay agenda is to end the lies, hate, bondage, brutality and destruction.I went to see Brokeback Mountain last weekend. At first I was stunned then overwhelmed with sadness as I saw my father's life decisions repeated in front of the world. The sadness turned to empathy and understanding of the terrible anguish my father went through trying to change. My thoughts then turned to my mother's pain caused by her misguided mission of beating her head against the stone wall of my father's orientation. Again the sadness set in as I realized what a destructive force this misguided agenda to suppress gays is to entire families. Then I felt something lift from me realizing that so many people would see the destructive forces at play in or society. The rug is being lifted and the dirt of silence and oppression underneath is being exposed. There was a time when mixed race love was treated the same way. Thank you E. Annie Proulx, Ang Lee and all those with the courage to be involved with this project. Thank you for exposing the truth and wreckage.I am 52 now and have been in love with and living with the same man for 27 years.

Robbed for the 'Best Picture' Oscar,"What can you say about this film after so long? Just revisited it and it still has the same power it did when it first come out.
Still believe this is one of Gyllenhaal's best performances as well as Heath Ledger's. Robbed for the Oscar of 'Best Picture' from Crash...we knew it then, we know it now.",,Anonymous,Romance
The year of the agenda.,"The last two years have been interesting. First we got Million Dollar Baby and its pseudo emotionalism. Now we get Transamerica and Brokeback Mountain.First off, the film was well-constructed and the acting was great, especially from Jake (Heth was kind of terrible IMO). I am tired of ""art"" films forcing their agendas down our throats, though. The indy film crowd thinks they're onto something new and profound in recent years, but these type of statements were made waaaaaaaay back in the sixties and seventies and are simply nothing new to behold. So this is an unconventional love story. WOW. I think myriads of people will change their minds of gay marriage now because of this film.So will there be a film about polygamy next year? What about incestual marriage. After all, you can't confine love, right? I want to see a film about a fourteen year old boy who marries his forty year old aunt. That will be a great ""love story."" This is all very laughable to say the least, especially from those of you who take it all seriously.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delightfully Surprised,"I just caught Brokeback on cable about a week ago and haven't stopped thinking about it. When I describe it to people who've not seen it I say the story is sweet and at the same time tragic, the casting is perfect, the acting impeccable with it's understated style, the sets brilliant, the scenery breathtaking and the music haunting. The poverty and hardships of the core families is captured in the sets and costumes and opens windows into these areas of life with heart wrenching depiction. Heath and Jake were perfect as were every cast member. No wonder this movie received so much attention. I recommend anyone with a hang-up over the known subject matter of this film get over it and give this film a watch. I can't imagine you won't be glad you did.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too much bad to go along with the good,"Grade: B-Brokeback Mountain is a brave and daring movie that wisely doesn't focus on its controversial nature. This is a story about an unconventional love. The movie is quiet and simple, like its main character Ennis Del Mar. The biggest problems are that the performances and characters are the strongest points of the movie, not the screenplay and plot. Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams both give great performances well worth of the praise they are receiving. Jake Gyllenhall is very underrated. His character, Jack, is more outgoing, not as subtle or complicated as Ennis. The first act of the movie, until Ennis and Jack get together, is very slow. There are numerous shots and scenes with no purpose that really detract from what the movie could have been. All in all, Brokeback Mountain is good, but it's certainly not the best movie of the year.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fine directing and acting, but predictable","Decent but not worth all the hoo-hah, particularly in terms of the writing. Was very predictable and therefore I couldn't get too attached to the characters and wasn't very moved. Seemed to rely too much on the scenery and music to bring out the emotion, and it didn't work for me. Also, I was annoyed by the mumbling of the character Ennis -- I missed about half his lines. Seems to me there is some strange bias for this film because of the combination of the ""controversial"" subject matter (which I think doesn't seem all that controversial to younger generations like me) combined with a sense of Americana sentiment that is supposed to draw a tear, but definitely didn't for me and I usually cry at the drop of a hat.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It made me cry and cry but was such a testament to love - and to all the people who have paved the way for those of us who enjoy freedom today and in the future. I was moved by the simplicity of the characters - people with no context for their feelings and experiences, not reacting to anything they knew or had read about or seen, it seems. Being gay was not a part of their life-scape, but the feelings they had for one another were inescapably compelling. Truly sad was the pain caused to each one's wife; and it seemed realistic that both handled it differently.A lovely, lovely love story.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Powerful,"""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""CRASH"" were two of my favorite films this year, and ""Brokeback"" easily surpasses the stylish, yet choppy ""Crash."" Never before has a bitter wife and two forbidden lovers graced the screen with such beauty! Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal star as two ranchers hired for a summer's work. A cold night brings them together, and the narrow minded society that the live in tears them apart. Heath Ledger delivers a truly haunting performance as Ennis Del Mar! Supporting him is Jake Gyllenhaal who plays optimist Jack Twist. Michelle Williams proves she come a long way since ""Dawsons Creek"" and manages to keep up with her costars beautifully! One of the most intense scenes in the movie revolves around a Thanksgiving dinner. In this scene, I not only felt sympathy to Ennis's forbidden love, but also towards Alma (Williams) broken heart. ""Brokeback Mountain"" has everything that a great movie should have: Love, tragedy, a few laughs, and a story that shook the nation!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Excellent movie, robbed of Best Picture...OK Jen, take a breath, let it go...","As a straight woman, seeing it with three friends, we were moved to tears by this film. I think the ""homophobic"" pseudo-liberals of Hollywood showed their true color ""YELLOW"" as in cowardice. They would not vote for a film about love between two men. I live in LA and when I heard a producer friend, who is now just an ""acquaintance"" say that ""Of course they wouldn't give it to a movie about ""bf"" gay cowboys"". I was livid and I asked people who voted if they saw the movie and many of them said no. They were uncomfortable with it and had no desire to see it. The ""politically correct"" race relations in Crash was a safe issue, homosexuality was not. What a bunch of closeted, hypocritical bigots! What can I say, to have both a gay and trans-gendered theme film nominated for Academy Awards is wonderful. I pray that more funding and talent and clout go toward excellent films like these and alleviate the hatred and stupidity of our society.

"Brokeback Mountain (Ang Lee, 2005) ***","I had a chance to watch this highly-acclaimed, award-winning film on the big screen while I was in Hollywood at the beginning of the year but, put off by the subject matter, I resisted doing so - until now. Well, while essentially a good film, I'll certainly join the chorus of those who consider it quite overrated! It's definitely not the first (or most significant) gay-themed American film, mainstream or otherwise - and, vis-à-vis my recent viewing of Nagisa Oshima's samurai picture, GOHATTO (1999), it's hardly the first to put this kind of spin on popular film genres either!Anyway, the two men's relationship comes out of nowhere really (boredom and the extreme cold of the mountains, maybe?), especially since both state that they're not ""queer""; besides, there's no attempt at an explanation of why it should have lasted two decades! This lack of conviction, therefore, coupled with the slow pace results in a deadly first half…but the film improves somewhat with its depiction of the two characters' drab family life.The third and least interesting major ""cowboy"" film from Larry McMurtry (the others being HUD [1963] and THE LAST PICTURE SHOW [1971]), it's well-acted by an ensemble cast - even if Heath Ledger lays on the mumbling James Dean persona a bit too thick! In the end, Ang Lee's surprising choice as director eventually emerges a sound one, as he gives the film a welcome arty feel; another major asset is the melancholy score.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cinema grows up again...,"An exquisite exercise in how tasteful, yet powerful; how understated, and yet visceral cinema can still be. This has a purity that perhaps outshines the rough-diamond original prose-piece- itself brilliant. Ledger's performance stands alongside the very best of Brando, De Niro or Pacino for sheer silent muscularity yet tenderness. Heart rending in its reality and surprises- it's tiny revelations and it's nuances. Why did he not get the plaudits at the awards ceremonies? Gyllenhaal mirrors his strengths, but in a marginally less dimensioned way. Together under Ang Lees guiding hand they say as many things about love and the human condition as any 2 hour stretch of movie has managed in the last 50 years. Cinematography, score and script are crystalline in their perfection. A masterpiece that feeds emotion and intellect. Stunning! Tremendously sad news to hear of Heath Ledger's death. His performance, here alone, will secure his position amongst the very best actors to bring the screen alive.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overrated,"While I think ""Brokeback Mountain"" was well-acted and directed, it's probably one of the most over-hyped movies of 2005. The subject matter could have been handled in a more delicate manner. For example, the opening sex scene in the tent between Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhaal could have been displayed with a shot of the tent exterior and the camera slowly drawing back from the tent while the audience hears the sounds of sex coming from inside the tent. Today, however, Hollywood feels that everything involving a sexual and violent nature must be displayed graphically.I cannot feel any sympathy for Ledger's character. Not only does he feel it is appropriate for him and Gylenhaal to publicly display their homosexuality in front of Ledger's wife and children, but whenever he and Gylenhaal experience a disturbance in their relationship, he responds by berating his wife and threatening her with a beating.To me, this is just another gay-friendly movie with a twist. If it wins for Best Picture at the Oscars, it will prove that enough audiences and critics have been fooled yet again by the ""Hollywood Hype"".",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Have I missed something?!,"To all the people of the world who've loved this film - 'What movie did you guys see?!'This has to be one of the dullest,blandest and most irritatingly sterile film's that I've watched in my entire movie-going life.Based on a short story by Annie Proulx,it should have remained just that - a short story.But screenwriters McMurtry and Ossana in their infinite wisdom have seen it fit to 'flesh-out' the story in order that it become 'filmable'.Although the story spans 20 years,the main leads don't seem to look any older than their younger selves and,in particular,the horrendous and amateurish wigs worn by all the protagonists appear positively laughable (don't miss the stick-on sideburns!).Heath Ledger's 'fantastic' performance amounts to spending the whole movie speaking from the south-west corner of his mouth so that audiences go back not having understood a word of what he said.The pace of the film is,to put it politely,leisurely,and I found myself looking at my watch once too often to check on the seemingly endless passage of time.To top it all,although this is supposed to be a love story,it distinctly comes across more as a lust story.I'm practically speechless as to why this movie has got so many raves.It's probably going to sweep all the major awards and I guess I'll have to enroll in some film-appreciation classes to perhaps 'understand' and fully appreciate this kind of cinema.As was the case with director Lee's earlier monumental bore 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon','Brokeback Mountain' left me cold and completely unmoved.If this seems less like a review and more like a rant,then I guess it just points to the fact as to how passionately I detest this piece of trite.The 2/10 rating is only for Rodrigo Prieto's breathtaking cinematography.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Moving,"The one and only reason to watch a movie is to being moved. To be moved out of your own reality into the reality of the characters but then again feeling strong resonance with your own life subconsciously. Brokeback Mountain is such a movie which touches the most hurting wounds in our lives: the wounds caused by missing a chance, by missing an opportunity to walk another path. These wounds hurt the most when the only reason to not have chosen the other path is our own fear. Fear is such a destructive emotion and mostly an amalgam of our childhood experiences, education and socialization. On the other hand, love can also be destructive but the combination of both as we see in BBM is truly tragic.While Ennis is the fearsome guy it's Jack who always believes and hopes that one day their love will be stronger than Ennis' fears. But Ennis doesn't make a decision until it's too late.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play these two characters and their love for each other in such a believable way that we are deeply touched. Yes, it is only a movie ... but we all know that must be many stories out there like the one between Ennis and Jack.Ang Lee did a fantastic job here. He created a true epic, with epic landscapes, epic emotions and an epic time line. On the other hand BBM is a very intimate movie watching closely the expressions of the protagonists. The music fits perfectly. It's minimalistic, not at all sweeping strings like the ones of 'Out of Africa'. Just one small complaint: I wish Lee had filmed in Cinemascope just because of the great visuals in the mountains; I think this would have made the movie even stronger.See this movie and you will hopefully see the world in a different light after watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Profoundly Melancholic Masterwork,"At its core this film is not about sexuality it is about profound loss and about not having a true life. Not one character comes though the other end of this without loss. And why? Not easily answered. An intolerant society and a rigid masculine template jump to mind. This film is hard to characterize, though. From its opening shot to its final one, there is an overwhelming sense of isolation and loneliness. Time passes but the outside world rarely infiltrates; some songs, some hairstyles, some newer cars but never the news of the day. This remoteness makes the film and its ultimate conclusion a tragedy. If there is ever a place to live a truthful and fulfilling life it should be Brokeback Mountain, but neither Jack Twist nor especially Ennis del Mar can truly live the life they desire. As it stands, theirs is mingled life that spans years and yet still seems empty and devoid. I cannot say truthfully that the actions of these men are without criticism especially with how they affect others in their lives but nothing they do to other people compares to what they do to each other. While theirs is a timeless love, both physically and spiritually, they also are haunted with melancholy and emptiness; a troubled human conflict that will shake most loving people to their core.As a film it is remarkable. Ang Lee's direction is a masterly and will be studied. Every image, every performance and edit is delicately and masterfully maintained throughout. The performances are amazing and for some will be career defining. Ledger is revelatory and I would stand his performance alongside any of Brando's early ones. You know Ennis. You love him and are angry with him and Ledger is never false in his portrayal. Gyllenhaal is just as amazing. Jack is the yin to Ennis' yang and Jake nails him. Without his character's love for life, the final scenes would not carry as much emotionally. Jake's performance is focused in his eyes and the sparkling flame within them. Watching that flame diminish over time is heartbreaking. Michelle Williams' Alma has deservedly received accolades and she is raw and real. Just as noteworthy is Anne Hathaway and I must say she really surprised me. In what could have been a mannered and arch character, she brings Lureen startlingly to life, most notably in her phone conversation with Ennis. The photography and music are beautifully intertwined and will stir your emotions and be with you for days.That this film is subjected to trite and hateful degradations by some is saddening. It seems at conflict with the truth and compassion that these ""moral"" people aspire to. To spout vitriol about this film seems so misplaced if anyone has truthfully seen it. It is this hate, however, that hits to the core of what Ennis believes. That no matter how fundamentally real Ennis' and Jack's feelings are for one another, there will be those that hate them and being hated is a more unspeakable horror than living alone.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

coitus interruptus                    (*may have spoilers here*),"I saw Brokeback Mountain yesterday and left the theatre with this piercing feeling, which is not pleasant at all.The general feeling in the end is like a 'coitus interruptus' by a huge pain piercing your stomach.Looking back to the movie, it gives you a wish of having changed the facts to have the plot ended up differently.Also, I missed loves scenes in the movie (is that only me?) as this is all about the love between the 2 guys, but once they finally get together, you don't see them cuddling, holding, touching, kissing each other. They go to those fishing-escapes, but the movie show them only chatting, discussing future, etc. As if they were only chaps. I guess if someone has to wait 4 years to see the one he loves, at the moment you are together with the person, you would enjoy every single minute the more you can.I don't know....

A stunning love story,"I am not sure how I can describe this movie with words. This is a story of 2 cowboys falling in love unexpectedly yet their love lasted forever. Ang Lee did an amazing job in telling this story. When you watch the movie, you feel that you are one of their friends watching how their love blossoms and how it goes thru the ups and downs. Thumbs to all actors and actresses. Heath and Jake were amazing. They never say I love you to each other yet their eyes are full of emotions of love. Sadly, they never end up with each other. Once you see this movie, you can't help wonder how can something so beautiful as true love between 2 human beings be so wrong in the society's eyes! Love is love. Who cares it is the same sex or not! The movie described well how the homosexuals are prejudiced in this movie and it is still the same in this reality world. I think this movie really inspire people to think and encourage one to face with true self. It is sort of a wake up call to the society not to place any more unnecessary prejudices against homosexuality. The acting is great. The scenery is beautiful. The plots are well played out. It is so good to see a movie like this. Strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Dreadful, and a disgrace to taboos","The story of a long-time romantic relationship between two cowboys should, in a perfect world, be a beautiful tale. It should show that despite the taboo of same-sex relationships, love and compassion can reign supreme. Instead, we're stuck with a deadeningly dull piece of slop that would put any sentimentalist to sleep if there weren't so many goshdarn panoramic views of mountains.Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger) are itinerant cowpokes who sign up to herd a mess o' sheep across Brokeback Mountains, and during the long drive, they fall for each other. Only it doesn't happen gradually, it's lust at first sight, after a cold night in a hot tent up in the mountains. After that, it's decades of pining and not immediately getting what one wants.I honestly believe that this movie has been such a big hit (critically and commercially) because of its same-sex theme, rather than because of its, oh I don't know, good acting or script. The plot is exceedingly simplistic; it's so easy to follow, you'll be able to predict the next scene with ease. But because the two principals are men, suddenly what's such a humdrum story ascends to an exalted level of genius.Make no mistake, it's a pretty picture to look at, and I do recommend watching it with the sound off. Maybe you love lovely scenery - there's a lot of gorgeous setting. Or maybe you're a straight woman or gay man and think Ledger and Gyllenhaal are hot hunks. With no sound, you'll be very happy. Turn the sound on, though, and you'll quickly realize there's no there, there. The problem with being a Beautiful Person on the outside, of course, is that people often assume you're a dullard inside. When Ennis or Jack speaks, there aren't pearls of wisdom that come dropping out; no, they're more like balls of silt, spoken either sotto voce or outright mumbled, the better to fame the words as Profound. There's nothing profound about the movie, other than the vast infinity of the untamed mountains.The movie perks up only when other actors show up. Randy Quaid has a few short scenes, and he easily outacts the younger leads. Michelle Williams, who plays Ennis's wife Alma, and Anne Hathaway, who plays Jack's wife Lureen, light up the screen when they're there, showing more vigor and passion with the hook of an eyebrow than either of the lunkheaded leads can with every expressionless countenance they can conjur. Ledger, who seemed to be channeling Steve McQueen's look, mumbles incoherently through much of the movie; this was partly owing to the chaw in his mouth (I presume), but still - when trying to be Profound, it is wise to be Understandable.I believe that this movie was swept up in hype, as people were first astonished at the man-on-man sex scenes (which looked and sounded as loving as a rape scene, although I'm no expert on gay sex scenes) and then proud of themselves for deigning to watch it. It's a real shame a taboo like this couldn't have been broken by a solid, adult film instead of the crappy, one-dimensional clichés and characterizations that screenwriter Larry McMurtry came up with; somehow, in the world of this movie, laconic equals deep.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

The score of Santaolalla is splendid. The direction of Ang Lee impeccable. All of this contributes to perfectly make the believable history. For the first time the theme is treated without any vulgarity. A sin that the homophobia will bring many not to see it. The film is powerful. The history remains you inside, it saddens, but it makes to reflect on the love and the life. The Brokeback Mountains are not anything else other than a place to whose search goes all, perhaps a mental state, where is you free from every inhibition, where to find the love, that a life fills, if the whole life we are fortunate.

Brokeback broke my heart,"I felt compelled to leave a comment here because I've never seen a movie that has moved me so deeply like Brokeback Mountain did.The movie wasn't as half as good as it is without the perfect performances of the entire cast. You could actually turn off the sound and just look at the facial expressions and gestures and you would still understand the story. Heath Ledger as a lonesome cowboy is simply breathtaking. His pain and sadness, expressed with few words and gestures is absolutely heartbreaking. It is amazing, how a twenty something year old man understands such a complex character and he shows it in every single gesture.Ang Lee's images are extremely powerful. You can almost smell the grass and feel the wind. He knows exactly what he does, no second is wasted. I love his understated and subtle style of directing. There is a lot of silence, but the atmosphere is always intense and emotionally charged.The movie is more than the sum of its parts, though. I can't find a logical explanation for the fascination that this story has for so many people around the world. ""The secret of Brokeback Mountain"" (That's the title for this movie here in Europe) will always be kept together with Jack's ashes up there in the Mountains. The only things left for Ennis' are the bittersweet memories and his longing that echoes now eternally through the mountain of Brokeback Mountain- and through your soul, long after the last credits have rolled down. -This is a terrific movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ang Lee masterfully expressed the tension of the situation and extremely difficult scenes, such as the initial somewhat violent sex scene, with such taste, that at no point was it difficult to watch.If you want to watch a film about forbidden love, and the lengths that homosexuals had to go to in the past (and possibly to some degree in the present) then watch this film.

A fairly good movie with a gimmick,"I'll probably get a lot of flak for this, but I seriously think that the only reason Brokeback Mountain got so much hype was because it featured a gay couple. Put a girl in one of their parts and the movie becomes a whole lot less interesting. This is a problem, especially when the film's supporters act like the love between the two characters is more important than their genders. Basically, the movie is about two lovers who cannot be together because of social standards. That's not an original plot, and I don't even think their love is developed as well as it could have been. Other movies do it better.Overall, Brokeback is certainly a rather good movie. I just don't think it's amazing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A short story that should have been treated as a short film.,"Let's not look at BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN as the ""gay cowboy"" movie or as ""the film that should have won the Best Picture Oscar."" Let's avoid the clichés that cinema as an art form reflects the political nature of society and let's definitely not tiptoe around the stance that the homosexual community needs to rally around this film and treat it as a benchmark. Instead, let's look at BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN as a film, something many reviewers (and fans) refuse to do.From its opening scene of a lonely pre-dawn road, through the entire first act filled with Canadian majesty masquerading as the purple mountains of Wyoming, film auteur Ang Lee tries his best to illustrate the solitary life that a sheep-herder must certainly face. This solidarity continues its theme as Ennis and Jack learn that they are a definite minority and how their lifestyle affects other choices they must deal with.BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN possess a number of fine and memorable scenes, most of which occur in the following two acts where Ennis and Jack, apart from each other, do their best to simply live life. Lee's base camera-work coupled with beautifully-authentic looking sets helps capture these cinematic moments. Where BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN fails is its inability to place these individual moments into a cohesive and compelling film. Lee fails in glancing over this solitary cowboy life by providing nothing more than the quickest of glimpses. As a result, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN as a whole appears as nothing more than filler material padding a short story.The silent moments in a cowboy's life is a topic that has been illustrated in more compelling films than this. Kevin Costner's OPEN RANGE is perhaps the most current example. A handful of good scenes does not make a complete narrative and Ang Lee and James Schamus have partnered on better collaborations than this.Heath Ledger's Ennis is a one-dimensional rough and stoic cowboy of old whose press has surprisingly outshone that of Jake Gyllenhaal's work, whose character - and acting - is definitely the superior of the two.Not to slight Annie Proulx's magazine story, it appeared that Lee and Oscar-winning writing team of McMurty and Ossana failed to forget the basic premise of adapting a single short story into a full-length feature. Great scenes become highly memorable but without a cohesive story combining such scenes into a greater sum results in an unimpressive overall movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
It is just a heart-breaking story that moved me to the bottom of my soul. I believe now I have seen real love.,"It is useless to say that it is the best movie I have ever seen. I simply cannot believe that I've seen it just now, that it's been out there for two years. I saw it twice so far, and I cried for three days after seeing it. My head hurt so bad, but the memory of the truly moving love story I saw was too alive in my soul for me to help myself from crying. I saw it with a friend of mine, and she was so surprised I cried. I cannot believe that there are people out there that were not moved by this incredible movie. It's definitely much more than ""gay cowboy movie"" some label it. It is just so sad, it was the only movie that made me cry. After seeing it, I watched different sequences, and each one made my heart shrink. My brain tries desperately to tell my heart that it's just a movie, but it's just the most romantic and the deepest movie. Watching it, I simply forgot that there were two men involved in that story. It just seamed as a hidden relationship, no matter who the two people involved were. I could never have imagined that a love story can be so sad. I have friends that make fun of me for crying over a movie, and especially over a ""gay"" movie. I just don't get them. After seeing this movie I have a totally different conception over what love can be. I can't imagine somebody not being moved by this movie. Maybe not as moved as to be sad and depressed for a week - like I am - but at least to get some of them thinking. Just listening to the soundtrack brings tears to my eyes, because it makes me recall all the happy moments Ennis and Jack had together, and how tragically they had to part. It is truly a wonderful love story, probably the most emotional ever written. No words can describe in how many ways this movie moved me. Great job! Excellent performance from the two very brave actors, and outstanding work from the director&crew. I may be heart-broken for a while after this emotional experience, but I could't be happier with having seen this wonderful piece of art.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
not as good as I expected,"For all the credit given I was expecting a lot more from this film. Sure the scenery and acting was great and the portrayal of homosexuals refreshing - actually making them out to be human which I for one totally approve of - but could it go any slower? OK I'm being harsh I know and after reading through a number of other comments, which generally rate it between 9 and 10 out of 10, I feel kind of mean BUT while I would watch it again, it just didn't live up to the expectations it had earned from previous reviews. I saw the film after the 'mad dash to the cinema' episode and while I was interested in the characters life and the beautiful scenery and the...characters life?... I did expect a lot more from such a highly acclaimed film. While the film was not as brilliant as I expected the cinematography was stunning, the scenery magnificent and the acting superb (even though our brilliant Heath Ledger barely opened his mouth when he spoke. Even after my harsh comments I would still recommend the film as after I saw it I appreciated it more. All in all a nice film but nothing overly extraordinaries",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simple but powerful!!,"This is my pick for best movie Oscar. It is impossible for me to imagine this film being any better. The story is uncomplicated but powerful, engaging, and well written. The cast is perfect. I cannot think of two better actors that contrast yet complement each other so well. Heathe Ledger's portrayal of Ennis, the orphaned, introverted, complex, and troubled man is Oscar worthy. Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of an open, simple, warm, loving man is Oscar worthy as well. The play between the two is the story. A little aside, if you have seen Jarhead, I think you will realize Jake is the modern ""common man""...Jimmy Stewart of the 21st Century. The cinemaphotography is stunning. It is hard to imagine more beautiful settings. The soundtrack is also excellent with a somewhat sorrowful background instrumental..I'm guessing it is original. The subject matter is I'm guessing widely known and may for some be considered controversial comes across as natural flow of the story. I might also say that the movie has it's lighter moments and myself and others chuckled outloud. I would encourage everyone that includes both open and closed minded to see this film. It is epic.

"""I Swear, Jack""......","A tribute to heath Ledger who died this day Jan. 23, 2008. So long cowpoke, see yuh on the flip-side...Brokeback Mountain is the best film to come out in many a year. Script and screenplay were excellent . Directing unblemished.Cinematography was sweeping and breathtaking, and only added to the love affair as did the musical score.Actors were actors to the core, and did a wonderful job of putting across the heart breaking , gut wrenching love that could not be satisfied by their distance from each other, but even with that distance they had each other for 20 some years , and that in itself shows their love for each other as not just being physical, but on the level of soul-mates.As every muscle in your body yearns for the sight of that loved-one and the pain will not subside for want of that person. Ennis and Jack had that forbidden love for each other and it played out like the great love affair it was . If any say that this is a film about gays , then I feel sorry for you. As you have missed a great part of life not to see that this is related to everyone who has gone over to the doorway and retched from the pain in your guts.

A return to form for Ang Lee,"Ang Lee is a uniquely accomplished director who has produced a succession of distinguished films which encompass an astonishing range of genres.Following fine work in his homeland of Taiwan such as ""Eat Drink, Man Woman"", he has made the period drama ""Sense And Sensibility"", the examination of family angst ""The Ice Storm"", an unusual western ""Ride With The Devil"", the wonderful 'wu xia' work ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", the comic book fantasy ""Hulk"" (a rare failure), and now an anguished study of homosexuality between two modern-day cowboys in his latest triumph ""Brokeback Mountain"".It is based on a short story written by Annie Proulx for the ""New Yorker"" in 1997 but commences in 1963. Located in Wyoming, USA but shot in Alberta, Canada, the scenery is stunning, even down to the cloud formations. Jack Gyllenhaal is the attractive, confident Jack Twist, while Heath ledger is the rougher, brooding, laconic Ennis del Mar - two men who have known little affection in their lives until an unexpected turn of events while they are tending sheep on the eponymous hillside.It is a relationship that struggles over two decades, even while both men marry and become fathers.

"Good, but not the milestone it's been built up to be","Brokeback Mountain is getting a lot of undeserved credit. Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie. It had a good love story. But it's getting a lot of credit as a milestone film, and it doesn't fully deserve it. The acting is incredible, especially on Ledger's part. He does understated very well, and if it weren't for Phillip Seymour-Hoffman's portrayal of a brilliant Truman Capote this year, he'd probably be a shoe-in for the Oscar. The story is where the movie falters. It's good, but it's a standard love story that's made ""special"" because it's gay cowboys. Plus, there are some plot holes. It's good, but probably not worthy of the Oscar it's going to win.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An incredible piece of cinema,"I must have seen this film 10 times. It is bitter and beautiful and absolutely haunting. Incredible performances from all four leads, stunning cinematography, wonderfully evocative score... I really didn't expect it to be as amazing as it was. It's in my top ten films of all time.One of the best things about this film is its subtlety. On rewatching so many little bits connect up, lines heartbreakingly echo previous lines, the camera lingers on a window or a toy horse to draw our minds back to an earlier scene. It is rich in symbolism.To those who think this is a gay love story? Do not underestimate it. It is far bigger than that. It's a story of regret, of the prisons our own psyches put us in and a fascinating study of love stunted in its growth, trapped in a decaying idyll.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
[+7] For nothing but the initiative!,"Brokeback Mountain is a cult film for a cause. It is a forerunner to most of the modern LGBTQ mainstream films around the world, but that doesn't mean that it is an engaging film as well.Cut out from a short story (of which, writing is better), the struggle to make it as a full length feature film is obvious. You get to yawn some during the runtime.The characters, the circumstances and even the acting seems very much 2D and a lot goes unexplained. Only if you put the entire blame on the time period and the culture of the 'cow boys', it will be convincing.I could imagine the impact that the movie has created in the cinema industry forever considering the fact that Jake and Ledger are celebrated more now than ever. And I am grateful for that but the film, to be honest, was shallow and boring.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brokeback Mountain is what love is all about.,"Brokeback Mountain  It is not about the Wild West, and it is not about sex, and yet it is so powerfully wild and sexy that one's mind goes off when Ennis (Heath Ledger) gets behind Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) and hugs him gently. It is an epic drama so brilliantly written and directed as if there had been no love before or after.The greatest love is always the most painful. The fact that it is about two ordinary guys makes it even more painful than that. For a man to kneel down and punch the wall in despair while not even knowing what was happening to him, it takes nothing but love. For a man to gently stroke another man's ear in a split of a moment, it takes absolutely nothing but ultimate love.It is a story of any forbidden love. It could be two girls; it could be a woman and a man of different races; it could be anything new, anything that the world does not want to face with. And America in the 60-ies, remote Wyoming countryside is no better. Some of the places in today's modern world are no better.It begins in 1963 when two boys go looking for jobs and end up together for an entire season on Brokeback Mountain. What happens there is inexplicable to both of them but they know it's earthshaking and they cannot stop it. Do they want to? Jack certainly does not. He is the outgoing one, the braver one, the one who is willing to embark on a different journey not aware of the possible consequences. Ennis wants to go on with his life as planned. And he tries so for 20 years and nothing is as planned. At one crucial moment he tells Jack: ""Why don't you let me be? Look at me, I am like this because of you "" but he knows better than that. On the one hand he is trapped in his early childhood memory of two guys beaten to death because of ""that thing."" As he recalls: ""My father made sure my brother and I saw it."" At the same time, he is overwhelmed with this wonderful feeling that he knows is wrong  so why is it so good when he is with him? Drawn to one another, they meet several times a year for ""fishing"" in Brokeback Mountain where they felt free and utterly happy; in spite of their families' doubts and suspicions. Ennis' wife has seen their passion and she does not want to face it. She does not want to admit her marriage has failed. Gradually, she becomes more and more unhappy and gets it off her chest only when remarried to another guy. Jack's wife is simply unhappy. Until the very end, when her suspicions unveil, she does not know the reason why but she does not feel loved.Jack's death is sudden and unexpected for the viewer. Yet, Ennis could picture exactly what happened because he knows his friend only too well. Was it just a reflection of what he saw in the past? Perhaps, but reality is too cruel to escape. His visit to Jack's parents is as touching a scene as it could possibly be. Not many words are spoken but so much is said. Jack's room, the window from which he looked into the world as a kid and the words: ""I promise you Jack ""  it all comes together and Ennis comes to terms with his feelings for the first time and forever.All characters are brilliantly brought to life by a wonderful cast. Jake Gyllenhaal shines with optimism in search for what he thinks is doable. The two supporting roles of Williams and Hathaway are played to perfection. Finally, Heath Ledger's Ennis Del Mar is breathtaking and unforgettable. He manages to convince us in the simple and yet complex nature of his character. The pain in his eyes when he finds out his shirt in Jack's closet is out of this world; that's how good he is.Brokeback Mountain is not just another pathetic ""Love Story"" or as some label it ""a homosexual Gone With the Wind."" Brokeback Mountain is what love is all about. Undoubtedly.P.S. To answer some of the comments here: Everyone watches from their own embedded social prospective. If you lived in San Francisco or Amsterdam and you are gay, sure it will be a step back, if you are in Teheran, it will be outrageously brave. Straight people will also see it differently and mainly be bitter for wasting good money on a ""queer"" movie, so there is no point to expect a common ground. Some will be disappointed because of the lack of Hollywood glamour, some with the lack of ""tender"" love scenes ... However, one thing is certain ... the world is not ready for a normal movie about two people who love each other if they do not fit the social milieu.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sorry but movie is NOT that greatest film of all time!!!,"I am astounded by all the praise being heaped on Brokeback Mountain. It has become a movement or an agenda rather than just a film that can be judged on its own entertainment merits.Having seen the film now, I'm pretty dismayed by the praise because it seems like the critics are worshiping the message or the theme of Brokeback Mountain rather than the film itself.Its OK. But it didn't blow me away nor did I find anything profound about it. It almost felt like a TV movie of the week to. Sure, the background scenes are nice and pretty but there are long gaps with no dialog and plenty of times when we're suppose to guess what's going on with Jack and Ennis.I feel like I have to guess what this film is about since its not really a love story as you see more about the breakup of relationships and dangers & wrongs of abandoning your wife and family.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Classic Masterpiece,"I have now seen this film three times and each time I discover something new that moves me or emotionally devastates me. To be dubbed as 'the gay cowboy film' does this masterpiece little justice. It is a beautiful love story and by way of a refreshing change it is between two people of the same sex. Heath Ledger's performance as the repressed Ennis Del Mar is simply breathtaking. His pain and sadness, expressed with few and often inaudible words is truly moving, raw and very very real. You just want to reach out and hug him. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams give equally moving performances. Well done to Ang Lee, Annie Proulx and the rest of the crew who helped bring this masterpiece to the cinema. Which brings me to this: What were the Academy thinking of awarding 'Crash' the Best Picture over 'Brokeback Mountain'? This reminds me of another well known and equally criminal travesty from years ago - this time courtesy of the British pop charts - when the classic single 'Vienna' by Ultravox was kept out of No.1 by the appalling Joe Dolce single 'Shaddap You Face'. The only difference being that Joe Dolce has more credibility than Crash! (Ouch!)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brokeback Mountain was heartfelt,"Brokeback Mountain is a movie that left me feeling something. It left me feeling like there is still filmmakers who care about and wish to explore the human condition. The relationships in the movie were especially realistic, particularly between the two main male characters and their wives. The relationship between the two men was so natural even when it was difficult. Although their characters are anything buy heroic,Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are heroes playing their roles. Brokeback Mountain was so well written, scored, photographed, acted, and directed that I have gone to see it twice and will return to the theater to see it again I'm sure. A million kudos to the filmmakers.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I found only reality crying in the movie theater.,"I have never cried in a movie theater before, but last night, in the packed theater, I cried more than I have in a great while. The reality of this movie, I am certain, has moved every single person that has seen it. Heath and Jake were amazing to say the least, I personally felt the passion, and because I believe there is something deeper in all of us that can really connect with the characters in this movie, I recommend it EVERYONE. When I first walked into the theater I was a little worried because my friends and I were the only people under the age of 30, the audience consisted mostly of older couples between the ages of 50 and 70 I would guess. It was the most moving thing to leave the theater seeing tears in the eyes of people I was sure would be disgusted. In my opinion this is the most original and most memorable love story of our time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A wonderful view of love and life,"It is so rare that I would even take the time to write a review of a movie. In fact, this is my first ever. Still, I feel compelled to tell whomever will read that this movie utterly moved the core of my soul. No where else have the struggles that gay people go through to come to terms with their sexuality been captured as poignantly, accurately and successfully as in this movie. It also captures the impact and affects of living life in fear (this can really apply to anything, not just being gay) and how many lives you touch and change as a result of being overwhelmed and terrorized by that fear. Both Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger did this movie justice with their talent and depth, and they both were nothing short of stellar in capturing the complexities of these roles. WOW!!! (Anne Hathaway & Michelle Williams were equally wonderful as well!) Also, Jake & Heath magnificently portrayed the beautiful love story that is at the core of this movie. RUN, do not walk, to the theatre and see this movie. It is for one and all - in all walks of life. If you open your heart and your mind, you will be enriched more than you'd have ever thought possible.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
remarkable,"it is not a moral lesson, not a pledge for a community, not a gay film. it is only a testimony. about love, fear, need of the other, public image, force of past, hope, responsibility, desire. a film who not propose models , lessons or values. only reflects, like a large mirror, the universe of the viewer. and that is its basic virtue. because it is only a honest story about two men looking happiness without hurt the other. it is a great film for the rare, admirable art to present the veil of uncomfortable truth. nothing heroic, nothing exceptional. only a story of a meeting, a relationship and few choices. so simple than it is out of any genre. sure, it is not easy to give new nuance to the classic image of cowboy. a film about purpose of life. about the forbidden desire and a farm who is only the old Arcadia . result - the silence becomes the really dialog. the need to escape from fall becomes itself fall. a film who must see. again. for discover new questions from a film who, in its essence, reminds the flavor of Extreme Orient.",,Anonymous,Romance
The movie that should have won best picture,"Brokeback Mountain stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger who play two cowboys who begin a relationship together and try to keep it a secret for many years. I feel uncomfortable reviewing this because even if you haven't seen the movie you should know what's it about. And if I'm going to be completely honest with everyone, I liked this movie. It may have not been my favorite movie or made it into my top 10, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I also feel uncomfortable reviewing this because if you have the courage to admit that you like Brokeback Mountain people automatically assume that you're gay. You don't have to be gay to enjoy this movie and just because you like this movie doesn't make you gay either. And also, there's no law that says that either. And I'm still not going to change my opinion of Brokeback Mountain if someone says I'm gay for liking this movie. I think one of the reasons people are so hesitant on seeing Brokeback Mountain is the plot, but if you look between the lines, it's actually a good movie. But say what you will about Brokeback Mountain, there are some beautiful locations here. I may not appreciate the movie, but I can appreciate the beauty and nature this film has to offer. I felt really uncomfortable watching it, but when the movie cuts to some nature shots I felt at peace and relaxed. This was the film that was robbed of best picture and instead went to Crash. And that's another thing I want to bring up. Even though it may not be the movie for me, I still think it should've won best picture. Where Brokeback Mountain lacks in the film plot makes up for its beautiful directing, cinematography, and sound editing that should be a perfect combination to earn this a best picture win. So overall, as much as I liked this movie, it just wasn't for me, but that still doesn't mean that you shouldn't check this out. Just ignore the plot and accept it for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Finally a movie about rural gay men,"I lived in San Francisco for a decade during the decadent 70's, as a reporter, and in the rural parts of the West for two decades, and as a man in my fifties, I can testify that Brokeback Mountain truly reflects for the first time, the real situation of life for rural men who find themselves feeling deep affection or love for each other.The other movies of rural gay life, like ""BIG EDEN"" are mostly a fantasy, though hopeful, they do not show how it really is. Brokeback hits hard at the heart of the matter. The bigotry, intolerance and murderous stupidity that people in rural areas can inflict upon men who love each other is real and this movie shows that truth. Gay movies that have in the past shown only the mincing, effeminate queens have left me unaffected, but Brokeback Mountain rings true for millions of rural men.This movie shows how jobs and promotions are denied or lost. Ruinous marriages are created, and children are born -- all because gay men must conform or face punishment or isolation or even death. The courage of these two characters to at least acknowledge their feelings to each other is the tough love I see everyday in my rural town. I know who these men are, who have confessed their hearts, take a momentary comfort and then bury their true natures to survive the social pressures. All we should learn to expect from each other is to be authentic.Misery and suffering is created and inflicted upon those rural men who remain single and therefore are immediately suspect and targeted for punishment or worse. Thank god for everybody who helped to make this movie and bring the searing truth to the consciousness of millions, and hopefully a slap to the consciousness of those guilty of their cruelty.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An observation,"It is perhaps in the nature of IMDb that even the best movie is likely to be given poor reviews and very low votes by some. I have seen that for many good films, but for Brokeback Mountain, a film which is critically acclaimed and widely lauded, this effect is particularly striking. It is often useful to look at the hostile as well as the favourable reviews in order to get a more rounded view of the film, but in the case of Brokeback Mountain, it is worth looking more closely at the hostile ones to see what is happening. The bad reviews generally are of the two following types -1) Complaints that the movie is too slow and boring, not enough characterisation of the main or minor characters, too few words spoken, etc. It is perhaps unfortunate that ""slow and boring"" is always the criticisms that any thoughtful movie is likely to attract, some people simply won't make any effort to understand a movie that doesn't have constant action or flashy cgi. They may also expect everything to be explicit spelt out so they don't need to work out what is happening by themselves. Brokeback Mountain is therefore unsatisfactory for them, it being largely about the private emotional lives of the protagonists, much of which is left unspoken. However, for those who are more thoughtful, they will find a beautiful story, simple yet complex, sparsely told yet highly emotional in its effect.2) People who haven't seen the movie but nevertheless will insist on pronouncing on its (or rather lack of) worthiness. Some of them even pretended to have seen it, but the errors in their reviews showed that all they did was to read other similarly ignorant reviews. Some probably even pretended to be what they are not - a couple of gay cowboys turned up one immediately after another to trash the film (one of these self-described gay cowboy even derided it as gay propaganda with little coherent explanation why it is so), how likely is that? These reviews are often stupid and dishonest, they don't make the slightly sense to anyone who had actually seen and understood the film. Some of these people will say that the film is ""average"" or ""OK"", but then it give a 1 out of 10? Do they understand what ""average"" means?Brokeback Mountain is by no means the perfect film, there are parts which I find unsatisfactory, either I find these parts not well-acted (Cassie, for example, overacted with her huge drops of tears in her last scene when Heath Ledger gave a perfectly restrained performance in the same scene that still managed to show his anguish and desolation), or I thought perhaps could been done differently or better. However, it is not possible to give it a vote 9.5, so a 10 it will be, if only to do my little bit to counter those dishonest people who voted out of hatred and spite rather than having genuinely seen the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Erotic and Real at the same time.,"This movie will move you to experience such a series of emotions, and during the film, you feel that you actually KNOW the main characters Ennis & Jack. Everything the reviews have said about this movie is absolutely true. Heath Ledger & Jake Gyllenhaal both give stunning renditions of 2 men who have to keep their lives secretly in the closet. Jack, (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is ready to burst open and start a life with a man as soon as he finds the right one. Ennis on the other hand, (played by Heath Ledger) is plagued by an image he saw as a child of a man mutilated because he was living alone with another man, and is therefore unable to fully commit to Jack.I think the most amazing thing about this movie, is that through everything, the two never say the words, ""I love you"" but you can see it between the two of them plain as day. Also, members of the gay community can be proud that they have a new voice for their pain besides ""Will & Grace"". And while that voice is stereotypical and laughable, ""Brokeback Mountain"" gives you the true love story of two MEN who are cowboys which is authentic....even up until the end.You'll cry, you'll laugh, and if you are affect at all by the homo-erotic under/overtones you'll definitely be switched on, since Gyllenhaal & Ledger don't use body doubles, and I'll leave it at that.It's refreshing to see two men who are well known actors in Hollywood not afraid to play men in a relationship together. Not only that, but they do it well and almost make it seem as if its unscripted. Thats how seamless their performance on film was.As a person whose done make up in theatre before, my only complaint is that they age the two actors WAY too fast...every hairpiece and bits of latex used on both actors looks way over done, and only half way into the movie they give Gyllenhaal a belly so you know thats the end of the nude scenes. You can see the lines where they put the latex to age Ledger, and they didn't even bother airbrushing it. By the end of the movie, they look like old farts when they are only 39. To the average movie goer, it shouldn't be too big of a deal, however for me, it reminded me in an unpleasant way that this is a movie.So overall, gay straight, whatever your orientation is, you will love this movie it is truly a love story for the ages.",,Anonymous,Romance
Almost there,"Beautiful backdrop of the hills, greenery, clouds- almost felt like going to Brokeback myself.Story and acting was superb- emotionally touching and good dialogues.

This film may change your life,"I had been expecting this film for a while, with plenty of rumours surrounding its making and its release. My first expectation was one of mild titillation  a gay-themed movie with good-looking actors and a Hollywood budget, how far would they go, etc When the film opened in the US, I looked at the website reviews and it dawned on me that this was going to be a very different, rather more serious experience.This is the mood in which I entered the cinema last week when I first saw it. Despite being 48 and having a reserved, introvert demeanour, I can shed the odd tear at a good movie. So I came with the proverbial box of tissues. I thought I was prepared.Well, how wrong I was. After maybe half an hour, having been drawn slowly into the film starting with the unforgettable score, I began to feel as Ennis does at one point in the film, as if my guts were slowly being drawn out by the yard. The last fifteen minutes pushed the pain and the sadness to a nearly unbearable point. I left the cinema in tears and tried to regain my composure at home, to no avail. This is now the fifth day, and I have been haunted by this film ever since. It has already cost me several sleepless nights, with the characters and the scenes constantly rushing through my head. I had not had this reaction to a film since I was a rather depressive and sensitive teenager struggling with a growing awareness of his homosexuality. And then again, the reaction had never been so strong.The day after I first saw the film, I bought the novel and read it in one go (it's very short and only takes about an hour). This definitely helps understanding the film, although I think the movie transcends the novel by a long way. By then, I felt I just had to see the film again the next day. On the second viewing, a lot of things clicked in the film that I had not appreciated before. A few details that had grated me on first viewing now fell into place and it felt as if nothing could be changed to the film. This time, I was just about overwhelmed - I cried my heart out again, even more so than the first time. I am now convinced this is an absolute masterpiece, and the film is right up there in my top ten favourites.I have been thinking a lot as to why this film struck such a chord at this point in my life. After all little if anything of it is relevant to my life  my own experiences could not be more remote than that of farmhands in Wyoming. The first explanation is of course about the shared experiences with anyone who has grown up gay (especially so thirty years ago)  the longing, the repressed feelings that cannot be articulated or aired, the dead-end situations, the secrets, the isolation and self-hate in an homophobic environment. But the film has a much greater significance and relevance, and eventually connects to all human experience: the overriding importance of love and relationships, the memories of grief and personal losses, the heartaches we have all experienced, the sense of time that goes away and will never come back, the sadness of lost opportunities, the endless quest for a better life, the dangers of holding back from more fulfilling alternatives in life, of not making commitments where one's heart lies but taking refuge in a humdrum existence that proves ultimately unsatisfactory whilst time ebbs inexorably away. So it is indeed, deep down, relevant to all of us.What can I say about the actors, the score and the direction that has not already been said better elsewhere? Outstanding sounds too feeble. If Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were to spend the rest of their (hopefully) long careers sticking to commercial trivia, movie history will forever remember them for the extraordinary performances they give here. Ledger's grunts and Gyllenhaal's longing, beautiful eyes say infinitely more than can ever be put in a script.You can find flaws in the film if you look for them. It could be another hour longer to develop the characters more fully in the second half, spanning twenty years. The film could show more intimate affection between Jack and Ennis (which I would find more satisfactory as a gay man). But enough ifs and buts. The emotional charge in the film is intense as it is, and it is what counts. So, I have to give a ten.Who cares if this film does or does not reap Oscars? No doubt there have been other outstanding performances at the movies this year, all worthy of rewards. But only a handful of films have ever transcended their medium and their theme to become great works of art connecting to the universal human condition. This is one of the few, and this is worth very much more than any award bestowed by the critics.I had to write this review, my first ever, to get this film out of my system and get on with my life. I can only say one thing. Go and see it. At all costs. You will come back emotionally drained, but ultimately a better person. Trust me.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This much-ballyhooed gay cowboy melodrama is an inert disappointment.,"I saw ""Brokeback Mountain"" & I was 100% disappointed! A complete let down. Not the Best Film of 2005, nor the Worst Film of 2005, just the most over-hyped let-down of a film of 2005! Well, if you miss Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain,"" that's okay  you're not missing much. This much-ballyhooed gay cowboy melodrama is an inert disappointment.All this was, and will ever be is a ""Gay-Film"" made with high end production values, with a B-Cast who couldn't act there way out of a paper bag, with a director who seems he wanted to re-build his reputation after the dud ""The Hulk"", and a studio willing to back his one-sided vision.Adapted from a short story by E. Annie Proulx (whose ""The Shipping News"" also made for a hugely disappointing movie), Lee's film stretches the story over the course of decades to beyond its breaking point.""Brokeback Mountain"" was the type of film made for the straight, art-house crowd, who only could probably handle a gay male (or anything gay for that matter as long as they didn't have to see it for real), or gay sex on the big screen, or in such small ways as ""Will & Grace"" that if it was actually placed in front of them in real life, these same so called open-mined people would freak out.Hailed as a landmark of mainstream tolerance (and to the ""mainstream""'s shame, that's exactly what it is), ""Brokeback Mountain"" feels more like an antiseptic gimmick that attempts to hijack the conventions of a traditionally-masculinized genre to further demonstrate, as if further demonstration were needed, that two men in love is as natural, tempestuous, and ineffable as heterosexuality. The obstacles thrown their way are hazarded at but ultimately poorly-drawn--in fact, there are arguably more opportunities for Jack and Ennis to have a gay relationship than there are scenes of hate and bigotry. Kudos, I guess, for presenting homosexual characters neither mincing nor particularly good at dressing and decorating, though one does get a little tired of the single-dimensions in which the female satellites and their problems are sketched.There was no ""real"" so-called ""Love"" relationship in this film. These two cowboys got drunk and had sex on top of a mountain for what one summer, & then what met every two to four years to do it over and over and over. Man if this is what Ang Lee calls a relationship, I would hate to see what he calls a ""F&%K Buddy""! Guys who get drunk and have sex is not love! I feel like the problem is that Lee's passion for this project is several degrees cooler than his cast's--like he's looking for a place to stretch out and relax (as indicated by the sloppy editing and laggard pacing & several goofs involving Jake Gyllenhaal's mustache) while everyone else is painting in swaths of passion, desperation, and regret, or even if you want to call it that.Ledger and Williams are not that amazing as critics & all the awards that they have collected will lead you to believe. None of the cast bring enough to the table between any of them to suggest what the film might have been--and to make ""Brokeback Mountain"" worth the look.As my partner stated the characters were nothing but cardboard, and we couldn't care about them or there lives as the story went along.As one critic pointed out, & I 100% agree: ""Of course, these criticisms fly in the face of popular opinion; ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a booby-trapped film, designed to appear like an Oscar winner, and to be viewed without question. It's infuriating that three other, much braver gay-themed films from earlier this year, ""Transamerica"", ""Mysterious Skin"" and ""Capote"", won't merit a fraction of the attention lavished upon Lee's timid effort. And gay audiences who have patiently waited for their epic romantic masterpiece will have to wait still longer"".THE WORST MOMENT: If U seen the trailer, the ending is so predictable that anybody could see it coming from miles away, that once you see the film you go who cares. I won't spoil it for those who haven't see the movie, but trust me I wasn't that moved, except when the credits rolled & I could leave the theater.I may be gay, but I didn't love this film, this to me wasn't a ""gay"" love story, it was more of a Cowboy ""lust"" picture with a low end production values, a really bad B cast and a film that felt like it went on forever & ever & ever.I hate to say it one more time, but gay audiences (like me) who have patiently waited for their epic romantic masterpiece will have to wait still longer.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The story of a love that is ""unique yet universal"", and uncommon in its place and time.","Brokeback Mountain tells a story as old as time, but one that is new to the mainstream. It is heartbreaking; cinematically beautiful; subtle in its messages; and impossible to forget. It offers the possibility of changing minds about love, changing minds about the American west, and changing how people approach their own lives. There is no acting -- only being: the actors become the characters and will be immortalized forever as Jack and Ennis. This film became a classic the moment it hit the theaters, with its tale of two ranch hands and an unarticulated, yet layers-deep, relationship. Fear, violence and oppression are never blatantly or gratuitously offered to the audience, but that energy is always lurking below the surface, as the friendship unfolds over a course of 20 years, leaving marriages and children in its wake. The true casualty here is the viewer's emotions, which are taken on a battering ride up and down a mountainous journey toward realizing love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Amazing,"No wonder this movie won so many awards. I'm still talking about this movie to all my friends of both genders. Hats off to everyone in making and starring in this LOVE story. Not a story of gay men.. but unforgettable love story. I felt so bad for the two main characters for they could not be with each other , maybe different times it would have been different. Excellent acting. My daughter who is fourteen watched it with me and after it was done she commented on the love story not any of the sexual contend of this movie. Everyone has been in the situation where you cannot be with the one whom you love so much, homosexual or not. One of my all time favorite movies.Can't wait to buy it .",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The book complements the movie,"First I read the short story and then watched the film, so it is difficult to understand why some people find the first part of the movie slow, it's not. Every second is important to the relationship that starts building between Jack and Ennis from the first time they set eyes on each other outside Aguirre's trailer.Having read the short story first, I immediately understood Ennis nervousness and depression when Jack tells him they have to go back down the mountain. Ennis does not understand his feelings for Jack, he only knows  at that point  that he has never felt so happy before (""feels like he can paw the white out of the moon""). And it takes him one year to figure out that he should never have let Jack out of his sight, meaning that he finally realized what his real feelings for Jack were, but that by then, already married and with a child, it was far far too late.If he had not been married, then MAYBE Ennis could have had a life with Jack. But he had already formed a family, and only had time to ""earn a living"" and was the kind of person that would never abandon a wife and child that depended on him, remember that it is Alma that divorces him. So the only thing left to him was to meet Jack every one in a while in the back of nowhere. The book also makes it clear that Alma divorces him because she gets tired of him going on his fishing trips and never taking a vacation with her and the girls, his refusal to get good permanent jobs and his propensity ignore her in bed.So, even though the film is very powerful, it is even more so after having read the book, don't miss it.And to all who didn't understand Ennis last words, they were: ""Jack, I swear_"" and the author adds: ""though Jack had never asked him to swear anything and was himself not the swearing kind.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brokeback Mountain,"I just saw Brokeback Mountain and loved it!!! It was hands down one of the best movies I have seen in a long time! I live in a very rural area where many people have to be ""hush-hush"" if they are in a homosexual relationship, which I think is very sad. I grew up in an area that I feel is more ""exceptng' than the area I live in now. I felt sad for all of the characters in this movie, but very sad for the men who loved each other but couldn't come out with it because of other people's prejudices. People can make things so complicated for others. I may sound idealistic, but I don't know why who people choose to love is such a concern to others with everything else that goes on in this world. We as Americans stress ""peace"" and ""love"" yet we can be big old hypocrites when it comes to subjects such as what this movie was about. I applaud the making of this movie to hopefully bring an awareness to such a sensitive topic. Sensitivity is what we need more of!!",,Anonymous,Romance
"It is propaganda for romantic love, after all.","I admire Ang Lee, I always did, at least since the Icestorm, which is one of my favorites of all times. Ang Lee is a lot in the (movie)news right now, because of the media's self-acclaimed ""oscar buzz"". He always looks modest, without false pretensions and like a very nice guy. No problem here.This movie, however, is propaganda. What is done here is to connect the promise of living a life close to the forces of nature (""natural life"") with the inner forces of romantic love, which supposedly are stronger than death and of course in opposition to the trivial forces of societal prejudice. Stories about this kind of romantic love, which are in line with ""human nature"" and against the ""unnatural social"", are well known and this story is told very well here.It gets its special drive because the lovers are men. Their love is impossible, in this time and at this place, no doubt about it, but it is not like this any longer. And here the movie becomes problematic. If this story is - as Ang Lee claims in the aforementioned interviews - more about something universal: romantic love, then it is naive at best: This kind of romantic love is not universal at all. If this is all about romantic love, that it is close to itself only in its own suspension, then I do not need it either. If the movie actually is about love between men in the 1960s/70s in the USA, then it has a lot of real historic interest, but it should not pretend to be more.The general ennui of men who are forced to be good salesmen, who live in marriages which also could happen over the phone, who are surrounded by responsibilities and crying children, all this is not due to not living ""natural"" romantic love - be it between men or not. The curse under which we are forced to live nowadays is to be able to live with our romantic loves, and to witness how that extraordinary blessing turns into ashes after some years.However, because I have such a high respect for Ang Lee's work, I do not rule out that he is right and that there is some more universal lesson in this fine piece of cinematography: that real love is about not finding fulfillment and that it is worth it.-",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""A red spark on the huge black mass of mountain. . .""","""Brokeback Mountain"" is a lyric poem. It is quiet, brave and bold. It will be talked about for years.The only condescension it showsand it's not for their attitudes about homosexuality, as you might expectis towards some of the lesser, ignorant characters. They deserve it.Jack and Ennis earn our respect and our love because they have that of the writers and the director. We watch them gropingly, angrily finding their way, and it's obvious the journey has been much longer than what we've seen. But once they get there it's just exhilarating. I keep going to the movies hoping to feel as renewed, inspired, and in love with the universe as I did after ""Brokeback Mountain."" But it very, very rarely happens.I don't believe in spoilers, so I will simply say that near the end there is a scene with a character whom you would believe to be the least likely person to accept, understand or acknowledge the relationship between Ennis and Jack. It's the small act of putting some crumpled items into a grocery bag that says, ""I understand. And I love you as if you were my own.""",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Wide skies, deep closet","Ang Lee's story of gay cowboys, their lives ruined by prejudice won many Oscars, and it's a sensitive treatment that shows how the way we think is governed by the environment we live in. And yet... am I the only person to find that there's something faintly ridiculous about the whole story, it's humourless solidity of terse, emotionally stilted men who turn to each other when, to be frank, it's either him or the sheep? While it's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't translate ""gay"" as ""camp"", this is a portrait of people buried so deep in the closet that they can't see even the faintest crack of light; who, as the film shows it, when they do spend time together, simply sit out under the stars not talking to each other. In some ways, the film does not so much reject myth as blend the stereotype of the western hero with with the conventionally incompatible idea of homosexuality. Real life can hurt, but it's rarely this solemn; and the plot goes nowhere after the premise is established. None of this makes 'Brokeback Mountain' a bad movie; but it is strainingly earnest at times.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Gone with the wind of Gay moviedom,"Living in a country like India, where being gay is a punishable offense, when i saw this film, I identified completely with what Enis says to Jack about if ""this thing "" comes out, "" we're dead"".

Long after you have finished watching the film, it echoes in your heart and the tragedy lives with you forever.

Desire of object obscure,"With different actors, this might have been a beautiful little film. With those present, it's likable and suggestive, but too remote from its subject. Perhaps it could have used a different director as well, because the subject appears to be outside this one's natural range.The subject (surprisingly, given the publicity that surrounded the film) is not homosexuality, in its own right, but the power of desire. The particular case shown happens to be the desire of one man for another, but it could as easily be for anyone else not allowable. The characters possessed by it seem as straight as they are queer, so that what their encounter with each other opens up may or may not be their innermost nature. In either case, and more importantly, it's the fulfillment of the strongest desire they've ever experienced or can imagine. The rest of the film traces which ways they go, and how far, under its sway.Plenty of films have shown characters throwing all away for the sake of passion. But generally their stories are presented as tragedies or comedies. This is the only one to show the series of little, everyday, foolish or wayward acts to which a man can be drawn by the irresistibly compelling, almost besotting force of a temptation. The excitement it introduces into his mind, crowding everything else into a corner; his fear and longing for it, which throw him into a kind of fog through which everything else looks vague and far away; his shunting aside of family, friends, job, all the obligations that seemed important before now dropped while he runs after his desire; the fabricating of stories to explain where he's off to, and the excuses he makes to himself; his feeling sorry afterwards, and even while he's doing it--but then, not truly.... At some time nearly everyone goes through something like this, or consciously resists it. The case shown is of a man wanting another man, but the condition is universal.The film observes it with great sympathy and accuracy of detail. It traces all the big steps in the characters' lives of desire: the preoccupation, concealments, getaways, and so forth. These, rather than the strict time sequence, are the basis of the chronology. And so perhaps they should be. But this structure leads to some jarring rifts in the straight timeline. For instance, one of the characters meets a woman, and a scene or two later she's bearing his child. I accepted these jumps to an extent, as approximations of the characters' own perceptions of their lives, but they tended to throw me out of the film and ought to have been managed more adroitly.I've read complaints that the film is slow. So it is, compared to films set in big cities. But it proceeds at the tempo of the Western towns where it's set and of the Westerners who live in them. If they moved faster, their actions would not only be unlifelike but would be robbed of their meaning.Where the film falls shorter is in the leading performances. The two actors are agreeable, but not good enough for their roles (or the roles weren't right for them). To be sure, the script doesn't give these enough definition, but the actors don't fill in the spaces. And they don't seem quite right otherwise. They don't seem of the place or of the period; in their scenes together, they don't seem to know each other or to be with each other. (In scenes with some other characters, they do.) Most crucially, they don't communicate any desire for each other, which is what the story turns on. In their sexual scenes, one has to infer this. And the action itself (as usual in sexual scenes) tells almost nothing about them.Perhaps the director or the screenwriters did intend the film to be about homosexuality. The last reel, approximately, so suggests. It takes a different, more sentimental direction than expected (I wonder if this was added on to the original short story). A more logical close might have been for one partner to lose his desire, or to feel it swamping him so much he had to give it up. The film's close isn't about desire at all; it's about love. To be sure, there's a relation between the two, but the film doesn't make clear what it is, or how we got to one from the other, so that the new facts we learn about the characters in this section feel like footnotes.The town settings at the beginning are almost painfully authentic in their quietness, the sharp sunlight, the cold heat of the air and the sun. I only stopped believing when the actors stepped in.The mountain is never as real as the town. Probably that's because its meanings are never communicated in visual terms. The narrative meaning is probably a literary one that no actual place could measure up to; the emotional meaning could be caught, but only with effort. It would have to grow out of the characters' everyday interactions with the place, first in their work and then, gradually, in their personal relations. But the details of these are scamped, so that we only glimpse, but never feel, the atmosphere unique to the place: the bite of the wind, the hardness of the ground, the steepness of the climb to the grazing field, the denseness of the herd; then, the relative comforts of the camp and, even more, the tent; and finally, the releasing of an urge that's been straining at its cinches, and the association of that freedom with the place where it happened. Some films achieve that kind of identification of landscape with interior feeling.But first must come the feeling.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Most powerful movie I've ever seen,"Ang Lee's brilliant and haunting love story instantly became my favorite movie after i saw it. It's power and sadness stayed with me for over a week. He actually improves upon the original short story- extending the story line and strengthening the characters. The performances were all great, but Heath Ledger's portrayal of Ennis Del Mar is one of the most powerful and nuanced performances of recent cinematic history. His acting skill moves beyond the sparse dialog. The real pain is evident in the silent scenes, where Ennis's inability to change the course of his life breaks the hearts of the audience. His character is not only identifiable to gay men, to to any person whose dreams have been a casualty of the world: gay, straight, male, female, red state, blue state. The film's few flaws (the almost too censured love scenes, the emphasis on their family life over their relationship) are instantly forgivable and forgettable upon the emotional force of the last quarter of the movie. Brokeback Mountain is the reason the 5 star review exists. Every movie I've ever seen pales in comparison.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Most Important film of the decade and by far the best year of 2005,"Look, I am a 16 year old-straight male, and Brokeback Mounatin is one of my favorite films of the decade and I admit that and get made fun of and called a homo by my friends. Now, about a year and a half ago I would have done the same thing, but then I realized I loved film and actually watched Brokeback Mounatin and realized I was being an ignorant prick. It seems like everyone I am friends or family with will not give this film a chance because it is about a homosexual relationship and it pisses me off. If you don't like the film for a certain reason and you give it a chance or even give it a chance and say it made you too uncomfortable, then i can accept that, but don't say anything about the film unless you see it. This film is a heart-breaking, melodramatic, nuanced masterpiece. Ang Lee really makes the most nuanced films between The Wedding Banquet, The Ice Storm, This film, and the masterpiece which is Crouching Tiger, he is one of the best directors alive. Heath Ledger gives such a bold, theme detailed, and understated performance and when he finally snaps it is heart breaking. I respect Jake Gyllenahl for taking the role and he is good, but not great. All the female actresses like Hathaway and Williams are great as well. Larry McMurtry wrote the screenplay and you can tell. The film has a very similar bleak feeling dealing with a certain place with same type of enclosed and scared people that The Last Picture Show dealt with, one of my favorite films of all time. I normally don't cry during films, but I teared up during this film. I cried in in The Last Picture Show, Last Tango In Paris, The Pianist, Life Is Beautiful, Elephant, The Deer Hunter, Amelie, The Bicycle Thief, Letters From Iwo Jima, Forrst Gump, Amores Peros, The Sweet Hereafter, and now this film.

This film has moved me like no other...,"I have just seen the film ""Brokeback Mountain"" here in NYC, and this film has moved me like no other. I have looked up pertinent information on IMDb.com and am including it here, in case others have not noticed the original author or screenwriter's information.The screenplay, by Larry McMurtry (""Lonesome Dove""), was based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx first published in the New Yorker in 1997. Proulx won the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for fiction for ""The Shipping News,"" another favorite film of mine.""Her short story ""Brokeback Mountain,"" which contains a character who is killed in a Wyoming gay-bashing, was published in The New Yorker in 1997, almost exactly one year before the real-life murder of gay Wyoming man Matthew Shepard. Proulx, who lived close to where Shepard was beaten, was called to but not selected for jury duty for the trial of Shepard's murders.""Proulx published her first novel at age 56. She was born in 1935 and McMurtry was born in 1936, so they are both around 70 years old. Maybe it's not all over for us yet!I have read McMurtry's about cowboys and the west, and as the screenwriter here, he does the same terrific job he always does. It was filmed in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, so the scenery is stunning and well worth a trip to a ""real big screen theater"" which I haven't been to in many years.I feel this film will change this country and this culture in ways we never could imagine, and it's long overdue.

So what?,"With all the lavishing of praise on this film I was expecting something spectacular. The subdued cinematography was excellent and the portrayals were wonderful (even the mushed-mouth lines of Heath Ledger) but the film left me wondering what it was all about.In a typical love story there is a certain amount of build up, a certain amount of care and planning. Yearning and care. There was non of that. The story went from 2 cowboys herding sheep, to a wham bam sex scene and then a bunch of wandering and muted yearning.Honestly, I have seen more tenderness in an episode of OZ then in this movie. While I believe there are some redeeming efforts I found that there was so much unspoken (Randy Quaid's 'picking up"" on the situation by 2 single and very brief visits to camp -- and the one encounter between the cowboys is supposed to telegraph a great passion) The only true glimpse I saw of Jack's care for Ennis was when Jack was not even on the screen. It was from Jack's mother that I got an inkling of Jack's passion for Ennis.A movie like this could have been great, a 10, but I find it hard to stick with the 6 I am giving it.

My initial thought was how incredible Heath Ledger was in his role (and he was, completely), but the more I have thought about the film, the more I have come to appreciate Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as well, they complimented each other so well, and have my total admiration for giving it their all.Who would have thought that three little words, 'Jack, I swear...' could contain so much emotion, pain and despair, not just for Ennis, but for the viewer, too.I want to watch it again, but I'm not sure I have the emotional strength to.

"Brilliant cast, epic love story","Love is all about the moment, the time spent together, the when and the where. Brokeback Mountain is the setting of that moment, one they could never get back. The rest of their lives is just centered around the memory of Brokeback Mountain, never amounting to much because they got stuck in that time. I'm a sucker for a good gay love story and this film moved me from minute one.Ennis (Ledger) and Jack (Gyllenhaal) are two gay cowboys who fall in love in the summer of 1963 while working as shepherds on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming. Needless to say, their relationship is taboo and they end up leading separate lives, each married and living far apart. They never forget each other and occasionally meet up on ""fishing trips"", desperately trying to recapture the time they had together when they first met. Time takes its toll, and the love they felt becomes a burden on both.With a brilliant cast, this epic love story will affect even those most opposed to homosexuality. It's not about gay love. It's about forbidden love. And it is in this love that Lee was able to merge the beauty of midland America with the beauty of a passion that inevitably turns into pain. You can't help but feel it. I know I did.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Have YOU ever loved so passionately?,"I've seen this movie twice. Great love story, the fact that they are two men makes little difference to me. What I keep harping on is how passionate they were together. I'v only ever been with one person in my life that made me feel this much this strongly and since seeing this movie I've thought of this person constantly.It's a little amusing that it took a Chinese director to show some of the more beautiful vistas of the American midwest; it really is a beautiful movie to watch.Go see this movie!

A really wonderful and touching experience,"It is a remarkable film - something not seen before. The way it handled such a sensitive subject will appeal to all types of audiences. The direction of Ang Lee was great - the story of a lifetime was compressed in a 2 hour movie and the pace was remarkable. The acting was really good and the main protagonists brought out the characters, as if they were real. The actors moved to the background and the screen characters took the center stage. The underlying pain that lingered throughout the movie was touchy and the ending should really touch all. This movie should do really good at the Oscars ..... a perfect 10 from me. I would recommend lovers of thoughtful and serious movies to see this one .. they should not miss it for anything.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
More than a love story...,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is a Drama movie in which we watch the story of Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, two men who form a passionate and complex romantic relationship while working as cowboys in the remote mountains of Wyoming.I found this movie very interesting and beautiful with amazing interpretations of both Heath Ledger who played as Ennis and Jake Gyllenhaal who played as Jack. The chemistry between the two actors is palpable, making their emotional connection more powerful. The cinematography was also a standout, with sweeping shots of the Western landscape that mirrored the vast emotional distance between the characters. It's undeniably a beautiful and tragic story and it can feel emotionally overwhelming at times. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a beautifully crafted movie with exceptional interpretations and a powerful exploration of love and identity. I can understand that it couldn't be for everyone but I suggest you to give it a try because I am sure that it will amaze you.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't really know what to say...,"This is one of the most honest and HAUNTING films that I have ever seen. What a story!! This is the type of film making and the type of performances and the type of writing that you can't really say much about, as it's hard to find the words to describe them...or you just don't know where to start...All of the performances were great. Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams were definitely on point with very accurate portrayals of women in their situations...but obviously, this is Heath and Jake's film...They are so amazing as the LEADS (don't know why Jake has been made supporting) as Ennis and Jack. I was just in love with both of the characters for their bravery and, most of all, their love. They both give the performances of their life...and everything they do from now on will be compared to this film. Jake was shamefully snubbed, not receiving a Golden Globe nomination. I hope the same thing doesn't happen come SAG and Oscar time...Just to let you know, if you don't already, this is a story about love...ridiculous, undying, unabashed, uncompromising, indescribable, REAL love. It is such a revelation and a breath of fresh air for PEOPLE in general today, let alone a gay man like myself. Make sure you are confident in the love that you have for your partner, if you have one, as this will make you think and LONG for that kind of love...What a heart-breaking and AMAZING film!

"Very enjoyable, and quite moving","Let me start by saying that I really liked it. The acting was great overall, and the dialog/plot seemed believable. Also, if you're the type that is still a little uncomfortable watching homosexual situations, you shouldn't be afraid to see this movie...It was tastefully done.As far as the acting, my favorite performance would have to be that of Michelle Williams. She brought such emotion and pure feeling to that part. Her performance was sincere and moving. Anne Hathaway was equally great, but with a more subdued character. She was the type that acted as if nothing could touch her, that she had everything in control, and in the end, you witness the pain that was always there...she really made it work. Randy Quaid was just as impressive. He showed yet another facet of his acting talent. His character was dead on. I know men like him, and he hit the nail on the head. Jake Gyllenhaal was brilliant as always. He is one of my favorites since Donnie Darko, and he just has an extreme and inspiring talent for acting. The only complaint here for me is Heath Ledger. He was not horrible, but I found the accent, and mannerisms a little rehearsed. I just didn't buy it. He was a non-cowboy trying to act like a cowboy...it's just the general feeling I got.Some people on the site are complaining of a slow moving story, and that nothing really happens. I even heard some comments to that same effect on my way out of the theater. The fact is, this is really an all out drama. The basic story of a group of people and the hardships they endure through a number of years. I'm not sure what everyone is expecting to happen. If you like tons of action, murder and mayhem, graphic sexuality, or other in your face types of themes, then you won't enjoy this. But...if you're like me, and you enjoy seeing everyday people facing the challenges of life, and struggling to find happiness, then you'll be in awe.As for the sexuality, I don't judge people on it, but I have to admit, I was a little uncomfortable during a few of the love scenes. I will say though, that I thought they were tastefully done, leaving a lot to the imagination...which, for my taste, is more enjoyable...whether it is gay or straight.That sums it up! I was very impressed with this movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very good film,"What is there to say really? This movie is so well directed, so brilliantly written and so beautifully shot.Some really great powerhouse performances also...Heath Ledger - one of the best in his career, absolutely astonishing and encapsulating. He draws us in so well and so easily. Such a shame that Heath died so young too.Jake Gylenhall - another amazing performance, hes so amazing in this film, he and Heath have such great chemistry and you can tell that these two loved every second of working on this film.Michelle Williams - you cannot help but root for jack and ennis. But Ennis' wife Alma....you cannot help but want to hug her. Michelle gives an excellent performance. She is an underrated actress in the industry.All in all, Brokeback Mountain, barley any flaws.

2 men goes to work as shepards in the mountain and they fall for each other.,"The movie does have nice scenery, but not as pretty as I have imagined it to be. And the story does seem to give a strong sense of hope and inspiration for audiences. Throughout the film, there are scenes of men being intimate. Some might find themselves feeling uncomfortable at times.The movie seems to be really quiet. There is very little background music; always just the sound of silence or the running of water...The ending keeps us wondering a little. Especially with Anne Hathaway's response to ""Ennis"" when he called.The film's message was clear in illustrating the hardship of living as a homosexual back then due to the narrow-mindedness of the public.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brokeback Mountain make's Dave Top Ten list,"Halfway through the movie I wasn't sure what I felt about the film, afraid it was going to go where I didn't want it to and become lame, over-dramatic or push the whole gay revolution in my grill however it didn't, it isn't the edgy film you suspect, it stayed a subtle film about love and life's shitty path, layered with beautiful acting, cinematography that created a world not unlike our own, and Ang Lee is a wonderful director who can touch any subject it seems and bring the right magic to it. By god the entire cast is great, everyone does top notch acting. Heath Ledger has so many layers playing through him that you can't help to sympathize and relate to his internal struggle, no matter where your own beliefs stand. The most amazing thing about this film's acting is in the women, in my opinion it is rare to find truly good actresses right now with few exceptions. The entire female cast of BrokeBack is amazing and blew me away, everyone from Anne Hathaway and Michele Williams playing the cowboy's wives, to Kate Mara playing the daughter of Ledger and Linda Cardellini (who I have loved since the Freaks & Geeks series) as the second female lover of Ledger's , and you might doubt it but Anna Faris, yes the annoying girl from those shitfests called Scary Movie, was great as a talks too much western gal. The entire movie felt authentic and real. This is most likely going to be my choice for best picture of the year. GO SEE IT.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
In summary.,"Like many people I wanted to see Brokeback Mountain to make my own opinion about a film that seems to have gathered much thought in the run up to its release. The backdrop to the film was simply stunning, and in my opinion, one of the highlights. The storyline was again, in my opinion only, weak. I do feel it has been greeted with such warmth and controversy due to a general thirst; we seldom get to see films that are ""obviously"" set to a gay theme.In hindsight a tad to long, very beautiful and at times moving. The guy behind me was in floods of tears, though I think that was more about him than the film. Now Beeches. Now that made me cry. Or Torch Song Trilogy or even Ben Hur. (Yes that did have a gay theme, but like most you have to watch for it) So maybe Brokeback Mountain was not so cutting edge after all.In summary. Not worth the hype it has been given but a great film regardless",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""A Truly Grounbreaking Film For Understanding of Love Between Two Human Beings""","I saw this film with friends, both straight and gay. I saw myself up on the screen for the first time in my 62 years of living. What a great feeling. While gays have been portrayed in many films over the years for many years and in very positive ways, this is the first time I have seen a real love story. By having its origin begin in 1963, six years before the Stonewall Riots in New York City - a cosmopolitan, sophisticated city even then it structures the turmoil these two men faced between each other and even more powerful from society. Both Ennis and Jack mirror some of my life (and I'm sure many other gays). Back then many of us had no role models for what it was to realize this attraction in our early teens. Many of us just kept it hidden and sometimes discovered this attraction in the same manner as Jack and Ennis, often stating the same ruse of denial after such and encounter. Oh, do I remember!!! I am out now.This film is so well done on so many levels. First the setting is so stark. Gays exist in the hinterlands, what a surprise!!!...they just up and move to the accepting cities, or at least where they can blend into the surroundings. The non-stereotypical ( by the media's standards, not mine) men in the film are brilliantly acted. Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are both to be commended for their portrayals - equally. I only hope that both get recognized for their quite truthfully perfect acting performances. The rest of the cast members, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway, are also to be commended as are Larry McMurtry and Dianna Osanna for their screenplay and Ang Lee for his direction. I have just read the short story and must note that much of Annie Proulx's prose in the book are adapted verbatim in the screenplay. Thanks to all involved for a great, great film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
What was that all about ?,"I've seen the movie and I can't understand what all the agitation was about. A flat love story which wouldn't have caught a second glance if it wasn't about two cowboys. The landscape is beautiful but beyond that there is nothing exceptional. It's like Anna Karenina all over again. It's a cheap attempt to make people feel guilty about their homophobic feelings. I really think that the emperor has no clothes. We know that America is changing, even the last bastion of masculinity and gay-phobia was reduced, love transcends all borders but the movie fails to pass the stereotype test except in the scene at the end with Jack's parents.Paul",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why it stays with you and what to do about it..,"One of the most overwhelming aspects of this film, and at the same time its genius, is how its story absorbs you into itself, finally wounds you and leaves you bleeding; yet it is a wounding that is also healing... Rather than fading by the time you get home and back to 'life', instead grief and bittersweet pain visit in waves until, alone, in private moments of the day, tears well-up.It's at once exhilarating and disturbing to be so deeply affected by a film. When it persists more that a day or two, albeit gently, you begin to wonder just what is happening to you.. Which brings me to my point: Brokeback Mountain is not staggering in its impact on you because of superficial concern for characters, but for how it somehow seduces you into confronting vicariously your own thwarted dreams, missed opportunities, thinly covered disappointments - even shame of your own unhappiness; so too your first loves, your great loves, the memory of love. One is ambushed by one's own phantoms and fondest memories, in potent and distilled form. It's not so much the movie that won't seem to leave us but our own soul's joys, sorrows and hopes, surfaced and in need of the light of day.So what are we to do? See the film endlessly? It is tempting to believe one more viewing will give me something more.. Probably not the final solution. What we need to do is read the text of our own life now, albeit as dramatically surfaced and illuminated for us by a film. We need now to re-enter the adventure of responsible liberty and walk resolutely and courageously into this storm that has come to visit us. We cannot out-source this profound task to film makers or anyone else, no matter how they may have inspired us. It is for us now to finish the story...As Proust wrote on the ultimate inability of other's books (or films) to satisfy us in our quest for truth and spiritual life,""Reading (movie-going) is on the threshold of the spiritual life; it can introduce us to it: it does not constitute it.""Bon courage à tous...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Truly Great American Love Story,"I will admit, I was a little skeptical about seeing this movie. But I wasn't about to pass up the opportunity to see two of my favorite actors. So I went ahead and rented it. At first it was a little... strange. I wasn't sure I was going to make it through the rest of the movie. But I sat and watched it and I fell in love with Jack and Ennis. Their story is so bittersweet, it just pulls you in and wont let you go. They are so beautiful together and they are so utterly miserable without each other that, by the end of the movie, you want them to be together. The world just doesn't seem right if they aren't When the ""gay cowboy movie"" cliché got to me, I wasn't so sure I wanted to put myself through this movie. But Brokeback Mountain is so much more than just a stereotypical ""gay cowboy movie."" It really and most truly is a great American love story. And I will stand by this movie until the day I die.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Left With The Deepest Sadness...,"First of all, can I just say, ""MY GOD"" I haven't seen such a brilliantly made movie since ""MILLION DOLLAR BABY"", even though I do think Brokeback Mountain does surpass Million Dollar Baby, with regards to better acting and just an all around, a better movie. Even though Clint Eastwood is ""THE MAN""! The title of my review expresses exactly how I was feeling when I left the theater.This is the tragic love story of two cowboys who fall in love while in the mountains of Brokeback. With the first love scene, it comes of as an unreasoning or an extravagant passion or attraction, which can be defined as INFATUATION. In the movie, we later on realize that, it's not infatuation at all, but something that goes much deeper. Something many of us don't like to say unless we truly meant it, something we call.... LOVE. Regardless of the fact that it is a love between two men, we as humans should understand because love is a universal emotion which everyone, straight or not, can understand and feel. Brokeback Mountain depicts every emotion we as humans feel; Love...sadness...fear...and anger.I was blown away by the performances of all the cast members including Anne Hathaway, which many people basically forgot was in the movie. Even though I do agree with her not being nominated for an Oscar because her performance was the weakest. Honestly, as hard as it is to say, because Jake Gyllenhaal is my favorite actor EVER and probably one of the most underrated,(Even though people are starting to catch on to him now) although he's been great since DONNIE DARKO. Heath Ledger's performance was stronger and more powerful than Jake's. I feel as though if anyone should've won an Oscar, he should.(Damn u, Capote!). His performance was one of the best performances to ever not win an Oscar in the history of the academy awards. Although these are strong words, they are true. I have never seen Heath act with so much heart and, passion and take on a character who isn't even an embody that fictional character like he did in Brokeback Mountain. Unlike the other actors who were nominated, who had someone who they could mirror and were trying to portray which, is still great. But to become someone who doesn't even exist with such passion and raw talent it would've seemed as though there were really an Ennis del Mar!Now on to Jake and Michelle. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was incredible as Jack Twist in Brokeback Mountain. But everyone should remember that, just because your not crying in every scene, fighting a cause, or even screaming at people in a dramatic and emotional way, doesn't mean you can't create a powerful performance. Which is exactly what Jake did, he was subtle with a lot of his expressions and feelings, and wasn't aggressive in several scenes. For the main part, Jake was very subtle, to portray a character that was in love with another man, not by choice.Best said in this line,""I anit no queer,"" said Ennis, Jack replies,""me neither."" His facial expressions and body language are priceless in the film, and those are attributes which not everyone possess. During these times an actor's real talent is shown, because its not always about how dramatic you can be.Michelle Williams performance is heartbreaking to watch. She, like Heath, really did a '180'(degree)in terms of the fact that I wasn't really a huge fan of their acting, and they've just done wonders in this film. We get to see her go through the horrible experience of her having to come to terms with the fact that her husband is having an affair, and to make matters worse, with the possibility that he could be gay; with his affair having to be with another man. Also, how every time he goes away to fish with his friend, they are together in more than one way. Michelle's breakdown in the movie was nothing short of incredible and moving. She may not have won the Oscar, but she surely deserved it. But I guess that it all depends on the opinion of the viewers/critics. And finally Ang Lee; Wow. No words can describe how thankful I am to him for making this movie and having the courage to carry on even with all the obstacles he had to face trying to make the movie. Thank you for your genius idea because this movie could've easily been a disaster. Even though Brokeback was snubbed for best picture, they had to give it to you Ang because your directing was nothing short of brilliant.... Thank You with the dearest of appreciation.Going to the movie, I was just expecting a great movie. But now thinking back, this was more than just a great movie. It was one of a kind, and probably will remain that way. I felt, basically, every emotion that Heath , Jake , Michelle , and even Anne felt. This may be a movie about tragedies, but the biggest tragedy was the Oscars showing there true colors; giving the best picture award to a movie that in its own right, was incredible but nowhere near on the same level, and as brilliantly made as Brokeback Mountain. This movie tears at your heart for 2 hrs and 15 mins, and with the way I, and probably many others, felt for many days to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A sweeping & epic cinema experience,"Brokeback Mountain was hands-down the best film of the year. With it's heart-wrenching performances, articulate direction, gorgeous scenery, subtle score and incredible script, it is a true piece of art. Heath Ledger, in the best role of his career, is a revelation; his ability to ACT so inexpressive is unbelievable. This film is the beginning of a new chapter in his career. Jake Gyllenhaal has been overshadowed lately by all the praise for Ledger's performance, and I feel this is not fair. He is also fantastic, particularly in one confrontation scene with Ledger. The supporting work is also great, particularly from Michelle Williams & Anne Hathaway; having this film ""under their belt"" will definitely be a career-booster. This film could not have come out at a more relevant time, with the US divided over gay marriage.Before going to see this film, you may think of it as ""the gay cowboy movie"" and after seeing it, you will feel completely different. It is perhaps one of the best love stories in recent years. Go to your nearest theatre and see this film; it's phenomenal.

Good but not great,"Due to the movie's acclaim, I had to watch it for myself. However, CRASH was the best picture of the year, with CAPOTE a close second, and in my humble opinion, M OF A GEISHA a close third. My problem with Bback was with the initial character development and interaction between the boys, preceding their first tryst. It did not seem that there was enough moments where their mutual attraction and feelings were growing, and I believe the first 30 minutes of the film dragged on a bit. I did not believe the level of intensity, which made it hard for me to buy the rush of passion. Nonetheless, the story was good, and I felt the acting was great, with Heath Ledger leading the way. The writing was good, but this movie was more hype rather than substance.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Most heart-felt movie of our decade,"At first I was apprehensive about seeing this movie. I thought, ""What straight man will go to see a movie about two gay cowboys?"" So, my sister got me the original short story which the movie is based on, and I read it within 45 minutes. The story was so amazing that I quickly went to see the movie. During the emotional points of this film, I admit that I sobbed. Although this film was labeled as a controversial film, it was, none the less, flawless and extraordinary!!! Afterward, I went to school and convinced 15 of my friends to watch this movie, and they all came back wanting to watch it for a second time. Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Michelle Williams delivered powerfully emotional performances. In this writer's own opinion, if Ledger, Williams, and Gyllenhaal do not win Oscars, then that will be the biggest disappointment/mistake of American Film History. I was so moved by this film that I went to see it a second time, and I sobbed again. Overall, it would be a mortal sin if one does not watch this film. This is a ""water-shed"" movie, and will probably/hopefully become one of the best films in history (along side Casablanca and Titanic). Go see this movie, I promise that (if you have an open mind about the understanding and acceptance of homosexuality in our society today) you will love this movie as much as I have.

Too much controversy = disappointment...,"Once upon a time there were two brawny cowboys that loved each other so much, and they spent the nights giving free hand to his love inside their tent there at the Wyoming mountains. They wished they could stay just like that for ever and ever, but it's not possible. In the deep America of the 60s (and at present time) it was quite a taboo to be a gay, so they'd better marry and have some children... the way is meant to be. Maybe they'll meet each other once a year and they'd be able to release they're true instincts... but that'll be all.Anytime a movie creates a big controversy you end up discovering that it wasn't that important at all. Ang Lee perfectly portraits those wonderful mountains, those streams, th sunsets... maybe he recreates himself too much (he just CAN'T make a movie of less than 2 hours). So, what's best about ""Brokeback Mountain""? Well, the photography, of course; the extraordinary beauty of those enclaves... and the work of Heath Ledger. I always thought he was a second rate-expressionless actor, but he makes a virtue out of that expressionless in this movie. He really looks like a redneck (even though he's born in Australia).*My rate: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Appreciate this film before you comment!,"Wow! The arguing that goes on in here is so amusing! Anyway, I thought this film was really good and despite a few things I would've liked to have seen expanded on I'm happy to give this full marks! Movies of this genre don't usually move me in the way that this did! Unfortunately, I felt it was ashame that the story doesn't involve more about Jack and Ennis' relationship together, but then the main issue IS the fact that their love was a love that cannot be! The romantic scenes between Gyllenhaal and Ledger were, i thought, displayed extremely well and really did back-up what you were meant to believe (that the two men were actually in love)! However, i did think that the initial sexual interaction seemed to me to be a little odd! I do though, think that this is just because that scene is based around pure animal magnetism and not any means of love unlike the later interactions! The passion in the scene where the wife, played by Williams, sees the lovers embrace at the side of the house is perfect, and is handled brilliantly by the two actors! I think the reason why this film is appreciated in the way it is by so many people is that it is a beautiful and captivating story, which is supported by many pivotal moments of great acting! These moments touched me and thats therefore why I am giving 'Brokeback Mountain' the rating I am! I hope this helps",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"devastating,inspiring","When I first went to see this movie like most people is was out of curiosity however I was hooked almost immediately. Heath Ledger is amazing and it is heartbreaking to watch him constantly toiling with himself. My favourite scene is their reunion after 4 years apart and Ennis is so overwhelmed he goes against all his beliefs and shows his emotions where there is the risk of them being seen. Jack looks confused until Ennis kisses him and then it all emotion returns. After watching this movie I was unsettled, disturbed, upset for a couple of days and started to think I was going a bit crazy. It is only a movie I kept telling myself.........I then logged on and felt so relieved that so many people were affected the same way as me. Initially I never wanted to see the movie again because of how bad it made me feel however I must confess that I have watched it again and spent most of the time smiling at the humour they share and crying at Jack's desperation to be with Ennis (the travelling from Texas when he heard about the divorce was heartbreaking) and Ennis's slow decline from basking in the love the share to the realisation that he will never allow them to be together. I am not an avid film fan so don't feel qualified to comment on direction,cinematography etc however how this film cannot touch everyone hearts fails me unfortunately the specific area this movie looks at IE society and it's attitude towards homosexuality is the very reason many people will never see this film. I can't believe how much I keep thinking about this film but I am glad to see that I am not alone. Part of me wants to see it again but the anguish and torment I feel for the characters is stopping me - I will give it a while before I cry again. It does dismay me how in our society people are forced to live a lie for fear of how they will be accepted. We should accept people for who/what they are after all those are the very things that conspire to create the people we know and love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Performances,"Brokeback Mountain (2005)**** (out of 4)Ang Lee's film about two cowboys (Heath Ledger/Jake Gyllenhaal) who come to have feelings towards one another but they live in a world where they can't be together. First things first but someone should tell the mainstream media that this isn't the first film to feature gay men. The political storm around the movie has probably kept a lot of people away, which is a shame because this is a pretty damn good film. I think the love story between the two men is a lot less interesting than when the two men are away from one another dealing with their other lives. The stuff between Ledger and his wife (Michelle Williams) was the best part of the film for me. The three performances are all great, especially Ledger who doesn't have much to say in the film so all the emotion has to come from his eyes.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Interesting, but . . . . .","After having been an evacuee from New Orleans for almost three months, the first movie I saw on returning to New Orleans was ""Brokeback Mountain."" I HATE those dreadful cineplex suburb movie gathering places where I saw it. I was initially disengaged with the movie and hoped that I could see it on a small screen in an ""art house"" setting. Canal Place, our local Landmark theater re-opened last weekend after having been closed for almost six months because of Hurricane Katrina's rampage. I went to Canal Place two days ago to see the movie again. I was just mildly less disengaged than I was the first time.I'm not sure that ""main stream"" America is going to be more tolerate of homosexuals because of this movie. I was disappointed that the actors didn't ""age"" very well over twenty years. I think that the stand out performance was that of Roberta Maxwell who plays Mrs. Twist. Now that performance deserved a best supporting actress nod.This movie doesn't displace my affection and love for some other ""queer"" themed movies such as ""Maurice,"" last year's under rated and very moving ""A Home at the End of the World,"" ""Gods and Monsters,"" and ""Parting Glances"" to name a few.Still, I admire the forces behind the scenes which made it possible to see this tragic story of two bisexual men whose lives are a lie to the loved ones around them.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Absolutely beautiful, haunting, one of a kind","Brokeback Mountain. I am haunted by this movie, this story, this love.I don't go to movies much. Like once every 5 years, maybe. But I read an article about Brokeback & couldn't get it out of my head. Checked it out online. There was an urgency to seeing it that I cannot explain. Saw it a week & 1/2 ago, and just had to go back this week. It's beyond words, how can one describe it as a ""gay love story"", a ""homosexual relationship"", whatever. I can't. It transcends that. I think of it as a love between two people who connected so powerfully, so deeply. It is simply beautiful. At night I replay scenes in my mind. It has changed me profoundly.I never left a comment on a website before, either. I wonder how I can be so involved with a movie written from a story written about people who never lived? I can't stop thinking about it. I loved seeing it the second time. The men were perfect as Ennis & Jake. Just perfect. Every scene between them was amazing. The 'back & forth' between them was so genuine, so real. I feel almost like a shadow in contrast to their reality.An amazing, beautiful, powerful masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
My brokeback mountain.,"I went to see Brokeback Mountain the other day. I did not cry one single tear but I have been haunted ever since. It is so moving. Ennis was me. Still, he has brought me back a reflection of myself I had well forgotten.Before June 1999 I had never been kissed. I had never been touched. I was so lonely, so lost. I remember I was not able to make a move to save my life. Now, watching this movie, he (Ennis) brought it all back to me. It deals with the very human drama of not taking proper advantage of the opportunities we are offered here and now. It's real. There are people like him, in this situation. Gay and straight.Sadly, we actually have nothing but a now here on Earth. These opportunities may not be there tomorrow. And when it domes to who we really are, I think it's such a waste to beat around the bush for so long.There's much more about the movie that could be said here but I want to leave something untouched for you people out there.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"OK, but not as good as all the award nominations suggest","Obviously, the best part about this movie was the two leads were both hot guys in Hollywood. Jake G. is really turning into a hot comedy and Heath L. isn't bad himself. The story was interesting, but not that well written. The love story wasn't that moving. I've seen a lot better. The film used the controversy of 2 gay cowboys to get all the media attention it didn't really deserve.It would have been better if it had been under 2 hours. There wasn't enough material to fill almost 2 and a half hours.FINAL VERDICT: It's worth watching just because it's different than most films. Plus, the scenery of nature was beautiful.

Teenybooper Love Story Gone Gay,"I can only imagine that the reason this film has received such acclaim is that it broaches a subject that has been taboo up until this point. The film, on its own merit, is strikingly ordinary. It is not particularly well acted. It is not particularly well directed. What we have here with sophomoric lines is a teenage romance story placed in a foreign setting. Admittingly, some of the mountain scenes are appealing. Some of the issues raised are interesting. The acting, though, is subpar. Quaid and the girl from Dawson's Creek are the only two good performances in the entire movie.It deserves from true critics of movies (and not the social critics that seem to proliferate in this movie's reviews) big thumbs down.

Incredibly film in all respects,"I guess I am the last person on earth to see ""Brokeback Mountain"". Wow. What an incredible film. It restores one's faith that in an age of endless squeals of what were originally bad movies in the first place, it is still possible for a great film to find a large appreciative audience without endless car chases, car wrecks, stereotypical characters, buddy banter, and gratuitous sex scenes.It is: A love story. A story of missed love and missed dreams. A story of despair. A story of hope. A story of life. A same sex Romeo and Juliet with a broader treatment of their separate lives and inner conflicts. It's a great and timeless story.One cannot help but admire the irony of using the masculine cowboy image. Just one of many stereotypes that this movies subtlety challenges.Yes, the directing and acting are flawless. The Ennis character is one of few words. But Heath Ledger nevertheless conveys the feelings with strong emotional energy. Someone once said that a film actor's most powerful tools are not the delivery of his lines, but his eyes, face and body language. Ledger makes this point exceptionally well.And let us not forget, that on top of all of this great directing and acting, there is this breathtaking cinematography that makes you want to just drop everything and head for the big sky country.This is truly a great film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cathartic,"The impact is shattering; all the more so because it was slow acting. When I came out of the cinema I was a bit relieved that the story had not ripped open a lot of painful memories - and there are some. However, half an hour later I could feel the emotion welling up, and an hour after that I was crying. The movie is so subtle and skillful in gently peeling back the scar tissue covering the psychic lesions of past years that I didn't realise it was happening.Scene after scene replays itself in my head. There is such a sense of loss, of desolation, of lives largely wasted and unfulfilled that it was like a death in the family. These last few days have been a period of grieving. What could have been and should have been creates a sadness which permeates the whole movie. This is catharsis time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wow...,"OK, I want to say that this move was one of the most powerfully intense movies I have seen in my entire life! Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal gave performances that exceeded my expectations.

This movie covered that entire scale of emotions for me. I laughed, I cried, I got angry, depressed, sad, you name it, I felt it! I am so glad that a director had the guts to finally touch on such a taboo subject in life. If you go to see this movie, allow yourself to feel every aspect of this movie, and you won't walk away disappointed!

Unbelievable power,"I recently saw Brokeback Mountain for the first time and was wholly unprepared for how the movie grabs a hold of you, drags you in and never completely lets you go even after the credits begin to roll. I have spent the last four days since first seeing the movie incredibly jealous of the intense and passionate love between the characters of Jack and Ennis. I have spent the last four days shedding a tear for the casualties of society, feeling whole-heartedly that these were not characters but people whom I feel deeply for. Their story permeates my every waking thought. I cannot even begin to properly describe how beautiful this movie is in every way, shape and form. The actors and actresses are superb and you forget they even are actors. The cinematography is breath taking and the composition of the score added just enough to pull at your heartstrings without taking over the movie. I haven't found my ""Brokeback Mountain"" yet, that place where I am completely free to be who I am, but as all of us are, I'm constantly searching.

Actually Philadelphia is one of my favorite dramas and i thought it dealt with the homosexuality issue very well. This film just didn't appeal to me, because although the characters were interesting and it was obvious that i would have understood much more if i had read the book, the flow of the film, the events and style of direction were all just too slow and bland for my liking. I was uninterested part of the time, the dialogues were decent, i thought Ledger did better with the acting than Gyllenhaal, which was surprising as i don't consider Ledger the better actor.

But whats an Oscar worthy movie which has no substance what so ever? Don't waste your time and money on it. I was just curious to see what all the hype was about, now I know it was just a hype to be politically correct. I walked into this movie with a very open mind and was looking forward to it. I waited till the end hoping it will end in a good way but I was left disappointed. No, I have nothing against gay people. And though I can honestly say I was a bit disturbed from some of the scenes I still stuck through it just to see when it will actually get better.

The movie stars Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Their performances are exceptional and no one else could have done better.

an epic tale,"I have never been moved to re watch a movie straight after seeing it. Thank the powers that be it was in the comfort of my home on a weekend that I first had the pleasure of watching this epic because the more I watched, the more I wanted - even needed, to watch it. And when I wasn't watching it, I was replaying it in my head. It's been a few days and I still can't stop thinking of it.I feel a little ridiculous but for some reason this movie touched such a raw nerve in me that I don't know what to do with myself. It has stirred up my yearning for that deep and electric connection which I fear is not real. I wonder whether it is unattainable not only because it is 'movie' love but also a love only likely of past ages due to the complexities of social influence etc. Can feelings be so strong if there are no obstacles? Would the intensity dissolve with the mundaneness of ordinary life if caution is thrown to the wind and a life is forged together? Despite these fears and although I'm not a religious woman, I pray to taste something so exquisite.Casting was perfect - in total awe of Heath and Jake (and Michelle - jealous too, naturally).

It's not all that good...,"Of course Brokeback Mountain is not a bad movie. The actors play their parts extremely good and the scenery is breathtaking. But what about the story? I imagine that Americans are not used to films about the love between two men, but in Europe and especially in the Netherlands it's no big deal at all. If these so-called controversial aspects are set aside the entire film is in my opinion nothing more than a fairly one-dimensional story. The are no - or hardly any - changes in plot, the characters remain gloomy from the beginning tot the end. There are no surprises whatsoever. From the beginning the viewer knows that the love between the two is doomed. And that's it mainly. A good movie, but not a master peace.

I've had a massive change of heart,"Back in February when the Oscar race was heating up, I saw Crash and was blown away by it as written. However, I hadn't seen Brokeback Mountain and for that reason had a slight hope Crash might win. I honestly wish I had seen it back then. While I loved Crash, having seen this film today I can honestly say it was ten times better and deserved every award it received. I actually think its a crying shame and insult the Acadamy passed over this film and played it safe with Crash in a clear attempt to stay clear from controversy.Before seeing this film I had no problem with gay people in general or in society. Although I was not a person who was a strong believer in Gay rights, I did agree that a relationship between people of any sex is about people who love each other no matter what age, colour, race etc. and they should be free to express that in society. After seeing this film my views are stronger and I honestly was moved for the second time this week (having watched Once Upon a Time in America a few days before although Brokeback Mountain is even better.) Heath Ledger, Jake Gylenhall, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathway and many others turn in outstanding performances here, with Ledger and Gylenhall carrying the film. Their scenes at Brokeback Mountain and when they reunite throughout are some of the most powerful and emotional I've ever seen and I actually shed tears on several occasions. They heavily strengthened my belief from earlier further and I now strongly understand the torment and sadness many homosexual people suffer at the hands of many society's today. God bless all of you.The deepest thanks go to Ang Lee, the writer of the short story Anne Proulx and screenwriters Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana for forming this masterpiece. Also worthy of much recognition are the Oscar winning score and beautiful photography.A tremendous achievement and landmark in cinema history 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
a bad film,"A massive disappointment. Take a good book and stretch it out into a tedious film. Problem is, the story spans 2 decades, and in trying to cover the time period, Lee doesn't take enough time to develop characters, relationships or situations. So at no point do you care about the people on the screen. Add to this Lee's tendency to avoid any clarification of plot, leaving the viewer to fill in huge blanks, the long silences and endless brooding looks and what dialogue there is being muttered inaudibly and you are left with a boring soulless film. The only actor to come out with any real credit is Anne Hathaway playing well against type.

A Nutshell Review: Brokeback Mountain,"Here's my challenge: Watch Casanova and Jarhead (both now showing in local theaters) before watching Brokeback Mountain, to appreciate and to keep fresh in your mind, the acting range of both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. One plays a king of lovemaking, while the other plays an army grunt, in which both are alpha-males roles. Then when you watch Brokeback Mountain, you'll probably be wide-eyed at how these two have a go at each other.Based upon the 1997 short story by Edna Anne Proulx, you must have your head stuck in mud if you're not aware this movie is about two cowboy shepherds who share a relationship up in the mountains of Brokeback. Set in 1963, we see Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) team up in their job to shepherd sheep to graze, and having strict orders to be separate most times to take care of their flock.But being together alone in the mountains, sharing their lives with each other, brings them too close, and soon, they share a forbidden illicit relationship (hey, they're supposed to be macho cowboys, and it's the 60s of free love and Vietnam looming) that transcends the usual boundaries of male bonding.It's like a summer love, and after an hour into the film, we explore how this love affect them as they try to ease themselves back to normalcy. Except that things are never going to be normal anymore. While they establish families - Del Mar with his be-throed Alma (Michelle Williams), and Twist with rich Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway in another role which she shows off her assets), they cannot forget their throes of passion they had sparked back in summer of 63. Before long, they get together again to reignite their passion for each other and continue over a period of 20 years.One thing's for sure, the story will still play out decently if you substitute gay love with heterosexual roles, like the countless of movies on cheating spouses, but there'll be a very distinct lack of punch. You'll notice that the male couples share similar trials and tribulations of any relationship - the love, passion, how much one party is willing to give the other, and how much the other will reciprocate, and unfulfilled dreams. What gives this movie the edge is how the characters are compelled to look for each other for solace, and the deceit and lies they have to go through in order to be together.It's a movie that's paced slowly, but gives opportunity for the audience to admire the postcard perfect (CGI-enhanced) landscape of the mountains and plains, to study the expressions of the characters, to listen and ponder upon the dialog. Lee Ang had made Chinese Wu-Xia movies sexy, and it's no wonder that he has also managed to add a touch of sensuality that permeates throughout Brokeback. The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack helps too in keeping the mood and emotions in check, serving to add to the narrative in periods of silenced dialog.Perhaps something which I thought was pretty neat, was the idea brought forward from Kinsey, that there is a degree of homosexuality in all of us, and it depends on how gay you are, or have the courage, to come out of the closet. What's interesting is when you think about whether the notion of gayness stems from nature, or nurture. If you'd seen the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about, and how passion can consume someone, that it takes over all sensibility, and about the propensity of risk you're willing to take.Heath Ledger had a pretty busy 2005, with diverse roles in Brothers Grimm, Lords of Dogtown, Casanova and this. I've seen all of them, and while I disliked Grimm, I thought his roles in 2005 should be credited with an Oscar win for this. Jake Gyllenhaal too plays Twist with a touch of machoness, and yet is able to slip back into needy whining gentleness with a flick of a switch. Michelle Williams' role, while small, is accentuated by the particular one scene in which she discover the truth. It is powerful - nothing much said, but everything said through the eyes. Perhaps the weakness link is Hathaway with her megawatt smile and bimbotic blonde looks, as the clueless wife of Twist caught in between some major family squabbles.Homophobes will probably give this movie a miss, but to generally brand this as a gay movie will be missing the point. I'd recommend it to everyone I know to watch this with an open mind. It's an out-and-out dramatic story on relationships, and it's classic storytelling at its best, with excellent acting and strong direction, cinematography, heck, this movie deserves its 8 Academy nominations, so let's see it take home some honors (I'm not sticking my neck out just yet, until I watch all the other contenders).P.S. Yes, this movie is shown here uncut. If you're not celebrating this movie, at least celebrate the fact that we can get to watch it here as it is intended to be.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Masterpiece,"Kudos to Ang Lee and everyone involved in the making of this incredible work of art. Its impact, though slow-burning, hit me with full force and broke me literally to pieces when it came full circle. Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist stayed with me for days after watching the movie, as if being persons I actually knew. Sounds esoteric, but everyone who ever made friends with movie characters as a kid (i.e. with a certain turtle-necked extraterrestrial) knows what I'm talking about. Well, I guess that comparison doesn't really hold, but you know... it's just awesome to have a film do that to me again after a long time of grown-up resistance against the blurring of the borders between art and real life.In short: This is movie-making at its purest and finest, slow-paced, but highly resonant in each single frame, with a story not driven by incident, forced melodrama and the writer's apparent wish to make everything fit in a profound statement (hello there, 'Crash'), but simply by characters stuck in themselves and their own existence, with every throwback in their constant pursuit of happiness being a result not only of society's shortcomings (in an intense flashback the film reveals a shocking glimpse of the outcome of a hate crime) but of their own inability to really accept the nature of their desire. Depressing stuff this might be, but the director's humanist approach to it, with it's loving gaze on all his characters, makes it not only bearable, but a truly cathartic experience for the viewer.As you may have already noticed I would recommend you badly to see this film - it truly deserves any audience it gets, and it might even change a few minds, let alone lives, along the way... as it is, in case you hadn't known, a love story between two men, transcending the queer movie as well as the Hollywood romance.Not to be missed, 11 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

But I loved so much Jake Gyllenhall performance, just a bit more than Heath Ledger's. His dreamy eyes are something very touching and really take you away! I'm so happy that Brokeback Mountain won in Europe (best movie at Venice Film Festival and BAFTA Awards) but so unhappy that it wasn't given the Oscar.

Just curious...have been attempting to research the answer to no avail. Also, is there anybody out there that is as impressed as I am with Heath Ledger's performance? I mean, his American accent was flawless (albeit a bit construed).

If you've seen movies with gay relationships, that never made it to the big screen, this will be the same with great cinematography. The movie will give a first glance to those who don't have gay friends or family members. To those who are struggling with their own identity, in a small town, go see this movie! Though it never has a climax or much of a plot, it is a good overall story. I grew up in a big city and never really went ""in the closet"" so it was interesting to see what it would be like. It just went on and on and on. Made it hard to keep myself interested. The nudity is no worse than a daytime soap opera, it's just two men.

Kept looking at my watch to see if it was about over. Second, did anyone else have trouble with the dialog? It was as it Heath Ledger was speaking with a mouth full of marbles. I kept thinking, ""what did he say""? I've never been to a movie with more instances that I simply could not make out what the character was saying. Last of all, there was very little character development at all. These people were all so one dimensional it's not even funny. It's like nothing happened to these guys in their normal lives -- they just lived for the occasional rendezvous.

When you really think about it, the fact that this movie can pull off as cheesy of a line as ""I wish I could quit you!"" speaks to how good the storytelling is. You can't pull that line off if you haven't generated enough empathy for your main characters.",,Anonymous,Romance
daring and boring,"Guess what Limau, my opinion is, while different from yours, GENUINE! Commendations - bold subject matter, anything Jake G. does, magnificent scenery, and Michelle Williams performance. And I liked the music. Drudgery - I spent the first third of the movie waiting for it to start, and the last 2/3 waiting for it to end. Here's the irony - I *LIKE* long, slow movies that let you think for yourself! This one's just long and slow. Heath, stick to the pretty-boy roles. Wow, I have to fill up 10 lines - I guess IMDb doesn't do succinct. So, if it matters, I'm a gay rights activist, which is why I applaud the bold subject matter. I've been a Jake fan since October Sky, and he has yet to disappoint me. I've never been a Heath fan, and he has yet to disappoint me. I've never been a Michelle Williams fan, but she converted me. Am I up to 10 lines yet?",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways...,"""Brokeback Mountain"" won 3 Oscars, and was nominated for 7 more. The late Heath Ledger's performance was praised, as was Jake Gyllenhaal's, and critics hailed it as a masterpiece.Looking at the poster for ""Brokeback"", I noticed that it was very similar to another movie poster, ""Titanic"". According to Wikipedia, it was designed after the ""Titanic"" poster on purpose. And that sums up the movie perfectly: it tries too hard to be touching, to be heart-warming, and to be romantic.Why does everyone praise Heath's performance? He wasn't that great, all he really did was talk through his lips with a deep voice. All of a sudden he deserves an Oscar?This movie was really (also) poorly made and directed. It starts with an awkward and far-too-long silence, and that's just about the whole movie: Ang Lee spends way too much time (for instance) following Ennis and Jack to the bar, showing a lot of (rather lovely at first, but then gets really boring) scenery. Please remind me why Lee got an Oscar for his direction instead of Steven Spielberg for ""Munich""? About 10 minutes into the movie, I'm waiting for something to happen. 20 minutes: ooh! A bear shows up! But nothing ends up coming from it: it's shown, you have an exciting minute waiting for some sort of plot to develop from it, but it turns out that we're coming back to Ennis and Jack after all.I'll cheerfully admit that I'm biased, and that romantic movies really aren't my thing. But ""Brokeback Mountain"" has such a poor plot, casting, direction, and an appalling score (that once more tries too hard to sound romantic)... How bad do I hate this movie? Words cannot describe my feelings.Do you want a well-made (keyword: WELL-made) romance movie? Watch ""Titanic"". I'll take it any day over this junk.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A must see movie especially for movie critics,"Wonderful! is not enough to describe it. It is yet the most original story I had ever seen. This movie actually gave me a whole new view of gays, they are not only those who feel feminine inside....... I was near to tears at the part when Ennis went to the house of Jack's parents and saw the clothe that Jack wore on the last day that they'd seen each other, I swore I would had cried if not only for the fact that I was with many people at the time. If only the world they were living in is not judgmental and cruel to those like them they would have lead a blissful life together. This movie will make each and everyone of us realize that we are lucky today because we already had the freedom to express ourselves out in the public. Jack and Ennis' tragic love story is an excellent example of the prejudice that gays experienced during old times. Being able to view this one-of-a-kind film was a privilege for me. Ang Lee not only brought out the best from the actors, he also brought out the best about seeing two male cowboys deeply in love with each other. Seriously! I mean, never had I seen a love story, especially between two gays, as beautiful as this. Though I had to admit that I was totally freak out when Jack and Ennis French kissed at the stairway of Jack's house, the scene when Ennis's wife finally discovered the truth. Now that I mentioned it I seem not to remember any love story between gays. Where the hell did Lee got this is one thing i WOULD LOVE TO KNOW.""I wish I know how to quit it"" whoever said this is least important, what matters most is that it struck me to the core. I guess this is the most unforgettable line to those many who had and will watch BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. It isn't because its an original nor is it sweet to hear nor will it move you to heavy emotion, the sole reason that I could guarantee this the fact that no one can control his or her or anyone's emotions. One couldn't control or rather, stop hate or love for whatever reason. Psycologically speaking this is a part of our life. We are living to feel this and undergo the process of discovering the wonders of life. The main truth about the line is that no matter who you are, no matter what you do, no matter how much you reason out you cannot stop yourself from loving a person no matter who he/she is, no matter what he/she did. It may sound absurd but the main fact is we are just human beings, that we do make some mistakes and that sometimes we just cannot control ourselves. This movie apparently showed us that things are not always the way we wanted it to be, that sometimes life is playing tricks on us, that it doesn't care whatever time or circumstance you are in. I am a person who doesn't generally believe in fate even until now that I'd already said this stuff but somehow I believe or wanted to believe there are some forces at work sometimes.Brokeback Mountain did deserve all of its awards especially best picture. Having to view this was a wonderful experienced for me. But we had to admit that young people who are not yet ready for heavy drama is not suit for this, they may find it too boring, they will only like or be amused by scenes where Jack and Ennis french kissed, now that's a part you don't usually witness. Though I am grossed out that Jake and Heath did that kissing scene no matter how original it may be.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Oh My.......Wow....,"This was indeed the most thought provoking, life changing movie I have ever seen. Brokeback Mountain has virtually transformed my heart and life. Everyone should watch this movie with an open heart. Kudos to Heath and Jake. I believed, I wept, I fell in Love with the passion of them both. How on earth could they not both have won the awards they were nominated for astounds and shocks me. Keep in mind that these two boys are not gay but yet sincerely conveyed a passion that can only come from the depths of ones very soul. Normally I do not follow any particular star or consider myself a ""fan"", but I shall follow these two careers with full anticipation. Thank you boys for your boldness and commitment. This one wins.Added: I truly thought that I was among the minority in the way this movie has impacted me...Wrong! It seems everyone except the narrowest of souls has connected on some substantial level and in some way to this movie. Gay and straight alike appear to be touched. Male and female alike. I too still grieve. I still think about it, I still long for the passion of it and wonder if I will ever experience it for myself. I find myself wanting to go to Wyoming and breath the air, Why? I know that there is nothing there for me to find. I want to stand on that mountain in Canada, put my feet in that creek and weep. My eyes well-up even now as I think about the piercing that movie has given my soul. Perhaps these feelings are symbolic to the fact that Jacks last wishes could not be carried out. If I go, maybe I can heal.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An intense experience - fabulous film!,"An hour after I saw the movie, and I'm still tearing up about it! This movie was excellent. I have been caught up in the movie hype, and secretly getting excited about it, and reading the excellent reviews of it here on IMDb. I have been wanting to see it for ages, and knew it was going to be good (and was so happy when it won awards)! But even so, my expectations were not just met, they were EXCEEDED. This movie is more excellent than I can put into words. I think it will open a lot of people's eyes to the real beauty of the love that can be shared. The love between these two men, Ennis and Jack, was amazing. It struck chords in my heart and left me breathless, and teary, and it really made me feel for them.This movie is amazingly poignant. The acting is SO amazing! I've never seen Heath Ledger act better than he did in Brokeback Mountain. Jake Glyllenhaal I had never really seen in movies, but I knew his name, and he did a wonderful job in this movie, too. He has those eyes that just sink you in and get you stuck there, swimming in them.The plot is realistic, telling of the hardships of 1963, but mostly the movie is about the love shared between the men, and how they cope with not being able to be together every minute as they wish.This movie also had some really funny parts in it. It's a drama, but there were some parts that really had me laughing. And at other parts, it can be so intense...intense passion...intense anger...intense sadness, and anguish...""Brokeback Mountain"" is a masterpiece because of the giant heart the movie, and its characters, have. Their hearts show through their love. It's stunning. It leaves you wanting to see the movie over, and over, and over.Poignant. Beautiful. Magnificent. These words can't even sum up the total effectiveness and excellence of ""Brokeback Mountain."" This is a movie you must experience in order to understand its greatness.

Brokeback Mountain as a Western,"Warning, warning. Spoilers everywhere. Place spoilers, scene spoilers, minor plot spoilers.This review best read by someone who has already seen the movie.I'm a Californian, first, last, and always, but for the most part I grew up in the Gold country and Ranch country of the far Northern end. In any way that matters, I'm a Westerner with a Northwest edge. Yreka, a town firmly in Ranch Country shadowed by Mt. Shasta is still what I think of as my home town.One set of grandparents sold their homestead in Saskatchawan and moved to Portland, Oregon. The other set farmed the family homestead near Halsey Oregon until they retired.My wife has roots in Rural Idaho. My stepmother was reared in Colorado. My Uncle and Aunt lived in Nevada but retired to Arizona.My family is about as Western as you can get if you don't include Texas.I've got one sister in Anchorage Alaska and one sister in Riverton Wyoming.....Yeah that Riverton.Spoiler coming! Ennis for a time lives above the laundromat in Riverton with his wife.Just for the record in case you don't or didn't stay for the credits: what you see on screen is from Alberta. Amongst other things, the real Riverton is a whole lot bigger town.Riverton in the movie isn't the Riverton my new-phew still lives in, but I wondered if Heath Ledger paid my nephew as a speech coach because Ledger has nailed Wyoming speech.I started this to talk about Brokeback as a Western.Another Spoiler coming.In the opening sequence Randy Quaid shows up to hire Ennis and Jack. Next time you watch this scene take careful note of Quaid's hat and walk. I think he's deliberately giving us a modernized version of John Wayne in Rio Bravo.And what's the theme of Rio Bravo and half the Western's in the canon? A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do, which is the right and honorable thing, whether or not he wants to and whether or not it's in his best interest.Western's are also often about the conflict between the big space and the loneliness of the human paths that seek to master it. (Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West is probably my favorite example. Every single one of the men ends up without Claudia Cardinale though all of them seem to want her.) Brokeback is clearly a Western. It's clearly about the Big Space. It's clearly about conquering loneliness or succumbing to it. It's about people I have known from tiny Western town all of my life who lead lives of quiet desperation, nobility, and pain.Ennis's tragedy is that he feels compelled to do the ""right thing"" by his community and his daughters, when that ""right thing"" is clearly a tragic loss for him.For a bit on the way home tonight, I kept saying to my wife ""How can Ang Lee get our West?"" Well, Duh, he had Larry McMurtry as a producer and writer and how can you get more West then that? If I take the Italian (Sergio Leone), I guess I have to take the Taiwanese",,Anonymous,Romance
"One thing is for sure, you'll know exactly what turns you on and off by the end of this one!","When I was confronted with the first graphic sex scene in this movie, being the politically correct individual I am, I tried my best to view it as a normal love story. Ya know... just your typical steamy spontaneous romp. Instead, I couldn't help but cringe and feel like I was watching a sequel to the prison rape scene in ""American History X"" or ""Mi Familia!"" It was then that I realized this REALLY WAS a movie about two gay cowboys! Quite frankly, if ""Brokeback Mountain"" had been about a man and a woman, this movie wouldn't have been given any attention whatsoever. I've seen love stories with much better screenplays, acting, you name it! Yeah, I know, that's missing the point of ""Brokeback Mountain"" because the gay issue is what makes it unique, but I'm always wary of movies that you can accurately claim: ""If not for (insert event, plot catch, casting decision) no one would remember this at all."" I call it the ""Memento Catch."" Remember how stoked everyone was when ""Memento"" first came out? They claimed it was a brilliant movie! That Christopher Nolan was the next Hitchcock! Well, the thing about ""Memento"" was that the events themselves weren't anything special, just the order in which they were presented. I'm not taking away from Nolan's movie at all, it was a brilliant screenplay! Imagine that, writers DO matter. Someone let Hollywood know before they saturate us with the next ""Dukes of Hazzard"" or ""Scooby-Doo."" But there wasn't really anything special to that movie other than the clever order of events, which to my knowledge, no one had attempted before. But now, years later, after we've regrouped and seen some of Nolan's other stuff such as ""Batman Begins"" -- which is decidedly average when you consider it cost $200 million to make -- ""Memento"" doesn't seem to have the lasting power that say, ""The Godfather"" or ""Star Wars"" does. Anyways.... my point is that once the hype dies and people on both sides of the spectrum cool down a little -- both the homophobic haters and the people pushing their agenda -- is anyone really going to remember this? Ya know, when I check Netflix every week, they have a big section dedicated to gay/lesbian film. You're telling me that no one has ever made a movie like this? I guess the difference is this was the first gay project that was actually able to pull in big name directors and actors. After all, the Oscars don't seem to take you serious until you sign a few household names.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"I saw the two Oscar favorites, and my own vote goes to Crash.","Brokeback Mountain, in spite of being a gay-themed film, did not move me the way Crash does.I can think of several possible reasons for this--other than the intrinsic merits of these films. In random order: The accents (I think I did not understand one-third of the dialogue) in BM, its slow pace, and the fact that I have seen enough closeted men up-close so that I look at most of them with a clinical detachment.Crash is also a tension-filled drama compared to BM's dry love story. The former leaves you with some hope, while BM leaves me, as a gay man, neither seething with anger at the homophobia (too subtle) nor does it make me cry buckets. I am not a fan of violence in film but here it was too fleeting to either hurt or outrage me (the way I was outraged by the violation of a woman's body in Crash). I would instead prefer the docu on the Matthew Shepard case (The Laramie Project).To me Crash is not just about racial prejudice but also a comment on America's gun culture. I have no knowledge about the situation in the States, but I know that enough discrimination exists on the individual level and there is enough violence involving guns to make them alive issues--they may disappear from the public radar but they do not go away. BM's flag for the gay issue is too underplayed for my liking.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Breathtakingly Beautiful--It Will Leave You Inspired,"This movie has been on my mind since I saw it. I can't get the longing of the characters out of my head. I truly wanted these characters to be together. I truly felt for these characters as well. I am not gay, but I have felt this type of pain while loving a man that I cannot be with. Due to pressures of family, friends, and society, I too chose not to pursue my one true love and passion. I definitely have identified with the characters in that way. I can only imagine what it would be like to be in the situation the characters were in while gay in those times. Living a life of turmoil and not doing anything about it because of society's pressures must be so terrible to say the least.This was a gut-wrenching movie between two characters that long to be with one another. Although I don't condone cheating, I do however understand why they did it. It is just a movie after-all. The acting was remarkable. Everyone in the film captured each character perfectly. Heath Ledger definitely captured Ennis. Jake did wonderfully as well. The scenery was breathtaking. I felt each characters pain. I can only hope that come Golden Globe and Oscar time, that this movie is recognized the way it should be.The love scenes were tasteful and only used to convey to the audience the characters feelings. They weren't over-the-top or graphic and were used sparingly. Most HETEROSEXUAL love-scenes are way too graphic and show way too much. They usually focus on the woman and show way too much! It was nice to see the ""jist"" and not have to see naked bodies.Also, I am from Middle America--Minnesota. This movie was only in 4 theaters in all of Minnesota and I am proud to say that the showing I went to was sold out! It is good to see that so many people are open to see a movie that isn't mainstream and IS different. I hope that we continue to move forward. Go see this movie. It will leave you moved, touched, and inspired. I will definitely see this movie again and I am betting that I will like it even more.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the most overrated movies of this decade!,"Motivated by the tons of good reviews of Brokeback Mountain and the man behind it (Ang Lee, of the fantastic Sense and Sensibility and Crouching Tiger...) i watched Brokeback mountain...My god! I'm totally surprised by the hype surrounding this movie! BM is a simple, slow paced, predictable love story. OK, its a gay love story but who cares? Just change the sexual orientation of a character gives a movie all that status? OK, now i will begin to make Gay films and won some Oscars! Speaking seriously, Brokeback Mountain is an ordinary and boring movie. The strong sex scenes with famous actors and convincing roles gave this movie all that notoriety and media but, looking on the neutral movie fan prism, the movie lacks content and power.There's a WHOLE bunch of amazing pictures in 2005 like Cinderella Man, Constant Gardener, Capote, Syriana, Good Night and Good Luck and, specially, Crash.

Beautiful unconventional love movie,"I think this movie deserves all the attention the press and the critic have witnessed. It's the moving story of the struggling, passionate and in someway tragic love between the two cowboys Ennis and Jack.

I'm very glad to see also that Michelle Williams has received the Academy Awards nomination for Best Supporting Actress and I see it as a great achievement for a so young actress who already had a great and serious career.

Best Picture of the Year,"Brokeback Mountain is the kind of movie that stays with you long after you have stopped viewing it. Ennis and Jack, the two main characters, are thrown together in the summer of '63, tending to sheep on Brokeback Mountain. One thing leads to another and both are forever changed. I know some have completely oversimplified this movie as a ""gay cowboy"" movie, but that is so far from the core of it. BBM is a love story, an epic one, which has never been done in gay themed movies (usually movies with gay characters as the focal point do not span anywhere near 20 years). It deservingly is the most acclaimed film of the year and should have been named best picture of the year by the academy, but who cares what they think. The performances are amazing. Heath Ledger is breathtaking. He totally became Ennis Del Mar. The same can be said for Jake Gyllenhaal, who is brilliant as Jack Twist. The supporting cast is also great. I would recommend this movie to anyone, not just fellow members of the gay community, but those who enjoy a movie that is heartbreakingly beautiful and will move you to tears.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The twenty year secret love affair of two cowboys, and how each deals with it in one another's presence, as well as on their own.","It has been almost a week since I went and saw this movie, and I can not get it out of my mind. I feel ownership over the mistakes that the characters made. Their good memories and genuine love soften the edge on a bad day for me.I read the short story before I went and saw the movie, and thought that it was incredibly well-written, but I was interested (and somewhat skeptical) to see how a filmmaker was planning on drawing out the action any better than Annie Proulx already had. Obviously from this review, my skepticism was misplaced, and what I found in Ang Lee's vision could be described as nothing less than mournfully captivating.Finally, someone in Hollywood got the notion of a love story right. Refreshing as the Wyoming setting, Ang Lee truly did the story justice, while adding his own insights along the way. This film makes you want to fix what went wrong, mend twenty years of hurt and see the world the film provides continue. 'Brokeback Mountain' makes you a part of the story, even if the characters on the screen can't see you, you certainly feel them.I was pleasantly surprised by Williams' and Hathaway's performances, guiltily, I hadn't expected much from them, but they prove that they are absolutely essential to this film. Quaid creates the quintessential face of bigotry which shocked my previous view of the roles he chose. Gyllenhaal wears every emotion on his sleeve, and despite the film spanning over twenty years, the initial joy and pleasure the audience witnesses in his eyes when he first meets Ennis is never subdued. But Ledger truly makes this movie, I don't believe anyone else could have developed the story in the way he did. Ledger's performance is absolutely heartbreaking.I feel drawn to go see this movie again, but afraid to at the same time. God, the end still makes me ache. Truly haunting...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love Doesn't Always Save Us,"Ang Lee has fashioned a wonderful American fugue from a story by Annie Proulx. Set against the landscape of the stark American West, Brokeback Mountain peers into the hearts of hardscrabble folks caught up in a seething gay love over a 20 year period. Their lives are as stark as the windblown town streets.Two young cowboys come together by chance for a summer job in the mountains watching over sheep. It's boring work, uncomfortable, silent, and in the intense loneliness of their separate lives they one freezing night come together in a tent. The act shocks them both as they struggle with their feelings and what to do.Ennis (Heath Ledger) is the plier-jawed loner who can never connect with anything. He's more surprised by what has happened. Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) seems more ready to accept what he has probably known about himself. But neither man knows what to do. They continue their ""love"" through the summer until the flinty boss (Randy Quaid) catches a glimpse of their shirtless romp. As summer closes, they go their separate ways not knowing anything else to do.Years go by. Ennis marries a dumpy little woman (Michelle Williams) and has has kids. He clings to his nomadic lifestyle. Jack drifts into rodeo and eventually marries also. But the course of their lives is set when Jack sends a postcard and says he's coming through town. Ennis can hardly contain the excitement he has for so long squashed within himself.Their ""fishing trip"" sets the tone for the next 15 years or so as the two men come together when they can because they cannot deny their love for each other. Jack talks about getting a ranch together, but Ennis knows the hard facts of an openly gay life.Ennis seems able to live in this small life with wife and kids and seeing Jack now and then, but Jack seems to wander into occasional gay trysts, more unsatisfied with his normal life. The women never really seem to notice much.The years go by. The men fight and love; they can't give each other up but they can't face the alternative of living together. Fate finally ends their relationship when Ennis gets a postcard returned with ""deceased"" stamped on it by the post office.Ledger is amazing as the uptight Ennis, a man with a huge capacity for love but a man who just can't ever admit his homosexual leanings. Gyllenhaal is a wonder as the softer Jack who tries so hard to do what he thinks the world expects. Both men are so driven by their Western codes of what others will think that they sacrifice their ""true"" loves and live shallow lives on the edges of reality.The film strikes the perfect balance between showing too much and leaving much for the viewer to imagine. So we're left with the image of Ennis cringing as he asks if other people can tell. He wonders if when someone looks at him oddly if they know. His guilt for his man love renders him even more reticent than his usual nature. Jack moves into dangerous territory as he seeks out what Ennis won't give him.Anne Hathaway is good as Jack's wife. Roberta Maxwell is striking in her small role as Jack's mother. Quaid and Williams are also good.But Gyllenhaal and Ledger are front and center here and amazingly avoid all gay stereotypes. Their characters don't change after they realize their gay tendencies. They are who they are. This is a sad and very beautiful film.",,Anonymous,Romance
An epic love story that breaks boundaries,"There is no denying that this movie is a story about two men who fall in love. But simplifying this film to such clichés is to criminally short-change it.I hope viewers going into this film do not have expectations. This film is best viewed when you know as little about it as possible, so I will not go into the details of the story. It is an epic film not because it tells a story of Homeric grandiosity, but on the contrary, it is an epic because it tells a story so grounded, realistic & palatable that no character in the film seems surreal, no emotion seems superficial and no outcome predictable.It is a film that keeps you in suspense precisely because it challenges boundaries and somehow makes you relate with characters that for most people will not be representative of their own sexuality. Because it is non-conventional, the audience relates to characters, not because of the subject matter necessarily, but because no single life is conventional. We all stepped outside of some boundary of our lives, whether to challenge an authority figure like our parents, whether to pursue a career others discouraged us from, or because we fell in love with someone of another ethnicity, race, and yes, same gender.This is, above all, a human story about life, choices & the years that pass. I think this film has had such an impact on the audiences because it has a sentimental quality that reminds us about the years that have passed & choices we made in our own lives. Jake & Ennis are young men at the beginning of the film, only 19 or 20. We then see them move through twenty years of their life and everything that happens, their regrets, thoughts, dreams & their inner struggle. Remember when you wanted to be a writer, but the family needed a steady income and you put in on a backburner while you work as a nurse?This film reminds us about what matters most in our short lives, makes us question the choices we've made & helps us see love as a powerful force we cannot deny. It is a masterpiece that captures life in a raw & real form (doesn't get more raw than cowboys working on the land with sheep & cattle or in the dust & grime of the rodeo). The fact that it does this through an examination of a relationship between two men is entirely secondary to Ang Lee's masterful capture of the tragic brevity of life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rather overrated,"This review is not going to be the heaps of praise that most other reviewers have given this film. Imagine, just for a moment, that it's not a film about a gay love story, but about a 'straight' love story. What's left?Well, it's a story about two people, spanning several decades. The photography is very well done and the opening shots of the outdoors on Brokeback Mountain are very promising... but somehow, I find it very difficult to feel any sympathy for the main characters. They seem self-centered in their actions, and the anti-gay sentiment is never really made felt. It's also a rather slow film, never picking up anywhere. There's no climax, it just... ambles on.In my opinion, the subject matter (which I can only praise, and about which there should be a lot more films) got the better of the perception of Brokeback Mountain. It's not a bad film, not in the least, but a masterpiece? No.In this light, I'm not surprised that it didn't score nearly as well at the Academy Awards as was thought beforehand.However, it does deserve praise for tackling a subject which is still very contentious in the more conservative areas of the world, and for being a film with originality. After all the rehashes, adaptations and sequels, that *is* a relief.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Heart Felt Movie,"Broke Back Mountain is a film that touches your soul.It had so much depth that makes you think that the story is real. The acting was superb. Everyone did such a wonderful job. The ending was sad, but it's just showing you that thats life. I didn't look at it as a gay movie after a while in watching the film. I looked at is as two people loving each other ,but drama was keeping them apart. My favorite part would have to be when jack visited Ennis at his house. It touched my hard. Another part would have to be the end when Ennis visited jack house after his death and saw his shirt that he saved with the blood on it. It almost made me cry. Overall I thought the movie was an A+.

heartbreaking,"After the movie ended, I wasn't very impressed with it. I mean, sure, it was a beautiful story about a forbidden love with a sad closing.

And that's when I found out how heartbreaking the end actually was. And not just the end, the whole story about two people that want to be together but the time and the circumstances are not right is just terrible. And because of people arrogant and stupid thinking, they couldn't live their live as they wished. And god, I felt so lucky because I have the freedom to live the life that I want.

Who could have dreamed that a movie about a couple of ""gay cowboys"" would be so beautifully done and gain such wide and avid acclaim. The director, Ang Lee, must be given much of the credit, as well as the two fine actors you've probably read so much about. And while this story is generally a first for the silver screen, there seems to be no agenda here. It's a tragic story, beautifully told and, since the time period is the early sixties to eighties, it could be linked with another ""gay themed"" film, The Boys in the Band, which was generally denounced by the gay community for portraying gays as a sad group of outcasts. No parties here. No romps in the sands of the Hamptons. Don't go looking for gay porno. There's little actual sex in the film. However, if there are teenagers in the audience, beware of sniggers and a wide variety of audible comments.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brokeback Love Mountain,"Thank u Ang Lee! Everything is beautiful in your movie, the actors in the movie are special. They have been chosen as if they are real guys in the story, Heath Ledger's performance must be seen. I think he should have been taken the Oscar as the best actor and Jake Gyllenhaal is the right decision for the Jack character and at last I can not forget the performance of Michelle Williams, she showed the best shocked person scene ever in the cinema history.

"Don't worry, Brokeback fans","To listen to some critics, Brokeback's loss on Oscar night meant that it wasn't as important, that it was just a nominee, relegating it to an also-ran status in the American consciousness. But, don't worry Brokeback fans, just let history be the judge. Brokeback Mountain was the best film of the year.In the long run, winning on Oscar night doesn't really mean much. Many of the films that we now regard as classics were denied the top prize: Citizen Kane, The Graduate, Bonnie and Clyde, A Clockwork Orange, Star Wars, Psycho, 2001, Saving Private Ryan, and Pulp Fiction-just to name a few. Like these films before it, Brokeback was great because it was different, and, in its own way, revolutionary. It felt IMPORTANT in a way few films do. History has taught us that The Academy isn't always right, and this is one of those times it got it wrong.Brokeback has made an indelible impression on our society. It has brought to the surface a conversation that is often conspicuously absent from our collective dialogue. Whether you wanted to know or not, you've got to admit that you heard a lot about the film. It was everywhere: the TV news, newspaper articles, late night talk show monologues; even President Bush couldn't escape being asked about it. It was hard to go anywhere without hearing some comment about gay cowboys.Take heart in the film's power to move people in a significant way, one way or the other. It rings true, and for some people that was a little scary. It seems to me that that is the best possible judge of a film's greatness. Ang Lee and his cast were able to truly capture the essence of Ennis and Jack, and the characters they created are destined to become landmarks of American cinema. For those who appreciated it, the film meant far more than Crash's superficial stylishness ever could. No statue changes that.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Brilliant, Haunting, Enduring Classic","Twenty years hence no one will remember - let alone remember fondly - the juvenile tantrum of 'Crash'; but twenty years hence people will remember, and still more people will for the first time see and hear and be profoundly moved by, 'Brokeback Mountain.' In every way 'Brokeback' is a superior film; in every way it dwarfs all the other films of 2005; it's a brilliant achievement in timeless, enduring cinematic storytelling possessed of all the classical complexity and power of love tragically denied and self-denied and, ultimately, it ends with the beginning, the hope, of love redeemed.Ennis Del Mar - Ennis of the Sea - evolves, he changes for the better, he emerges, he moves from the inchoate, turgid soup of the sea to plant his feet on terra firma whence his love finds its roots and begins to branch out, to embrace his daughter's love for him and for her betrothed, and his love for them. Ennis holds onto, and the rest of his life's heartbeats depend from, the tragic talisman of his bloodied shirt, because it is his passport - and this enduring film's timeless, classical metaphor for tragedy - to the sublime which, in Jack's and his life, was not to be theirs.In twenty years time people will still be moved by, and they will continue to ache from and to love, 'Brokeback Mountain.'",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A profile of Ennis Del Mar, born in the wrong era to openly express his feelings for another man.","I first saw this movie about 6 years ago, since then it has come under very much scrutiny from critics and fans alike. There are any number of interpretations of everything that happens in the story, and there are over 2300 user reviews right here on the IMDb. So I will not pretend to add anything new, however I am choosing to look at the story almost exclusively from the character that Heath Ledger plays so well, Ennis Del Mar. The following comments reflect my own points of view and I make no claims that anyone else should embrace them.The story starts in 1963 when Ennis is around 19 or 20. He is just a poor young cowboy looking for some summer work and he becomes one of a two-person team to look after and protect a large herd of sheep grazing on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming. Ennis is shy and hardly ever says more than the minimum, but he is engaged to a nice young lady and they plan to marry in the fall.The other young cowboy is Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist. Jack was occupying the tent and cooking, and Ennis would pitch a small tent and sleep among the sheep, riding back to the camp every afternoon to eat. One fateful afternoon it was beginning to get dark before Ennis left, so he decided to sleep near the camp fire under a blanket. But even in the summer it gets very cold at elevation, and on this night Jack eventually talked a shivering Ennis into the tent. Jack made a move, pulling Ennis' arm over him where Ennis discovered Jack in an aroused state. Initially recoiling in great surprise, soon Ennis and Jack consummated their new friendship.It is important to keep in mind this is a work of fiction, so as a viewer we are required to quickly evaluate plausibility. From my vantage point, it is ONLY plausible if Ennis is homosexual deep to his core, otherwise he would have pulled away and rejected Jack's advances. He could not have ""become homosexual"" that night in the tent. (We know from later scenes that Jack was indeed homosexual and regularly sought other men, and even male prostitutes when that was his only option.)So this created a great conundrum for Ennis, he knew from some childhood experiences and guidance from his father, being known to be homosexual will probably get you killed in short order. So when the summer was over and Jack went away, even though Ennis was in deep sorrow he went ahead with his marriage. Over the years he had two daughters to whom he showed much fatherly affection. But he never really loved his wife, he performed his ""husbandly duty"" but his thoughts were always with Jack, and looking forward to their next meeting, which might have been weeks or might have been years.The story ends around 1983, and we see a scene of his oldest daughter, Alma Jr. talking to Ennis about her upcoming marriage. But Ennis is a broken man. He is long divorced, his wife knowing fully that he and Jack weren't really going fishing on all those trips over the years. Jack has died, perhaps from injury when a tire exploded as Jack's wife Lureen told him over the phone, or perhaps at the hands of several men who beat him to death, as we see in what appears to be a dream scene. Ennis is not like Jack, looking for another man, and he has no interest in looking for another wife. He was born in a time when he could not be who he really was, and he wasn't successful at pretending to be someone else.Ennis's last words in the film are ""Jack, I swear"" as he is holding the old bloody shirt that had been hanging in Jack's closet for some years. It was the only thing he had left that he could touch and smell. There has been considerable discussion of what that phrase meant, but to me it is very clear. That phrase was used regularly where I grew up in the 1950s and 1960s. It was always used in a sense of exasperation, an all-encompassing phrase with a sigh which sums up everything and yet nothing of what might have just happened. For Ennis it was the unfortunate or fortunate, depending on how one wants to look at it, meeting of Jack which made his life everything it is, yet with nothing at all now to hold onto.Randy Quaid is good as the sheep herding boss, Joe Aguirre. He observed the two men through high-powered binoculars, he knew what was going on. Michelle Williams is good as Ennis' wife Alma. Anne Hathaway is good as Lureen Newsome .",,Anonymous,Romance
Inert gay cowboy drama,"Overyhyped inert drama with (sometimes!) good perfomances by the main actors. The ending is decent. I guess the book might a be a more interesting read. Mediocre for me, but I do understand why some people just love it... it has a certain vibe to it, a vibe not so cool today as it was in 2005. We've gotten way too many ""gay-related"" dramas in the last decade so movies like this don't hit home anymore,.. at least for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
movie needs an active watcher,"The acting brilliance was in the silence. Heath Ledger was amazing. I don't care what the topic was, whether or not is was a love story, acting without words the way he did was second to none. One of the greatest on screen performances that I have ever seen. Now as far as the narrow minded people who think that two men falling in love and having sex is too taboo for a motion picture, you are all too out of focus to be judging an artistic film like this anyways. Stick to commenting on action flicks, and I stress flicks because they are not films in the historical sense of the word, like the matrix. A film doesn't have to be full of attention grabbing dialogue and witty comebacks to be a great film. I am sorry that DelMar didn't say ""eat this"" before he punched Jack out. This was one of the most honest, and humble films that caught emotion better than any I have ever seen. This film doesn't take a stand or try to give you some fake over the top theme. The fact that the emotions are implied and not spelled out for the watcher force you to think and have some empathy for the characters. It is painfully obvious that some of us do not have that ability.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"It is not the words that are said, it's the words that are left unsaid","Brokeback Mountain is said to be a ""gay-cowboy""-movie. That is not completely true. It is true that the main characters in the movie are cowboys, and that they fall in love with each other, but that is not everything. This story could be of anyone. But it is of two men in love.Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger) is a shy young guy who gets a job herding sheep for a summer in Brokeback Mountain, with Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) as a partner. One cold night they end up drunk and in a same tent, and make love. This is where the love story begins. After the summer both men go separate directions, get married and get children, but they never forget each other. Then one day after four years they meet again and there is no turning back.Brokeback Mountain is emotionally packed, powerful movie. It left me feeling blown up for a day at least. Only few movies do that to me, that they really get into my head and don't let go. Brokeback Mountain did that. It is not so much of the things that are said in the movie, that get you. It is the things that are left unsaid. And it is not only the things that are shown in the movie that get you. It is the things that are left unshown.It was interesting to notice how big erotic impact a movie like this can have. I have no desire to see real gay sex, but seeing these two strong men hugging each other, kissing each other after many years of separation, I was totally stunned.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are amazing in this movie. They are brave men who take this kind of role that has the possibility of making them immortal and take them to the top actors' league, but also possibility of marking them with the ""gay"" stamp forever. Both were just fantastic. Of the minor roles, Michelle Williams as Ennis' wife Alma actually shines in her role. When Alma witnesses his husband kissing a guy, she is heart broken, but keeps everything for herself.Ang Lee really knows how to make ""pretty pictures"" (for example Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). Every single frame of the movie was a work of art in itself. The stunning scenery, colours and the people, everything was just perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
mediocre film,"This film was not even the best cowboy movie of the year (THREE BURIALS OF MELQUIADES ESTRADA), nor was it the best gay-themed film of the year (MYSTERIOUS SKIN), so I was very surprised to find out that it got the nod for representing both categories at the Academy Awards in its nominee for Best Picture. It begins slow, goes in the middle slow, and outs slow, and we see a decent story unfold occasionally, but most of the time the men talk about their passion and it taking hold, etc. It is a generally safe movie, not especially creative or exciting, and it has some strong things to say, but all of these have been said and better. A few things that stuck with me: the effect their relationship had on their other family members was heartbreaking to watch, and the way that the two men split apart. Their love did not come across very well, and while the film has a lot to do about sex, it isn't all that sexy.A well done film. An occasionally heartbreaking film. But a flat and disjointed film. Yes, it was pretty to watch, etc., but it didn't do it for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A short story in a long film,"Few movies have gay characters in mains roles. And gays are very often not shown as people but in stead as stereotypes like the screaming hairdresser or sex maniacs.It's very uplifting when an A-list director takes the challenge and make a gay movie.Ang Lee made several brilliant movies and once before he made a fabulous comedy with gay themes, the wedding banquet. Thats why I looked forward to enjoy the sad love story of to cowboys in Wyoming.Technically the movie is fantastic and the scenery is brilliant filmed. The acting also is quite good.Brokeback Mountain is very long, actually much to long. The story could have been written on the back of a stamp, so short it is. The film totally lacks intensity. The characters are not interesting at all.

Masterpiece!,"I don't know if anyone will ever be able to top this film in the gay genre.

You know those movies that just made you believe the characters were real and you can't stop thinking about their ""life""? This managed to do it.I humbly bow to the director, Ang Lee.

It may have created ripples in the society.

It hits the bottom of your heart,"Being a movie which is rated R in States and having a controversial theme which talks about unrecognised love in most of countries worldwide, Brokeback Mountain does make itself extraordinary like the weather Ennis and Jack had in Brokeback Mountain. Ang Lee is a director who pays a lot of attention to details, not only the soundtrack of the music but the details of the emotional and verbal part of the movie. The movie starts with the word 'sh*t' (UK version, sound excluded), ended with 'Jack, I swear...'. The montage at the last meet of Ennis and Jack makes all the past twenty years even miserable. How could they love each other so much that they could stand the same mountain and activities only 2-3 times a year? Yet it's not only about the forbidden love (used-to-be). In 'Friends', that Ross married a lesbian is a sense of humor. Here, when we saw what happened to Alma when she discovered and how she tried to rescue their marriage. It's such a miserable thing to admit that we have to live under the masks.The scenes shoot at Brokeback are incredibly beautiful and the whole cast is quite successful especially with the couple Heath and Michelle. It gets more intense in the later half of the movie since you know the reality is always worse than our thoughts. It is a sad love story with a powerful ending. Everything stops there at the right time to hit the bottom of your heart without touching it. You'd cry aloud but couldn't do so because you are trapped into the deep thoughts about your own life/relationship or whatever. Will you keep your commitment? Time will tell.

I thought the subject matter was very interesting but I think that a little more could have been done with it. Maybe I was expecting too much after hearing and reading others comments. I did like the scenery very much and the over all look of the movie, but at times I reached for the remote control thinking I would skip ahead to something interesting. I endured it without skipping ahead and I am not unhappy about that, but I did wonder at times...is this movie nearly over?? I had hoped for a different ending ( can't say too much and spoil it for others ) and I guess the ending we got was what life is like.

A hauntingly beautiful love story that will stay with you!,"I entered the screening of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN with the most open of minds and left emotionally drained. When a movie can do that to you, then you know you have been deeply entertained. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN has been constantly referred to as a 'gay cowboy' film, but that unfortunate label doesn't even begin to describe the film.In their star-making & Oscar-nominated performances, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal portray Ennis & Jack, two sheepherders hired to watch over a flock of sheep on the movie title's mountain. The two men are polar opposites - Ennis is the mumbly, quiet chain-smoker engaged to be married while Jack is the younger, idealistic one. One cold night, Jack has Ennis sleep in the tent so Ennis doesn't freeze and from that point the real story begins. The attraction the two men feel is foreign and scary to both of these good ol' boys. Their physical encounter is passionate & aggressive - something Jack & Ennis have never experienced with others. It is on this night that the men form their 'bond' - a love for one another that cannot be spoken of to others, yet they deny themselves the chance to be together. The fateful day comes when their jobs end and both men go their separate ways and attempt to live 'normal lives. Ennis marries Alma and has 2 girls; Jack also ties the knot and sires a son. Over the course of 20 years, the men meet up and unify their bond. Of course, with any great love story ultimately comes tragedy...To label BROKEBACK the 'gay cowboy' film is ludicrous, in my opinion. This is a film of raw human emotion, pure and simple. Everyone wants love - everyone wants to be in love. The love between Jack and Ennis is tangible and powerful, yet these two plain ordinary men cannot explain it, even to themselves. Their actual conversations are few and far between, but in the case of Ennis, his silence speaks volumes! The performances in this film is really what blew me away. Heath Ledger is a revelation - his Ennis Del Mar is a tortured soul, a man who cannot have the love he wants. Jake Gyllenhaal is very good in the less showy role of Jack Twist. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway are dead-on as the respective wives of Ennis and Jack.This movie deserves its long life! As the film's tag line says - ""Love is a Force of Nature"". I will carry this movie with me for a long time to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Let me just check my watch...,"I should have guessed from the first six or so minutes of the movie. We see Ennis (Heath Ledger) arrive at the head ranchers office first. He looks around, stands by the door, and waits. A minute or so passes. Then, Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) drives up in rather rickety truck. He gets out, shares a glance with Ennis, and gets back in the truck. More time passes. There was a point during this rather overly extended scene where I thought that the store had screwed up and given me a copy of ""Waiting for Godot"". But as soon as the owner (Randy Quaid) shows up, I put those negative thoughts to rest. It's sure to pick up soon, I reflected rather naively.Unfortunately for me, the entire movie runs like that introductory scene. It is verrrrry slooooow. Normally, I can sit through movies like this. There are a few that I have come to respect despite their leisurely pace. Not this one, though. Portions of this movie run like they've been dipped in molasses. I must admit, there are some portions that movie extremely fast; to whit, the relationship between the two. How do two people proceed from idle chit-chat to emotional and physical love without some intervening steps? I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure meaningful relationships don't work that way. One-night stands yes, deep connections no.I can't really fault this film for trying. The makers of ""Brokeback"" shot for a rather high goal and I applaud them for doing so. The message of love and acceptance is an outstanding one, and everyone in the world would be a lot better off if they realized that just those with alternative lifestyles are no threat to the status quo just because of whom they love. That's a great message. The movie... not so much.Considering that I've only seen this movie once and walked out before the ending, my review might not be the best critique around. But I'm willing to be fair. At the very least, as fair as I could possible be under the circumstances. I'm going to give this movie one last try, but I'm not holding my breath; mainly because I could pass out from oxygen deprivation during those longer scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Love is a human emotion,"Brokeback mountain is not only a movie about love, is movie where many identify by living a love that has to be hidden in order to stay together. A love so powerful that is willing to set aside boundaries and obstacles that might come along the way. Brokeback mountain how love has not barriers, how it could be felt in so many ways and express itself without the restriction of a society, or even gender.This masterpiece will me remembers trough out time as the very first movie who made it to the academy nominations, recognitions from several state critics societies and then some. Brokeback Mountain started in only 100 screens in the US. By the en d of the first month this number in creased radically.It is a shame that people like Jack and Ennis are forced to live a double life just to fulfill society's rules. They are forced to get married, sometimes they end up having children causing the marital partner and children to suffer when the truth is reveal. Gay love could still be considered as forbidden in may areas of the country. The main attribution of this movie is to prove that love is a human emotion therefore it cannot be categorized into gay or straight.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another power of love,"I had a chance to see Brokeback Mountain last night. The result was I have fallen for the movie. I think that the movie simply tells another love story but this time it chooses to focus on love that happens between 2 men under a circumstance of tough lives and massively limited acceptance from the society. Nevertheless, the story is not somehow considered a forbidden love.There are so many scenes in the movie that were so captivating and made me cry considering by magnificent and talented performances of the main characters showing animal desire and reluctant feelings of hesitantly knowing yourself and their what-is-the-right-thing-to-do justifications. While supporting roles like their wives who are unintentionally victimized by the can't-help-it bond of manhood also help oppress this contradictory love amongst the concerned parties. Even though many have found the portrayal develops in a slow move but as the movie goes by, most feel that it constantly reveals stronger and clearer symbol that ultimately takes you to the climax of the movie.The element of the movie powerfully repeats the fact that ""your heart is an uncontrollable organ of your body"" and ""love can happen between any different race, any different religion and of course between the same sex"".Brokeback Mountain is not really talking about sex between 2 guys but it is about love between 2 human beings. This equates to ""love is a force of nature"".If you give it a shot by not discriminating against gay people or not over-imagining that this is a guy on guy porno, this movie is another heartbreaking, tragically devastating love story that will make you feel very emotional. In my opinion, the final scene where Ennis says "" Jack, I swear."" is the most painful moment of the movie.I personally rate the movie for an A. If asked why ? it' s because of 2 things; 1. As a gay man, this love story hurts so bad. 2. As a moviegoer, this flick hurts so good!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Captivating, Gutwrenching... and Perfect","No 2+ hr. movie has ever held my absolute attention and summoned such deep, raw emotion. Brokeback Mountain deserves a 10 in my view because I've never been more moved. Unrequited love just happens to hit close to heart, but this was as much a beautiful story as it was heartbreaking. I thought the direction, acting and photography was Oscar-worthy. Jake Gyllenhaal was great, but Heath Ledger was brilliant. This goes down as one of the best movies I've ever seen because the story is so strong and gripping. This story is also ground-breaking! There is no other motion picture that comes close. Two guys in Wyoming find each other and live out a 20 year under-current of passion and longing for each other while living separate lives eventually succumb to homophobia, ignorance, and crippling fear.

Does Jack 's  love strong enough ?,This movie was good . But I just could not understand why Jack's love for Ennis( which was strong as the story tells us ) could not change Ennis even after a span of 20 ys ( that is too long).If Jack loved Ennis so much & and could do anything for him (to the extend of leaving their families & living together)why did he or his love not change the mind set of Ennis. Ennis knew all about Jack's love and still took him for granted .If Ennis had changed gradually things would have been different. I think Jack and Ennis should have talked about issues which separated them from each other for so long.......the movie revolved around physical attraction and nothing was shown/ felt regarding emotions...... Ang lee direction 8/10 .landscape and ambiance perfect 10 (esp for a love story ) but relationship between Jack and Ennis just 5/10....In any relation(esp with ur lover)U have to respect and understand that person on his /her grounds.Love and life is beautiful...u just have to let it grow.....,6.0,Anonymous,Romance

But he did.Don't get me wrong: this is a very solid movie, which manages to appeal to everyone, although it would seem at first that it is hard to relate to (unless you are a gay cowboy in the closet). The story is moving, the cinematography fantastic, and all of the actors performing at an amazing level.It's just that Heath Ledger is one notch above everyone else.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Of Mice and Men revisited,"Brokeback Mountain (2005), directed by Ang Lee, is based on a New Yorker short story by E. Annie Proulx, and has a screenplay by Larry McMurtry. Although Lee is Chinese, he appears to have a good feel for the western U.S., and, of course, both Proulx and McMurtry have demonstrated their expertise in portraying this region.The story is well known to everyone--two young men have a same-sex love relationship that persists after each has a wife and children. The point of the story is that this love is difficult to display in the best of circumstances, and impossible to display in their circumstances.The problem with this film for me is that the only memorable aspect of both men is their love for each other. Other than their hidden love, they don't demonstrate any positive characteristics--intelligence, honesty, or kindness. Each man makes his wife unhappy, and neither is a satisfactory parent.The tragedy of this film is that two lives that could have been happy are robbed of the possibility of happiness. This reflects a societal problem that I consider a disgrace. Moreover, their unhappiness causes unhappiness in others that spreads out in a ripple effect.One problem for me is that I thought the film was uncharitable to both wives. The film presented them as obstacles to happiness, while I thought they should have been considered as victims of the same forces to which their husbands were subjected. (Incidentally, Michelle Williams was outstanding in the thankless role as one of the wives.)Brokeback Mountain is an important movie about an important theme. However, I would have enjoyed this film more if it had been about characters for whom I had more affection.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is a fake,"I really do not understand what's the fuss about. This is a very mediocre boring movie. The only fact that makes it so prominent is that two protagonists are cowboys and they are gays. They cannot do anything with this. They don't do anything with this. They just lead their boring, more then ordinary life ant that's it. But actually I don't need homosexual cowboys to observe all of this. I already have Bill Murray in Broken Flowers and Lost in Translation for this purpose. And definitely his way of doing nothing is much more convincing. And definitely it's not the only example.Love? Roger Ebert says this could be a story of two women or two people of conflicting religions. Right: this could be a story of anything! And of nothing at the same time. The story needs personality, it's got to be personalized, in other case it's just a piece of wasted time.PS I would like to add something to this. First, I am not a homophobe, I feel fabsolutely free communicating with people of all kinds. Second, I truly admire previouse Ang Lee's works considering him one of the most amazing directors ever. But talking of this movie I cannot even say it's the worst one. Most of 'the worst' movies are the funniest ones (like Peter Jackson's Bad Taste, etc.) It's just boring and useless. Do we see the most outstanding pictures of nature? Nope. Is this the most touching drama? Nope. Do the actors work at their best? Remember any of Al Pacino's or DeNiro's or amybody else's of that kind role and admit: no.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romance and tragedy in the mountains...,"I live in a small regional town, and there was talk of banning this film in the local cinema. I'm very pleased that this obstacle was overcome and it screened. Even if for a somewhat limited time.I had heard a lot of passing comment and read a few non-spoiler reviews on this film, and really didn't know what to expect. From what I'd read I was fully expecting a fast paced, crass gay-cowboy flick with such overdone and rough sex scenes that it would simply paint a horrid picture of the relationship these two men develop.Happy to say, my misguided thoughts were quickly washed away. This movie is full of beautiful vistas and magic scenery. Thumbs up for cinematography. The sex whilst character-true, is quite tame and certainly doesn't monopolize the screen, there is a great balance between full-on heated romance, and relaxing and enjoying the world.Heath and Jake do a fantastic job of believable 'get-in-and-get-it-done' honest hard working cowboys. They develop the characters bond for each other well. There are a few sneaking glances and smiles that are so cute when you realize these boys are out there in the freezing cold nights, and are trying to uphold the rugged manly image that would be expected of them.Both characters show emotion well, and Heath does well at holding back so much throughout the film.Towards the end you really take in the tragedy underlying the story. They never truly live their own lives, their own lives are always in secret and never shared with friends and family because of what is socially expected of them. The women in their lives suffer directly as a result of societies expectations, because they to are living a false life with no hope for true happiness.Jack always talks about what they could have together if they could just ignore everyone else. Too often their time spent together ends in anger and you are left wishing there was just so much more time for these boys to enjoy life...I hope people watch this movie and learn what social barriers and intolerance can inflict on others. Let people live _thier_ lives, and get on with your own.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
a rare gem,"In 1963, two strangers, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist are looking for work. Both find work herding sheep for Joe Aguirre on Brokeback Mountain. Both men are completely different from each other, Ennis is extremely introverted and emotionally isolated, not connecting to others through his mumbled words. Jack is open and self confident, with inspirations of glory on the rodeo scene. Over the days stuck in the isolated mountain range, their friendship makes a strong connection between them, soon becoming a highly intimate and emotionally charged relationship. When the season is over, returning to humanity, they both go their separate ways. Ennis marries his fiancé Alma and have two girls, while Jack tries the rodeo with little success, though soon meets Lureen both marrying with a baby boy soon to follow.Brokeback Mountain is one of those exceptional films that come ever so rarely, that instantly marks itself in history. The emotional manipulation is wielded so strong that its hard not to be swept up in the emotionally charged relationship of Ennis and Jack. While Ennis is happiest with Jack, he understands the ramification of public scrutiny, which Jack fails to understand, not wanting a hidden life. Taking the brunt end are Jack and Ennis's wives, stuck in their empty, impassioned marriages, constantly questioning themselves and the nature of Jack and Ennis's friendship.The subtlety of Ang Lee's direction reveals the beauty of Brokeback Mountain. Lee superbly connects the dilemmas of the characters and the landscapes they wonder. The breath taking, sweeping, remote landscape of the Wyoming Mountains, brilliantly captured by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, are so lush and alluring that your uncontrollably drawn in. Brokeback Mountain could not have been placed in the hands of another director, Lee never being didactic while shooting you right into the heart of the film. While set in the open plains of the mountain, the story is so emotionally suffocating. The claustrophobia is tautly constructed by Ang Lee, tightly grabbing you and never letting go.The truth and honesty is the real distinguishing facet of Brokeback Mountain. Never does the story feel artificial or unrealistic. The themes are so universal of love stories, perfectly depicting unrequested love; where everything doesn't work out and doesn't end happy. Enahncing this is the somber, mellow acoustic guitar, constantly encapsulating the heart break and angst between Ennis and Jack.Nothing short of exceptional can describe Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal performances. Never have both actors been so revelatory in their career so far. Heath Ledger perfectly embodies the introversion and depth of Ennis. Ledger wonderfully shows the change of Ennis over the twenty year period the film takes. Jake Gyllenhaal does an equally brilliant performance, vividly bringing the angst and heartbreak to Jack. While it is the male actors that are center stage, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway are both sorely overlooked. Michelle Williams is outstanding, with her shining above Ledger and Gyllenhaal. Williams is so dramatically charged, giving her career defining performance. While she has a minor role, Anne Hathaway is great as Lureen, finishing the perfect touch of brilliant casting.Deserving of all the accolades it's given, Brokeback Moutain is a heart breaking love story like no other. It's simple perfect in every way.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very accurate and moving,"Having grown up in Alberta (yes, full of intolerant red-necks as well), I got an amazing sense of an accurate representation of time, people and place while watching Brokeback Mountain. I understand that this movie was filmed in Alberta and not Wyoming, but that's not really a bad thing. I thought the screenplay was brilliant and the dialogue was very close to much of what I experienced growing up. I feel the casting was well chosen, and the performances dealt with the issue of homosexuality in the best of taste. I was surprised that at a Friday afternoon matinée, the theatre was 3/4 full, and my guess is that less than 1/2 the people there were gay. Decades ago theatres were very strict regarding movie ratings & ID, so I had to 'sneak-in"" to see ""Love Story"". I remember that when the Ali McGraw character died (some would argue the worst actress of all time), half the theatre erupted into applause! Conversely, while watching Brokeback Mountain there was audible whimpering throughout the theatre at many times during the movie. When Brokeback Mountain ended and the credits came up - the audience sat motionless for many minutes - not out of disgust, but because people seemed to be trying to compose themselves - before they carried on with their daily lives. Brokeback Mountain presented genuine characters as their lives evolved over time, and brought the audience to become engrossed in their struggles, love, and poignant heartache. Brokeback Mountain is film-making at its best!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"If you will not understand what love is all about after watching this, heaven help you.","I have yet to be touched so deep by a movie. It was so profound am hoping it will serve as a lesson to all those who choose to be judge mental that when you love, you love regardless of sex. I come from a country where majority of the people are very close-minded. On many occasions, I have tried to convince my own friends about the importance of understanding without bias. This movie will serve as a stepping stone, I hope. Last night as I watched, there was laughter in my little home; tears, shock, remorse and deep sadness. I was with them right back there at broke back mountain. Having beans for breakfast... I will watch it time and time again for as long as I live. Its amazingly beautiful.. As I type this mail, tears are rolling down my cheeks and my colleague across is thinking I have gone insane. I have placed a large poster in the office for all to see. Brokeback mountain is the bomb. Keep up the good work.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best actors who could handle this role,"Not only does the film not consider the formation of this relationship to be strange, but with this sentence at the beginning of the formation of the sexual relationship in the tent that (there is nothing else that comes to our mind here) it completes the argument for us. This relationship seems to be over with a simple goodbye between Jack and Ennis after finishing the shepherding job, but the meeting of these two people after a few years upsets all the calculations. Now they both have families and children and live in two American states that are 14 hours apart on average, but this distance does not prevent Jack and Ennis from meeting each other monthly. The screenplay shows Jack much more eager, while Ennis is shown as a realistic person, and this makes us not understand until the end of the movie if Ennis had the same desire as much as Jack was eager to reach and live with Ennis. Or not... the sequence where Ennis prefers his daughters to Jack or the part where Ennis is willing to give up a shepherding course for his daughter's wedding if he didn't do it to see Jack makes the opinion stronger that with this Despite everything, Enis sees a future in her daughters that is less in her relationship and life with Jack. The script moves on the border between confirming and denying this relationship. In one part, it depicts the pressure caused by the distance between these two, and in another part, it shows us the cries and depression of Anis's wife. In the middle of the night in the mountains, Brokeback (lust) shows us that it leads to interest and four years later, other angles of this interest. Family and friends about the sexual relationship between two men, but should we really ignore the ugliness of this relationship?",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Powerful, Numbing","I just saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) to a packed house (with Ang Lee present for today's screening). And I have to say, it absolutely transfixed me and was worth the watch. Out of 24 movies I screened at the TIFF this year, this was the only one I rated a 10/10! Three things really stood out for me making this a stand-out of a film:1) HONESTY: Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal really pulled this off. I wasn't expecting performances so real and nuanced, and was warmly surprised. Kudos, also, to Mr. Lee for making such a poignant and refreshingly honest film!2) STORY: Great story-telling. In fact you're not actually being *told* a story. The story unfolds and the viewer watches what happens pulling you in. What a great experience! In fact, I want to experience this story again -- I'm going to look for the short story.3) NUMBING: In a thought-provoking kind of way. I left the theatre digesting the story even as I sat on the streetcar thinking about the characters. I cared for them, and wondered what could/might happen to them after the screen went black. My mind was playing out scenarios and in that sense, it was numbing, in a thought-provoking, emotionally heavy way.This is powerful cinema and is definitely worth checking out. It's the best Ang Lee film I've seen to date (I've seen most, but not all of his feature films).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The ultimate portrayal of 75% of America - IDIOTS,"First off, let me say, this is NOT a homophobic post. I felt like I needed to say that for those people who aren't the best listeners/readers and can't figure out on their own.This movie is the perfect portrayal of 75% of the people in America - IDIOTS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO STRUCTURE OUT A HEALTHY FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES. That was one of the best things about the movie though - is how it kept hammering down on the point that IF YOU DENY WHO YOU REALLY ARE, AND DON'T DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT TO BE DOING WITH YOUR LIFE - THEN YOUR LIFE IS GOING TO GET MESSED UP. (aka you're gonna upset people, you're gonna be unhappy and missing something inside and it's going to show, and you'll end up alone and miserable).The movie was extremely hard to enjoy while viewing, because almost every character in the movie was an annoying, brainless hillbilly. During the first section of the movie, when they're actually up on the mountain, it had me wondering ""what the heck motivated these guys to want to do this movie?"". Not just because they aren't gay in real life and have to get all gay (like really intensely gay) up on each other, but because aside from the intense making out and BF'ing, they are just a couple of BORING LOSERS. Who wants to spend their life herding sheep on a mountain? Day and night? And especially in the 60's - possibly the most amazing decade in our history??? Get a LIFE!!!Jake Gyllenhaal's character was really gross anyways. I don't really get it. If I was gay, and was going to love someone over Michelle Williams and my 2 daughters, it'd have to be a pretty hot dude like Kevin Barnes or that Shane dude from The L Word.Anyways, the movie really picks up once they get off the mountain and get married and we start watching their lives go by at like a YEAR PER MINUTE. it's impossible to have a bad movie when you are seeing only the entertaining stuff in a couple of people's lives. There was a massive amount of foreshadowing, which made things easy to call out but none of the scenarios were ever too cliché - they were all entertaining and effective.I am still surprised it won Best Picture, but it's a very solid and very different movie. All performances were solid - Heath Ledger was great, Michelle Williams was perfect, Gylenhaal was crazy and wildly entertaining but still extremely unattractive, Quaid was believable in his role, annnnd Anne Hathaway was surprisingly awesome in her part. I still think they should have picked someone else to play Donnie Darko's part...JACK TWIST?!??!?!Congrats Ang Lee - your HULK was really bad... way to recover!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wow! Nice,"While the performances are uniformly fantastic, nothing can quite prepare the mind for the work that Heath Ledger provides. As an actor prone to overcompensating, Ledger's Ennis is a man of decidedly few words, yet is a thunderstorm of heartache on the inside. This is quite literally a full-bodied performance, using all of Ledger as Ennis thrashes about watching his life fall apart due to his self-loathing, distance, and towering regret. Unable to give himself over to his feelings, Ennis's heart withers and dies, only witnessing moments of happiness with Jack, which allows him to be the man he wants to be without fear of judgment. Saying Ledger is Oscar-worthy here isn't strong enough: this is a career-best performance, and a crucial element to the necessary feeling of frustration that powers the film",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A tragic love story - give me a break.,"I am still trying to understand the appeal of Brokeback Mountain. Here is a movie about two men who have sex during a stint of watching a flock of sheep. Then they go on to marry (women), have children, and, instead of being faithful to their wives and families, meet every so often to have sex. They talk about getting a place together but never have the ""you know whats"" to be honest to themselves and families. Therefore they remain in their marriages, making everyone miserable. I do not recall ever hearing the word ""love"" from either one to the other. The only phrase remotely in that ballpark was, ""I wish I knew how to quit you"". I am sorry but these two are selfish, cowardly, and unable to control their physical attraction. Just because their relationship lasted years doesn't make it love. If they were that much in love, they should have been honest and made a life together instead of destroying others.The scenery and music seems to give this movie much more credence than it really deserves. The real tragedy is the hype surrounding it. I rate it a 2 for the mountains and music.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
different versions of Brokeback Mountain,"Brokeback Mountain was amazing. I am not going to try to top some of the wonderful reviews here, but I did want to make a comment. I was moved enough by the movie to see it a second time (this never happens) and went to see it at a different theater. I was shocked, though, that it seemed like a different version. And there were definitely differences in the tent scenes between Ennis and Jack. There were other differences, too, but the tent scenes had the most striking differences. I didn't know if this was for a specific reason or not...but it made a difference. So, I certainly recommend seeing this movie, but I can't help but wonder if different people are seeing different versions.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The best movie in years!,"I was not sure about going to see the movie Brokeback Mountian, but I could not stay away. Opening day I was one of the first at a theater 2 hours away from my home, waiting to get the best seat and watch the 2 hour and 14 minute movie. I had never seen either of the two main actors before. About five minutes into the movie when Jake Gyllenaal appeared, I knew I had picked a winner!This movie is more then about the yearning of these two men for one another. It is about the yearning that most of us have in our hearts for something different in our lives. It is a movie that makes you think about turns that you made in your life and where your life has eventually lead.The acting is magnificent and the direction and writing perfect. Thank you for a wonderful movie, one that I will watch again over and over and one that I will want to own.
