A good Sequel,"Rick and Evelyn now married with a son, find themselves amidst the second coming of Imhotep. After their Son Alex is kidnapped by Imhotep as he seeks the Scorpion King (The Rock) Rick and Evelyn must pursue their sons capture, with the aid of the clues Alex leaves along the way.Aside from some unusual revelations in Evelyn and Ricks past, the movie concentrates mainly on the action this time out and runs a little short on story.I Liked the evolution of Evey's character, now she's hardened up she makes a mean adversary, and takes part in some good battles.All in all, i enjoyed the experience and once again the Visuals were more than adequate.If you enjoyed the first, then watch this one, its good fun and has some fine moments.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Non-stop action,"The success of ""The Mummy"" in 1999 surprised everyone, and on the day that it opened, Universal Studios greenlit another sequel. The original (the 1999 one) was a lot of fun because it mixed creepy scares with awesome action and goofy humor. The sequel does more or less the same thing, except that the action sequences come pretty much one after another from beginning to end.Rick (Brendan Fraser) has married his love from the first film, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), and the have a son, Alex (Freddy Boath). After finding the bracelet of the mythical Scorpion King, they're attacked by villains who are intent on raising Imhotep from the dead (again) so he can kill the Scorpion King and take over the world. Of course, it's up to Rick and Evelyn to stop them.All the characters from the first film in the franchise are back, and they slide into their parts easily. Arnold Vosloo gets to do more with his character, and Patricia Velasquez (who has about 10 times as much screen time as she did in the first film) has a lot of fun acting like Jennifer Lopez's alter-ego. There are a few new characters as well, including young Freddie Boath, who is excellent as Alex. His screen appeal rivals Macauley Culkin at his best. Shaun Parkes is a much better source of comic relief than Kevin J. O'Connor (he's consistently funny, and the dialogue between him and Rick or Jonathan is hilarious). Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is suitably creepy as a new villain and Alun Armstrong is suitably kooky as the ringleader.Stephen Sommers knows how to create an action movie. He creates real characters, not actors who are given different names, and sends them into action scene after action scene. It's a fun and exciting flick, and that's all it tries to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Special Effects Extravaganza,"If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you're probably expecting fast paced adventure, non-stop action and a special effects extravaganza with just enough story to keep it all interesting.  And if that's what you're hoping for, you certainly won't be disappointed; because that's exactly what you get in `The Mummy Returns,' written and directed by Stephen Sommers. The story begins in Egypt, where Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his wife, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) discover an ancient bracelet that had once belonged to a warrior known as `The Scorpion King (The Rock),' who, back in the day, had sold his soul to the god, Anubis, for control of his armies and domination of the world.  Now, it seems, The Scorpion King's resurrection is imminent, and if he succeeds and once again raises the armies of Anubis, he could very well take over or destroy the world.  Followers of Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo), however, who are privy to this information as well, decide to resurrect their dark leader so that he can face The Scorpion King, defeat him, take control of Anubis' armies and conquer the world himself, putting them in control.  But the key to the whole plan lies with who has control of the bracelet at the time of The Scorpion King's resurrection.  And the O'Connells have taken it back home with them to London.So the adventure begins in earnest, moving from Egypt to London, then back again to Egypt.  Along the way, there's plenty of mummies, fighting, and bugs, but very few surprises, except for one scene near the end when something quite unexpected happens.  The story itself gets somewhat lost in the muddle, but it doesn't really matter; plot is fairly insignificant in a movie like this, as long as it maintains at least a thread of credibility and can give the action some context.  And that it does, so all is well and it allows you to get on with what this movie is really all about, which-- simply put-- is having a good time.With shades of `Indiana Jones' and `Star Wars' abounding, the real success of this movie lies in the fact that it never pretends to be anything other than what it is or what it was meant to be, and that is an entertaining, fun movie.  It's visually explosive, from the sweeping, desert vistas of the converging, battling armies, to the mummies and assorted demons and creatures generously sprinkled throughout.  And the hand-to-hand combat scenes between Evelyn and Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velazquez) are especially thrilling.  The one element of the film that doesn't seem to work too well has to do with a particular mode of transportation to which the O'Connells must resort upon their return to Egypt, and which ultimately plays a significant part in the outcome of the whole adventure.  It's something that seemingly would have been more appropriate in `The Adventures of Baron Munchausen' or `Peter Pan.'As far as the performances, suffice to say that the actors involved all do their jobs well; after all, in a movie like this you're not going to find anyone struggling with `The Method.'  Fraser strikes a handsome, heroic pose-- call him a poor man's Indiana Jones-- and Weisz is becoming as Evelyn.  Most importantly, they all walk the walk and talk the talk, and Sommers keeps them on track and wisely avoids allowing any lapses into `camp' or tongue-in-cheek character interpretations, which makes this a solid, fun-filled, action-adventure movie that is what it is.The supporting cast includes John Hannah (providing some comic relief as Jonathan Carnahan), Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Lock Nah), Freddie Boath (Alex O'Connell) and Obed Fehr (Ardeth Bay).  As with most sequels, you'll get more out of `The Mummy Returns' if you've seen the original, which had more of a story and, of course, would give you the background of the characters. But even on it's own and taken at face value, this movie is a feast for the senses, and just a lot of good fun.  Just don't go in expecting anything more than what the trailer promises; if you can do that, chances are you're going to enjoy the movie and have a good time.  I rate this one 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than some would make out...,"When The Mummy hit theatres in 1999, critics everywhere panned it as being a poor man's Indiana Jones. While the two movies are about as similar as Dr. No is to GoldenEye (thankfully), I suppose comparisons between one non-stop adventure film and other are inevitable. In the end, what really counts when determining a film's quality is the level to which it can entertain. And if there is one thing The Mummy did well, it was entertain. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo were very well chosen for their roles.The Mummy Returns is easy to see as being another sequel churned out to satiate the greedy money-machine that Hollywood has become, but it has a few things working for it. One thing that is immediately obvious is that the sequel was very much intended to be a film that could be enjoyed without ever having seen the original. The only references to the previous film are done to fill in the narrative gaps about who Imhotep is, and why he is the way he is. The addition of The Scorpion King was an interesting effort to give the film a new antagonist, but the lack of screentime didn't work well in this tangent's favour. Another tangent that could have been better developed was the rivalry between Imhotep's girlfriend and whatever her name was. Imhotep originally mistook Rachel Weisz's character for being his girlfriend reincarnated, so the use of a woman who looks exactly like her while creating this new tangent needed to be developed differently.Most people won't give a damn about complex story tangents and will want to know if this film is entertaining. And it is entertaining, alright. There is barely a dull moment in the film's substantial running length, and Oded Fehr does a bang-up job of providing a Mad-Max-cum-Indiana-Jones hero. I want to know where they get those groovy costumes and tattoos from, they look quite nice. Anyway, when all is said and done, this is an eight out of ten film. A few badly constructed story details here and there, but some extremely entertaining action sequences make up for them. Don't listen to the nay-sayers. This is matinee-style material at its (almost) best. Get the DVD when it comes out, it will at least tide you over until George Lucas gets his head out of his proverbial and realises that the VHS era is well and truly over.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable thanks to the humor and the many special effects.,"Most people compare this sequel to the first movie 'The Mummy', which is a good thing of course, but I haven't seen the first one, so no comparisons from me.So what can I tell you? Well, the movie isn't as bad as I expected. It's all to clear that the director's first thought wasn't about the script but about the many special effects, but i still quite liked the movie. What made this movie work for me was the humor. Normally this kind of movies takes itself much too serious, there is no place for any joke or funny situation at all. In The Mummy Returns this is different.Thanks to the humor, this movie was very enjoyable, but it is of course the many special effects that make this movie what it is. Don't expect anything real: a mummy coming to life, sucking the life out of people, armies of mythological creatures... will of course never exist in reality, but it certainly was nice to see.I guess it is best to qualify this movie as some excellent way to pass some boring hours on a cold and rainy afternoon. It's certainly not an intellectual movie, but I didn't mind about that when watching it. I give it a 6,5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unpretentious and fun. 7/10,"The Mummy Returns is maybe a step above the first one. The action is non-stop, and it does manage, for the most part, to rouse the audience, or at least me. The good guys are likable. Brendan Fraser is where he belongs. Rachel Weisz is beautiful. John Hannah amuses as Jonathan, and Freddie Boath manages not to annoy as Alex, the kid. He's pretty good as a smart-mouthed brat. The bad guys are, for the most part, fun to hate. Im-Ho-Tep is a good villain. Maybe he isn't given enough to do here, but he's still cool. Patricia Valazquez is a real stunner as his love interst, Anck-Su-Namun. She's probably the best thing about the film. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was good as Lock Nah, the main henchman. Perhaps the weakest part of the film is the Rock as the Scorpion King. The narration during the film's prologue is not nearly as good as it would be if we were watching the story develop. The Scorpion King is basically a boring character. His computer-animated doppleganger at the film's climax is neat, but it would have been better if there were some feelings towards that character.People who know their action flicks will notice that the Mummy Returns steals about every action scene from every action movie made in the past 20 years, quoting movies like Aliens, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park 2 (why? that movie was terrible), and especially Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, with which, if you remember, The Mummy I was competing with in the box office successfully in May of 1999. They don't try to hide any of it. They even make a jest at Spielberg with a shadow against the moon from ET and Amblin Entertainment. It's all in good fun. You shouldn't be too angry at the sloppy script. If you are going to be angry, the shoddy computer animation should be your target. Still, it's not bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"More of the same adventure sequel, but it actually works.","Both the original and this are great fun and completely likable. Of course the sequel does have flaws, the plot isn't quite as strong as the one in the original, the scorpion king was a bit of a disappointment(he could've been designed better) and again like the original it is overlong. But it does have a sense of unpretentious fun, and that is great to see. The visuals are very impressive, and the music score, this time by Alan Silvestri is very effective, though I do prefer the Goldsmith. Although he isn't given as much to do, Arnold Vosloo still impresses as Imhotep, who I admit I did find scary in the original, not so much here, but Vosloo's performance is great. The other performances are fine too, Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are both charming in the lead roles, and Patricia Velasquez is just beautiful beyond words as Meela Nais/Arnk Su Namun. Plus Freddie Boath is perfectly tolerable as Alexander, and John Hannah is fine too, same with Allun Armstrong of all people. All in all, a fun sequel, that shows that more of the same can actually work. The only other sequel that I have seen that is more of the same yet lives up exactly to the standard of its original is Home Alone 2:Lost in New York. 7/10 for Mummy Returns.

Pretty good for a sequel.,"This movie is pretty good, it delivers pretty much the same thing we got in the Firs movie.  Some characters are more developed and some others more expanded, all the same, some others are reduced and we are introduced to new characters.  The plot is good, not as good as the first movie, but still does a good job keeping you interested and entertained the whole time.The sequel takes place 10 years later, when Rick O'Conell (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) are now married, and have a son, Alex (Freddie Boath).  Alex has been kidnaped by the bad guys, including the infamous Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) and his eternal love reincarnated (Patricia Velazques).  Now it's just a matter of time for them to find Alex before it's too late for everybody...The performances are pretty good, almost all of them.  Brendan Fraser does a good job once again as the handsome Rick, he is strong, funny, charismatic, what else can you ask?  Rachel Weisz role has been developed a lot more, she is no longer the clumsy egyptologist wanna-be, now she runs the British museum and is a mom; and she does a great job with that.  John Hannah is also back as  the useless Jonathan, this time not as funny as he used to be. Oded Fehr  character has been expanded a lot, we get to see him a lot more in this movie.  He did a good job as Ardeth.  One more time, the winner of this movie is Arnold Vosloo as the villain; his performance was excellent! He manages to express all the emotions without opening his mouth!  This guy has great acting skills, too bad not many movie producers/directors have noticed it.  The Rock does his movie debut with this movie, he is the Scorpion King, the whole movie turns around him, even though he was in the movie for the first 5 minutes of it.  Still he did a good job for his first time.  Patricia Velazques was the only one who did a BAAAAD job.  Her acting is awful! She is pretty and everything, but she really needs some acting classes.The music once again is one of the key parts of this movie, it is really good, even though Jerry Goldsmith wasn't in charge of it. The direction is good too, just like in the first movie, and we get to see a lot more of special effects.This movie is good, i really enjoyed it, I liked the first one better though, but that's just me.  You might like this one better, so YOU MUST SEE THIS ONE! **** out of *****",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Yeah, right, and no harm ever came from reading a book. You remember how that one went?","After the financial success of ""The Mummy"" two years earlier, the sequel was inevitable. The big players from the first film are back, Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo and Oded Fehr. Stephen Sommers once again directs (and writes), Patricia Velasquez comes in to be a main player after her cameo in the first film, and young Freddie Boath plays the son of Rick and Evelyn who are now married. This time the cameo goes to Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson who plays The Scorpion King and who is replaced by a very bad CGI version of himself at film's finale.When the second sequel, ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" (2008), was released, Brendan Fraser went on record as saying that for ""The Mummy Returns"" they basically remade the film they had already made in 1999! This is absolutely true, some new characters and an expansion on the O'Connell romance have been put in to beef it up, while some Zombie Pygmies are around to add extra monster factor, but yes! It's a re-tread only with more money spent, more effects (and better effects apart from Scorpion King) and more noise. This actually is OK for those who enjoyed the first film immensely, because ""Returns"" is every bit as enjoyable as family blockbuster entertainment. The Worldwide box offices rang to the tune of over $330 million in profit. That's a lot of happy families you would think!.So yes, it's a bit of a cheat, but much like the film before it, it gets away with it because the makers do everything they can to entertain the action/adventure loving crowd. With legions of Anubis warriors, those awesome Pygmies and the all round funny by-play between a cast comfortable with the material (again), ""The Mummy Returns"" delivers exactly what can reasonably be expected of it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Film Shouldn`t Revolve Around CGI,"The problem I had with the original film was that the script seemed to be written around the special effects , especially the CGI . Well the bad news about the sequel is that it suffers from the same problem multiplied by ten. Witness the opening prologue of massed armies fighting , an oasis appearing from nowhere and the scorpian king`s army overrunning a city all of which might have looked good on paper but on screen is badly executed due to some really apalling CGI . I don`t know what it is about this type of cinema technology but think of all the films where it`s been used in set pieces that fail to convince ( ESCAPE FROM LA , DIE ANOTHER DAY etc ) and watching it used in THE MUMMY RETURNS  left me shaking my head wondering why directors and FX maestros haven`t been able to improve upon it . Watching the action scenes in this movie is like watching a cartoon.Equally unconvincing and uninvolving is the screenplay which revolves around the bad guys wanting to get their hands on Rachel Weisz chest . Who can blame them ? you ask , well it`s not that sort of chest I`m talking about , it`s a treasure chest containing something or another which I didn`t bother to digest because the plot takes second place to a bunch of CGI inspired set pieces . Unfortunately most of the set pieces are stolen from the previous film which gave me a feeling THE MUMMY REMADE WITH A SEQUENCE STOLEN FROM JURASSIC PARK:THE LOST WORLD would have been a better title . And watch out for the number of scenes where one of the good guys is in serious trouble only to have the hero appear to save the day . It really does get tedious after the first three or four times it happensI may be accused of taking this film far too seriously and not realising it`s a dumb popcorn movie . Perhaps but what`s wrong with an intelligent popcorn movie ? And does anyone else miss the good old days when monsters were men dressed up in costumes or stop frame photography ?",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Romance makes movie complete,"After seeing ""The Mummy"" in the theaters for the first time two years ago, I knew I would be hooked. I've watched it about twenty times since then, and as many people know, this movie does not get boring or less funny after watching it numerous times, in fact, I think it gets more and more thrilling each time. I began hoping for a sequel to be released, and when I heard that one was in the making, I was relieved that they weren't going to end this great storyline with just one film. When ""The Mummy Returns"" was finally released in theaters, it didn't recieve very many good reviews right away. I was dissapointed because I didn't understand how Stephen Sommers could direct such a great movie classic and then totally botch a promising sequel. I let the reviews get to me and I didn't see the movie while in the theaters. I waited until this past weekend to watch TMR on pay-per-view not expecting much due to the bad reviews, but I soon found out that, boy, were some of those critics wrong.Right from the opening scene I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed. The action, special effects, acting, comedy, and romance were all better than it's prequel in my opinion. The plot was a little confusing, and the Scorpion King graphic at the end looked like the same one used in the video game, but all in all it was an extremely fun and enjoyable movie. I actually found myself watching it three times in a row. I probably could have watched it 24 hours straight, but I didn't want to ruin it right away.The SFX in TMR were outstanding. The pymies were so amazing, and the Anubis warriors were excellent as well. But, on to the greater aspects of the film. I thought that Jonathan, played by John Hannah, is one of the funniest characters ever, his one-liners are terrific, I was laughing out loud during his lines. Arnold Vosloo is great as the title character, but could have been more like the original, he was not as powerful in this film but was good anyway. Many people disliked Alex O'Connell, played by newcomer Freddie Boath, but I found him to be quite funny and likable. He had many great lines and was sarcastic when the film needed it. He is a cute kid and l hope he will have a good acting career. Oded Fehr is wonderful as Ardeth Bay. He keeps the heroes grounded.Meela/Anck-su-namun, played by Patricia Velasquez has some good scenes, but I found her to be not as great as the rest of the cast. I wasn't really looking forward to seeing The Rock as the Scorpion  King in this film, but he wasn't as bad as I thought, even though he was only it for about three minutes, I would have labled him as an extra. It was all hype for him. My favorite part of ""The Mummy Returns"" was the great chemistry between Brendan Fraser (Rick) and Rachel Weisz (Evie). They looked like an actual couple in this film, unlike other recent movies. This was why I liked this one better than the prequel. A little bit of romance was what was missing from the first 2/3 of ""The Mummy"", and I am so glad it was included much more in this film. Brendan Fraser is very easy on the eyes and he looks like a down-to-earth guy, not like a stereotypical moviestar. I think this is why the two seem so believeable in TMR, they are just two normal people who are still very beautiful people. I am glad they made Evie more attractive in TMR, she deserves to show off her pretty eyes. Rick is great because he is still the same sarcastic, wise-guy, handsome hero, who has all the females in the theater (including myself) drooling and sighing, that he was in the first mummy movie.I hope that they will make another sequel with Fraser, Weisz, Hannah, Vosloo, Fehr, and Boath all included. They can't take out any of these characters without the movie being butchered. I probably won't see ""The Scorpion King"" since Brendan and Rachel, my favorite characters, won't be in it. I know there are many others just like me who love the romance in this film. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes action, SFX, comedy, romance, and good clean fun. I would give this movie a 9.9 out of 10 points with the 0.1 being subtracted because it wasn't long enough to really explain the plot in more depth. When it ended, I wished it wasn't over. This goes in my top 5 movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More of the Same but OK,"There are times when the cynical part of me gets put aside and I go to a movie to just see what happens. I decided that this time I would enjoy the special effects, the rules dreamed up by the Mummy experts, none of them ancient Egyptians, and just watch. There is really no plot, at least none of any importance. It is a series of events with some loose kind of contrived hierarchy of evil that needs to be addressed. It is pure video game stuff. Still, I watched it, admiring the incredible images put on the screen. The rapidity of motion. The critters that kept coming and coming. I looked at this like I look at a photograph and said, ""The people that did this are pretty darned creative."" Wouldn't it be nice if there was a bit of suspense and anticipation. We all know that you-know-who is going to meet you-know-who and according to the talk about the sequel, we know who's coming next. Anyway, I'm not going to put it down but I'm also not going to bother to watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Simply Awesome!,"On my day off from work today, I decided to pop in the Mummy Returns for something fun to watch. I hadn't seen it since it was released for homeviewing, so it's been about a year or two. I must say that this movie takes my breath away each time I see it. The Mummy Returns is a roller coaster ride which barely stops during the entire 2+ hours! I love the CGI effects, and how lavish the scenery looks. The movie made me feel as though I was witnessing Ancient Egypt and and the 1930's era in person. So what if things look 'cartoony' during the battling sequences! I think that the battle sequences in Two Towers looked just as much the same. I find that with many fans nowadays, they take things way too seriously. If a movie or TV series is not what they hope for, then they blast it all to hell just because they are whining babies. Take for instance Star Trek Nemesis. That was another really good movie, yet the so called 'fans' ripped it apart piece by piece and then fed it to the dogs. I just wish that the babies would enjoy the movies instead of complaining that a movie isn't good quality. If thats the case they should just go back to their rooms and watch Fargo or the English Patient! Both the Mummy and the Mummy Returns rock as far as action movies go. Get a huge bag of chips a large bottle of pop, sit down with your girlfriend and enjoy two great movies!! Excellent fun!!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't You Just Love Social Realism?,"The plot of this film is too complex to set out in any great detail. Suffice it to say that a group of villains, including one of the curators of the British Museum, have revived the corpse of the Ancient Egyptian priest Imhotep, who was put to death for his part in the murder of the Pharaoh, a crime carried out by his wife Anck-su-Namun, who was also Imhotep's lover. The villains are also seeking to use a magic bracelet to revive the Scorpion King (a warrior from another period of Egyptian history who sold his soul to the dark god Anubis in exchange for military success) and his army. The idea is that they will then use Imhotep to kill the Scorpion King, which will give them control of his army, which they will then use to achieve their ambition of world domination. The only people who can thwart their schemes are Rick O'Connell, an American archaeologist, and his beautiful English wife Evelyn, whose young son Alex has stolen the magic bracelet. Evelyn just happens to be the reincarnation of the daughter of the murdered Pharaoh.You get the general idea. Don't you just love social realism?Despite the fact that the plot of 'The Mummy Returns' is clearly nonsensical, I rather enjoyed the film. It is set in the 1930s, and it clearly owes much to the 'Indiana Jones' films, also set in that period. Both involve Egyptian archaeology and artefacts with mystical powers. Although this will sound heretical to the army of Spielberg devotees, who have voted 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' to number 17 in your list of the 250 best movies of all time, I have to say that I enjoyed 'The Mummy Returns' at least as much as any of the 'Indiana Jones' series (and considerably more than 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'). The reason is that the film is fast-paced and occasionally witty; the film whisks the viewer from one adventure to another and generates enough excitement to make him or her forget the many absurdities and inconsistencies in the script. The film never makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously, a mistake that can often ruin an adventure film of this nature.The best thing about this film is that it stars the gorgeous Rachel Weisz. Indeed, it helped to change my ideas about her. I had previously seen Rachel as an attractive, but rather conservative and proper actress, always playing English rose types in art-house movies. 'The Mummy Returns' (I have never seen 'The Mummy') showed that she has a larger range than this and has not only the looks, but also the sex appeal and cinematic presence, to take the lead in Hollywood blockbusters. (Her predecessor as official English Rose, Helena Bonham Carter, has also made a similar move). Brendan Fraser has never really been my favourite actor, but here he did well as Rick, the solid and dependable family man.This is very much a 'family values' thriller, like 'True Lies' or 'The River Wild', in which mum, dad and the kid all play their part in thwarting the bad guys. This phenomenon perhaps marks a change in the way in which women are seen by the film industry. At one time, leading actresses often disliked being cast as a mother, even of young children, as it was seen as a sign that their career as a leading lady was over and that henceforward they only had 'character' roles to look forward to. Rachel Weisz, however, plays a mother both here and in her next film, 'About a Boy', without her career suffering any harm.Of the other characters, there was an amusing cameo from John Hannah as Jonathan, Evelyn's cowardly and avaricious brother. The villains do not really stand out , with the exception of Patricia Velasquez as the reincarnated Anck-su-Namun, a villainess almost as sexy as the heroine. (Her duel with Rachel Weisz will probably strike most male viewers as the film's most memorable scene). The sense of menace overhanging the heroes comes more from the film's computer-generated effects. One thing I did not like was the Scorpion King, in the early scenes a human being but in the later ones a rather ridiculous and unconvincing half-man half-scorpion monster like something from a cheap B-movie.In a way, the film could be seen as a modern-day B-movie; an updated large-scale big-budget version of those old Saturday morning quickies. Much the same thing, however, could be said of many of Spielberg's films (and not just Indiana Jones). 'The Mummy Returns' may be nonsense, but at least it is entertaining nonsense. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Loud, silly, PG-rated violence...","basically a typical summer blockbuster!  I saw it at a sneak preview last night and I mostly liked it.  The action is virtually non-stop, the special effects (except for one monster at the end) are incredible and the film never stops moving.  But the plot makes no sense (something about a Scorpion King and the Mummy fighting), characterizations are nonexistent and there's some truly awful dialogue.  Also in a movie that takes place in the 1930s, terms like ""Are we there yet?"" ""Whatever..."" and ""Get a room"" did not exist! That may be nitpicking, but it bothered me.  Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz and John Hannah all reprise their roles from the original.  They're all very good here...too bad they have nothing to play with.  But, I was never bored. It's a movie where you turn off your mind, sit back and enjoy the ride.  In other words, a very good summer movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good swashbuckling fun in confusing story,"The team of Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) and Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) have increase by one with the addition of their son Alex (Freddie Boath). Together, they are treasure hunting and finds the Bracelet of Anubis. In ancient times, the Scorpion King used it to command the Army of Anubis. Now everybody is on a quest to stop the coming of the apocalyptic rising of the army of Anubis.The story is complicated and confusing. There is a lot of backstory to learn. The 15 minute prequel of The Rock as the Scorpion King didn't help any. It's more of an ad for the Scorpion King franchise. At least, it's easy to identify the good guys from the bad guys. So even if you don't understand what's happening, you know who to root for. The CGI and the swashbuckling makes up for some of the confusion.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Why is Sommers still making movies?,"As fatuous as the first Mummy movie was, it had a certain goofy charm to it. The characters were marginally likable and a few scenes here and there made me chuckle.The sequel, however, is a monstrosity. It lacks all the cleverness and innocent goodwill of the first movie, which leads me to believe the rumors I hear that a) the first movie benefited from massive uncredited rewrites and b) the same ghost writers left Sommers to his own devices for the second after getting shafted on credit for the first movie.So here we have it, a clear portrait of Stephen Sommers' film-making abilities and they are meager. As a writer he gives us some real gems of dialog. You know that any movie that has a kid say, ""My dad's gonna kick you a**,"" is going to be a real stinker. The rub in this situation comes when you realize that it's the best line in the movie.CGI effects dominate this movie and they are bad. Everything from the midget mummies to the flying boat zeppelin looks fake and stupid.Don't waste your time. This movie was a monumental waste of time and money.1 out of 10.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Cartoons, Cartoons, Cartoons...","What a joke this movie is. The first Mummy was quite alright, with the right dose of suspense, an interesting story, likeable characters and quite subtle visual effects. Not an 'Indiana Jones' in any way, but an enjoyable movie nevertheless.'The Mummy Returns' looks fake from start to finish. Sommers tried to create a sequel that is bigger an better than the first one, but he failed in almost every way.Someone should tell film makers that today's computer technology is not yet able to replace EVERY movie set and definitely it's not ready to replace actors!!This movie includes some of the worst effects ever created by ILM and maybe it's not even their fault. Because it's their job to do what the director wants, so if they were asked to create the Rock as a CGI character, they just had to do it.Of course the result is totally laughable, an embarrassing moment for a movie with such a high budget. Also the moment where the pyramid sucks in all the jungle, is the stupidest, most fake, over-the-top effect I have ever encountered.What the hell was Sommers thinking? ""Ah, that's a nice idea, I'll just ask the ILM guys to do it and we're done"". Well, it looks totally cartoonish and ridiculous.Having recently watched the good old 'Big Trouble in little China', all I have to say is that the rubber monster in no way worst than any of the effects in 'Mummy Returns'. Why? Because principal photography is at least applied on set and can -with the right director- produce a quite realistic result.Listening to the DVD audio commentary by Stephen Sommers, all I can say is that the guy is totally untalented and has no appreciation of art at all. He was just lucky. The people are always hungry for Indiana Jones type of adventures and he was there at the right time. He is under the impression that because his movie sold well, he created something good.Well, this movie has zero suspense, the characters are now unlikeable (except for the always brilliant John Hannah) and everything's totally predictable. Plus, there are so many elements in 'Mummy Returns', you just can't keep track of. Pygmy mummies out of nowhere, flying zeppelin things, projector bracelets, weird reincarnations, among others. It's like having a sandwich with everything on; in the end, you just don't know what you're eating.The script isn't totally bad, but it's loaded with so much useless information that makes the movie hard to watch, even for the sake of the story. I had to listen to the DVD commentary, to realize that the building Eve and Rick return to, is their home and not a museum! What was that?! Who produced this joke of a movie?The humor is good though, I grant Sommers that. Also did you know that the 2-disk set DVD sold ever more that the movie itself? And it's a terrible release too. The second disc was totally unnecessary, it's full of the Rock being interviewed - who cares about him anyway?If they followed a more subtle direction, they could have a good movie. You know, Sommers said that computer guys cannot replace an actor. Well, THEY HAVE REPLACED YOU, Stevie!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Loved this sequel! Amazing work by everybody,"The Mummy Returns is a film that, I think, you need to see the first film of the saga because otherwise you don't understand some little details. That film is a film like Indiana Jones with the same plot and the same characters. But the kid is an exception. The cinema show us the kids like boys and girls insufferable, but Alex O'Conell is a boy that ""pass more time in the museum that in house"". One difference this film have respect Indiana Jone's films are the sobrenatural characters than appears like The Scorpión King or Imhotep. If you like Indiana Jones and Egyptian mithology, I recomend you that film",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A 'Bad' movie that is fun to watch,"Of all my 200-something reviews here, this proves the most difficult to write. How do you justify a film so overtly poor in all traditional aspects? Maybe you don't  maybe it is enough that I leave you with my titular summary and hope you will have as much fun as I did watching 'The Mummy Returns'.Yet I could not to do this because it is a film that demands some evaluation. First, there are many many things wrong with this Mummy installment: its screenplay is a sketchbook mess with gaping plot holes, it suffers from the sequel-hubris of being 'big, bigger, epic', its one-liners are often wristslashingly cringeworthy, the villain characters are frighteningly flat, the animated pygmies some 2/3s into the movie are a joke, and on that note the CGI is so inexplicably bad that it may actually wound you to watch just five years later (it is bizarrely much worse than in the first Mummy film), and lastly there is an unbearably annoying young-Anakin-like boy  Rick and Evelyn's son  whom is given far too much importance in the story and far too much screen time in the film. In other words, 'The Mummy Returns' is camp of Batman and Robin-like proportions.But my god, it is quite possibly the most well-executed and entertaining camp I have ever seen. Its predecessor 'The Mummy (1999)' proves a wonderful little Indiana Jones romp with a crisp freshness and beautiful settings. 'Returns' is equally sprawling with stunning ancient Egyptian locations and buildings but much of the novelty of the whole premise has regrettably worn off from the first film. It therefore goes to great lengths to compensate for its sequel-shortcomings by dishing out everything on a larger scale. This means kinetic, dynamic heartstopping action in all kinds of time eras with all kinds of scope. It is also, thanks to this no-nonsense approach, bathed in urgency which means no slow-paced moments to reflect on its quality.The pinnacle of 'The Mummy Returns' success is its characters. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz undoubtedly have a remarkably comedic rapport that was fully showcased when the series kick-started, and is equally engrossing this time around. Although these two are the goldmine of the film, it offers plenty of goodies from the rest of its cast. Oded Fehr and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are excellent and fun to watch in their respective parts, as is the triumvirate of goofy comedic-sidekick-ish badguys with their assigned quirks. It is constantly poised on the brink of silliness, but then, so is Pirates of the Caribbean and the mainstream audience is crazy about that series.I strongly believed that this is a highly underrated film in terms of entertainment value and it is a shame Fraser wasn't showered with awards for his hilarious performance.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun But Not As Good As The Original,"The Mummy Returns picks up a few years after the last film left off, our hero and heroine are now married with a child but still exploring the realms of ancient Egypt. Thus an ancient evil is released yada yada etc. Basically what you need to know is this is more of the same un-complicated adventure from the 1st film, if you liked the first one then you'll get along just fine with this.Rachel Weisz is stunning as ever playing Evie and Brendan Frasier does pretty well again with the all action hero Rick O Connell. I really enjoyed John Hannah's comedy sidekick in this movie who provided some funny scenes between the action packed sequences, also the Rock was well cast as the scorpion king. Where this film lacks over it's predecessor is in some very dodgy CGI and the addition of an irritating kid as a main character. Also as with all sequels it doesn't feel as fresh as the original. There are also a few cringe worthy scenes of father son bonding and some jokes that miss the mark by a mile.7/10 - Good fun but feels padded out and not as fresh as the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not up to the original but still good,"The real stars of this show are the gals rachel weisz and patricia velesquez. RW is a beauty and PV is a darkhaired sex bomb. They have a battle midway in the flik when they are back in ancient Egypt and half naked. It's great to watch. Special effects are sensational too esp the last 20 minutes when it's just one action-packed crisis after another. Unfortunately, there isn't much plot to the story - Rick and evie's kid gets kidnapped and they try to get him back and that's about it. The kid, like all kids in movies nowadays, is a smart-butt and a real pain. One of the bad guys keeps talking about killing the kid and you find yourself rooting for him to do it.

"You kids have it easy.  You only have to kill the mummy twice.  Back in my day, we had to kill him thrice.","Mostly a rehash of the original, but this time, there's the Scorpion King (The Rock) to shake things up a bit. I actually saw this movie in Spain, so the one-liners were often hard to translate. But overall, we now know that movies from the 1930's are to be remade in the 1950's-1970's with a sense of camp, and then remade in the 21st century as crosses between David Lean-style epics and Harrison Ford action flicks; not only ""The Mummy"", but also ""King Kong"" comes to mind. But now that Brendan Fraser has starred in a Best Picture winner (""Crash"") and Rachel Weisz has won Best Supporting Actress for ""The Constant Gardener"", I expect no more mummies.And one more thing: why did the Scorpion King get his own movie? I never saw it but heard that it was just an excuse for buff men to flex their muscles. It was actually released the same weekend as ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", which of course is much more well remembered. No surprise there.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A very good Popcorn movie.,"This is the true essence of the popcorn movie, and like the first film, delivers the fun in spades.

He finds the Bracelet of Anubis, gets kidnapped and off we go on a fun race against time across the desert encountering all sorts of dangers and evil critters along the way. This one also introduces us to the ""Scorpion King"" (least said, I think) and Sommers, again, keeps this all moving along apace.

"Good, action packed with a few flaws","The Mummy Returns is a good sequel to The Mummy.  Although The Mummy was remake of an earlier film and the sequel also takes from a few other movies, this one is good.  If you are one who can't stand movies that are not completely original, mostly likely, you will not be able to sit through this one.  However, if you are looking for some action packed, good entertainment, this one is for you.All of the original actors, Brenden Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, return for this sequel.  This helps the movie flow.  The action starts right from the beginning and does not stop until the end. There is little or no ""slow"" period in this one.  The special affects are good for the most part but it appeared the f/x artists were either, running out of money or time in a few areas.  Some of the effects seemed either poor or incomplete.  There were also a few other items in the movie that did not make sense.  There were also problems with some of the technology used in this movie that were not invented by the time this film was suppose to take place (such as a reliable rocket engine in 1933).Over all, this one if definitely worth your while (8 out of 10).",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Great Mummy Sequel,"The Mummy Returns (2001, Dir. Stephen Sommers)Many years ago, in Ancient Egypt, the Scorpian Kind led a menacing army, but when he sold his soul to Anubis, he was erased from history. Now he is only a myth...or is he? Rick and Evelyn O'Connell is still discovering new artifacts, along with their 8 year old son Alex. They discover the Bracelet of Anubis. But someone else is after the bracelet. High Priest Imhotep has been brought back from the dead once again and wants the bracelet, to control the Scorpian King's army. That's not the only problem. Imhotep now has Alex and with the bracelet attached to him, doesn't have long to live.It's hard to come across a good sequel, but 'The Mummy Returns' isn't that bad. It might feel as if it's missing the menace of the mummy in this film, but it's still a lot of fun. All the great characters are back with some hilarious lines, especially John Hannah as Jonathan. The effects are great just like the last film, and the action is there for everyone. Depending on what you like, there will be mixed opinions on which film is better.""Oh, Not these guys again"" - Rick (Brendan Fraser)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Poor Mummy!,"First, let me tell you that I did not hate ""The mummy"". It was light, fresh funny and action packed and it never tried to take itself too seriously. I cannot say the same of the sequel.First of all, it lost its originality. Not only is it ""inspired"" by the first film, it plagiarize entire parts of it (the kids who destroys all the temple's pillars as his mother did with the library in the first installment, the huge face of Imothep in the water trying to swallow our heroes hot air balloon compared to the same face in the sandstorm trying to swallow the light airplane).Then, there are those other movie influences: A final battle between the heroes and the arch-enemies while outside, good troops are fighting with an army so much more powerful (Did I hear someone say Star Wars?). Women fighting with various bladed weapons and running on walls (Why did I think of Crouching Tiger?) A perfectly swell gentleman turning to be the leader of a cult which our heroes spy from above(Have you seen Indianna Jones and the Temple of Doom?)Otherwise, the story have been left out and it's just action scene over action scene with a couple of in jokes to lighten up the atmosphere and remind us of how ""the mummy"" was so much more better than this dumb sequel.By the way, could anyone tell me how ""The Rock"" got his name in top billing when he only appears on screen for a couple of minutes.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fantastic piece of entertainment!!,"I saw this film twice in the cinema with my friends, and hell, somehow I enjoyed it even more the second time!!  What can I say about the action?  It is fabulous from start to finish - especially the scenes in London, featuring Tower Bridge and the British Museum as you've never seen them before!  The little mummies are superb as they scuttle along buildings, and there are also some thrilling chase sequences through the forests!All acting is first-rate in this film - Brendan Fraser I find just the most likeable hero, Rachel Weisz looks even more stunning, Patricia Velasquez is perfectly bitchy, John Hannah is again the typical English clown, and Arnold Vosloo adds another dimension to the character of Imhotep - I even felt sorry for the guy in this film!  And how could I forget Freddie Boath, who does an excellent job as an amusing though stereotypical boy-scout-type kid. Also look out for a scene-stealing turn from the airship-pilot, but the star of the show just has to be Horus, the kestrel!The special effects perhaps vary in this film, from breathtakingly-brilliant to downright pathetic.  I particularly found the scenes in the airship, flying through the sky, very dodgy - surely that's a cardboard cut-out in the background?!But did I mention the music?  This film has a fantastic soundtrack, which I made sure to buy, and adds even more merit to a remarkable adventure.Overall, I'd give this film at least 7/10 for pure entertainment value - it may not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it rivals the likes of 'Star Wars' as the best popcorn movie ever!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A bit of a decline from the prequel but still pretty great,"""The Mummy Returns"" follows Brendan Fraser and the gang again for some more fun mummy adventures. If you just don't compare this with its prequel then you'll honestly have loads of fun with this one.Not as legendary as the first, but still an awesome rememberable movie with lots of fun and adventure. Loved the characters, the pacing, the story and generally just loved the movie as a whole. Brilliant. (But just between you and me... I think that's more because of nostalgia than anything.

great fun,"THE MUMMY RETURNS, believe me, is Hollywood blockbuster at its best. In my opinion this one worked better than the original because it never let up with the action.

This one was more serious with its tonality, it meant business, no nonsense!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alex is the Worst,"""The Mummy Returns"" is significantly weaker than the first film. Rather than explore a new story, the movie had to rehash plot points from the first one. The reincarnation aspects were forced, the Scorpion King was an afterthought (just look at the CGI) and Imhotep was a shell of himself.Ultimately, the worst decision made by this franchise was introducing a child into the story. I used to say that Short Round was the most annoying child in cinema, but I've changed my mind. Alex has now taken the top spot.While I liked seeing Rick and Evy back in action, and some of the fight scenes were cool, there wasn't much else to enjoy about this movie.Best Character: Evy

Better series,"I am a fan of the Indiana Jones series, but for more sheer fun and enjoyment The Mummy series, excluding the Tom Cruise movie (it was horrible, regardless of how you look at it), is great. I can watch these more frequently versus the Indiana Jones movies. Even the most recent, which is good, is getting boring. The thing I like here is the lack of constant chases. Remove those from the Indiana Jones movies and it has, maybe 45 minutes of actual movie. The Mummy movies just seem to have more substance. They're fun. Exciting and Arnold Vosloo is a great baddie. He has fun. It's obvious. The movies have great actors: Fraser, Weisz, Fehr. Really fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No need for a second,"""The Mummy Returns"" when it should have stayed at home, wrapped up tight! This sequel never really felt right, there was the humour, and a lot of fairly good special effects {for the year it was made}, but the plot, the script was just dull. The inclusion of the Scorpion King along with Imhotep just fell flat on it's face, too much conflicting storyline. The script just did not come up to standard, which the first movie achieved quite well.

"Delivers the goods, as sequels go...amazing special effects!","While not quite up to the original Brendan Fraser flick that started it all, 'The Mummy Returns' delivers all the action, adventure and romance one could expect from a story of this sort--and then some.  My only problem with the picture is the action is so non-stop, it hardly gives you a chance to enjoy the beautiful sets and scenery. Something is happening every moment--in itself not a bad thing--but there's seldom a pause for breath or a sequence that doesn't involve heavy use of FX.As for the participants, Brendan Fraser resumes his original role looking just a tad bit heavier, Rachel Weisz makes a lovely action-adventure heroine, and John Hannah and Fred Boath have some crackling good lines to deliver, giving the much needed humorous slant to all of the proceedings--not that anyone is going to take the story seriously.Again, if you enjoyed 'The Mummy', you'll enjoy this one. Some of the scenes are gorgeously staged--the dirigible looks like a floating gondola in the sky, zooming past mountains and pyramids--and the desert sands are real enough to supply all the exotic flavor needed. And some of the creatures dreamed up by those Industrial Light people are really awesome.Summing up: never a dull moment thanks to some dazzling use of special effects. Those little ""critters"" are amazing! Heavy on effects, weak on plot--but hey, it's just a damn good sequel! Relax and enjoy a non-stop ride that gives new meaning to the term ""cliffhanger"".",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but not – quite – as good as the first","The first 'Mummy' film was a classic. No, not in the 'Godfather' kind of way. No, it certainly won't be remembered as one of the greats when it comes to the history of cinema. However, it was a fun little film which has its place on TV on a Saturday afternoon. It was a good action-adventure film which could be enjoyed by all the family without much of a need for brainpower.Yes, it could be looked at as a 'poor man's Indiana Jones,' but it was just such fun it should be afforded some of its misgivings and simply enjoyed for what it was. So, because of its simple success (and commercial, obviously), a sequel was quickly greenlit. The second instalment certainly gets a fair few things right, yet it never quite gels together like the first. Not that's it's bad, it's just not – quite – as good as the first.The best thing about it is the cast. They all return from the original. And it's nice to see the two central characters (Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz) don't need to fall in love all over again. They're married now and they have a child, Alex, who's not as annoying as 99% of the children we see in films. In fact, instead of Rik having to rescue Evelyn constantly, the two of them have to rescue their son. Yes, the Mummy does indeed return (never mind how he was firmly killed and dragged to hell in the first instalment. He's now back, okay?) and wants to borrow the mythical 'Scorpion King's' army with which he can then take over the world again. Unfortunately, little Alex just so happens to have the only bracelet attached to him, so he's captured and subsequently dragged half way around the world into to raise the army.One of the things 'The Mummy Returns' will always be known for is that it's the first filmic outing for 'The Rock' (better known nowadays as, former wrestler, Dwayne Johnson). He plays the Scorpion King himself – a secondary villain, also not the type you want to get hold of either your only son, or an army capable of taking over the world. It's a brave attempt to crowbar another villain into the mix, but he's not properly in it until the final showdown, therefore the main villain we go with is the Mummy, simply because he was in the first film and is basically in the second outing all the way through.So, The Mummy Returns sits nicely alongside its predecessor in the 'Saturday matinée' type of film. It too will be enjoyed by most families with a sense of humour and a forgiving nature towards daft films. But it's not perfect. It's hard to explain exactly what's wrong with it, but there's something there that doesn't feel right. And it wasn't in the first. It does seem a little more formulaic than the first. You get one action scene after the next, even going as far as to copy the sandstorm from the first film and changing it slightly using water instead of sand.It's a nice little film and most people should like it. Perhaps it's best to let the Mummy franchise die there. It will certainly save you from the very disappointing third instalment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Mummy Returns for another sandy CGI adventure, tossing out character development off of the dirigible.","Bigger is not always better (unless you are a size queen...). Clearly, both Sommers and the ancient pharaohs failed to capitalise on this ethos, with colossal pyramids, temples and undead armies towering over the O'Connell's. Yet despite the plague of special effects that have tainted the lands of Egypt, turning it into an outdated polygonal desert, this is still an incredibly enjoyable adventure flick that harks back to the 'Indiana Jones' era of films. I miss those days! After activating the Bracelet of Anubis, the O'Connell's must prevent a newly resurrected Imhotep from slaying the Scorpion King, granting him control over Anubis' army.Right, let's address the camel in the oasis. The Scorpion King. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Merging into one. It looked abhorrently terrible back in '01 and I can damn well guarantee you it still looks like the dark side of Anubis' buttocks today. That is just one example of various ""revolutionary"" special effects that either look out of place or are atrociously rendered. Some, mostly environmental details, still hold up well. Most, do not. So to align the film's focus on haphazard visuals rather than the characters themselves, well, it makes for light entertainment at best. There are some droplets of personable qualities, especially with Rick and Evelyn, but with a large array of returning and new characters, it was just too much. Too many travellers in this desert, y'know what I mean!Regardless, Sommers is able to keep the narrative flowing and showcase a plethora of set pieces that are sure to bring some excitement, even if certain sub-plots like Anck-Su-Namun's reincarnation are underdeveloped. Whether it be a barrage of mummified pygmies killing everyone or a car chase in downtown London, it's always kept brisk and enjoyable. The cast does not need any dusting, with them all performing adequately (damn I miss Fraser...). And Silvestri's score is a definite highlight, enhancing that enjoyable nature even further.Substituting the horror found in its predecessor for a straight up adventure flick was probably the best move Sommers could make, but more attention to the characters was needed to truly add that much required Egyptian spice. Decent sequel, but falling for the ""bigger is better"" trap. Let's just not discuss the spin-off or sequel...or reboot...",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Stephen Sommers isn't Steven Spielberg, but at least he isn't Jan deBont.","Jan deBont started out great, directing-wise, with ""Speed,"" and he hasn't made a decent movie since. Stephen Sommers hasn't reached the heights of ""Speed,"" but he hasn't plumbed the depths of ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" either - he makes big dumb movies, for sure, but at least he makes entertaining big dumb movies. Think of him as the American equivalent of Roland Emmerich if Emmerich hadn't shot his bolt after ""Independence Day"" (""Deep Rising"" is everything ""Godzilla"" should have been).""The Mummy Returns,"" the silly but fun sequel to the silly but fun ""The Mummy,"" actually improves on the original in a few aspects, most notably in that Rachel Weisz's Evy has a bit more dimension to her this time with the clumsiness that was a running gag in the first movie passed on as an afterthought to her and Rick's (Brendan Fraser) son; but the story of our heroes having to prevent the unearthed Mummy and his reincarnated love (the fetching Patricia Valezquez) from killing the Scorpion King and using his army to take over the world, all the while racing to keep their son from dying himself, is more than a little flawed in its scripting - where did the new Anck-su-Namun come from, for instance? - and some moments leave a bad taste in the mouth (are we really supposed to laugh at the scene where a hapless underling gets killed by a pygmy and John Hannah's character says ""Sorry!""?).Our heroes' son (played by Spencer Treat Clark, who I honestly thought was a girl in ""Gladiator"" and didn't impress me here either) is another drawback, with attempts to weld his mother's Britishness and his father's wiseacre nature never quite working; and the special effects are uneven, varying from horribly obvious (like the opening battle and the raising of the dead army in the climax) to quite good (like the pygmies and the abyss) - since five effects companies are listed, it's unlikely that Industrial Light and Magic are to blame for all the flaws (and they are definitely credited for the pygmy work).But the movie benefits from action to spare, from its spirited cast (even the Rock in his - let's be honest - cameo as the Scorpion King), and also from Alan Silvestri's excellent score. (A big order of the carnivorous bugs that eat at least one member of the cast should, however, go to whoever put that ghastly song ""Forever May Not Be Long Enough"" over the end credits - the most obvious tack-on pop number since Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart and Sting got together for the tune at the end of the '93 version of ""The Three Musketeers."")

Starting from the begging the story and action are gripping. The way the movie even pokes fun at itself is brilliant. When Rachel is explaining to Frasier about the Bracelet of Anubis and the Scorpion King, Frasier finishes her sentences by saying ""Let me guess, he wants to wipe out the world"" ""How do you know?"" she asks.

If you liked the sexy mummy, there's more of him too: and you almost feel sorry for him at the end. And then there's the Rock, who lived up to his name. He has just about as much acting ability as his name (which is the main reason I avoided The Scorpion King). I gather wrestling fans were disappointed with how little he was in the film: I was grateful. And I mustn't forget to mention the son of Evie and Rick O'Connell. Normally, I abhor films and tv shows that add children, but this one has all the feisty fearlessness of both of his parents, keeps his head under fire, while keeping the ability of all children to get into trouble. He reminds me of the children/young adults in the Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and that's a compliment. Overall, if you enjoyed the first movie, there's lots you'll like in this sequel. I'd like to see more of them, even without the mummy!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Alright, Alright, Let's just admit it...","Ok so we all don't want to really admit how much fun this all was...  both this movie, and its predecessor, but come on it was fun.Ok so the Rock can't act his way out of a paper bag, and Oded Fehr looks and sometimes acts like a George Harrison clone (casting directors are you paying attention), but hey the Egyptology in both are well researched and there is a great song by the band Live in the soundtrack.  Hey come on it was fun.  In fact, I haven't had this much fun with a set of movies since the Indiana Jones series.OK so it was unrealistic, but what do you expect from an action adventure movie.  And a fun one at that.Ok so some of the script was corny, but hey it wasn't predictable. Those involved in these movies obviously had fun or they wouldn't have come back for more.  So let's admit.  We loved these movies and had fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"He does return, and he brings nothing new with him","More of the same. For anyone wondering, no, I don't like Indiana Jones either(though I've barely watched any; I do believe that I'd enjoy it, and I can't say that for this). You know, I really wish I could say something nice about Sommers. No, honestly. For as cathartic as it can be to unleash a verbal smack-down in these reviews, it is nothing compared to how satisfying it is to point to what a certain film-maker does that sets them apart from the rest. Be it an uncompromising vision, perfectionism, or, heck, simpler things such as them always making the viewer laugh, or being dependable to provide exciting pictures. But I can find no such thing about him. Well, to be accurate, nothing that is *positive*. The numerous holes that this(the *second flick*) creates in the continuity are one of the signs that he expects the audience to just ignore all of the inconsistencies, to not question the fiction we are served. While there are a couple of things that are kinda cool, and the occasional second here and there of the non-stop action that doesn't suck, everything is still ridiculously over the top. Can he please limit his crap to focusing on only one catastrophe at a time? The effects continue to be the real attraction(and they're already outdated), albeit this has less of people standing around to admire the aesthetic value of the source of the immediate danger that they are in. I don't know why they chose to cut corners with several of the FX, instead of figuring out a different way to do the sequence(it would be less obvious). Bits in this mirror the first, only here, it makes even less sense. Rick himself has a line about how convenient the plot is. Every character is obnoxious, and this adds an intolerable kid. I repeat the question: Who are we meant to care about? Emotion is invariably phoned in, mainly because of the tone. A handful of these performers can act, elsewhere... it is not a myth, I have seen it. A couple of them may make an effort here. Oded Fehr remains my favorite thing about these. The Rock has so little to do that you can barely be disappointed; it is worth noting, however, that, in this, his face often seems to indicate that the desert exudes an incredibly rank odor. Oh, wait, sorry... that's him trying to look bad-ass. This is powerfully unfunny, and a few moments are disgusting. When did Imhotep develop outright telekinesis? And why on Earth does he only use it sometimes? There is mild, if potentially disturbing, violence in this. Well, the mummies do, to an extent and every now and again, actually have the appearance they're supposed to. And this provides hot chicks(including showing them briefly half-naked) for us straight males to gawk at. I mean, I've never noticed before that Weisz is that sexy. Maybe this is the only time she's had cleavage so much in the space of two hours, and her legs featured prominently in as frequent shots as here. In ways(not all), this is not as awful as the original. I recommend this to any fans of that, and/or of cheesy adventure movies in general. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of My Least Favorite Movies Ever,"From the start, I hated this movie with a passion when I saw it. The only reason I rented it in the first place was because the first was enjoyable and fun, but this was unbearable. Brendan Fraiser and Rachel Weiz's son was stubborn and over-courageous, which would be fine if he could shut up with his lame comments every five seconds. His British accent (where'd that come from?) didn't help matters. The story in this sequel is considerably worse than the first, which was never great but could at least grab attention. It's always a bad sign when somehow people are able to be brought back to life over and over, therefore killing excitement or suspense during action. In the end, I didn't have any more endurance and the last ten minutes went right over my head (but what I do remember wasn't any good either).",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good enough,"(2001) The Mummy Returns
ADVENTURE/ ACTIONWritten and directed by Stephen Sommer that has much of the same cast that were at the first movie have returned to the second, but with one additional difference, is guide, Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and archeologist, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) are now a couple with an 8 year old son named Alex (Freddie Boath). And ""the mummy"", Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) from the first film kidnaps him for the intention of reincarnating his lover back from the dead, which Alex may consist to have some of the blood to do that.If people love the first than they should like this second installment as well! This is by no means better than the first which kept the CGI at a reasonable amount whereas the CGI has been quite 'overused' in this sequel by a lot. S The dialogue and the actors kept much of this sequel entertaining enough which could've been better- this one get's a pass.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Today is March 23, 2019, almost 18 years since this opened in theaters.....","....and I come back and watch it at least every 4-5 years. Kind of like The Mummy 1999. I'm an old guy and I remember as a kid in the 50's seeing the 1932 version with Boris Karloff on Nightmare Theater on TV Friday night. It might have been scary, don't remember but it always made me appreciate the whole idea of a mummy. I like The Mummy from 1999 and was excited to see The Mummy Returns with all the originals. I will say that if Dwayne Johnson had stuck around playing the Scorpion King his career would have gone bye-bye. I liked all the actors here and I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay deserves every good role he's had since then. Silly story, great special effects if a little ragged at times but it's still a worthy continuation of the original. Now then, maybe 5 years from now I'll come back again or I might watch The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, although probably not.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I got what I paid for...,"Sand, sand and more sand and amongst it all quite a nice and tidy movie, although I preferred the original. The scenery and the fight scenes between opposing armies are spectacular and the special effects are quite outstanding. A great cast (Brendan Frasier is excellent in his 'Mummy' roles) does a very good job with a story which I felt tended to 'reach' for surprises a little at times. The jokes were, at times, a little thin and came just short of waggling the eyebrows to highlight a punchline. If a thrill-a-minute movie is what you are after then this is a movie that should be high on your list of must-sees but I do tend to prefer a movie with a little more substance. This is definitely a movie I would see again, if only for the special effects.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The adventure continues 7/10,"""The Mummy Returns"" is a good sequel to its original movie. I had my own doubts at first but shortly after I enjoyed the film like everyone else. It's a nice adventure movie with humor, action and drama at the same time. The characters arcs are much more richer this time so to me it adds a lot to the story and script. Brendan Fraser is a good actor, just like I said before his character resembles Indiana Jones, a lot of attitude and sarcasm. Rachael Weisz is gorgeous and a wonderful actress. John Hannah once again has the role of the comedic character in films such as ""the mummy"". overall a really fun experience that I enjoyed watching with others, I recommend for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Adventure Is Reborn - And it's better then before!,"The Mummy Returns is a definate ""must-see"" movie. It has Great Effects, great acting, a great story, all done, by amazing people! If you liked the first Mummy, you will LOVE this one. It has action, adventure, romance and comedy all the way through, it's great! I have found nothing wrong with it. The story was very well written by a great man, Stephen Sommers. This one is very funny and keeps you entertained all the way through. The music is superb as well, it is also nice that the main cast returns as well as 92 percent of the crew! At first I was not sure of Freddie Boath but as soon as I saw the first scene he was in I knew that if a child of that age can act that well, the so can all the adults. Anyone whose anyone must see this movie. Nothing bad can be said about it. So, get to the cinema now and relive the adventure started off in the first one, and continued in this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Overkill from the drawing board - But fun,"One SERIOUS recommendation before you watch this one: Watch ""The Mummy"" first! From there on it's much easier to see TMR in the right spirit - or not at all. For those who loved the first one - depending on WHAT they loved about it - the sequel will range from utter disappointment to utter fun. For those who didn't like ""The Mummy"" at all, there can only be one rule: Stay away from the sequel at all cost... and also from this comment.Right..., with that out of the way, we can go down to brass tactics. First: The sequel is no match for the original. ""The Mummy"" sported many of the virtues which made the 3 Indys adventure movie classics and can rightfully be called the best clone yet. The Indys are even more to be considered in so far as they are the only classic adventure movie series in existence which can boast a flawless line of equally good parts, one building on the other.That's where TMR fall seriously short. I guess it fell in the same cash-gilded trap as Episode I and, to a far lesser extent, Return Of The Jedi.EVERY scene is virtually screaming: ""We want to top the first one!"" But desperation never fares well in storytelling - especially in that genre. Someone had analyzed and dissected ""The Mummy"" into its 'obvious' aspects and labeled them for the sequel's spare parts depot. Nothing wrong in that - as long as someone has the wisdom to wait for the main ingredient which made the original a great movie: A good script. Almost every scene seems like a fast excuse for nifty visual effect. Almost every dialogue/gag seems like a carbon copy from the old script, just with an afterburner tied to every line. Pity that this time there isn't a decent story to bind the gags, and so it degenerates to a kind of choppy sitcom. That makes the fact that the gags are not half as good as the original's stand out even more.The weakness of the script puts an incredible drag on the movie's natural pace, which had to be compensated by an ever faster sequence of 'highlights' piled on each other without any support from the story. The by far weakest aspect of the script is sadly also the one which - if done right - could've pushed the whole project into the class of ""The Mummy"": The Baddies. They failed on each of them in a different way, but always with the same result. No real threat. The Mummy itself suffered from the typical sequel disease. Totally overdone and drowned in FX. No match for its former truly scary and also dangerously luring 'glory'. (No blame on the actor. He wrestled an impossible foe: A story which didn't really give a toss about him.)The Scorpion King: He was only a special effect right from the start until his bitter Playstation end. The Rock's attempts at 'Mineral wants to play Animal' didn't help there, of course. Such legends as the Scorpion King's aren't drawn from biceps but from real power - and The Rock's - I hesitate to say acting - was as powerful as a dead sheep plugged on to high voltage to make it twitch at the right moment.Ankh-Su-Namun: In a way, she is by far the most tragic failure in the 'threat department', because she had the greatest potential to STILL pull off the impossible after the two main baddies had pulled out on grounds of million dollar invisibility. While everyone on the team was frantically busy to create one WHOW! after the other, nobody noticed that they had far more than just a stunningly beautiful lady waiting in the wings to make the air move. While everybody was hamming like mad, Patricia Velasques took hold of the painfully few effective scenes she had and tackled them with almost too extreme economy, which made her stick out even more. The camera mostly treated her like a beautiful ornament glued to the appropriate biceps, or doing what second row minions do before the big one is at hand. Seen like that, PV turned impossible odds into an advantage. Like a black jaguar prowling every scene - 'almost' too quiet - 'almost' too understated - and ALWAYS ruling the screen. Sure, Patricia Velasques is a looker to define all lookers, and therefore already reason enough to watch this movie on purely aesthetic reasons, but in her case that's really just the icing on the cake. She has real presence. Give her half a decent line and half a decent scene to chill already yawning viewers, and suddenly you've got your threat to consider beyond the next bunch of FX extravaganzas. But alas..., all was wasted. They never gave her more than the occasional bone to feed on - and the most pathetic exit of all. A few coffee filled nights of brainstorming over the script to make her the real and unexpected danger - the real power rising, when none of the ancient Uber-Hunks is looking - would've given this predictable rumble of testosterone a REAL twist. Dark and quietly moving danger as the perfect counterweight to unhinge all the loudness running amok.Perfect. Ah, well...As far as the 'goodies' are concerned, the acting was adequate and fitting the glossy but pretty empty frame. John Hannah, though, was even more wasted than in the first one, since they turned his character into a truly annoying fool, now. But on the whole, this goes for everyone on the cast. They were better than the story deserved. Hamming til the cows came out was the only way to give this wreck the fitting 'glue' and save it from falling totally apart.Which brings me to the plus-side of this movie. Yes, there is one. Above all, it's fun, once expectations have been leveled to just that. And, oddly enough, it grows on you, if you're prepared to give it a second chance at home. Once, you've stopped caring for the overall story, you begin to appreciate the 'set pieces' - and there are quite a few to enjoy.The effects range from stunning to ridiculous. The whole movie takes much less care of believability and coherence of atmosphere than the first one, and that's a serious drawback on the general tone. It's now closer to a Fantasy romp than an Indy type adventure. That's why - in the end - this movie's more like a collection of more or less good set pieces, failing to merge into a story, but also leaving some honestly entertaining moments behind. There are far worse ways to spend a fun evening at home.Schogger13",,Anonymous,Fantasy

turkey alert!,"After seeing the ""Mummy,"" and enjoying it a great deal, the sequel was an enormous letdown.  The plot elements (what little of them there were) I found contrived... my husband and I were actually laughing out loud at parts we can only presume the director intended not to be humorous (as were others in the movie theater).I was rooting for the Mummy (Vosloo) to ""eat"" the protagonists (excepting Oded Fehr), unfortunately ""Rick"" and ""Evy"" were simply too two-dimensional to make a decent meal....  For me the best part of the movie was the fight scene at the end... NOT because of horrid ""special"" effects with the Scorpion King, but because of Arnold Vosloo's beefy bod (stripped to the trews, by gum!).Can be entertaining if viewed under the influence of a great dose of satirical humor.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great sequel to an awesome movie,"I'm reviewing simply because this movie unjustly has only 6.4 out of 10 stars.The only downside to this movie is the Scorpion King's CGI.But come on! Pygmy mummies?! The Anubis army?! It more than makes up for it.I will always love this movie. I didn't bother with the third movie, as the recasting of Evie was unforgivable.Great eye candy with Rick, Ardeth, Jonathan, and The Mummy himself. A few nods to the original movie are sprinkled within as a callback.Perhaps if they'd extended the opening to allow the CGI to be completed, this movie would rate 10 out of 10 stars, but as it is, it's a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
MORE OF THE SAME,"Ten years after the events of the first film, Rick and Evelyn O'Connell are settled in 1935 London, where they are raising their son. When a chain of events finds the corpse of Imhotep resurrected, the O'Connells go on a desperate race to save the world from unspeakable evil and to rescue their son before it is too late. The Mummy Returns is still good, old-fashioned, serial-throwback fun. It has also an amazing soundtrack from Alan Silvestri. Overall, the film probably offers what fans of The Mummy are expecting. This movie is essentially more of the same.

This movie should be wrapped in bandages ....,"This is the worst movie I have seen in some time.  My excuse for going to see it is I didn't see the first one.   I rarely get itchy feet while at a movie but 15 minutes into this one I started wondering how long it was going to be.  There is no character development.This movie certainly proves that special effects don't make a movie. The effects were great but when you don't have a connection, its like watching something cool for a few minutes then its time to leave.  The characters are all artificial, superficial, two dimensional things that don't behave in any way approaching a normal person.  The man and woman are either in gut wrenching danger or kissing.  And even the kissing was boring since there is no build up - its like, ok, can we have a kiss - camera, action - its a take.  Yawn!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Promised greats things, delivered quite a few.","This movie promised great things, and delivered quite a few of them. From the beginning, the pace of the movie kept you enthralled- if a little exhausted, with the impressively shot fight scenes, the dazzling special effects (best viewed at the cinema for a more 'awe-inspiring' result), the great chemistry between the two leads (Rachel Weisz and Brendan Frasier as the 'O'Connells') and the perfomances of such scene stealers as Freddie Boath as the mischievous, accident-prone son of the O'Connell's, Patricia Velazquez as the reincarnation of Anak-su-namun, and the intense screen-presence of Arnold Vosloo as the infamous Imhotep. However, as a fan of the first movie, I found certain aspects of the plot a little hard to accept and if I may dare to say- far fetched, despite the fact that the movie admittedly and thankfully does not take itself seriously. This included, without giving too much away, the whole Evie and Rick reincarnation business *cue flesh-revealing flashbacks* Diehard fans of the first movie will find one particular aspect of the plot distressing, again without giving too much away, let me just say this: Wasn't Imhotep the man with whom Anak-su-namun possessed an eternal bond? The man for whom she was willing to sacrifice herself to be with in the first movie? The same man she shared half the first movie with in dealing with their everlasting devotion? I'll say no more.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rachel Weisz is fantastic,"I got a chance to see Rachel Weisz in a dark movie last night, but she really shines in this film. I continue to be impressed by her range. It's not a great film by any measure, but it is good fun. Weisz's duel with Patricia Velasquez as the reincarnated Anck-su-Namun was incredible.This is, in one sense, a family movie, al la ""True Lies."" Dad (Brendon Frazier), mom (Weisz) and son (Freddie Boath) all fight together to defeat Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo). There is even a kooky brother-in-law (John Hannah) - a real family adventure.This is the second film for ""The Rock."" He was in ""Longshot,"" but way down on the billing as a mugger. Here he rises to prominence in a cast, but his character is quite ridiculous. It's something out of a ""B"" movie.All in all, if you are looking for some mindless entertainment on a Saturday night, this film can frequently be found on USA.

Yeah, there's an annoying kid added to the mix, but along with him comes a grander scope; as well as a gun-toting Evy as protective mom (ruggedness suits her). Definitely more emphasis on action scenes and special effects, and it's just busier overall.

Action at a furious pace!,"First of all, I'm not very impartial because I am a great fan of the director of this movie, Stephen Sommers. All the expectations I had were completely fulfilled. This movie has got everything that I want to see in a movie of this kind and from this director: plenty of great, well - performed action underlined by a perfect sense of entertaining humor in combination with a bit of love and drama (fortunately not too much of it). The action continues without ever stopping and totally entertains you in the course of the 130 minutes. Stephen Sommers surpasses himself with each movie he makes and I'm already looking forward to watching `Van Helsing' which is also written AND directed by Sommers. In my opinion his name has to be mentioned at one stroke along with other great action - directors like John McTiernan, John Woo, Renny Harlin, Wolfgang Petersen, Michael Bay and James Cameron.

If I could UN-see it I would,"Rarely do I stumble upon movies that make me feel insulted merely to have seen them. The mummy returns could have been a great movie. The story behind it is decent, the special effects - I must give them that - were awesome. But when it comes to the script and the casting there's a few people in Hollywood that should be arrested. The movie is a perfect example of how a movie that could have been good turns bad through the greed of the movie companies. Children never had a place in movies. Very few have managed to incorporate children into the story line, but not one managed to let a child play a major part without the story be made to suffer. We saw it in Star Wars Episode 1, Jurassic Park and now in the mummy returns. In all these movies the story was made to suffer to make the movie more attractive for children, thus producing more money in ticket and merchandise sales. Now it would be one thing if in fact the movie was targeted for the younger audience (like Jurassic Park). Then I would have nothing bad to say about it. I'm 22 years of age, way too old to watch children's movies. But the movie isn't. With the amount of violence actually there, there's no way it could get around an age 13-rating. And I'll tell you what else, there's a ton of movies targeted for children out there that grownups CAN enjoy! I'm not going to go further into why the child part annoys me so much, I am sure you are all intelligent beings who know exactly what I'm talking about. The child actor in the movie is not the only part that destroyed the movie as a whole. The general theme of the lead actors being literally invulnerable (read: immortal) insults my intelligence as an audience member to the greatest. I'm not normally one that spots movie goofs, but in this one there were a hundred and more. You want to see what a good action movie with this theme should be like, rent Indiana Jones.

The storyline's quite different, and the action scenes are, if anything, better. Yes, there are plotholes, particularly when you combine the two stories of the original movie and the sequel, and the immense commercial throughought the movie for the Scorpion King movie with the Rock was horrificaly bad.

The Mummy Returns,"I loved this movie because it interest me. This movie came out in the year of 2001. I personally always thought that mummies are interesting. I love reading about them. I watched all the Mummy movies with Branden Fraiser in it. For some odd reason, the second always had my vote. Every time it comes on the television i would always watch it. It kind of reminds me of Indiana Jones. I love things that uses clues. I also love mysteries and puzzles. Every time it comes on my family always leave me in the room that i'm watching it in. They say that i am weird. My favorite characters are the Majai,Imhotep,Anck-Sunamun,Rick,and Evelyn. I love how they acted. They certainly had the right people playing their roles. I loved the graphics. Overall, This movie is a 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolute Drivel,"Overblown effects, protracted, idiotic plot, two-dimensional acting, pathetic ""emoting"" in lieu of any real feeling, ludicrous, uninspired, unbelievable dialogue.For the life of me, I can't fathom how something with effects so big (and obviously expensive) can't have a halfway decent plot and semi-believeable dialogue. It's as if the producers threw 95% of the budget into the effects and 5% into thescreenplay, which seems like an afterthought at best.Talk about wasted talent! Brendan Fraser is a fine comedic actor whose talents are barely tapped in this sophomoric tale of derring-doo doo. Remember those paint by numbers paintings as a kid. This is acting by the numbers. I can just hear the director saying, ""OK, now you've got to look sad here.""Unlike good movies where you tend to get drawn in and involved in the plot and actually begin to care about the characters, I was well aware I was watching a movieÑfinding it exceedingly hard to suspend my disbeliefÑand never developed any empathy whatsoever for any of the characters.I've decided after this film NOT to go see any film just because of the effects. You can have the greatest effects, but if you have a banal plot and insipid dialogue, you have a worthless piece of celluloid.The only niche I could genuinely see enjoying this film are 10-year-old boys who are intrigued and excited by the gee-whiz factor.

A Worthy Sequel To The Great Franchise,"The second installment to the franchise this movie does live up to every expectation. And is the rare thing, but this movie surpasses its original. For the people that love an adventure movie this is a must watch.Brief: Set 10 years after the first movie, where Imhotep is being resurrected and this time he wanted to rule the world and be immortal. To do so, he have to kidnapped Rick's son who is the chosen one to guide them to the mystical place of Scorpion King pyramid.Though not very accurate nor sophisticated as the previous film, the movie is being substitute with more entertainment and more action, and it was an absolute blast to watch. The story is brilliant and the best part is there has been a characters development and the introduction of the new character adds more freshness to the film.What I like most about this movie is an endless action scenes, that is unlike ""don't talk, just shoot"" kind of movie. This is fun from the beginning till end, though many parts of the movie are over done. What disappoints about this movie is the CGI of Scorpion King, which look absolutely fake and it was one of the worst animation I have ever seen and that really put me off. Why every single animation in the movie is awesome, the most importance character ends up so plastic like.Lastly, it is truly a worthy sequel to the great franchise.Reason To Watch: The Story Continue Brilliantly From The First Movie.Reason Not To: The CGI of Scorpion King is Horrendous.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-).Rate Y/N After Read, Thanks",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Maintains the fun of its predecessor at the expense of any dignity the franchise had left.,"Early in ""The Mummy Returns,"" sequel to Universal's 1999 blockbuster remake ""The Mummy,"" charming American swashbuckler Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) fights a cadre of decomposed Egyptian corpses on the back of a London double-decker. Also on the bus is Rick's wife/scholar Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), to whom he laments, ""This is bad!"" ""We've had bad before,"" Evelyn replies. Rick: ""This is worse!"" Indeed! As is the whole of ""The Mummy Returns,"" a film so ludicrously over the top and blindly made that even after Warner Brothers' dismal ""Wild Wild West"" featuring jets retrofitted to a flying bicycle, this film put the jets on a flying boat.Explaining the plot of ""The Mummy Returns"" in detail is about as necessary as cooking directions on Pop-Tarts: Ten-or-so years after the events in ""The Mummy,"" Rick and Evelyn must search the globe for their son Alex (Freddie Boath) who, after trying on a bracelet that was actually an ancient artifact belonging to a Babylonian-era warlord named The Scorpion King (The Rock), becomes a human map to a mythical oasis where The King awaits an opponent who, if victorious, will take control of his armies and have the power to rule the world. The kidnapper was none other than Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), the eponymous ghoul and former high priest thwarted by O'Connell in the first film, now resurrected by the voluptuous Meela Nais (Patricia Valasquez), reincarnation of Anck Su Namun, the ancient beauty whom Imhotep shared a fatal affair with thousands of years ago. The evil pair plan to find the oasis and defeat The Scorpion King, and thus, like a biblical Bonnie and Clyde, set the whole gory story into motion.And those are just the broad strokes! Along the way we encounter the usual hoards of faceless, black-cloaked baddies with guns, the not-so-usual undead soldiers, and the flat-out weird and nasty little pygmy-mummies--everything coated with the oh-so-easy-to-swallow zombie in-jokes of ghouls bobbling their own decapitated heads.All that said, ""The Mummy Returns"" maintains all the fun of its predecessor (if only at the expense of any dignity the franchise had left.) This is a movie that knows it's bad (and boy is it bad!), that knows it's the ultimate product of the Hollywood machine--and is damn proud of it! It's undeniably great to see O'Connell leap and tumble his way out of ridiculously overwhelming odds--literally one wrong step from being horribly gored in front of his child. At the film's climax, O'Connell is engaged in a battle against the new and CGI improved Scorpion King (complete with giant scorpion legs and torso). As I watched Brendan Fraser (and/or his stuntman) dodge the unstoppable claws of the rendered-Rock's intimidating mandible, it occurred to me that I hadn't seen such wickedly intense choreography of actor and CGI since Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore tangoed beautifully with a pair of hungry velociraptors in ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" (another enjoyable franchise-destroyer). For ""The Mummy Returns,"" VFX supervisor John Andrew Burton Jr. and a very extended team brought this sequence to life.Fraser has always plunged headfirst into roles that even the most work-starved actor might shy away from (""Encino Man,"" ""Looney Toons: Back In Action,"" ""Monkeybone""), and does so with such enthusiasm that we never feel embarrassed for him. Here he embraces Rick O'Connell in all his two-dimensionality where others might abandon the role, and the character survives because of him.Joining Rick and Evelyn are Evelyn's unscrupulous-yet-lovable bro Jonathan (John Hannah) and the melodramatic guru-warrior Ardeth Bey (that dude with all the Arabic writing on his cheeks, played by Oded Fehr), who also serves as the film's interim historian, giving us any and all back story needed without all the bother of exposition or creative storytelling. An enjoyable chemistry and timing has developed between these actors in just two films. There truly is a sense of camaraderie; We find it quite easy, for example, to accept Jonathan's momentary turn of seriousness toward the end of the film after two acts of comedy because the other actors know just how to respond to him (Hannah is possibly the best Scottish actor alive, see ""Sliding Doors"").Of course, the bulk of the film is lighthearted, and any melodrama is taken with a grain of salt--not least of all by screenwriter/director Sthephen Sommers, who plays up the group-fun-breeziness that worked so well with the first mummy movie; Upon seeing the forbidden bracelet on Alex's arm, Ardeth decrees grimly, ""By putting on the bracelet, you have started a chain reaction that could bring about the next apocalypse."" Fraser looks at Ardeth, ""Hey, you, lighten up."" I suppose that's Sommers' best and only defense against critics like Peter Travers of Rolling Stone who (justifiably) called his film ""A p!ss poor mummy movie indeed that doesn't deliver a damn thing worth preserving.""""Hey, Peter, lighten up.""",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Worthy Sequel To The Mummy,"Making effective use of the very same ingredients that made its predecessor a surprise success, The Mummy Returns is a worthy follow-up to The Mummy that brings slight improvements in almost all filmmaking departments to provide its viewers another hell of a rollicking adventure that stays true to the original while also being more entertaining this time.Set 10 years after the events of the first film, the story of The Mummy Returns brings back Rick & Evelyn O'Connell, along with their son Alex, against the High Priest Imhotep who has again risen from the dead but this time is looking for the Bracelet of Anubis in order to gain control of The Scorpion King's army, thus once again endangering the fate of all mankind.Written & directed by Stephen Sommers who returns to the franchise he created with more action, humour & fun sequences and does a wonderful job at it. The premise is light-hearted as expected but the improvements are very much noticeable in visual effects, music, set pieces & few performances if not in writing which lack the freshness that the original had.On an overall scale, The Mummy Returns is a welcome addition to The Mummy franchise that builds upon the foundation laid by the first chapter to succeed as another lively, cheerful & highly enjoyable extravaganza and does enough to satisfy most fans of the original. Once again not meant to be taken seriously, this adventurous sequel is almost as good as its predecessor, if not better.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Merry old England has a mummy amuck.,"This time out I am less critical, because this runs circles around the first entry in '99. Brendan Fraser is much easier to take as the ultimate reluctant hero. Of course he is very ""whipped"" and who wouldn't be partnered with Rachel Weisz? She impresses me more than ever. What a stunning looker and a very athletic actress. The couple's son played by Freddie Boath can at times be a pain in the butt. The story line plays a back row seat to the special effects and almost non-stop action.Rick and 'Evie' O'Connell not only have to control the awakened mummy of High Priest Imhotep(Arnold Vosloo); they also have to fend off the likes of 'sand soldiers', pygmies, scorpions and the Scorpion King himself played by professional wrestler Dwayne(The Rock)Johnson.Also appearing in this fun time summer thriller are Oded Fehr, John Hannah and Shaun Parkes.

Bring That Mummy on Again,"All the key players are back for this more spectacular variation of the new Mummy villain - an Egyptian high priest thousands of years old with many supernatural powers. The first 5 minutes, with the new character The Scorpion King essayed by The Rock, actually outdoes the '99 film right off the bat; everything is more, as is the case with such sequels - about 10%-15% more, like a formula. The box office grosses seem to bear this out - throw in more, and the crowds will come - this out-grossed the '99 movie. But, more what, really? More money spent on the special computer FX? That's it. When commenting on a film such as this, it's more appropriate to focus on 'the ILM guys' - the ones who construct all the fake armies and sprouting foliage out of nowhere. Did they spend the computer money well, is the main question. I suppose so. I'm not a computer FX expert.I am familiar with movies such as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and its own sequels. The '99 Mummy movie was derivative of those adventures and this is a copy of the '99 movie. So all the stuff in the old crypts and hidden tunnels and funky pyramids is very old (no pun intended) by now. The scouring beetles make a brief early appearance and still manage to creep out a bit, but the rest is just a slightly enlarged/expanded take on the menace of the same old Mummy. They advanced the story a few years from the previous movie, indicated by the new son of the two main characters (Fraser & Weisz). And this is the only new element, the threat to the young son, which deviates from the first flic. ""The Scorpion King"" offshoot picture arrived soon after this but what really surprises me about the franchise is that no 3rd Mummy picture has surfaced, yet. Money speaks more than a Mummy, as they say.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"The Mummy Returns, postage due.","I'll start by saying I liked the movie. No, it wasn't as good as the first. I wouldn't even say the effects were as good as the first (which I rewatched the night before on DVD). The cool ""face effect"" is back. More than once. Not done quite as well, either. While I thought the idea of what happens to the Scorpion King was good, the effect used to pull it off doesn't quite make it. Too many characters, not enough plot. If you like One-liners, you'll have something to look forward to.So, why did I like the movie with all this going against it? The action never stops. The movie hits the ground running and keeps going. Yes, the final rescue is more than a little silly, but the ""Yes it is!"" line (nearly) makes up for it. It's not a great movie, and it knows it. It IS a fun movie, and it does that well.If you're looking for a movie like War And Peace, why the heck did you go see a movie called ""The Mummy Returns"" ?

Better than I expected!!!!!!,"Ever since 1999 i longed for the time when a movie director would realise that a sequal to the Mummy is a brilliant idea, and finally my waiting came to a close with the Mummy Returns! YES!My original thoughts from the trailer was this is going to be the movie of the year, possible comparing with Lord Of The Rings and Shrek. We didn't go to see the movie until the craze was almost over, we knew that all the cinemas would be packed, but eventually we went to see it.After seeing the movie i can tell ya, this movies has everything, Action, Graphics, Laughter, Sadness, Romance, History and a good few twists, i am not going to give it away but trust me if you havent seen this movie, when its available on DVD or VHS or to RENT get it quick!There is nothing i can put down about this movie apart from possible to things, The Rock's acting and the Scoprion King Grahpics. The rock's acting is so useless on the opening shot when he screams some sort of battle cry (""AKU MACENTAY"") you neerly wanna run out of the cinema crying. Then once the Scorpion King makes a deal with the Rock to have his soul, the rock is not seen till the end of the movie, in which he returns as a 10ft Scorpion which looks like something of Resident Evil, and trust me its not only the same sort of thing, it looks the same, the graphics on that shot are, a bad word.Apart from that this movie was a crack, a real storm, you really do get you're money worth.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A worthy, enjoyable ride.","I liked the new direction they took Evie, making her more like aCameron woman: tough. Very different from how she began in thefirst film, but it still works. I like strong women in film. I hate the""Help me, James,"" you so often get in Bond movies. So seeingRachel come out as this tough broad willing to risk her neck andnot afraid to get down and dirty with the boys in order to save herfamily was very cool.Rick's a bit older, and more cautious. He's got a family now anddoesn't want anything to happen to them. His best moments arewhen Evie or his son, Alex, are in danger.Speaking of Alex, the kid (Freddie Boath, I think) who plays him isreally good. A fine addition to the cast.The rest of the returning cast is fine as well, especially Oded. Hegets beat up pretty good, but he's got some great scenes.Acting-wise, the film is strong.It's the effects that really mar the film. You can tell the movie wasrushed into theaters, unfortunately. They really should havepushed this back till November. The old Mummy effects andassorted returning tricks from the original look fine, but a greatmany of the new stuff looks bad. The hot air balloon, in particular,looks fake in almost every shot. And the final CG for the ScorpionKing, not too give too much away, is almost laughable. It reallylooks silly. I've heard complaints that Anubis's dog warriors lookedfake, but hey, they're dog warriors - how real did you expect them tolook? They're fine. They get the job done.There's also much less humor this time. The film is darker. Thegross factor has been pushed up a bit. What humor there isdepends a great deal on having seen the first film.What works, though, are the personal relationships of thecharacters. I really bought into Rick and Evie's relationship, andthat these people care for each other, and were willing to die forone another. There is a very interesting juxtaposition of theirrelationship and the one between Imhotep and Anck-Su-Anum,culminating in a final moment for all four. The way each reacts totheir corresponding counterpart in that one moment is the realresolution of the film, despite anything else that may occur after it.As for the action, everything has been turned up a notch. While thefirst had a fairly long passage in the middle with only one shortaction sequence (on the boat), this film races from one actionsequence to another. It never really stops to take its breath. Somemay say this is a bad thing, but it never loses sight of the principalcharacters along the way, and the action is strong.The threat is also more real this time, culminating in the death ofone of the returning leads, rather than a side character like Benifrom the first film. It's a shock that works for its immediacy andpotency.Like its predecessor, the film is driven not by the men, but bywomen (and, in this case, children). It is Evie and Anck-Su-Anumwho propel the story forward, along with young Alex, and who forcethings to their eventual conclusion. Even The Mummy himselfalmost takes a back seat on the ride, as the O'Connells are forcedto deal with myriad bad guys. But he pops up every once in a whileto muss their hair and make up. To see an action film driven not bymen but by women is a rarity, and even more rare is one thatworks for a male audience. But this one does.All in all, the film is a fine sequel. I missed the humor of theoriginal, and the effects should have been given more time, but theaction is good, and the characterization is strong. This isn't just aremake of the original. They took the story in a new direction andturned things up a notch. The core of the film is the O'Connellfamily. If you buy into them and their relationship, and care for themas they care for one another, then you'll live with the occasionalawful CG and won't bemoan the lack of humor too much. If not,then it's going to be a very long film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just one summer movie,"Abuse of CGI effects? yes; More action than in the first one? yes; Do you need to have the brain of Einstein to understand it? No!; Is it sophisticated and will it prevail for the rest of the eternity? No; but...is it still worth watching? Completely!; Is it a fun movie that complies with what people expect from summer movies? Absolutely!!!.Spiderman-like mummies, pigmey mummies, two bad guys instead of one, 100 more special effects, twice the action including more than 100,000 bullets shot, a huge army of Anubises and the images that supposedly represent Egypt 3,000 years ago all golden and rich; what else would you like? Maybe a little more originality, but this is Hollywood and that is not possible most of the times.Is there anything wrong of using your eyes instead of your brains for having fun? I hope not, because I don't do that on summer adventure/action movies. Instead, try to take the movie for what it is, a continuation of the money making movie from 1999 to make even more money this time giving people a little more of the same thing the other did. Having that in mind, don't expect Oscar material in this movie, but just two hours of adventure, romance, an Indiana Jones-like score and money spent in its making, etc. And then, I assure you that you might have a pleasant time and a smile at the end of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Mindless summer fun, and cheese","Some of the movies that are the most fun to watch are the action adventure films that come out each summer. They cram lots of special effects, fighting, running and everything else that makes a movie vibrate into about 90 minutes.Unfortunately, that rarely makes these summer flicks *good* movies. Even allowing for the mindlessness of a summer film, I had a hard time with aspects of Mummy 2. I gave it a 6, and only because of the fact it was intended to be a summer film.First, I don't know what Brendan Fraser is doing, but his portrayal of an action hero in the Indiana Jones tradition is awkward. Fraser bounces back and forth between sentimental husband and savy adventurer, able to snatch snakes and knives out of the air. He even *walks* funny, kind of hunched over, gorilla-like. The sequel (and the original) make great efforts to tell us, through dialogue, that Fraser's character is blunt and more likely to fight and ask questions later than think his way out of a tough situation. And yet this same character is so sensitive to his wife, and so aware of the needs of those around him, that his ""action guy"" mode seems out of place. He is too smart and too caring to be the fearless hero.Second, why in the world did this movie create a very cheesy ""scorpion king monster"" in the finale? That was probably the most fake looking monster, especially the face (which was The Rock's face, sort of), I have seen since that 1982ish movie about Perseus and the Greek gods who manipulated him. You kept expecting this scorpion thing to speak, and we had several close-ups of the enraged face, but all it ever did was roar. And this was supposed to be the latest version of a great warrior bent on taking over the world? He seemed as smart as a rock (no pun intended).Finally, several actors/roles were all wrong, or at least not done well. Izzy, the dirigible-for-hire guy, was supposed to provide comic relief, I guess. But his delivery and English accent were far too sophisticated to be convincing for the kind of rogue-for-hitre character he played. The character who was curator at the British museum and as well as the person who was bringing Ahotep back from the dead made no sense. What was his motivation? We never saw Ahotep reward anyone except his woman. Why help him?Still, the movie was loud, fast and mostly fun, even if it made little sense.

The Mummy with a stinger,"The Mummy always returns - one way or another that is. In this case it is the sequel for the 1999 movie that was quite succesful. Actually this one was succesful as well - or at least that is what the numbers I see suggest to me. Not sure how the movie producers saw them. Might still not have been enough for them.But especially during the opening act, I was wondering, why didn't they make more of them? Well they did 7 years after this one ... and there was a spin off - Scorpion King - that had more sequels than this one. To be fair the sequels of the spin off were made for the home market (DVD and or streaming that is).Still this begins strong, with another story of another villain, in this case played by Dwayne Johnson (or the Rock as many know him). The beginning is quite nice, but you can see the imperfect CGI there too. It does not get better from that point on.While the humor and the characters have been carried over, this seems even more tongue in cheeck and even more aware of what it does to its audience. For better or worse.Back to the CGI though ... which is one of the most horrific ones you will encounter, especially towards the end. I do wonder if the Rock can watch this - it is hideous to say the least and he is the ... well face of it. Sorry but that pun practically wrote itself.Anyway this still is fun, but not as much as the first one was.

Entertaining but...,"It starts off very well and for the most part, this movie moves along at a very decent pace ALMOST the whole time. Velasques is a intriguing villainess and Weisz charming as heroine. They have also supplied this movie with a lot (and I do mean A LOT) of computer-animated images. Most of them are very impressive (like the wall of water in a ravine), but some fall flat and look fake. A reviewer referred to this movie as ""Brendan and the 101 computer-images"" and it's a fairly accurate description. It's a good, almost old-fashioned, matinee-movie where only a few images may be unsettling for a minor. However, I got a slightly dizzy feeling watching this. In a sequel you always know that they are going to do something more spectacular according to the ""bigger is better""-philosophy. And here they have thrown in almost everything imaginable and after a while I found myself saying ""oh, please. Not that too!"". The balloon-ships arrival was such a case. They should have cut some things out and left a more tightwoven plot, because I found the film just a bit too long. Otherwise I have nothing bad to say about this. All this movie wants is to entertain and that it does! The actors do their job fairly well, but take a back-seat to all the spectacular images and effects.

The Scorpion King was good but was ultimately superficial but the O'Connell offspring was a tad irritating. Everything else is frighteningly samey, even certain plot devices were recycled. Once again we are treated to Imhotep's face chasing our heroes and we get another oddball pilot.Of note is the substantial amount of visual effects the viewer is assaulted with. Some were great (the oasis) but some were rather disappointing (the Scorpion King) but as a whole they worked well and gave a film a nice sheen.All in all rather fun but nothing new. People who watched the first film will know what to expect. Just leave your brain at home, sit back and enjoy. I give this a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I still gained the desired entertainment from it.,"'The Mummy Returns' feels to me to be a downgrade on the original, though I still gained the desired entertainment from it. There is an absolute barrage of special effects used in this though, I said in my previous review about it aging badly - it's worse here.I still wouldn't say that the below par effects affected my enjoyment terribly much, like last time, but due to the (what felt like) increase of its usage it definitely becomes a bit of an eyesore this time out. The Scorpion King towards the conclusion looks particularly poor, I gotta say.Cast-wise, I could copy and paste what I said about the 1999 flick. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are good together, I like the addition of their son (played well by Freddie Boath) into the mix. Also in my review of 'The Mummy', I noted that I wanted more of Oded Fehr, well I got that wish delivered here.Quite interesting to see Dwayne Johnson appear as The Scorpion King, a character (and therefore franchise; five of them!) that I never knew existed until very recently. Given Johnson's upward acting trajectory since these films, I assume he didn't appear in all of those other spin-offs; I'll soon find out, intrigued to watch 'em either way.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The same magic plus The Rock!!!,"When you approach a sequel the danger is not meeting the expectations of the audience, not honouring the characters established in the first film and not recreating the magic. The Mummy Returns doesn't have any of these problems, the cast is back and they're clearly still loving it, heroes and villains alike. There are some additions to the cast like Freddie Boath as Alex O'Connell and The Rock as the Scorpion King both of whom do a great job, but we're here to see Mr and Mrs O'Connell take on the evil Imhotep and we're not disappointed.
Action, adventure, romance and a lot of fun as Rick retains his shoot first, second and third approach to problems. Rachel Weisz as Evelyn gets more action and responds with aplom and John Hannah continues to be a fine comedic foil.
Mummies, mini mummies, huge undead Jackal armies and more are thrown at the cast, topped by the return of Imhotep and Anck Su Namun who also get to develop their characters and relationship to a heartbreaking degree and they provide one of the most tragic and moving parts of what is essentially a fantastic popcorn movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Yet Another Example Of Overkill,"Here is another ""Class A exhibit"" on how to turn a successful, appealing movie into a ludicrous stupid one with a sequel that overkills everything that worked in the first movie.When the 1999 film, ""The Mummy"" came out, it features a likable family: husband, wife and young son - battling all kinds of strange and fascinating foes in ancient Egypt. It was simply a fun movie with awesome special-effects that dazzled millions of theater-goers. The story was ludicrous but took a back seat to the astounding visuals and the nice family whom we could root for.Then the sequel comes out - Mummy 2, if you will - and now (a) the wife (played by Rachel Weisz) has turned macho; (b) the kid is now a mouthy snot; (c) the action scenes have gone from a good number to an excessive amount where it is two hours of non-stop mayhem; (d) the sound has gone from loud to ear-shattering. In other words, here we go again with ""excess"""" or ""overkill,.""It's too much....way too much....and so poorly done I am not surprised a third in the series hasn't been released, although rumors have it there will be another in 2008. I can't imagine how bad that one will be if imitates this one.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Could Use Tighter Wrapping,"`The Mummy Returns' brings back most, but not all the elements that made `The Mummy' such a hoot; i.e., exotic locales, larger than life characters, genuine humor and breakneck action.  However, suspense, which was not a hot commodity even in the first `Mummy' is TOTALLY absent here.Fortunately, all of the surviving principals are back.  However, Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor), the weasel, is sorely missed, and not altogether satisfactorily replaced.  Worse, there are TOO many villains, none of whom are given adequate screen time.  One would certainly wish for more of a contribution by Arnold Vosloo (the mummy).  Rachel Weisz looks incredibly fetching.  However, her ego must have gotten the best of her.  Can you imagine ANYONE explore insect-infested ruins wearing a Wonderbra and supermodel makeup?  Rachel probably couldn't stand how everyone (at least every male) stood up to take notice at Patricia Valazquez first appearance in `The Mummy,' wearing makeup and very little else.  Here Valazquez's most prominent assets are kept discretely tucked in her blouse (at least in the `contemporary' sequences), and she wears no makeup (a decision I am sure was dictated by Weisz).  Weisz needn't have worried.  Inept acting is a turnoff, and Valazquez is laughable in her key contemporary scene with Vosloo.The movie jumps into the action portion of the plot way too quickly, which results in the brief lulls intended to build suspense building tedium instead.  The movie also promises us `The Rock,' who appears only in the flashbacks.  Instead, the `contemporary' climax gives us a phony-looking computer generated scorpion with `The Rock's' features.Even with all its shortcomings, `The Mummy Returns' is one heck of a ride, a worthy, if slightly inferior successor to `The Mummy.'",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Good Mummy-movie,"If you liked The Mummy you are absolutely going to like this, there is a lot of action, mummies, evil Egyptians and awesome special effects. The two movies are connected in a very nice way, actually making the original better after seeing the sequel. It's a good mummy-movie with some beautiful shots and it sure is entertaining. It's actually somewhat better than the original since the story is better and more intense than the original.7 out of 10",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nearly but nearly,"This is much more of an action film than the 1999 ""The Mummy"" and it so nearly matches or beats that film...but it doesn't for me.What are great are the battles, the interplay between Jonathan and Alex, the scenery both real and CGI, the British Museum resurrection of Imhotep, the O'Connells, Izzy, Ardeth Bay, the balloon, the Rock in battle, Imhotep's rejection by Anck-su-Amun and the general whoosh of action whose pace never lets up.There are lots of good touches like all the mummies in the British Museum coming to life at the same time or Izzy filling in some of O'Connell's past misdeeds and a few cheesy cliches like the dirigible floating across a huge moon a la E.T.What let it down were the lack of a real narrative once the bracelet was off, the Rock looked in perfect health when supposedly close to death in the desert, the awful CGI of the Scorpion King ( whoever thought that was close to flesh colour needs a new colour chart ) and those terrible pygmy mummies at the oasis where the fight just went on and on and on.It was fun but it could have been greater :-) and I don't think the Rock can carry the third film on his own :-(",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I've seen this movie, it was called ""The Mummy.""","First, let me say, I really enjoyed the first ""The Mummy.""  ""The Mummy Returns"" is almost as good.  I knock it a bit for being too much like the first one in some spots, but not similar enough in the places it counts. Strangely enough I believe this was deliberate on the part of the director, but whatcha gonna do?  The primary thing I noticed is this movie takes itself even less seriously than the first.  It has an almost cartoon-like quality in certain spots which really threw me for a loop.  However, it's still a fun time film that you really couldn't ask more of.  Thank god ""The Rock"" had such a tiny role.  Watch for ""The Scorpion King"" prequel scheduled to come out 2002.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Fantastic Movie,"The Mummy Returns is filled with action, comedy and is a wonderful movie. If you like action packed movies then go see The Mummy Returns. It proves once again that a sequel can be just as good, if not better than the original. This is probably Brendan Fraiser's best performance yet.  With wonderful performances from Brendan Frasier, Rachel Weiz, and John Hannah this is the first summer hit of 2001. The Mummy Returns starts off ten years after The Mummy (1999).  Rick O Connell (Frasier) is now married to Evelyn and they have a son.  They then uncover the long lost bracelet of the Scorpion King played by WWF's The Rock.  They then are joined up by Imotep and some other foes, and plan to destroy the Scorpion King and gain control of his army so he can rule the Earth.  In order to save their son and stop the mummy from controlling the Earth, they must stop Imotep and the Scorpion King themselves before the world becomes a formless wasteland. WWF fans maybe disappointed however.  The Rock, in his film debut is only in two scenes throughout the entire movie.  He truly outdoes himself plating the Scorpion King, a warrior who gives his soul to become the ultimate warrior.  Although it's a small role, The Rock gives a great performance as the Scorpion King.  All that time in the wrestling ring has really paid off for him in his new role as the Scorpion King. Although some sequels have been known to be bombs at the box office, this movie is a nonstop thrill ride.  It's filled with action, comedy, romance and everything else that makes a movie an instant favorite at the box office.  Only a few sequels however have measured up to the original.  This one is worth seeing again.  The whole cast gave an outstanding performance. From 1 to 10, I would have to give The Mummy Returns a 7.8, for its outstanding performances and the well thought out plot. Brendan Frasier and the rest of the group do a fantastic job in The Mummy Returns.  The summer of 2001 is nearly here and I suggest going to go see The Mummy Returns. If you like The Mummy Returns, then here are some recommendations for movies you should see.  First, you might wish to see The Mummy, so you may see for yourself how the original compares to the sequel.  Some other movies you might want to see if you enjoyed The Mummy Returns, would probably be the Indiana Jones Trilogy (The Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade).",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
absolutely fabulous!,"I went to the sneak preview last night, and the movie well exceeded my expectations.  The special effects were phenomenal and the story and action never stop.  Just when you think you can stop holding your breath, they catch you completely by surprise.

MORE PATRICIA VELASQUEZ!!,"""The Mummy"" was a fun, enjoyable action film with great special effects. ""The Mummy Returns"" is pretty much the same. If you liked the first there is no way you could not like this.Instead of Imhotep's face in a giant sandstorm he is there in a giant wall of water. Still cool. There are generally a little more digital FX's, which is neither good nor bad; that is the way it is.There are some DIFFERENCES. The bad ones are that there is a bit less character development and more mindless fun. Some scenes and things seem aimed at a slightly younger audience, such as the flying dirigible, which I did not need. Wrestling star, The Rock, was not entirely convincing as a giant digital scorpion.On the other hand, the film makes GREAT use of the two hot brunette babes, Rachel Weisz, and PATRICIA VELASQUEZ who played Ank-Su Namun, the mummy's main squeeze. Both are used much better and feistier than in the first film. Velasquez had little more than a cameo then, but fit in nicely here in a major role. Velasquez is a former Miss Venezuela and top model, and is gorgeous, and does a very nice job acting, too. If there is a third ""Mummy"" I sure want to see more of her.Very good popcorn entertainment. Fun. Go see it, or rent it when available.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A sequel that sacrifices story for jokes & swashbuckling,"The Mummy Returns was already on a sandy foundation for me. I know many people loved the 1999 movie, but I wasn't as big of a fan. This sequel continues the trend of killing any tension it has built up with jokes, and sacrifices story for swashbuckling. And if the constant one-liners didn't make this film goofy enough, they also decided to throw a wise-cracking kid into the mix, as well. Look, there are some fun moments in this movie, but I laughed more at the CGI than I did the intentional humor. I like Brendan Fraser. I like Rachel Weisz. I even like Oded Fehr.

Slickly packaged no-brainer,"There are a few exciting action sequences, but overall the movie is just like its CGI effects: too perfectly smooth and plastic-looking. The first movie seemed to be set in its time (the 1920s), but this film could have happened in any decade except for the funny-looking cars. Oddly enough you never believe that Brendan and Rachel are the parents of their cute little plot point, er, son. They like him well enough, but they never act like his parents. He suffers from being too precocious like most kids in these kinds of movies, but he's funny and interesting. As an ""OZ"" fan, I was thrilled to see Adebisi as one of the lead henchmen! He was quite menacing. It was just OK.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too many problems to count,"I had so many problems with this movie, I don't know where to begin.  Let me say that I am a fan of The Mummy (1999)... it's definitely a guilty pleasure.  That movie had a good plot, a good build up to the ""reveal"" of the mummy, hilarious one liners (""It's still... juicy""), and fun action sequences.The Mummy Returns doesn't have any of that.  We see the first supernatural beings about thirty seconds into the movie (the sand-doggies), and the first mummies about two minutes later.  And they're the same soldier mummies from the first movie.  Sigh.The action is so relentless that it gets boring, and rarely leaves time for any dialog at all, let alone anything funny.  The plot is rather painfully contrived, and not much is explained.  The romance between Evie and O'Connell is just plain sappy (""Cue violins... now kiss!"" got old after the 4th or 5th time, thanks), and loses the spark their relationship had in the first movie.And you know, I could suspend my disbelief about the whole supernatural ancient egyptian magic thing; after all, it's rather essential to the central theme of the movie.  I *refused* to suspend my disbelief about the hot air balloon with after burners.  That was just plain stupid.Don't get me started on the horridly inconsistent CGI work.  It was VERY bad at times, to the point of it looking like a video game.  The Rock as the scorpion king (at the end) looked so jarringly fake that I wanted to run far away from this film.  They must have just painted The Rock's face onto a CGI model, and it showed.  Mr. Potato Head from Toy Story had more emotion in his facial expressions.Oh well, this movie will make its millions.  But it doesn't deserve it.-John",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

excellent sequel close in quality to the first one,"I have and continue to describe the first ""The Mummy"" as one of the quintessential action-comedy movies of all time. The sequel, featuring the return of the most important cast members, called ""The Mummy Returns"" is a follow-up that is additionally very good, full of intelligence and humor that combines elaborately and with effectiveness, and has its fair share of action sequences and fights of all kinds. Like its predecessor, ""The Mummy Returns"" never gets dull or boring and although it is still just lots of fun, most of it silly fun, is highly entertaining for this reason.Most of the traits that make ""The Mummy Returns"" effective are described in my review of the first ""The Mummy"" so I will not begin to restate them again and just advise readers to check the aforementioned review for my ideas on why I think this film and the one before it are excellent and good enough to be called quintessential action-comedies. ""The Mummy Returns"", in short, is well-paced, full of action, has intelligent and well-acted laughs, a great cast of characters, sword fights, gunfights, fist fights, doesn't become too serious in any of its traits, is not too scary or frightening, and although not as good as the original, is still very fun to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bigger doesn´t certainly mean better,"In the sequel to the very successful summer-hit of 1999 ""The Mummy"", director Stephen Sommers has made everything bigger and, according to himself, better. I can´t say that I agree with ""The Mummy Returns"" being better than its predecessor, but this is still fun stuff.Several years after their first adventure, Rick and Evelyn are back in Egypt to hunt for treasures. This time they have their ingenious son with them. After some trouble, they get home to London, but they´ve brought something with them that they shouldn´t have taken. Very soon an old friend of theirs is resurrected and the fun begins.In ""The Mummy Returns"", lots of the comedy from part one has been removed in favor of more special effects. Because there are lots of those here. Too many, I would say. Sure, they are great to look at (except for one certain effect towards the end, shame on you ILM), and helps the movie to keep the pace up. But it feels like Stephen Sommers should have trusted more on his actors, and less on the effects.The film has its moments, the Scorpion King not being one, and the fun rarely stops. The actors do a good job with the material they have, and it´s nice to see the beautiful actress Patricia Velasquez in a bigger role this time around. This is one of the better sequels I´ve seen in a long time.3/5",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If a man does not embrace his past, he has no future.","Rachel Weisz really shines in this film. I continue to be impressed by her range. It's not a great film by any measure, but it is good fun. Weisz's duel with Patricia Velasquez as the reincarnated Anck-su-Namun was incredible.This is, in one sense, a family movie, ala ""True Lies."" Dad (Brendon Frazier), mom (Weisz) and son (Freddie Boath) all fight together to defeat Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo). There is even a kooky brother-in-law (John Hannah) - a real family adventure.This is the second film for ""The Rock."" He was in ""Longshot,"" but way down on the billing as a mugger. Here he rises to prominence in a cast, but his character is quite ridiculous.

An entertaining and satisfying sequel!,"The Mummy Returns, which was released in 2001, is a sequel to the 1999 hit, The Mummy. This movie is a very worthy and fun to watch sequel.

The new characters are very well put together as well. I really enjoyed the villains in this movie, especially the scorpion King, played by the very well cast Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. He truly is perfect for the role of the scorpion King, tough, muscular, good looking, and able to do the hardcore action adventure scenes true justice. On to The special effects. The special effects are very well done in this flick, very cool and realistic looking, well for the most part that is, there is one scene at the end where the special effects are actually pretty bad looking. The end part where the scorpion King is resurrected, the cgi in that scene is very poor, but that's the only bad part with the special effects, the rest are great!

"'Scorpion King' aside, this is an intermittently enjoyable sequel.","'The Mummy Returns (2001)' tries to keep the same fun tone and irreverent feel as the first flick, but it doesn't feel sincere on any real level and is notably ridiculous (even by the standards of its genre). It's a bit tamer and isn't quite as tight as its predecessor either. Still, everything is painted with a broadly fantastical brush and the flick introduces some fairly unique back-story elements that surely provided inspiration for Sofia Boutella's recent incarnation of the bandaged bogeyman. It hits the ground running and doesn't really stop for a second, but it's still kind of boring in the middle. It has its highlights, of course, but a lot of it is less exciting than it seems on paper. Still, the central trio are solid and the piece is intermittently enjoyable. The climax is surprisingly fun, even when The Rock turns up as a fully CG creature. Though that particular special effect is notorious for being possibly one of the worst featured in a film of this size, it's entertaining in its own B-movie kind of way and isn't too far out of line with the rest of the picture.

The storyline was obviously built to support the visual effects, instead of being the visual effects supporting the storyline. Allright! My kind'a movie! At times in the movie, it was obvious that a little more money (and a lot more of time) would have done wonders to some of the effects. f.ex. the Scorpion kind had almost no facial texture, and was generally not wery well made. Also they had to fix Imhotep (i.e. make him less mummy and more human) quite early in the movie, which was obviously done to save resources. the ending was especially affected by this fenomeno. The death of Anck-Su-Namun was kind of weak, especially since she had a lot more screen-time than in the first movie. At some point the movie also got a little too ridiculous.

"Spectacular, yes...but it lacks the first part`s charm","That is probably my subjective opinion, since I have the first part and must`ve watched it a dozen times by now. This sequel has everything it should have - great special effects (except for the Scorpion King in the end, it was painfully obvious that it was an animation), great music, great scenery, A LOT of action and some funny scenes...but the characters and their lines are not as amusing as they used to be in the first part and there are some seriously pathetic moments. Not to mention some confusing things in the plotline. For instance, Meela can`t be resurrected Anck-su-namun because someone had to resurrect her and there isn`t anyone who could do that except Imhotep, who is not brought back to life yet. And if she`s a reincarnation (definition - reincarnation is a rebirth of a soul in a new human body - and as far as I know that should happen at birth), then her soul is already reborn so it couldn`t have been in the Underworld when Imhotep brought her back to life in ""The Mummy"". See what I mean?I won`t even discuss how come that Imhotep didn`t recognize Evie as Nefertiri. I didn`t like all this thing about reincarnation - everyone turned out to be some ancient Egyptian something.Plus - I absolutely hated the the ending of Imhotep`s and Anck-su-namun`s love. It wasn`t just a disgrace, it was a desecration that undermined the very existence of ""The Mummy"". We didn`t need that.7/10 so far, maybe I change my mind after watching it again.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
As enjoyable as the first movie...,"If you enjoyed the 1999 ""The Mummy"" movie, then you will definitely also enjoy the 2001 sequel ""The Mummy Returns"".Writer and director Stephen Sommers put together a great script for ""The Mummy Returns"", one that feels like a good and natural continuation of the predecessor. And that makes it all the more easy to get sucked up and drawn into the storyline. And it is a great adventure movie with a fast pace and a good narrative.It was good to see the majority of the cast from the 1999 movie return to reprise their characters and roles in ""The Mummy Returns"". And you definitely have a great cast ensemble in the movie, with the likes of Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr, Dwayne Johnson, Alun Armstrong and others.""The Mummy Returns"" makes for a great adventure movie that has something for audience members of all ages.I have seen writer and director Stephen Sommers 2001 ""The Mummy Returns"" movie a handful of times since it was originally released. And it is the type of adventure movie that can be seen again and again.Something that puzzles me about ""The Mummy Returns"" is the fact that the CGI effects in this 2001 movie are somewhat worse than they were in the 1999 movie ""The Mummy"". But if you can look past the somewhat dubious special effects, then ""The Mummy Returns"" is a rather enjoyable adventure.My rating of ""The Mummy Returns"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Slow to it's feet,After a very slow start and only a bit of action this movie recovered well with heaps of action and humour! It made me laugh at the scene with the mummy's on the bus and the special effects were great!

Not Sure If I Liked It,"OK, as an action film, it was enjoyable.  Yes it suffers from ""Sequel-itis"". It was fun to watch.  Enjoyable characters, great effects (most of the time-Scorpion King was poorly done).My big problem with the movie was the ""bad guys"".  The film-makers decided to go with excess.  In other words, there were a lot of different bad guys, each with their own agenda.  Of course, this made the task our heros face very daunting.  They were successful in this.  However, if you look at each of the characters one by one, and you consider that each one is supposed to be the epitome of all evil, each was far too easily vanquished.  Imhotep, the title character, himself turns into a cowardly, sniveling weasel, therefore making him one of the least significant of the baddies!Plot holes galore, but that is to be expected in any film of this type. Just a celebration of excess that could have been done better with some restraint.  Still enjoyable to watch, but try not to think of it as a great movie, and you will be better off.  Give it a try.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great underrated sequel in the Mummy action genre franchise!,"Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a few action fantasy sequels, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.The Mummy Returns (2001) was my second movie during summer 2001 in the mummy series franchise that I went to see it in the movie theater that year. This time I went alone during the summer watching this movie. This flick become one of my favorite action adventure movies. It is my favorite Mummy flick and I don't care what anyone says I love it! I bought VHS tape in 2003, unfortunately I don't have that tape anymore, but I got it on Blu-ray disc and I love it so much. The year's biggest action-adventure is coming home with a vengeance! Brendan Fraser and an all-star cast reunite with Stephen Sommers for explosive, non-stop thrills in ""the ultimate roller-coaster movie ride!"" Brendan Fraser ,Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Patricia Velasquez and Oded Fehr returns from the first movie and reunite for the second time of the Mummy franchise with some new additions on the cast Freddie Boath and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. It's as good as the first film in the aspect of special effects, but it is just as entertaining and comical as the first film. I love the first film and I love this film, the story is brilliant and the actors give brilliant performances. But like I said some of the special effects are terrible like the first appearance of the animated Scorpion King, he just looks really bad. Apart from that The Mummy Returns is an hilarious and highly entertaining film. A must for fans of the franchise!A lot of the critics were unkind to this movie but they were missing the point: it's just fun all the way﻿. They only dropped the ball on the CG scorpion king in my opinion. Brilliant movies﻿. I felt my soul freaking escape when I heard Arnold speak Imhotep was my favorite character and still is! What I love about this movie: The Mummy and The Mummy Returns reminds me on The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Both of the movie did had returning cast and they ere both much different dark tone, characters. I think The Mummy Returns copied or borrowed scenes from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This film is set 10 years after the vents on the first movie an ancient legacy of terror is unleashed when the accursed mummy, Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), is resurrected - along with a force even more powerful: The Scorpion King (The Rock). Now, as the fate of all mankind hangs in the balance, Rick O'Connell (Fraser) and his wife Evie (Rachel Weisz) embark on a daring, desperate race to save their son - and the world - from unspeakable evil.I have enjoyed this movie in every way and I love that movie isn't boring but has action and it is set in different locations beside the Egypt. It has action, humor and great performances by the actors in it. In my opinion I think The Mummy is superior and much better than this movie, but this sequel isn't bad either and it is a good summer blockbuster movie. I always enjoy even today when every time I see it. The acting is pretty good, though sometimes things become a little hammy. The writing and directing are also well done, this is like the mini-version of what Indiana Jones could be -- though that may be too big a compliment.The flaws and the problems I have with the film are: the CGI were messed up this time around; it did not meet up with those from the first film! Some characters were in a dark tone this time. The character Evie Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) was really in a dark tone and way, way too hot I really did not like that in the movie. Not that I did not like it, in the movie the past life of Evelyn really confused me, when she was Princess Nefertiri a princess warrior when Imhotep and Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velásquez) killed her father the emperor. Suddenly Evie was a bad ass! Just like Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from The Terminator from a shy girl to a bad ass in sequel. That is why I am saying this movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The special-effects are TERRIBLE! The Scorpion King looks so fake! The army of Anubis looks fake! Everything that had to be inserted digitally comes out terrible. That is the main problems in the film that I had.The last ting I wanna say: when the full force of Anubis' army is bearing down and outnumbered, the Medjai prepare to make their last stand everyone in the theater was cheering up with them when Ardeth Bay screams his line: 'Till Death! Everyone was cheering up for them. As everything was said, I love this movie and everyone did a great job and I love this movie to death! I gave a 9/10 if they wouldn't be any flaws in it or weren't things that bothered me in it.The Mummy Returns is a 2001 American action adventure film written and directed by Stephen Sommers, starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr, Patricia Velásquez, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.

A good movie but a poor sequel,"First off let me say that The Mummy Returns is a good movie, is well worth the price of admission. But in the same breath let me say that it is a poor sequel.The Mummy Returns succeeds in the same way as The Mummy. Lots of action, adventure, suspense, and the right amount of humor at just the right time.But The Mummy Returns doesn't carry the same magic that made The Mummy such a wonderful hit. It's more of a action thrill ride (though there's nothing wrong with that) where The Mummy was a action filled horror film. In this sequel the horror part of the story is replaced with more fighting and more special effects. While this does make a good movie it change from The Mummy's creepier look.You you go see The Mummy Returns looking for the next film in the mummy horror genre you may be disappointed. If you're just looking for a good good action/adventure movie with a good amount of humor thrown in then you've made a great choice.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"This movie was BAD, real BAD!!!!","I thought this movie was a waste of 16 bucks.  I took my wife and was dragged in by some friends, and I really wish I would have not.  First of all, I give every movie a chance.  I am the type of person who usually finds one positive in every movie, and I did find one here.  The panoramic desert scenes were awesome, but the rest of the movie sucked.  The script was cheesy, many of the special effects were easily detectable as fake, the theme was stupid, the story confusing, plot and characterization were non existent.  I didn't care what happened to any of these people, they could have all died, I just wanted my money back.  I fell asleep 5 times, and I usually don't pay 8 bucks for a nap.  That only goes to show that all movies out now stink because when this movie can do better than most at the box office, that's pathetic.  I thought the previews were much better than this film, and they sucked too.  listen to a person who gives every movie a fair shot and don't waste your money, you'll feel as stupid as this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well...it was noisy and there were lots of monsters.,"I wasn't bored watching ""The Mummy Returns"", which is about all I can say for it.  The problem was that I was never really involved, excited or interested.  Brendan Fraser maintains his vague, undefinable, barely-there charisma.  Rachel Weisz is still kinda-sorta-attractive-but-not-really and her acting hasn't improved any.  The little kid is, like most little kids in the movies, roughly 7,000 times smarter than any of the adults in the picture, far too smart to really be 8 years old, full of ""hilarious"" wisecracks, and massively annoying.The ultimate problem, though, is that it doesn't really succeed as a summertime special effects movie - it doesn't contain a single FX shot that made me sit up and take notice.  Granted, this is becoming harder and harder to do, but ""The Mummy Returns"" didn't even try.  They just had all the same effects from the first movie, except more of them.But there were some swordfights, lots of shootouts, plenty of monsters, and the volume was turned way, way up.  Also, the popcorn was pretty tasty, the root beer was okay...and I didn't fall asleep once during the movie.  So...I guess...that's a plus.  Of sorts.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Do not watch if you're older than 15,"The first Stephen Sommers mummy-movie, released in 1999, already was a lousy and overly boisterous film that focused on the visual eye-candy rather than to re-tell the classic Imothep-tale properly. Still, it had its compelling moments and enough humor to put the whole production into perspective. Even the more experienced horror fan, who seeks atmosphere instead of excitement, could find a bit of joy in ""The Mummy"". This rapidly finished sequel, however, fully aims itself at (pre-) teen audiences who never in their lives saw a good movie and waste their days with playing video games! The script is a mess, revolving on the resurrection of Imothep (again) and the coming of a new Egyptian bad-boy, namely ""The Scorpion King"". Rick and Evelyn O'Connor (the heroes of the first) as well as Imothep intend to destroy ""The Scorpion King"", but for different purposes. The mean mummy wants to take of command of Scorpion's army and wipe out the world whereas the archaeologists-couple tries to prevent this. There's a giant amount of totally redundant sequences and it looks like they were only added to show good the makers are with computer-engineered special effects. Okay, we got it...tell a story instead! Every dead end or illogical aspect in the script is resolved with another attention-distracting visual trick and  after a while  it looks like the writers aren't even trying to be ingenious anymore. The acting is really bad with Fraser and Weisz both thinking about their paychecks instead of their lines and the introduction of cinema's most annoying child-actor in history: Freddie Boath. He's an 8-year-old brat who supposedly has more archaeologist-knowledge than an army of university professors. John Hannah also walks around the sets for no reason. He had a few funny one-liners and grimaces in the first film, but his part here is pretty much pointless. For some incomprehensible reason, this movie is pretty loved among IMDb-members (judging by the ratings and user comments) but I can't think of any positive (or even redeeming) comments in favor of it. I'm sorry",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
SFX is good,"The story is your average indiana jones plot.

CGI Overkill,"I went to see this with my older brother (he's 22, i'm 19)because we both liked the original for it's sense of old-fashioned action adventure (for a new generation). So we figured this would be about the same, but more of it. We couldn't be more right. Even though i do like the film's light- heartedness, the special effects are what (for me anyway) really ruined the film. Almost every single shot contains that damn CGI (i'll take stop-motion animation anyday). Not that i hate CGI, but it has to be functional, here it all seems too forced to be natural, heck, even the backgrounds of ancient Egypt looked fake, whereas in the Mummy they looked great. The action in the film was inventive and pacey, but again ruined by all that CGI rammed down your throat (you don't know where to look). Overall i'd say this is an enjoyable film, great for a Friday or Saturday night with your mates and spectacular fun for the kids, but for me the sometimes great, sometimes terrible CGI was way too much and the ending was disappointing too: they promised so much with it, but in the end all we have is a badly animated scorpion king.*** out of *****",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Outstanding and entertaining!,"Action and adventure abound throughout this movie.  There are grand battles, deception, romance and narrow escapes from death and that's just in the first half hour!  Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are back and this time, they have more than an ancient mummy to contend with. This time around, there's evil followers of Imhotep, armies of the undead, pygmies and The Scorpion King himself.  The pace never lets up. It's a roller coaster ride that takes you up, down and then spins you upside down and throws you for another roll.  The stunts are great, the effects are great, and the story is also great.

"Utter, Utter Crap","I'm a fan of Brendan Fraser, and a fan of Rachel Weisz.  I'm a big fan of good action films, and even a lot of semi-good ones, and a big fan of pulp. I'm a big fan of special effects, if they're justified by the movie they're in.But this is flat-out one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The writing and direction are simply atrocious, beyond bad.  Scenes are shot as if without any forethought or planning or concept of what they'll look like on the screen.  The story is so stupid that it's outright insulting -- not because it's about dead people coming to life, and so forth, but because it makes almost no sense at all and yet still manages to be completely predictable.Dull story, bad action scenes, boring characters, tedious visuals, lame special effects -- just a colossal waste of money and talent.  They spent about $100 million making this, and it looks like maybe $25 million.  Not that it would be worth that.Not half as good as ""Deep Rising"", by the same writer-director, and *that* wasn't exactly a great movie.

Preordained entertaining sequel,"Not only does the Mummy return but his friends and enemies and all the romance and adventure they brought with them in the first film. Stephen Sommers, Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weisz, Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah were back to do the second part of the franchise, this time up against an even more powerful adversary. Parts of the plot are amusingly retrodden from the first part too; and again not much makes or is expected to make sense.The former servant of Anubis the Scorpion King and his vast army have lain dormant for nearly five thousand years biding their time. Young Imhotep would like to control this power, meanwhile the Fraser's are chasing after them all to get back their precocious eight year old son who has been kidnapped by Imhotep, and to fight Evil with Good too of course. It's a swift film with no messing about but favourite bits out of many include the London Bus ride, the boy's journey on the train, the barmy dirigible flight, the race to get to the pyramid before dawn. With this movie it's only the ride that matters - all the way from 3067 BC to AD 1933, not the reason for it. The cgi cartoonery was laid on with a trowel but usually complemented the action even if a bit brutal at times. Fraser and Weisz certainly had a delightful rapport.It only worked because it was the same team on and off the screen - take one part of the jigsaw away and you don't have a jigsaw, witness the later disastrous part three. However I still wish it originally could've been a three-film franchise instead of two, simply because we would've had even more of this pleasantly nonsensical hokum to enjoy all these years later!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Definitely worse than the first one, but still entertaining.","When comparing it to the first one, we find thay this one has less adventures, less fun, less mysteries and tricks, less magic, worse visual effects, more fights specially one vs one fights, more mummies count but less in diversity, more kisses, more enemies, more weak and unexplained motives of some of the characters, weaker plot, but all of this didn't prevent it from being a good entertaining movie.Some of the elements in that movie were copied from the first one and they tried to enhance it but the result wasn't that good, such as the bugs, the mummies, and Im-Ho-Tib who transferred from being the most invincible mummy to a normal human being who can make a conversation and has feelings as well.There's a reason of why this sequel stopped, moving from a great movie in the first part to a good one here is probably not the main one, but i believe having a third one would give the creators a chance to over come all the problems that appeared here but unfortunately this didn't happen until late.Finally, it's another good adventure classic, you will have a chance to watch another beautiful scenes of Ancient Egypt and its golden treasures, and you will never be bored while ""Brendan Frezar"" is on the screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the worst movies ever made!,"I can't even begin to put into words how horrible this movie is. The total lack of effort in creating an interesting story and translating it onto film was beyond my comprehension as to why movies are made. This embodies everything that a film should not be... a story that serves no purpose either to itself or to the audience, the lack of interesting characters (because who really cared about what happened to any of them throughout the movie?), and senseless action that didn't even drive the plot (oh look, here comes another tidal wave with the dude's face in it for no reason). The Mummy Returns just goes to show how technology, which is suppose to enhance the visual aspect of an actual story, has been manipulated so that movies nowadays are only about how cool stuff looks onscreen without taking any interest to the film itself. And on top of that, this movie's visual effects weren't even good. It just looked like Brenden Fraser in a cheap cartoon. This kind of modern raping of the cinema has most likely ruined the minds of the mass viewers. Aside from the fact that it grossed $200 million dollars, which shows how tasteless movies like this have made us, it really isn't worth it once we realize how far behind this will put us in ever going back to making quality movies again.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great Sequel,"Better than the first? Sorry but I respectful disagree.Cons1. The kid was annoying2. The CGI was worse. I know there was bad CGI in the first one which is dated but I can forgive it for that since it was 1999 CGI was still kind of new. Here though? It has been 3 years since the first movie the CGI should have gotten better but it didn't I got worse in my opinion3. I don't buy guy with the aircraft saving them at the end because they crash in the jungle, there is no way he could have fixed that huge aircraft there is no repair shop or anything and I don't think he would have the tools with him to fix it either.4. The rock was under used. It is why have him at the start then never see him again until the last 5 or 7 minutes of the movie? It is kinda false advertising since he is on the poster but hardly in the movie that itself5. I don't think the score for the film was better than the score in the first onePros?Great action scene/fight scenesLocations were niceThe bus scene in London where the mummies are going after them was well done.

This Film Needs a Benny,"The original was character driven and fun, as well as funny.  This one spent much more time and effort on big-budget special effects than character development or humor.  This film needed a Benny.The hot-air balloon idea was contrived, badly written, and poorly animated. The character of Izzy just isn't filled in enough, and that IS a writing problem, not an acting problem.  The movie feels like it was thrown together, re-written by a half-dozen studio executives who wanted to mix the original with ""The Matrix"" and remove everything intelligent.  I liked the characters in the first film quite a bit.  I missed them.  And other than faint glimpses of the original Rick, and even fainter ones of Evie (more of which are shown via Alex than Rachel Weisz), they're not here at all.  Great actors given nothing to do but react to special effects, as opposed to (as in the first one) each other.A good idea squandered-- I liked it, but any director is likely to be surrounded by Yes-men after a success like the original ""Mummy.""Worth watching once.

better than the first,"I thought the flick was much better than the first, as far as the writing was concerned.

Not that I'm opposed to fighting scenes, but I don't want that to occupy the whole story-line.All in all, I recommend this film for home viewing.

"OK Sequel, Terrible Visual Effects","This movie is so packed with CGI that it makes it look like a video game demo. After watching quite a large number of new computer generated movies, it all comes down to this: the effects are good, only if the director is talented enough to make them look real.In my opinion only three artists incorporated computer effects successfully in their movies: Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott and James Cameron. Only these people created movies with heavy use of cgi in the last 10 years that looked real (in fact they looked so real that you didn't even notice them).Apparently for some people computers can give you all the power to create anything visually, without using any of the old days' craftsmanship. 'The Mummy Returns' looks fake, especially at the climax of the movie. When Scorpion King arrived, I was looking for my joystick! Didn't anyone realize that they should combine real shots of the Rock with some cgi?As a story, 'the Mummy Returns' is okay for a sequel, quite inventive at places and with some nice sence of humor. Still, it takes a lot of talent for someone to create the new 'Indiana Jones'.To all directors: Please go back to using miniatures and physical photography. Watch the 1993 Jurassic Park to study what's real. (That goes also for some old timers that return to their saga after 20 years, just to shows us cartoons!)",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The actors expression are too poor and not good enough. It should be done better to make this movie more perfect.For effects, again, very impressive and excellent job of creating the fast action scene from time to time.The camera angle move a bit too fast. Cause a bit of headache especially in the fighting scene. It probably good to stay in one angle for at least 10 seconds before moving to another angle.

"""Adventure is reborn"" (feet first!)","10 years after they stopped Imhotep taking over the world, Rick and Evelyn are married with a son, Alex. Again they accidentally set off a chain of events that awakens Imhotep from his resting place in the British Museum. However a second force has been released in the shape of the Scorpion King and Rick and Evelyn must race to stop both from destroying the world. Meanwhile Evelyn begins to experience flashbacks that reveal that she may have been Princess Netertiri, daughter of Pharaoh Seti.As with every big blockbuster, a sequel is inevitable. It generally doesn't matter whether the first film was good or not, or if the sequel is well thought out or not. It only matters that it guaranteed to make a set percentage of the original's profit and therefore not a risk. The story here feels forced from the very start - first the introduction of the kid makes it feel like they're just trying to keep it interesting by adding characters (if the first film was like Raiders then this is definitely Temple of Doom). Secondly we suddenly discover that Evelyn is the reincarnation of Princess Nefertiri! How come this little gem never came out in the first film? The addition of 'The Scorpion King' is so minor that you wonder why they used his character at all - then you see that the Mummy 3 will be subtitled 'the scorpion king' and you realise that it was just another excuse to spin money (especially when you see that The Rock was put in the role).The fact that the script has stopped trying is a real drain on how much fun you can have. Right from the start (the fight in Rick's house) you see this - all the main characters just 'show up' at the fight at exactly the right time! Even Ardeth Bay and Jonathon show up - despite the fact that Ardeth just came from Egypt! This laziness is apparent all through the film, it relies on big bangs and OTT action scenes to carry the film.Fraser loses another truck load of credibility by doing this - he's good, but it's obvious that he was too blinded by dollars to read the script. Weisz is terrible - even if she gets more of an action role, her character is still daft. Hannah seems to know he's in rubbish and just wants to get through it and get paid. Boath as the young Alex is all cute, cheeky child adventuring - a perfect example of how cute children are the death of films.For me the saddest performance was Lock-Nah (Adewae Akinnuoye-Agbaje) - it was sad because I know what he's capable of. For anyone who's seen HBO's Oz he played the monstrous Simon Adebesi. In Oz Adewale gave a great performance over 3 or 4 series where his character changed significantly, so he can act but he's never going to be a leading man, so I guess he was happy to get in a big film.Overall this is laughable - unlike the first movie, it's impossible to ignore the sheer daftness of the whole thing. If you don't believe that this is merely a money spinning production rather than an attempt to make a good film then check out the special effects on the Scorpion King at the end. They look so terrible (like a Sega mega-drive's effects) because the effects process was rushed through in order to get the film out into the market.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than the first,"This time, Stephen Sommers has forgotten the terror to film a pure adventure film, in the same way as Indiana Jones, with exoticism, adventures, dangers, and of course, good sense of humour, all mixed with spectacular special effects. The reincarnation of Ank-sun-ammun awakes the Mummy again, Inmhotep must fight with the Scorpion King in order to command his army a nd conquer the world. In this way, he will be able to enjoy his life with his lover forever. Unfortunately, this will mean the end for humans, so the O'Conells have to stop him. With a great sense of humour and adventure it is better indeed than the previous part, better special effects, and less terror,which makes the film better. All actors are great (for this kind of film) specially Voosloo, who makes the Mummy the most charismatic character of the film. On the other hand, the charisma of the characters of inmhotep and Ank-sun-amun is greater than the time they have in the film, the director could have taken more profit of their spectacular and precious love story to make the film more enjoyable; this guides us to another question: If the Mummy only wanted to be with his lover, why should he do all this mess to command Anubis Army, could he simply stay happily with her?? The film is funny and enjoyable, despite some things (as said before) that could have been filmed better. Ideal for enjoy during 2 hours with one of the best modern classical adventures film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Slightly dopey, but fun anyway.","Going in to see this movie, i was not concerned with historical accuracy. It's a movie about a freaking resurrected mummy, for crying out loud, i think that should be anyone's first hint that viewers are in for a nice little detour from reality, and all tghe better for it. Picking up several years after the adventures of the first film, we rejoin what is now the O'Connell family as they cross paths with Imhotep once again, this time in an effort to stop him from raising a supernatural army that would allow him to conquer the world. The Mummy Returns is the sort of movie that makes a fun distraction on a lazy Saturday afternoon, not unlike the hokey, cheesy (but nonetheless entertaining) monster movies i grew up with. If you can put down your pretensions that every movie should be or should even strive to be the highest form of art, make yourself some popcorn, sit back, put a few parts of your brain in neutral and just enjoy the ride. Yeah, some of the effects bite pretty hard, but so what?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Imhotep returns,this movie is a sequel to the mummy the story goes as follows: imhotep is resurrected and he wants to revive the unstoppable army of the of Anubis but he has to kill the scorpion king first in order to successfully use the army scorpion king so he can rule mankind mean while Rick Eva and Alex travel across the world to stop imhotep and send the scorpion king's army back to he underworld but can either stop the scorpion king or will he resurrect Anubis's army himself and rule mankind like in the last movie the mummy returns takes you back to Egypt to bring you up to speed on the history of Egypt and then lets you see the movie,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable thanks to the humor and the many special effects.,"Most people compare this sequel to the first movie 'The Mummy', which is a good thing of course, but I haven't seen the first one, so no comparisons from me.So what can I tell you? Well, the movie isn't as bad as I expected. It's all to clear that the director's first thought wasn't about the script but about the many special effects, but i still quite liked the movie. What made this movie work for me was the humor. Normally this kind of movies takes itself much too serious, there is no place for any joke or funny situation at all. In The Mummy Returns this is different.Thanks to the humor, this movie was very enjoyable, but it is of course the many special effects that make this movie what it is. Don't expect anything real: a mummy coming to life, sucking the life out of people, armies of mythological creatures... will of course never exist in reality, but it certainly was nice to see.I guess it is best to qualify this movie as some excellent way to pass some boring hours on a cold and rainy afternoon. It's certainly not an intellectual movie, but I didn't mind about that when watching it. I give it a",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun but disappointing,"It is always said to see when a director and writer sacrifices what might have been a quality story for special effects. This is the case with the sequel to Stephen Sommer's ""The Mummy"". I sort of knew this would be the case when looking at the previews they showed several scenes with the army of Anubis marching across the desert but none of the story. This is because while the story was there and it was interesting, it was nothing to write home about. There was one review I read that compared Rick O'Connel (Fraser) to Indiana Jones. Fedora hat included this comparison may be accurate but this movie is better compared with the second of the Indy sequels which by all accounts was not as good as the first or third Indy movies.This movie introduces itself very well. The first half hour is very entertaining as we are shown all the main characters and told basically what to expect. The problems happen about the point where the characters find themselves on the way back home to London. There are all these guys running around in red suits and we have no idea what their motivation is other than wanting to wake up Mr. walking talking corpse. Why would you want to do that? They never explain it. From that point on the movie is fun (don't get me wrong - it was fun to watch) but it lacked the original's originality. The humor, I am happy to say, is still present and made for good times.The other day I watched the original movie with the director's commentary turned on and got a glimpse of why this movie is the way it is from Mr. Sommer's comments. There is no doubt that he is talented but he should have stuck with creating a good story and then hired ILM to do the SFX. I won't comment on ""The Rock"" as he in only in the movie for about 15 minutes and his role is... different.6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Mummy Returns... as a Dummy!,"I loved the Mummy. What a rollicking good yarn. Back to the 1980s Indiana Jones tongue in cheek rah rah britain archaeological adventures. Lots of freaky bugs to eat you from the inside out. etc etc etc.BUTThe Mummy Returns does not rollick. The yarn has unravelled. This movie makes you want to be sick from the inside out.Don't get me wrong. The movie starts VERY PROMISINGLY!!! I read somewhere that the Rock was anxious people would think he was a crap actor. It might come as good news to him that he was the best actor in the whole darn thing! The little muffin head kid was woeful and very un-cute. Brendan Fraser was looking a little tired, as though he didn't really care.All this I could have handled. That is, until the flying balloon ship.HELLO???? CRAP ALERT!!!! This crappy balloon flies into some jungle thing with pygmies running around. Uh-Duh? What??? True. Pygmies.This was one of those movies that started well, became mediocre, and then became very corny. I know, I know, what can I expect from a sequel.

The Mummy Returns.....Better Than Ever!,"The Mummy Returns is a very good sequel, much better than the first film. Most of the main characters return and some intriguing new characters appear for the first time. The special effects are better than the first film, obviously. There is another good blend of genres such as action, adventure, and comedy.Brendan Fraser returns as Rick O'Connell. He and his wife Evy along with their son, Alex find the bracelet of Anubis while a British Museum curator and Imhotep's old lover resurrects the powerful Imhotep. Alex gets kidnapped by Imhotep because he wears the bracelet and that is the guide to the Scorpion King. Now the O'Connells with Ardeth Bay have to rescue Alex and prevent Imhotep from taking control over the Scorpion King's army.The acting is great. Fraser did a better job than he did in the first film. Rachel Weisz is even more beautiful in this film and she is a fine actress. John Hannah cracked me up even more as the stupid uncle. The presence of a kid, Freddie Boath added youth to this film. I was happy to see that Oded Fehr got more screen time as the serious, bold protector of Imhotep's tomb.The special effects are much more effective especially when the water demon was chasing the O'Connells in the hot air balloon. The creatures by the Scorpion King's pyramid scared the living daylights out of me. I don't want to be chased by vicious creatures like those.Overall, this is a very good film. I rate this movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining enough to ignore other aspects of the film,"Sequels,you can't do anything about it. You know it will come back when a movie gross over 100 hundred million dollars(more close to 200m). The question remains would it be a good sequel or a bad one? The answer depends of what you expect from a film or,for that matter, a sequel. If you expect that the sequel will give you some characters development,will be more sophisticated and will have some reasonable not to mention a convincing plot, than look somewhere else , because you will not find these things in this film. It basically do ""The Mummy"" all over with not much changes to it. The characters remain the same, though the addition of Evie's past was a nice touch,though very much convenient. The plot the remains the same, and everything goes as predictable as a sequel can be. Not a shred of surprise or originality here. You can see what comes miles ahead.The effects were good though in some cases they looked like computer generated ones (which means they look phony and not convincing enough, which shouldn't happen in a film that relies heavily on effects).Nevertheless the film is fun to watch and entertaining enough to ignore all other aspects. The film enjoy a fast phase which is its great asset and help passed it 2 hours running quite quickly.It is not a must film.

A Few More Cobwebs in the Tomb This Time.,"Oddly by-the-numbers sequel fast forwards 10 years from the original to 1933 London where the body of the titled monster (Arnold Vosloo) is shipped to be in a museum. Naturally horror strikes again as a mysterious woman (Patricia Velasquez, who basically had a cameo in the original) resurrects Vosloo and also tries to resurrect his ancient mistress (also played by Velasquez). The powers combine to try and defeat the Scorpion King (an warrior of the past played by The Rock) and his army back in ancient Egypt. The plan is to kill The Rock and turn his army to their side of darkness. Once again it is up to adventurer Brendan Fraser, Egyptologist Rachel Weisz (now Fraser's wife), their adolescent son (Freddie Boath) and Weisz's brother (the comical John Hannah) to stop Vosloo and Velasquez before they are able to take control of the world for good. ""The Mummy Returns"" is a little jumping jack of a film that does not come straight at you near as well as the original did. If anything, this picture may be a little too smart for its own good. Old replays and concepts from the first installment come back with ho-hum results. The characters are still likable and the special effects are still second-to-none, but the direction and screenplay ultimately end up making the production an achingly average accomplishment. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

There are no real surprises, though - except for Rachel Weisz who has somehow acquired some sort of ancient Egyptian (?) martial art.

Brendan is still cute in this one.,"The Mummy Returns (2001)-You really should watch 'The Mummy' (1999) first. Although this one is enjoyable in its own right, it will just make more sense if you know what the O'Connell's have been up to and how they got to where they are and why Imhotep is more than a little hacked off with them.It is another epic, along the lines of 'Indiana Jones' and such like, but while it's pretty close, it's not quite as good as the first. It does still have action, fun and laughs aplenty and it's easy to watch (Apart from the bit with the bugs).I like the character of Lock-Nah and the banter he has with Alex, who isn't the usual annoying kid that you find in these films. And of course Rick and Evie work really well, but Jonathan is still just brilliant for me and so well played by John Hannah.The pygmies and some of the other CGI elements are a bit rubbish. They could just have been played by extras and would have been just as terrifying. Trust me, I've met a few terrifying extras in my time.Some of the repetition of jokes and action works and other bits fall slightly flat, but it still seems to move with a good pace and has that adventurous fun that is perfect for a Christmas evenings viewing or any time of the year really, which is handy as it is constantly repeated on ITV.833.65/1000.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
And so it begins....,"Every year, around this time, I always start to get a little giddy.  I'm always so excited to see summer roll around, so I can watch those guys at ILM have their fun, trying to outdo what they did last go round.  Each year, summer movies seem to get more and more computerized, and less entertaining. After watching The Mummy Returns, I feel the trend will continue.  Make no mistake, the film is an action ride from beginning to end, but not once is it truly a FUN ride.I was really pumped to see this film.  I mean REALLY pumped.  I don't even know why.  Granted, I liked the first Mummy film, but not that much.  All I talked about for the past two weeks was seeing this movie.  I don't even know why...I just did.  My friend even made some off color sexual remarks about the Mummy and I.  Yes, it was that bad.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised I was disappointed.  I had it coming.What hurt the film the most was too much action.  I love thrills and chills and yadda yadda...but it was too much.  The film had formula written all over it. Too many characters, too little development, jumping from one death defying circumstance to another.  The CGI was good, but way overdone.  I miss the days where characters actually got the chance to interact with one another.  So darn much of the film felt incredibly fake.  It was more like watching a video game.  Apparently, they forgot to actually write the thing. I got a feeling Sommers and crew just sat around thinking of things that would LOOK cool in a movie.  I think some of the ideas were jokes that somehow got scripted in by accident.  Some of it worked great, but other scenes just made me want to laugh...and not when I was supposed to, either. Granted, the film is supposed to be a comic book fantasy film, but we're not idiots.  We won't watch anything.  Then again, I was there day one and many were there with me...so maybe we will.As far as the cast goes, I can't really blame them.  Each did their job and did it well.  It was good to see everyone back for a second go round, and I still like the characters.  Fraser, Weisz, Hannah, and Fehr did a great job. Freddie Boath didn't grate my nerves like I thought he would (*cough-Jake LLoyd-cough*) and was actually pretty funny.  BUT...the Scorpion King, portrayed by The Rock. WHAT?!?  What is the big deal?  How can ""Hollywood"" determine if this guy is the next big action star...he's in the film for all of 5 minutes, and had like three lines of gibberish?  I mean, I'll give the guy a chance, but to give him a prequel based on his performance here is just silly.So, even as I bash the film, it filled the time and I am in total LOVE with Patricia Velazquez, so I'd give it a 7 out of 10.  Yeah, I'm a bit of a hypocrite, so what?  $7 bucks isn't too much to pay for a couple hours of watching the most beautiful female on the planet.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stop returning already!,"This film began okay. I enjoyed the original & was looking forward to this & the opening scenes with the Scorpion King didn't disappoint. But then. Oh Boy! This has to be a prime example of all that is wrong with the Hollywood summer blockbuster. Yes you must suspend disbelief & go with the flow but this film has nothing of merit. The acting is awful with wooden performances all-round amidst very poor (not so) special effects, in particular the laughable Scorpion King at the end. Most of the effects would not look out of place on your standard games console & look rushed & cheap. I wouldn't be surprised if they were quickly done to get the film out. Its a movie made by special effects geeks for special effects geeks. The original was a pretty good adventure film but this is a real Indiana Jones wannabe without the likable characters,wit,style or coherent plot just a series of set-pieces cut together.

Good sequel,"First of all I want to mention that I´m a fifteen year old Austrian so my English is not the best one or very poor.What´s to say about the Mummy returns? Nice sequel. Of course not as good as the original film but not too bad at all. The plot was quite disappointing. One action scene followed another. The mystical,calm parts of the first film which I very estimated are almost removed except a few romantic scenes. I also missed the good old British humor of John Hannah. In my opinion is the Mummy returns more Fantasy than it is Horror. On the other hand the battle between the Madjai and the Army of Anubis and the duel between Rachel Weisz and Patricia Velasquez make the film worth seeing. Besides, I think that Miss.Weisz was more adventurer than the mother of an eight year old boy, which does not mean that she is a bad actress. - By the way I´d say that Rachel Weisz is one the most beautiful, lovely and attractive woman in Hollywood  ;) - What a pity that beauty and charm don´t make a good film. Oded Fehr was in contrast to some special effects (the appearance of the Rock or when the whole jungle disappeared into the Golden Pyramid) brilliant in his role as the commander of the Madjai armed whether with his sword or with the Thompson.  *Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta!* As well as Ardeth Bay was Arnoldo Vosloo as Imhotep who showed more emotions than in the original film.

"Return of the Mummy...and his honey, and the money, and it's funny...","Enough rhyming, but basically that's the whole movie; The Mummy, Imhotep returns with his sweetheart, Anck-su-namun, it cost $100 million+ to make, and it's a comedy as well as an action/adventure/horror/romance/etc.I read the book about a month ago, so basically I spoiled the whole plot for myself, but it was still a enjoyable.  It was slow to start with in the beginning, but as the plot built up and the action started to rise, it was exhilirating.  As far as plot goes, it is a lot more intricate and developed than the first plot, which you don't see very often in these kinds of movies.  I knew this going into the movie because of the book, and I was glad I didn't have to take too many stupid pills before the movie. Imhotep's romance with Anck-su-namun was basically the center of the plot, and Patricia Velazquez (who plays Anck, and is so friggin' hot) is in a vast majority of the film.  Don't get me wrong, Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and Oded Fehr (who is also in the majority of the film) were good as the recurring characters, but my favorite character has got to be Alex, the audience favorite, played by newcomer Freddie Boath.  His smart-ass comments (coming from Evy, of course) and thick English accent make him perfect for the role.My only gripes: One was the rushed look the movie had overall.  If they spent another good year and $20 million more on this movie, the special effects would be top-notch.  A lot of time was obviously spent on making the Mummy corpse look good, but this did not compensate for the cartoonish and rushed look of some of the special effects.  Even the dialogue and actors seemed a little hurried to get the movie done.  But still, you have to give the geniuses at IL+M credit for bringing the movie to life, but of course, the sequel had to get out before the first movie was forgotten.  And the other is mainly directed to teenage girls: The Rock's role is horribly overrated.  Chances are I will see the ""sequel"" that is being planned as we speak, but there better be a kick-ass story and FX, but unfortunately the 3rd movie will not be helmed by Sommers.

There are SO many elements wrong with this film I could write a book on it, and just may someday provided I could ever sit through it again. The CGI animation is the least of the problems, but that in itself is so wretchedly done that you will either laugh out loud because it is so fake, or else get really annoyed beyond compare. There is a part where I actually wanted the young boy to go outside the temple rather than stay inside trying to revive his dead mother, just so he could be entertained by the cartoon show outside (an army of hundreds of thousands of cartoon jackals line up for battle). If you enjoy a movie that blatantly rips off Home Alone reactions, Titanic embraces on the stern of a ship, a vehicle that flies past the moon ala E.T., or a character dressed in the exact same costume Tom Cruise wore in the orgy scene of Eyes Wide Shut, then go see this movie!!

"More action in this sequel, but the plot isn't as good.","This one is very action packed this time around.  From start to finish is almost one action scene after another.  Unfortunately, it is not better than the first mummy because its plot leaves a bit to be desired.  First off, the mummy doesn't seem to be important enough in the plot.  The title of the movie is the mummy, but he doesn't seem to be the focus he should be.  Then there is the Scorpion King plot.  I don't mind that too much, but it just lessened the importance of the mummy further.  Thankfully, the Rock has no speaking lines and not much screen time to muck up the film.  Still aside from these and a few more story problems, this movie is a great action flick.  Best to just turn off your brain and enjoy all the action such as the cool bus chase in London or the forest filled with the little creatures. The effects, like in the first one, are pretty good...but nothing really ground breaking.  The Scorpion King at the end though was a pretty cool looking character that looked like one of Ray Harryhausen's stop motion creatures.

"""The Mummy Returns"" (2001) - A Bigger, Bolder, and Fun Sequel","""The Mummy Returns,"" directed by Stephen Sommers, is the sequel to the wildly successful ""The Mummy"" (1999), and it doubles down on everything that made the first film a hit-action, adventure, humor, and supernatural thrills. Released in 2001, the film brings back the beloved characters from the original and introduces new elements that expand the mythos of the series. While it's an enjoyable romp, the film occasionally struggles under the weight of its own ambitions.The story picks up several years after the events of the first film. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) are now married with a young son, Alex (Freddie Boath). Their peaceful life is disrupted when they inadvertently awaken Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) once again, who is resurrected by a cult intent on using his power to conquer the world. Adding to the chaos, a new threat emerges in the form of the Scorpion King (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), a legendary warrior whose return could spell doom for the entire world.Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz reprise their roles with the same charm and chemistry that made them fan favorites in the first film. Fraser continues to shine as the adventurous Rick, balancing heroism with his signature lightheartedness. Weisz's Evelyn is even more dynamic this time around, with the sequel giving her character more to do, including action scenes that showcase her growth as an adventurer. Young Freddie Boath as Alex O'Connell brings a fresh energy to the cast, and his mischievous interactions with his parents add a layer of family dynamics to the story.Arnold Vosloo returns as the fearsome Imhotep, once again delivering a performance that blends menace with a certain tragic depth. The introduction of Dwayne Johnson as the Scorpion King adds a new layer of intrigue, although his role in the film is limited and mostly serves to set up the spinoff film, ""The Scorpion King."" Unfortunately, the CGI used to bring the Scorpion King's final form to life has become infamous for its lackluster quality, even by early 2000s standards, detracting from what should have been a climactic showdown.Visually, ""The Mummy Returns"" is a spectacle, with grand set pieces and elaborate action sequences that outdo those of its predecessor. The film takes the adventure to new locations, from the bustling streets of London to the vast deserts of Egypt, creating a globe-trotting epic that feels larger in scale. The special effects are more ambitious, though not always successful, with some sequences showing their age, particularly the CGI-heavy moments.The film's pacing is relentless, packing in action scene after action scene, which is both a strength and a weakness. While it keeps the audience engaged, it also leaves little room for the quieter, more suspenseful moments that made the first film so effective. The plot is more convoluted this time around, with multiple storylines and an array of ancient curses, mystical objects, and prophecies that can be hard to keep track of.The humor and light-hearted tone remain intact, with plenty of witty banter and comedic moments, particularly from John Hannah, who returns as Evelyn's brother Jonathan. His comedic timing provides much-needed levity amidst the nonstop action and supernatural threats.In conclusion, ""The Mummy Returns"" is a fun and action-packed sequel that delivers on spectacle and entertainment, even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of the original. It's a bigger, bolder adventure that fans of the first film will likely enjoy, though some may find the CGI and overstuffed plot to be a bit of a letdown. Despite its flaws, the film remains an enjoyable entry in the ""Mummy"" franchise, offering plenty of thrills and nostalgia for audiences who appreciate a good old-fashioned adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Very formulaic adventure flick but one with enough action to hold your attention.,"I thought ""The Mummy"" was so bad I couldn't finish watching it. However, ""The Mummy Returns"" is a quite different and more exciting film that kept my attention all the way. Lots of action, and a very aggressive sound track with good use of the rear surround channels. The DVD picture is also uniformly good all the way.I like Brendan Frasier and I like Rachel Weisz, and they seem very appropriate as parents with a young son. The story line was a bit hard to follow at times, with the mummy coming back and the Scorpion King coming back, but it involved an ancient bracelet that their son put on his arm, which protected him as long as he wore it, and all the bad guys trying to get it. The bracelet gave the boy visions of where to follow the get to a particular pyramid. As you would expect, the good guys prevailed in the end, after many chase scenes and sword fight and gun fights.OK film, easily forgettable, but with superb action and special effects. Another film greatly influenced by ""Indiana Jones"" films. Plus great to watch Rachel Weisz and Brendan Frasier.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mindlessly entertaining...,"Here we have one of those rare sequels that is every bit as goodas the original. Of course, I'm not saying the original was any goodto begin with. Actually, I'm not even sure they didn't just basicallyrecut the same old movie and tag one or two new characters andthen release it under this new title!In any event, I took my 7 year old boy to see the movie and he hada ball. Come to think of it, I was pretty well entertained also. Plotdetails are too silly (and inconsequential) to get into. Suffice to say,the title character (the sullen Imhotep) is somehow resurrectedand, by some contrivance, once again must face the meddling ofBrendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz (now married with a tow headedJunior Egyptologist as their son) and the bumbling brother-in-lawJohn Hannah. Mysterious native good-guy Ardeth Bey is also backas are the usual Indiana Jones inspired assortment of swarthypower (or money) hungry villains.The new twist involves the legendary character of the ScorpionKing (WWF's The Rock in his well suited -- and undemanding --debut performance) whose legend is laid out in a tidy openingsequence set some 5000 years in the past. Suffice to say, theforces of both good and evil are concerned with the ScorpionKing's resurrection and the ancient prophesy that would releasethe evil Egyptian God Anubis' army of the undead upon theunsuspecting world. Do I have to keep it a secret as to whoprevails?The movie is charged with energy and the action doesn't let uplong enough for anyone to groan over the scripts numerousattempts at machismo-levity in the face of great peril (a hallmark ofFraser's). In the end, the movie, like its predecessor, strives to bean Indiana Jones episode. And, as with its predecessor, it comesoff as a 2nd rate imitation. It just tries too hard and the strain bogsthe film down. What's most surprising about this movie is howdisappointing the special effects turn out to be. The seams reallyshow during several crucial sequences. Most egregious of all isthe CGI figure of the resurrected Scorpion King as a half man/halfscorpion creature. What is supposed to look like The Rock's headand upper torso, looks like one of the human characters from ToyStory. Those Ray Harryhausen stop motion creatures from theSinbad movies would have been more effective.I would recommend The Mummy Returns for everyone who enjoyed the first movie. It's not a bad family fright movie either.While the action may be intense for the smallest movie-agekiddies, the violence is quite bloodless. Most harrowing foryoungsters might be the scene where the decomposed Imhotep""sucks"" the skin off of three victims (who kind of deserved itanyway, in the morality of the narrative) in order to reconstitute hisown flesh. It sounds worse than it actually appears on film, believeit or not. Actually, so does this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun if you do not analyse the improbabilities too much,"I have not seen many movies with so many reviews, 88 pages! Maybe as many liking it as thinking it is boring. I found one guy quite funny, he said the film was ""very good"" and said he'd give it ten out of ten, yet the vote shown was six out of ten!I've seen it a couple of times in the TV, the last time very late at night. I could have watched something else but gave it another go and still found things to enjoy. I think that's because I ignore the improbabilities.I like most of the acting, Brendan Fraser is always good, Rachel Weisz gorgeous and doing fighting scenes well, I find Patricia Velasquez (Anck-Su-Namun) beautiful in very characteristic way. I do not get it why some think Freddy Boath (Alex O'Connell) so annoying, maybe they have no children (?). The character does well not to be intimidated by his captors. I find Arnold Vosloo as the Mummy handsome and an excellent actor. There is even humour in the acting by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as the big bad guy. I would like to see more of Obed Fehr (Ardeth Bay), I know he was in the ""Charmed"" but cannot remember his character. John Hannah (Jonathan Carnahan) is always funny, and I liked Shaun Parkes as Izzy.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not the best follow-up,"The first of these wasn't a great film and this one fell further behind. Continuing from where the Mummy left off, in this installment, the body of the pries re-awakens and creates havoc.The first movie had the benefit of a new, interesting cast and a possibly good movie but this second installment had nothing going for it. From the beginning it was obvious that this was simply a sad attempt of banking on the success of the first film. They didn't even have the decency of giving us a new story, the just recycled the old one.What is left for us here is a movie full of nothing but special effects and, fortunately, the public is not yet dumb enough to accept this.5/10 This installment had nothing going for it other than the cast and some redone fx",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I would rather have an aneurism...,"The Mummy Returns was possibly the most inconstitent movie I have ever seen. There were at least twenty times during the movie where the plot completely fell to pieces and the viewer was left so totally confused that there was nothing else to do but get lost in the incessant wave of visual effects, which were no where near as impressive as the previews made out.  I can't even begin to describe the plot holes that so confounded me with their stupidity that it made Independence Day look like a screenplay masterpiece worthy of Oscar recognition.  Of course, Brandon Fraiser was as wooden as ever, the British girl (whatever her name his) is just as annoying as every movie she has been in, the kid is ridiculous, and all the other characters don't even have enough personality between them to pull off the Olson twins on Full House.  Simply put, I'm so dumb struck by the sheer monstrosity this 'film' represents that I would prefer to watch every episode of Step by Step and Family Matters back to back before I would sit through that utter maggot-ridden garbage born from Satan's bowels.

I actually hated the first mummy but this was twice as cool. The action was simply much more imaginative and the effects were lovely. Who can forget the little nasty pygme's or the Anubis warriors? Those are really great new creatures. The Scorpion King, on the other hand, looked weird and cartoonish. I liked the references to the first film.

"Just as the same as the original, but more action and a few laughs","""The Mummy Returns"" is the sequel to the 1999 box-office sleeper starring Brendan Fraser as John O'Connell, a swashbuckling adventurer stealing many of the treasures of Egypt along with having to stop an evil un-dead God from taking over the world.Six years pass as John is married to librarian/archaeologist lover Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) from the first movie where they are doing the same adventures where they have a son, Alexander (Freddie Boath), joining in on the action. Evelyn starts having visions where she pictures herself as this other person back in Egypt before discovering something deep in the caverns of one of their expeditions. The bracelet of Anubis is in the hands of the O'Connell's.In another part of London, Blatus Hafez (Alun Armstrong) has his own agenda where he wants to raise Prince Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) back from the dead to awake the Scorpion King (The Rock) and unleash hell all over the world. Blatus gets help from Meela Nais (Patricia Valesquez) who bares a resemblance to Imhotep's girlfriend Anuk-Su-Namun from the first Mummy movie.Along the way, Alex is kidnapped by Blatus's goons where they believe the parents will give when the bracelet of Anubis is handed by them.John Hannah brings comic relief as Johnathan Caranhan, Evelyn's brother, and gets involve in more action scenes. Oded Fehr returns as Ardeth Bay, the anti-hero from the first movie who plays a much larger role than in the original where he's more of a hero and ally.It's good fun, but it takes too much formula of the original movie from the special effects, including a water chase sequence that looks like the sand chase from the first movie. There's also a character in the film called Izzy where his name sounds like a derivate of Beni just like in the original. There's more screams and surprises than in the original where there's hardly any laughs despite one or two scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Like Brendan Fraser in this,"The opening of the film had already utilized many special effects including the Tower at Thebes and the two armies fighting till the death. Also, The Rock (even though his only line was in Ancient Egyptian) was still pretty solid. After an intense war scene, we finally arrive on the O'connells. Rick (Brendan Fraser) is now a family man. His son, Alex, shows as much strength and warmth that both Evy and Rick have. Throughout the film, the relationship within the family grew and amassed to that of an odd family. The film doesn't slow down yet, we are then treated to beautiful sets that have you believe they actually were in Egypt all those years ago. Also, Alan Silvestri has a truly magnificent score that is used to its fullest potential. The film takes us to Hamunaptra, where Imhotep is found inside of some cocoon like object.

"A guilty pleasure sequel that's more of the same, but still fun","Now some of you have remembered my review of the first Mummy film. While it may not be a classic, I'm one of the few people who liked it due to the likeable cast, the sets, action sequences, great music from the late Jerry Goldsmith, and atmosphere. Then when I heard that they made two sequels to this, I became interested and watched the former, this one, to see if it would be as good as the first.From what I've got, it's nothing spectacular, but for what it is, this sequel is a guilty pleasure. Ok there are some problems like the story being a carbon copy of the first like some sequels, a few inconsistencies with the script and some of the effects looked great when the film came out in theaters but they don't hold up very well.That being said, everything else stood out fine. The cast is still likeable especially Brendan Fraser and Arnold Vosloo (to those who don't know, kid actor Freddie Boath, who played the son of Brendan Fraser and Rachel Wiesz's characters Rick and Evelyn, chose to audition for this role instead of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's (Sorcerer's in USA) Stone. Which is a shame really, but that's life I guess), the sets are very unique, the action sequences are even better and while Alan Silversti's score may not be as strong as Jerry Goldsmith's in the original, the guy did a serviceable job providing some of the best action music in years.Overall, The Mummy Returns isn't a classic, but it's still a guilty pleasure sequel and to those who haven't seen it yet, check it out!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Nearly Ruined by CGI,"The Mummy Returns captured my attention for months as I followed the trailers and news online regarding it's contents.  I was very excited when I purchased the tickets ahead of time yesterday afternoon, and more excited when I saw that the shows had ALL sold out.  It appeared people were as excited and curious as I was.The Mummy Returns presents us with the return of our favorite characters, or not-so-favorite if you had questionable thoughts about the first.  It is overdone on the CGI all throughout, and even a little child would be able to notice the created waterfall.  C'mon guys... pixels are bad!The fighting scenes were great, aside from the final which was again destroyed by the CGI.  The characters were more developed, and we were able to see the magi more, as I would have liked in the first.  The story keeps you going, and the movie never slows down; I didn't have to readjust in my seat once!The actors do a very good job and bring that comicbook style Indiana Jones to the screen.  Yes, I said Indiana Jones.  It's not, okay!  Don't go into this movie thinking it's a Spielberg production that's now a cult-classic trilogy.After seeing this, I am anticipating the Scorpion King and will be there purchasing my tickets ahead of time for it.  Do I think this movie will be the summer's biggest hit?  Not too sure.

A worthy sequel,"This is a movie I have been waiting to see since the first movie.  I thought that the story was fairly well written, and thought that a sequel, if well done, would be great fun.I wasn't disappointed.  The movie takes up 10 years after the events in the first movie; Rick and Evie are married and have a son, Alex, and are living in London when they're not on digs in Egypt.  Now that the Bembridge Scholars have come to their senses, Evie is working at the British Museum, and has begun to have strange dreams and waking visions of her in ancient Egypt.Enter Imhotep, newly resurrected by his followers, who is going to rule the Army of Anubis and take over the world.  Anksunamun is also there, in the flesh, to help Imhotep on his mission.  His mission is to defeat The Scorpion King, the ancient leader of the Army of Anubis, played by The Rock. Lots of action, fighting, mummies running up walls and golden pyramids later, our heroes prevail (as if you expected otherwise?)The story runs pretty smoothly throughout and the acting is pretty good, at least as good as the first movie.  I wasn't expecting Oscar nominations out of this movie.  If you are, wait until it comes out on video and save a couple of bucks for your disappointment.  The special effects were OK, too, though a lot of them were rehashes from the first one (wall of water instead of sand, Imhotep absorbing the souls of his victims to gain strength, mummies running on the walls, scarabs coming out of the sand, etc.)  The most annoying part of the movie, which I had problems getting past, was the very poor quality of the computer-generated graphics involving The Scorpion King in the last bit of the movie.  Given the high quality of the rest of the CGI, from the recreations of Carnac to the Army of Anubis to Imhotep-in-tatters, this was very difficult not to notice.Overall, a good adventure flick with a couple of good laughs thrown in, this should be on a par with the original Mummy in terms of success and viewability.

The characters were the same, but they did not seem to be having the same feel to the them as they did in the first movie. The film's nature was darker as well, not as tongue-in-cheek as the first picture. The reason I liked the Mummy so much was its blend of high-octane action, great stuntwork, good special effects, and a light touch of comedy. Here everything is CGI special effects in overdrive, much in the same vein as the Jurassic Park films. Also, the darker nature of the film made it seem less interesting than the first one did. Once again, I point out that it wasn't all bad. Some of the new characters were very interesting, and some of the returning ones had their moments, but this film will not go down in my books as an instant classic, like the first one did.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This abomination has neither.  It is all Hollywood hype and marketing at its worst, anything to make the buck.  Of course, from a business point of view it is a wild success, just about the most profitable movie opening ever.  No accounting for taste, what?  All this despite the fact that the computer graphics look as though they were designed by a 3 year old (and a not very bright 3 year old at that) and the story written on the fly.  The acting, what there is of it squeezed between the CGI ""action"" sequences which fills most of the movie, is abyssmal.  The female lead looks about as Egyptian as a bowl of borscht.

The Sequel that Greed Built,"""The Mummy Returns"" is a very LOUD sequel that is really about 10 movies condensed into one.  Unfortunately, not one of those movies is very interesting.  Breaking down the plot to make sense would actually require a 10'x10' flowchart and a PowerPoint presentation, so I'll do my best without those.The movie starts off with an army of people yelling at an army of snarling CG Enubis warriors.  One of those armies is led by The Scorpion King (Duane ""The Rock"" Johnson), who gets his power from a cumbersome bracelet.  There's a lot more yelling and screaming and somehow the King sells his soul to the God Enubis for the use of his army.  But for some reason the King can't use the army until he arises back from the dead at some point in time, which of course just happens to coincide with the rest of the events of the movie.  Confused yet?A few centuries later, some people decide to wake up Imhotep, the mummy that we all thought died for sure in the first movie.  Obviously, these idiots didn't pay to see ""The Mummy"" 2 years ago or they'd know that whenever Imhotep wakes up he's always in a bad mood and feels like taking over the world.  Still, you'd think their reasons for resurrecting him would be justified.  Wrong.  Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.  Nothing in this movie is justified.They want to wake up Imhotep because he's the only one powerful enough to kill the Scorpion King and his army of Enubis.  But whoever kills the King gets to take over the army, and so, once again, someone will have to kill Imhotep.  Can I ask something?  If Imhotep is more powerful than the S. King, and we don't think we can fight the King, how are we then supposed to kill the practically unstoppable Imhotep?Wouldn't it make sense to just kill the Scorpion King and eliminate the middle mummy?Our usual heroes are back from the first movie: Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser); his wife Evelyn (vamped-out Rachel Wise); and the sexy Ardeth Bay (Oded Fahr), one of those Mummy guardian people who are SUPPOSED to keep all this disastrous stuff from happening in the first place. And now we also have Alex, Rick and Evelyn's love child.After coming home to London from an expedition, Alex accidentally puts on the Scorpion King's magic bracelet and is then kidnapped by the people who happen to be resurrecting Imhotep in a nearby museum. So now Rick, Evelyn, and the usual gang must try and find their son before the Scorpion King wakes up and wants his jewelry back.On their way to find Alex, the group destroys a double-decker bus, sets fire to a library, somehow makes it back to Egypt, and recruits a token funny black guy to pilot a wishy-washy blimp that will take them to the Scorpion King's resting place.  Meanwhile, Ardeth has recruited all the guardians to help in the fight against one or more of the bad guys (pick one, who cares?).  The folks who kidnapped Alex are now accompanied by the resurrected Imhotep are also on their way to pay a visit to the Scorpion King.  Remember?  Imhotep is supposed to kill him, and we'll kill Imhotep.  Oy, and, as if there wasn't enough happening already, the gang encounters these pygmie-type gremlin things in a bizarre oasis outside the Scorpion King's pyramid.  The pygmies run around in the tall grass of the oasis and kill people.  They looked fake and were pretty pointless.Speaking of fake, if you blink at all while watching this movie, it's like missing out on $10,000,000 worth of computer graphics, including a wall of water that looks as if it were drawn in crayon by a 3 year-old, and a very fake Scorpion King in his ""scorpio"" form (I suppose the Rock was unavailable for pick-ups).Other than being visually assaulting, the soundtrack consists of a looping ""ARRRRRRRG!"" type sound, and, at the end, when everything inexplicably self-destructs, there's just a deafening ""WHOOOSSSSHHHH!"" mixed in with the ""ARRRRRGGGGG!""  Even the ending credits are loud.This movie will make so much money.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

The acting was fine and the story was about as believable as you can get for a mummy.

the receipt is been useful,"you waited it, it now arrived the entertainment of the summer (and the year). But which says entertainment does not say necessarily intelligent.Writer and director, Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, Deep Rising) reiterate his bet, that of concocter a diverting film, a giant blockbuster, a cinematographic carcass made up immenses blocks... with much money (95 million dollars spent well in the circumstances).In fact, one associates (always) movie of year with pure american entertainment; Could The Mummy Returns does not dislodge with the rule, how it? One often says that blockbuster has the resources which do one of them, but this one wants to be the cream of the cream.Characters attaching, coloured and alive, slight amount of romantic, mirobolants effects and three-dimensional, well introduced humour, history folded back with simplest without possible confusion (interesting and comprehensible, this is not what I seek this kind of production?); ambiance total appears dynamic, thorough, energetic and visually splendid and spectacular.All the estival ingredients pullulate in this Hollywood production (turned mainly to Africa and England) for our greater pleasure. If he's necessary to have waiting, that's to be diverted well of the whole beginning to the any end, nothing else. If you move for other thing, you knocked with bad... fall. No ounce of reflexion, therefore impossible to split hairs; no chance to win oscar, therefore it will not pass to history and its later range will not be deep. Can one be upset with him with the scenario writer not to have thought of including a certain psychological level? Never, that's an entertainment. The only reason so that we  remember it in the years to come will be the seal collected with the box office (68, 1 million dollars during a weekend. WOW! ).Mainly, which is worth the turning, it is that the film makes us pass one excellent moment - on this subject, I will lie down month tightened this evening. Except for exception (Terminator II), rare are the films which enjoy a sequel to offer the package to us whose container dazzles us, does not leave us indifferent, wants to be higher than its baby; a sequel which does not leave us perplexed.In what milked with story just as it is, it is necessary to remember the first episode, but that of the second does not want to be complicated. I would say that it is is higher than this type of production. Does the scenario writer take necessary time to analyse, to explain and then to show us the continuation of the events... special effects. The narrative frame thus is well wrapped by the orgy of the visual effects, and the characters who make it up, installation to attract crowd.At all events, the only thing of which you must remember is it is about an ENTERTAINMENT, a big BLOCKBUSTER (as they are liked), nothing else. Remember this. If the first were compared with new Indiana Jones (not for me in any case), the second appears out of this category. If the producers want to copy this famous archaeologist, they must go to be repaired; they are beside the "" track "" and have not completely to find the whip corresponding - I prefer to await the fourth of the series Indiana Jones. The return of the mummy is an action movie which is caught for an adventure movie. There is the great negative point. history told definitely lower and is thought than his false friend; it is less true, less historical, less serious, less dramatic and less adventurous in more than the contribution humorous less and not very subtle (but it is very effective...). And is it not there that you say that one is a movie adventure and the other is an action movie, disguised that one to me? I love you, one thus returns to the starting point, sensational...What disappoints in the movie prove the end (the interior final scene frontwith Mr WWF disguised in scorpion for the needs for film... ridiculous but obvious). we almost don't believe. The effects are atrocious, null and incredible (undoubtedly only the most negative pushing back).Then with you to judge if you will then move (after having seen this of course film, because you must see it entertainment to perfect your psychology) for the third opus of the Mummy which will be entitled - with less that it changed - THE SCORPION KING (currently in turning) with The Rock itself and Michael Clarke Duncan (the giant of THE GREEN LINE) planned initially for fall 2001, but without the original actors...PASS A good movie...",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Modern Movie For A Simpler Time,"""The Mummy Returns"" plays like a film made in the forties when Universal produced four sequels to the original ""The Mummy"" (1932). Though I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I think most classic monster fans will, it may seem out of place to today's more ""sophisticated and enlightened"" movie crowd.The movie's all about fun and high-adventure and it delivers in spades on both! It contains all of the excitement, thrills and intrigue that can be found in the adventure serials of the thirties and forties.  Whether intentional or not, the CGI creature effects hearkened back to the days of Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen. Though much smoother than their stop-motion techniques, there was an obvious separation between the computer world and the real world. This added a kitschy feel to the film which I loved. When this movie is released for home viewing, I plan on watching it in black and white to get the complete 1940's feel!The bottom line: If you go to the theatre to be entertained and to escape the real world, go see ""The Mummy Returns"", the kid inside you will thank you for it!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A fun sequel, enjoyable and entertaining.","When I first learned that they were coming out with a sequel to the Mummy, I pretty much knew exactly what to expect.  More of the same.  More special effects, more action, less plot, and alot more laughs.  I was not disappointedI can appreciate any sequel that shamelessly makes fun of the original. Two scenes in particular are taken directly from the original.  Same lines and everything.I can also appreciate a movie that refuses to take itself seriously.  The movie knows it's not a shining example of filmmaking masterpiece.  It revels in it.And finally, I can appreciate any movie that makes fun of so many other movies.  There were a number of Matrix-ish style moves, and the showdown between O'Connel and Imotep just screamed ""PHANTOM MENACE.""  There was alot of Indiana Jones...and I near died laughing when Rick and Evie were standing on the bow of the balloon-ship, (which I also don't understand.) Titanic, anyone?  And there was also the part with them running down a narrow hallway ahead of a torrent of rushing water.I could be wrong, but anyone who has ever played the computer game Diablo 2, by Blizzard Entertainment will swear that the little blowgun pygmy creatures, the creatures in the dark army, and the Rock-Scorpion king all have very obvious counter-parts in the game.I also enjoyed how the producers were able to get around The Rock's utter lack of acting talent by casting him in a role that does not require him to act.  Gotta love it.In short, this movie is not one that will go down as one of the great movies in history.  But it's extremely entertaining, and would be an excellent movie to watch with a group of friends.  I highly recommend it to anyone.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
TERRIBLE sequel and a TERRIBLE film period,"The Mummy Returns looked really good before it came out. However I saw it last night and it is a waste of film. I LOVE The Mummy. Sure it might not have been entirely original but it was FUN and it never took itself seriously. Plus Jerry Goldsmith conducted a wonderful score.With this film, it takes itself way too seriously, has a TERRIBLE score(Alan Silvestri sucks!), and it is a ripoff of the Indiana Jones Trilogy(whoever thinks Brendan Fraser-while a cool guy-is better than Indiana Jones is insane), The Matrix, and The Lost World. The little pygmy warriors serve absolutely no point in this dreck. They pluck people down and attack them EXACTLY like the Velociraptors did in The Lost World. Rick O'Connell fights Imhotep with some Matrix-ish moves and The Scorpion King( this guy is only in the film for less than five minutes!) throws enemies to the ground in the style of The Matrix.The CGI is an embarassment. ILM has done GREAT work on so many other films, and they did a totally horrible job on this. When the giant scorpion with the Rock's head appeared at the end, I laughed myself silly at it's hokiness, as did many others in the packed theater. Either Stephen Sommers wanted to pay homage to Ray Harryhausen or he just wanted to do a rush job and that much is clear through the whole film. If he had another year(all sequels should at least have three years inbetween them) to work on this, he could have refined the CGI and plot so much more. Yes this is a popcorn movie and it was never intended to be Shakespeare but The Mummy had decent acting, great CGI, and a coherent plot. The Mummy Returns has none of these things.I highly advise anyone who has not seen this film to not see it. It is a dissapointment and a waste of money.The Mummy RULESThe Mummy Returns SUCKS",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Summer Movie since Terminator 2!!!,"THIS is how you make a summer blockbuster!!!! Exciting action scenes, cool special effects, decent acting, cool story....the only people who won't like this movie are the people who shouldn't see movies like this in the first place.The first Mummy was pleasant, but a little too slight and jokey for my taste. This movie isn't particularly darker, but the fight scenes are much more kick-@ss (if a little too Matrix-inspired), and the story just feels more solid and involving than the first one. Granted, there isn't that much character development, but you'll still find yourself caring about the good guys, and even the bad guys as well.My only complaint would be the over-hyping of The Rock. He was only in it for about 2 minutes, and didn't have any dialogue!!! Why cast one of the great speech-makers of our time and have him not say anything!?!But all in all, this movie did what The PHANTOM MENACE should have done - provide fun, rabble-rousing, rip-roaring entertainment from beginning to end.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Entertaining Film,"This is a film full of action, romance, and horrible situations you can only experience in nightmares or your greatest fears. There are bits of comedy with a small boy who manages to get himself deeply involved with a Scorpion bracelet and fits in quite well with this thriller of a story. Brendon Fraser, (Rich) sort of plays second fiddle to Rachel Weisz ,(Evelyn) who seems to handle the Scorpion King with no problems. If you hate looking at scorpions, you will definitely have your share and some might be larger than you plan to deal with in this film. Excellent production but rather too long and drawn out at times, but worth viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I only regret that one is the lowest rating,"This movie hurt me in a way that I have never been hurt before.  I feel it was the worst movie that I have ever seen in a theatre....The Mummy Returns is a non-stop thrill ride of plot holes, superficial acting, poorly done special effects, and scenic rip-offs of well known movies.  Only one other movie I have seen drove me to the point of screaming while I watched it, I was overcome with a desire to warn others that they should not see this film.While I sat in the theatre, I was wistfully remembering horrid films that in comparison outshine this.... this.. ugh, words fail to describe this monstrousity.  I remember films like: Congo, Ishtar, Howard the Duck; I found myself thinking about how much fun I'd be having if these films were on the screen instead of the Mummy 2.  I wished for a power failure, earthquake, hurricaine, anything to stop the pain that was throbbing behind my eyes.I won't spoil the storyline, mainly because I felt the movie lacked one...maybe there is a rosetta stone buried somewhere in Hollywood that fills in the tattered swiss-cheese plot.  Or maybe the makers of this film are true sadists and have planned a Mummy 3 that will run along the same time frame filling in the holes in Mummy 2.   God, I hope not.My friend I watched the movie with summed it up very well when he said, ""You have to treat movies like this like you would treat a bear attack... Just try to go limp, hope you survive, and try to cover up your genitalia.""I'll conclude with a plea to anyone who is listening, don't go see this movie, if you waste the price of admission on this terrible movie, you'll likely never forgive yourself.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another magnificent piece from Sommers,"Truly an adventure film with instant action, fast paced, makes you forgot about time and drags you right in.The cast is good to great, I can't complain about The Rock (a wrester in real life) is perfectly cast (representing a great warrior), Voslo and Velasquez as villains are also very good, less fits in my opinion the good characters represented by Frazer and Weisz.A blazing cinematography (CGI used everywhere, battles of tens of thousands (!) of warriors). The ancient Egypt and pyramids never looked so vivid and great as in this ""motion picture"".Story is simple and straight as a good tale and adventure should be. There are also some grotesque side stories (John Hannah really makes me laugh at times), the film seams to never get boring for me (I've seen it more then once, it even gets better when you see it a second time).Sound soundtrack from Silvestry (a very adventure like one, his style seams to fit to this kind of films well, he scores another adventure film L.Croft Cradle of life recently with soundtrack very close to this one).You can also look at it as a great tale and watch it with you young kids, they will be well entertained too.I give it 9/10 for the year of 2001.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

The last half hour of the movie is very loud.,"I went to The Mummy Returns expecting to enjoy a couple of hours of action and some great special effects. But for some reason, the picture just didn't pull together for me into a coherent whole. There were about a half dozen young teens in front of me and I expected they'd be noisy, but they just sat there - no reaction at all to the movie.I suspect this might play better on a TV at home.

"Too much special effects, not enough story","The Mummy Returns was quite a fun movie, but really lacks a lot compared to the first one.  The special effects were amazing and at the same time disappointing.  It seemed that Sommers (director) couldn't leave one single frame untouched by special effects.  To be sure the graphics were quite realistic, but in the way they were used it was so over the top and outlandish that the 'specialness' (if that is a word) of the effect was lost.The original had a bit more of a quality story for what is at the most basic level a B-line movie.  The Mummy Returns was full of too many characters: The brother-in-law and the child were of no use and did nothing to advance the plot.  The Scorpion King was a thin plot device to use two evil characters instead of one bad guy. It is a sequel and therefore must have more baddies.Special effects were best put to use in the panorama/CGI images of ancient Egypt, the large battle scenes and in the visionary use of the Scorpion bracelet.  Otherwise, the closeups of CGI monsters, The half-scorpion/half-Rock creature at the end, the pygmy mummies, the dirigible/boat combo were altogether uninspiring.Overall I have to give it a 6.  It WAS fun, and I do love a good mummy movie, but the first was better.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
check the demographics,"First off, I did enjoy this film immensely, as I did the original.Obviously, neither is deathless cinema, and while the original had maybe a bit more innocence and charm, this one makes up for it with a certain depth. Problem is that it gets lost in all the special effects... Let me get to my main point, though, which was something I arrived at in reading the demographics on the votes. Almost every ""real"" review I have seen of this film makes a point of it being geared towards adolescent males, and this is where the surprise lies. Because across the board, this film is favored by women...and not necessarily the younger ones. Until I noted those figures, I thought I might be alone, but just let me speak for a moment to any of those ladies out there who might be wondering if this is something they might enjoy...Yes, it is too loud. Yes, it has way too many computer generated action sequences. Yes, there are gaping holes in the plot... But it's fun. It's a great movie to watch with the kids, and also one to enjoy alone. There's romance of both the worldly and otherworldly variety.There's a movie kid who is actually appealing.For those who like him, there's Brendan Fraser at his swashbuckling best.There are strong female characters(though I personally thought Anck-su-Namun turned out to be a real B****) It has some captivating eye candy in the shape of Oded Fehr, and last but by no means least, the writhe-in-your-seat-sexy Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep.

An Honest Review,"And what happened? The Mummy Returns is far from a bad flick. It is still a massively entertaining adventure, but it just seems...odd? Here there be mysteries...but don't worry you don't have to see the first one to really understand the second. It's not that type of movie.But it is challenging. It challenges you to get past the...well, let me bring you up to speed.Fraser the foolhardy adventurer and Weisz the lost in her own world Archaeologist got together in the first film and are still together in the second, only now it's been a few years and they have a little kid.Hannah is still around playing the brother and black sheep of the family. Vosloo is still the mummy. Fehr is still the guardian of whatever society and the bulk of the film still takes place in Egypt.But it is challenging. It challenges you to keep up with the inconsistencies. Honestly, they are just pulling plot points out of hammer-space in this one. They are adding backstories that would have been insanely relevant in the first film had they thought they were going to make a sequel......but they didn't and rather than writing a follow-up that would stay consistent film they threw caution to the wind and opted to just make everything up and hope the audience went along with it.And we did.Because, let's face it, it's not exactly Shakespeare. We weren't expecting Richard the II. Honestly, if you can't follow it, you have an IQ below 80 and if the blatant inconsistencies upset you so much you can't get around them than you are taking life way too seriously for your own good.This is a popcorn popper. This is a soda sucker. This is a sit down in your chair and enjoy the campy-fun ride.The audience walked into The Mummy Returns expecting an adventure film that delivered action and humor and that is exactly what they got.The bottom line is that, despite its massive flaws, The Mummy Returns is still entertaining and that is all it is, Entertainment. Capital E there.If you want a heady work of cinematic brilliance...well, you shouldn't be watching this. This movie had one job and it pulled it off soundly.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Watchable, and enjoyable, almost throughout.","I saw The Mummy, and enjoyed it somewhat, and when I needed something to watch tonight I settled on the sequel.  I don't recall the original well enough to compare them very closely, but I can say that I did enjoy the sequel.  Not all that terribly much, but I would recommend it.For about the first hour, the film is a wonderful action comedy.  The characters, dialogue, and action were all working for me.  Then at about the halfway mark things start slowing down in the film, and when the action picks up at the end for a conclusion (That features no less than 3 simulatneous battles going on at any one time), it feels anti-climactic, hardly exciting, and ripe with action film cliches.Some of the stuff, like the interaction between the characters of the film first (I especially liked Jonathan, once more a worthless but humorous sidekick) works very nicely.  Others, like the good portion of screen time spent on a bizarre dirigible, including a chase scene that mirrors one from the original film, don't.  Most of the best stuff comes early in the film, and I found by the end I was losing interest.Part of the problem could be that the film is really exciting from the start, and practically doesn't let up for the first hour.  After that, I was sufficiently thrilled, I almost didn't need more, so when the conclusion came, I didn't have any energy left to invest in it.Those who are going to see The Rock in this film, be warned.  He appears for only about 5 minutes in the film.  I don't quite understand how he got so much money and billing for a part that seemed like a cameo to me.  Imhotep, the Mummy from the first film, returns (Hence the title) but is pretty underused.I would marginally recommend the film, especially to fans of the first, but I would not go in expecting anything more than a summer action film that presents a lot of special effects, perhaps too many for its own good.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Could have been a video game movie.,"Here, at last and for your consideration, is a film that is so very nonsensical the term movie doesn't even apply to it. The Mummy Returns is basically a rehash of  the action sequences from such blockbusters as Raiders of the Lost Ark, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Lost World: Jurassic Park (you'd have to be pretty desperate to rip off that last one, right?). I'd go through all of The Mummy Returns' 'influences' here, or at least more of them, if it wasn't such a behemoth task. And then 'writer/ director' Stephen Sommers connects these action sequences through something which only by videogame standards (ten years ago) could be called a plot.But then, you may ask, sometimes you don't watch movies for intelligent plotting, clever subtexts, deep and moving performances or even a coherent and fitting visual style. Sometimes all you want is your money's worth in excitement, adrenaline, thrills and spills. While spills are abundant here, the other three are sadly passed by. There's an uninspired (but expensive!) bus chase through Londen, one-and-a-half CTHD-style choppily edited (but expensive!) fight sequences and innumerable predictable (but expen..- oh, who cares) scenes featuring CGI creatures. Yes, The Mummy Returns certainly has its fair share of visual effects, although the quality is often debatable. But its main problem is, the excitement, adrenaline and thrills never take off, because Sommers does not only forget to establish any real kind of threat, he also doesn't make us care about the characters. Sommers seems to argue that effects equal excitement, but they do not.Now, to be honest, I never saw The Mummy (nor am I very anxious to). When it came out in 1999, after The Matrix had proven action could be done in a stylish and clever way, I never really felt like seeing another popcorn no-brainer. And to be honest, I can't think of a single pure no-brainer since The Matrix that I really enjoyed (unless you're counting Gladiator). But still, at least with M:I-2, X-Men, and even Hollow Man I found highlights and I could follow something of a storyline. The Mummy Returns is for me nothing more than a rumoured $160 million of computer-generated nonsense. I could've spent two hours watching grass grow, and I'd still be more entertained.Rating: 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Film Containing Action and CGI in Lieu of Suspense and Horror,"This film begins in ancient times with a warrior known as ""the Scorpion King"" (Dwayne Johnson) amassing an army for which he intends to conquer the known world. To his dismay he is soundly defeated while besieging Thebes and as a consequence he is left wandering in the desert with no food or water. It's then that he prays to the Egyptian god Anubus and promises his soul for the opportuntity to defeat his enemies one last time. True to his word, Anubus grants this request by conjuring up an army of jackal warriors for which the Scorpion King does indeed conquer everything in his path to include the city of Thebes. But as soon as he tastes his hard-fought victory Anubus claims soul of the Scorpion King along with the army given to him. The scene then shifts to five thousand years later with an archeologist named ""Rick O'Connell"" (Brendon Frazer) and his wife ""Evelyn O'Connell"" in the process of exploring a tomb near ancient Thebes. Also with them is their young son ""Alexander O'Connell"" who discovers a small chest which contains a gold bracelet. Upon putting it on his wrist he suddenly sees a vision of where the Scorpion King's sepulcher is located. Not long afterward, the curator of the British Museum resurrects the mummy of ""Imhotep"" () who plans on resurrecting the Scorpion King for the purpose of killing him and assuming command of his army in order to conquer the world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie had numerous sub-plots which became rather confusing at time. Likewise, the inclusion of numerous action scenes and CGI in lieu of any noticeable suspense or horror was also a feature which lessened the overall potential this film could have had. Be that as it may, while it certainly wasn't a bad film by any means, it could have been much better and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This sequel is excellent !,"They usually say sequels to movies can be pretty lame, but ""The Mummy Returns"" blew that right into the water. I thought this movie was creative and alot of fun, and the computer special effects were not too much at all.

Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz do a great job of reprising the eternal love between Rick and Evie, Freddie Boath did a great job as Alex and his character did seem to be a stronger combination of and than his parents. You have to love John Hannah as Jonathan, he's such a sweetie and him being a clutz is just hilarious. Oded Fahr was kewl as Ardeth Bay, he really get's into his role and  I hope to see him in further roles in Hollywood, I loved his character. It was sad to see Imhotep crying when Anaksahamun betray him like that, making him realise that there love wasn't true and that the term eternal love belonged to Rick and Evie.

"Entertaining, but could have been better","This movie was completely devoid of any unique plotline, but that doesn't diminish the entertainment value.  If you come into this movie expecting some profound meaning, you will be vastly disappointed by this rehashing of the same plot line that worked for Indiana Jones.  Because that is really all it is.  A little fighting, a little running, a little humor, shake it, don't stir it and you have this film.  But, if you have no expectations (I hadn't even ever seen the first one, though I hear this one was better, which makes me not want to see the first one), than you can just sit back and enjoy the scenery.  This movie was filmed in some beautiful locations (Egypt, London, Morocco, Petra, etc).  And Brendan Fraser and Oded Fehr are hunks.  And the humor kept the audience twittering, even if the delivery was a bit dry and contrived.Perhaps the worst element of this movie was some of the digital effects. The animation of the Scorpion King at the end was pathetic.  There is better animation in Pac Man.  The least they could have done was actually use The Rock rather than trying to recreate him digitally.  And enough already with the Matrix effects.  We've seen enough slow motion kicks and punches to last a lifetime.

Action packed but...,"I'm starting to see a trend in the new action/adventure movies and it may not be for the better. CGI (Computer Generated Images) is becoming one of the primary tools of many filmmakers but is it coming at a cost? We began to see CGI come into movies quite a few years ago but they were usually as enhancements to the story or to the set. Now CGI is becoming more prominent and taking a center stage role. The Mummy Returns is a very good example of this.The Mummy Returns is a sequel to the very popular The Mummy that came out in 1999. The story basically takes place several years later after our hero, Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Evie Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) have gotten married and have a young son (Freddie Boath). The couple are still the adventurous archeologists they were in the first movie but now they have a young son to take with them on their adventures. This story revolves around the resurrection of our arch villain, Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), but with a slight twist. This time around he's to kill the Scorpion King (The Rock) that will be making a reappearance after 5000 years to take over the world. But as noble as that sounds, his motives are less than desirable.Was I entertained? Yes, definitely BUT, this was a case of too much CGI. The blending of reality and fantasy together with CGI can be a tricky thing, especially when the two worlds meet. The audience whether consciously or not, will instinctively pick up on things when they are unable to identify with it. In this movie, we see many instances where the two worlds meet and quite a few times, my eye was attracted to something that didn't move naturally. Unlike the movie, Matrix, where we were basically told to suspend all beliefs about the law of physics and such, this movie incorporated characters that behaved human-like yet movements and detail gave them away. Mind you, I do not often see walking wolf-like creatures but their mannerism and general body shape was humanoid so the natural instinct was to identify with what you know and in too many cases, it didn't look right to the eye. The decision to generate a complete CGI of the Scorpion King at the end of the movie I thought was a big error. The looks were too cartoonish and resembled something you see on Saturday morning cartoons. It was too distracting and took away from the events at the time.However, I really enjoyed the fight sequences between the female leads (Weisz and Velazquez). They were quick and well choreographed. It's refreshing to see that directors are not afraid to show female leads as strong characters that are just as capable to fight as their male counter-parts. Fraser and Weisz played their parts well and like the last movie, Oded Fehr is outstanding. The Rock however is something else. In his movie debut, I found his performance a little bit extreme and probably not too far from his wrestling persona. Whether this will be the beginning of a film career or not, I cannot tell but hopefully his acting improves.Overall, this was a very entertaining movie to kick off the summer. It was full of action and fast paced but I've seen much better computer graphics in other movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Please, Mummy, do not return again.","I can't beleive I got tricked into seeing this. I kept telling myself it was going to be dumb but I went because The Rock was in it and The Rock says ""The Rock says to see The Mummy Returns"". So I went. God Almighty...After watching this I wanted to drive to Beverly Hills, buy a map to the stars' homes, find Brendan Fraser and smash his head against a wall 50 times. This guy should be blacklisted or fired from Hollywood. I know this is a movie in which the actor is supposed to relax and allow the story to carry itself but even that was bad! The mummies looked dumb. Did you see those cute little baby mummies?! What were they trying to do? Copy The Return of the Jedi with the cute little Wookies?The girls weren't attractive at all, not even that ""bad guy"" girl model.

You don't expect me to take this movie serouisly!,"Ok, this movie wasn't *that* bad, but it was close, how about i make a list of what i thought was really *that* bad...The acting, - The fight scenes, - The fight scenes, - The acting, - Plot loopholes, - The acting,And as you can tell, the acting REALLY  bugged me! I thought that this movie was nothing more than a joke, i couldn't understand WHY exactly this movie was intended to be serouis coz it bloody wasn't!

A Guilty Pleasure,"As a person who grew up with the Brendan Fraser Mummy films I have a place in my heart for them. However this film is terrible.

Returning With Better Effects But Mediocre Story,"I just ""returned"" (ha ha) from the movies this evening from seeing ""The Mummy Returns"". And while I loved it, I was also a bit disappointed.The story begins with a narrator explaining the legend of the Scorpion King (The Rock), and in turn begins with a magnificent battle scene. After the legend, we are taken to the current time where Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) are touring the tomb in which Evie finds the mystical bracelet of the Scorpion King. However, a group of bad guys and a reincarnated version of Im-Ho-Tep's (Arnold Vosloo) mistress Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Valezquaz) are also after that very bracelet to use in their plot to bring back Im-Ho-Tep, raise the Scorpion King's powerful armies from the dead, and take over the world (bwa ha ha!-kidding). They succeed in stealing the safe in which the bracelet was kept, but are foiled when they discover the bracelet isn't there, on account of it being on the wrist of Evie and Rick's kid, Alex (Freddie Boath). So they steal the kid, leading Rick and Evie into another wild adventure dealing with ancient curses and evil mummies in order to save both their son and the world from destruction.This movie was spell bounding cinematically. Beautiful and breath-taking special effects in almost all of the scenes! You saw some of The Matrix effects used in some of the fight scenes. And the sound effects have certainly improved from the last film. It was amazing to watch.But it stumbled upon one problem, and that problem can be best explained by one of my mottos for movies: a movie can't live on special effects alone. Between the action/fight sequences...well, the story was weak. It never really interested or impressed me whenever there was no effects. Now, I'm not one of those people that need lots of awesome effects to keep me entertained. It's just that the screenplay/story needed more work when it couldn't rely on movie magic to help it survive.The acting was okay. I thought Rachel Weisz was somewhat weak in her performance. Brendan Fraser did an alright job, as did pretty much all of the actors. The one I really liked though was whoever played Izzy, Rick's assistant. Any no-effects scene he was in was instantly wonderful. He deserved a bigger role, and I think they should make a movie out of Rick and Izzy's pre-Mummy adventures. I'd pay to see that!Overall, the movie was fun summer entertainment. While weak in some areas, I thought it was very fun to watch and a good way to spend a Friday night in the summer. I give it a 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
For those who didn't like the first...,"Quick and simple.The Mummy 1999 - Bad scarab effects(and overused), bad acting (especially the female lead), annoying supporting acting, and a movie that was confused at times if it wanted to be serious or just fun.The Mummy Returns 2001 - Cameo use of scarabs (darker and higher quality work), the lead actress learned how to act between films, the supporting cast did a much better job, and the movie was just overall more fun than the first.  Oh yeah, the fight choreography was much better also.Don't get me wrong, the sequel had it's problems also (nobody has been able to properly CG a human face yet, but ILM gives a good shot at it here)What makes the difference between the two films is that the first allowed its problems to detract from it's overall quality, while the second has problems that just add to the ""popcorn action film"" feel.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great action and fun,"This movie is like most sequels; it is not as good as the original.  But it is still a fun movie and worth seeing if you enjoy action, adventure, romance, and comedy.  It is your typical summer movie -- not heavy on the social commentary, but a two-hour ""check your brain at the door, sit back, and don't read too much into everything"" movie.  And let's face it -- isn't that what most of us enjoy about movies in the first place?All the lead players are back and they all do a fine job.  Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz make quite an adorable couple.  Unfortunately, John Hannah really is not a major player in this film, which is rather sad.  He was one of the reasons why the first one was so much fun.  Arnold Vosloo is still a menacing presence; and this time around Patricia Velasquez gets a bigger part.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Remarkable only for the amount of 3D effects thrown at the screen.,"This movie is unremarkable except for the amount of 3D effects which are thrown at the audience. I went to the film with very low expectations, expecting a fun-but-dumb action movie - and was very disappointed. There are so many action sequences lined up (one after the other) that the whole thing feels like an amusement park ride and not much else. It seems as if the camera/directing crew ran about shooting a whole bagload of sequences, and then tried to cram all the effects they could back into each one until they felt ""right"" or good enough to splice together to present in theaters. I think I even saw a scene with one of the extras in the background, trying to run off camera. As for the Egyptian theme of the work: there was one authentic-looking box which contained the stylistically strange ""scorpion bracer,"" and there was an outdoor shot of Abu Simbel which looked very nice but was an obvious model. That's about it for accuracy. Everything else is either a hodge-podge of other historic styles, or has a lumpy we-had-a-tatoo-artist-design-this look to it. Watch Indy Jones again if you want a great adventure film, or even Karloff's Mummy - it would be a better use of your time.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Summer Popcorn Movie,"The Mummy Returns is a great sequel to the entertaining Mummy.  The action is fast and furious, and pretty much non-stop.  The fight scenes are excellent, and well coordinated.  The Mummy Returns has great action, beautiful special effects, and it keeps your eyes glued to the screen.  This is not a movie you could easily fall asleep to.  It's got some good humor, and it has two love stories in it as well, so not just men will enjoy this movie.

"Horrible, mindless, garbage.","I had high expectations for this movie since I thoroughly enjoyed the first one, but now after seeing it, I can honestly say I would like my money back. We have all the original actors starring in the same roles. Not to mention the addition of the ""bart simpson"" like Alex character, son of Rick and Evie. He was a pointless addition, as it's obvious he's just there for brief (and un-funny) comic relief. John Hannah revises his role of 'Jonathan Carnahan, and is painfully annoying in this picture. He was much more entertaining in the first movie, and is disgraced even more in this. Aside from the flat and boring characters, we have the love story between Imhotep and Anck Su Namun, which is a disgrace to to any love story ever written. They have no chemistry, and the audience does not feel anything for them. If you are going for the graphics, you will be sorely disappointed.The graphics in this movie look like they were cut and pasted from a nintendo game. If you are a fan of the first movie, and have any respect for it, do not see this movie, as you will lose all love and respect for the series.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Mummy 2,"Oh the difficulties of being a sequel. So much to live up to and so rarely do they succeed. This is another in a long line of underperforming second installments. It's not awful, but it's a marked step down from the first.The big problem here is that the first one was such a hit that the studio started seeing huge dollar signs and just had to try and milk every dollar they could. We get the Scorpion King, which spins off into a bunch of spin offs, most bad. It's also cramming in a lot of really forced and clunky backstory and exposition that they clearly wanted to come back to in more movies, but that never happened.Like I said, it's not awful, it's just kinda average and mediocre, which is a real disappointment.

Let's see how many Indiana Jones rip-offs can be put on film,"Look, this film had some entertaining moments, however, there were NO surprises.  I think almost every minute of this film was borrowed from somewhere else.  If it wasn't from the entire Indiana Jones trilogy it was Army of Darkness or James Bond or the Matrix or Final Fantasy (video game). Despite the fast pace and attempts at action, I was distracted by all the scenes and elements I recognized from other places.  Hollywood at its most unoriginal trying to pass off the same old thing refurbished.  Nothing special.  6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Take it at face value, folks","Well, the first thing I noticed, within the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, was the plot of this movie being very convoluted and a strong suspension of disbelief being required.  There are also a whole lot of handy coincidences and characters saying ""I remember this guy"" or ""Not this, again!"" which gets real old after a while.There is also a smart alec kid who could get on your nerves, even if you're trying really hard to like him.The movie is also rated PG-13 this time around and so there is a lot less gore and it's not nearly as scary as the first one.  Which sucks.The Rock was really okay (quite out of character actually) and as usual Brendan Fraser is yummy and his costars are competent.So it was a good flick as far as the action and special effects and all, but it's pretty hard to follow unless you're paying really close attention. I'd say it's worth your attention -- just pay attention!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More of the same but the same great quality,"The sequel to the fantastic adventure that was The Mummy was always going to be a tough job. Thankfully the same cast and crew are reunited with writer/director Steven Somers taking the helm once again.The good thing about this movie is that it doesn't try to top the original but what it does do is offer up more of the same. Same feel, same look, same humour and it all works nicely to bring a sequel that will keep you entertained for an hour or two.It has to be said it's not 'quite' as good as the original. The story takes a strange turn in giving the characters some sort of mystical heritage which is a little odd but works nonetheless. The CGI is the usual standard for a film of this type but again I don't think it is quite as good as the first film.All this is just nitpicking as the plot and story race along very well and all the actors do their parts and look like they are having fun especially the young O'Connell Alex who is a nice addition to the cast.Nothing more can really be said, if you like me loved the first Mummy film then do not hesitate to watch this as it is simply an extension of the quality and will satisfactorily fill your 'more of the same' urge.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Best Worst Summer Movie,"I had the unfortunate opportunity to view this movie on opening night. I did see the original, and let me say...this one was much, much worse. In trying to top the first film, Summers over shoots his goal, landing in an ugly bog of horrible special effects, bad one liners, predictable plot turns, character inconsistency, and continuity errors abound. It had a great start, but after the first 30 minutes were over I just felt, well, queasy. Most of the acting was decent, but some very yuck-yuck moments ruined it.I recommend this film to anyone who has: a small child, a cell phone, or money to burn.If Summers had scaled down the ""epic"" story line, I think he could have had more money to support the special effects.

It was better than the first one!,"""The Mummy Returns"" is the sequel to the first ""Mummy"" about a the gun-fighter and librarian, now married and parents, who must face the infamous Imhotep, who is awaken by a evil group. But the other thing that they must do is get back their son, who is captured by the evil group and taken to the Oasis of Ahm-Shere because they are looking to awaken the Scorpion King so that Imhotep can kill him and gain control of his armies.Now you may read my version of the synopsis and say, ""This sounds stupid. I don't wanna see a movie like that,"" but it's actually a lot better than the first one. It was much more exciting, thrilling, and funny than the first one. The intensity of the first one may not be present, but it makes up for it by all the other things that I've listed here. Plus, there's an element of sadness to it. I don't want to say what it is, but believe me when I say, that there's is a good chance that you'll cry...if you like the characters as much as I do.So please, see this movie.

The Same Cast & Crew Returns,"When you look at what Stephen Sommers first ""The Mummy"" movie delivered, ""The Mummy Returns"" is a perfectly acceptable sequel. We get more adventure, more action and more cartoonish horror. A blend that simply manages to entertain in an unpretentious fashion with nothing more to it. Even more so than the first film was, ""The Mummy Returns"" is a CGI/SFX oozing fest in the adventurous vein of the legendary ""Indiana Jones"" movies. Only with mummies and other fantastic shenanigans this time. It's big budget summer blockbuster fun, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. The same cast & crew returns and delivers the goods a second time. By now Fraser & Weisz's characters have a kid, so you'll just have to take him along for the ride. Naturally, this also means that the film is intended for a very wide target audience, so all the violence & horror in this film is virtually bloodless, rather aimed to be enjoyable & spectacular than frightening or gruesome. The two films can easily be watched back-to-back for 4 hours of fast-paced entertainment. Or you can go watch a 90 minutes artfilm instead. The choice is yours.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Some good effects, no plot","Mummy Returns had a few good things going for it, but none of them have to do with plot or entertainment value.  The effects were okay for the most part, although the Scorpion King monster at the end was awful.  The second unit photography and many of the Egyptian vistas were beautiful, and the sets were pretty good ripoffs of those in the Indiana Jones movies.Out of all the actors, clearly Brendan Fraser was the worst.  He was boring, he had nothing to do, and he wasn't funny at all.  Oded Fehr was the best actor in the movie, along with the Rock.  Unfortunately the Rock is only in the first five minutes of the movie, and he has almost no lines of dialogue. His CGI appearance at the end, of course, was forgettable.This movie could have been much better -- right now it has a lot of boring, unoriginal moments.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Far too flashy.,"The plot:Ten years after killing off the evil priest Imhotep, the Rick O' Connor has married Evie and they have a son called Aleks that has a big interest with Egypt's history. They search for a bracelet once owned by a man known as the Scorpion King, that used an army that would enslave the world.Meanwhile a cult has found the body of Imhotep and have raised him from the dead to fight the Scorpion King so that the army the SK had would be under the control of Imhotep and can enslave the world. The O' Connors are left with fighting off Imhotep and a bunch of other various creations and enemies.The view:The plot sounds action packed, and it is. The action scenes are brilliantly put together and the entertainment is put in the film from start to finish. The problem is that the film relies on computers far to much to bring some action scenes to life and it comes to a point when the viewer can't take any more of it and the enjoyment stops there, and when the ending has come along the scenes have tired the viewer out making you want to hate some of the way it was made. ***",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Horrid script ruined a potentially fabulous film!,"As all sequels go, this wasn't as good as the first one. But it was still rather good. And had the potential to be *much* better! I *loved* the continuity from first to second. The continuing fragments of the story are wonderfully inserted here to add a strong feeling of connection between the first and second films. And the characterization continued to be wonderful (and thankfully, they didn't let the Rock act much;)But that said, there were many aspects that just plain ruined an otherwise clever story. The romance was just plain horrid. Not that it existed, rather the way it was handled. It just got sappy and cheezy with silly dialogue and ridiculous overtones. Not to mention we were hammered over the head with it. And I don't generally like brats in films like these (Temple of Doom perhaps being one of the few exceptions), and though this one was better than most (no incessant whining and screeching) he was still a bit out of place and was focussed on WAY too much. As well, John Hannah's antics were completely overdone this film...and Rachel Weisz wasn't clumsy enough.That side, the baddies were all amusingly well acted (great seeing Adewale in a role other than hardened criminal...oh...never mind;) I still think he's an amazing actor!) and I love the guy who plays Imhotep. But the pacing of the film (which started *really* well) got skewed about halfway through the film and the film started to suffer. Too many action scenes jammed into too short a period of time. They were all becoming generic (and rehashes of the first film), and how many cliffhanger 'He's going to die!! Quickly!! Grab him!!' scenes can one bear within a couple of hours??? The final John Hannah grab for the jewel had me rolling my eyes and begging for the bloody film to finish already! (and cartoon style action films are cartoon style action films, but it would be nice to see a good character in some actual pain and peril once in awhile or it simple becomes yawnable).Overall: I liked the film. I especially loved the continuity between films. And I look forward to The Scorpion King. But I hope that it's better scripted and lives up to its potential a bit more. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This movie is not bad.,"Even though I enjoyed this film, I felt that it didn't meet or top the original. Mainly, I feel that the film focuses too much on the action rather than the horror that the first one created. However, the action sequences were satisfying, from the bus sequence, to the final battle between the Medjai and the armies of Anubis. Even though Arnold Vosloo still maintains his portrayal of power, he loses some of that original power as the danger and importance of his role is replaced with the race against time to stop the Scorpion King from being awaken. Overall, although I enjoyed most of the performances, like Fraser and Weisz, I feel that while it's enjoyable and is re-watchable, for me, its only the action sequences that make this worth returning to, rather than the characters, horror and the few yet strong battle scenes from the first film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An enjoyable ride on the coat-tails of the first,"I didn't really know what to expect from The Mummy Returns. On one hand, it had the potential to be a work of art, taking what was built from the original movie and adding to it. On the other hand, it could be another tired rehash of the same film. In the end it was a bit of both.The film certainly looks very nice. The special effects (with the exception of the Scorpion King) are superb and really convey a sense of power. Imhotep and his effects are handled very nicely.There is very little, if any, character development in the film. That said, a lot of background information left out of the original is provided and some questions about the first film are answered. This is a lot of fun for those who like tie-ins to other films. However, a lot of the jokes used in the original are reused here (homage, or rehash?)The plot premise is believable and the scriptwriters did a good job of providing everyone with a reason to be in the film. Plot inconsistencies are rare. I've seen a lot worse lately (e.g. Red Planet).If you're an action fan, look no further. This film is non-stop. In fact, there's almost too much of it. We don't get the chance to stop and take a breather for much of the film. Unfortunately, that means that the journey is largely glossed over in favour of hacking and slaying (not that that's a bad thing).Overall I felt that it was a good film, provided that you've seen the original. Those seeing this alone will probably not get as much out of it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

woah!,"When i watch this at the cinema with some friends, almost all of them thought that the original mummy was much better.  To tell you the truth, i was not a big fan of the first mummy movie.  I thought the the ""mummy"" (the main bad guy) was rather weak and not scary at all, as he was supposed to be.In the mummy returns, the ""mummy"" was still just as weak but i thought he was more acceptable here since he had a human side to him now, he had a love relationship with the snake woman, which was somehow connected to Evelyn, the main female character, (there is some attempts at a story).  Also, he was vulnerable at the end which made him gave him more human qualities.As you can tell from my comments, i have no idea what most of the character's names are, character not greatly emphasized in the movie.  In fact, the most interesting character in this movie was the ""mummy"" himself. It was also better than the first installment since it had a nice intro explaining how the scorpion king came about to getting his powers.One part of the movie i have to congratulate them on (no matter how out of place it was) is the balloon scene at night, it looked really cosy with the stars in the background and kerosene lamps hanging around.  There were also many gripping scenes in the movie, many ""close encounters"", which were similar to the ""t-rex chasing car"" scene from jurassic park.  Sure, the plot was a little hard to follow (what plot?), but the fast paced action and CG kept me on the edge of my seat.  Also, has stephen sommers even seen indiana jones and the last crusade??  the guy at the end is not supposed to get the diamond, hes supposed to drop it or something cos its too heavy.  nb, i can tell it was fake from the back row.Overall, the movie could of had some nice character development with an interesting plot, and a FEW memorable suspense/action sequences... but full on action is fine too i guess.

Pretty good,"I just saw ""The Mummy Returns"" a few hours ago, and was pleasantly surprised with it. I actually consider it to be a little bit better than its predecessor. The graphics and creature effects were really good, with the exception of those used during the fight scene between Rick O'Connell and the Scorpion King. I particularly liked the funny pygmy monsters and the scary Anubis warriors. Freddie Boath was really good as the O'Connells' son Alex, and made me laugh in several scenes. Another character that I liked was Ardeth Bay, the mysterious nomad leader first seen in the original film (They should make a spinoff movie about him instead of one about the Scorpion King). I kind of liked the humorous hidden references that were made to the first film(Such as the scene in the first one when Jonathan has difficulty deciphering a certain hyroglyphic during a crucial moment). It was also pretty cool to finally see Evelyn really fighting in a few scenes.This movie was more exciting than the first one, and for the most part, more fun in general.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The elements of terror and a good capture of the period from the first film, are completely discarded here. Bigger and fun but does not have the charm as before","With one foot in the adventurous Spielberg of Indiana Jones, the megalomaniac Stephen Sommers skillfully and unashamedly brought together all the clichés that permeate the most basic of adventure films, whether in the usual conception of good vs. evil. badly, in the inevitable romance between two charismatic protagonists, in the uncompromising epic tone of a production set in exotic environments, and in the technical pomposity to fill and please the public's eyes. Being a bet that was more than right, ""The Mummy"" earned a few million for Universal's coffers, which would inevitably end up generating a following. The producer called Stephen Sommers again, who once again wrote and directed. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr, Patricia Velásquez would also return by reprising their characters.In London, inside a dark chamber of the British Museum, an old force of terror is about to be reborn. It is 1933, the year of Scorpio. It has been ten years since the brave Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Egyptologist Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) fought for their lives against Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), a 3,000-year-old enemy. Now Rick and Evelyn are married and live in London, along with their son, Alex (Freddie Boath), who is eight years old. Several events culminate in the discovery of the resurrected body of Imhotep, thanks to the help of the reincarnation of his beloved from ancient Egypt, Anck-Su-Naman (Patricia Velazquez), who killed and died for him. Thus, the mummy returns to roam the Earth, determined to carry out its search for immortality. However, another force is also at large in the world, the Scorpion King (Dwayne Johnson), who was born from the dark rituals of Egyptian mysticism and is even more powerful than Imhotep. When they face each other, the fate of Earth will be in danger and Rick and Evelyn will start a desperate race to save the world from an unspeakable evil and also to rescue Alex from the followers of Imhotep, who took the boy because he, without having a clue, he placed the bracelet of Anubis on his arm, an artifact of incredible power. On this journey they will go to Egypt and enter the Scorpion King's domain. A long time ago this terrible warrior promised his soul to the god Anubis in exchange for military sovereignty. He and his army were frozen in time, in a kind of interval between life and death, but now they are ready to kill again. The King Scorpion has more powers, secrets and strength than the fearsome Imhotep, is full of hatred and should not be disturbed.Sommers established himself as a nostalgic for classic adventure, which, in the midst of his generous production in special effects and grandiose scenarios, seeks to flirt with naivety and disengagement with great ambitions that allow him to flow and breathe organically while entertainment. Anyway, here is again the whole gathering of elements that made the original taste good, improved now by a more experienced director and a cast whose tuning has grown satisfactorily from one film to the next. Of course, Sommers who does not miss the chance to shamelessly reissue the most striking moments of the original production, such as the imposing sandstorm (here taken to the sea) or the climaxes - which involved reading the Book of the Dead, was 'recreated '- and the character who reads the spell, although different from the one who performed the task the first time, gets to be confused with the same symbol - which certainly denotes a certain lack of interest in innovating in the script, even though there are curious twists and turns.In ""The Mummy's Return"", Sommers makes this mistake again by creating an absurd story that serves as a mere excuse for him to portray his heroes facing, in exotic locations, digitally created villains. With this, the director manages to produce a film that entertains the audience for about two hours, but that is promptly forgotten when the lights go on. Films like Return of the Mummy always revolve around ancient curses, human sacrifices and legendary beings that are apparently indestructible. However, the first to recognize the clichés is the story's own hero, Rick, since he is the one who says the above sentence at various moments in the narrative - and this is the characteristic that redeems, at least in part, this production: by insisting on not taking himself seriously, the film ends up conquering the viewer through his humor, which tends to self-parody. Yes, parody: after all, how would you define the reaction of a certain character in this sequel, who, upon discovering what the villain's goals are, exclaims: Ah, the old trick of destroying the world '?
Much more form than content, this was a film that enriched the universe of its predecessor, but even more dumbed down a formula that, honestly, was never smart. The great asset of Return of the Mummy was to bring to the mainstream world in its first film role, still in a completely underdeveloped way, what would be, today, one of the biggest names in the world entertainment industry: Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. In charge of playing the Scorpion King, perhaps the greatest warrior Egypt has ever seen, for a few minutes of the film, the character's popularity ended up being so great that the producers thought it best to give him his first film, The Scorpion King.The lack of originality ends up being compensated, however, by the technical values of production. Sommers excels in the action scenes, intense and well-choreographed (there is a sensational duel between two characters), in addition to maintaining their ability to exhibit and explore the grandeur in art direction. Alan Silvestri replaces Jerry Goldsmith well in the composition of the soundtrack and maintains the scale of the production's grandeur. The production has numerous shots involving visual effects, which work in a few scenes, such as the chase of the mummies on a double-decker bus in the heart of 1930s London, but which, in general, aged extremely badly and arrive in several moments to be extremely shameful and regrettable, especially in a production of almost 100 million dollars, in which we can mention the emergence of a forest in the middle of the desert. This same forest being ""sucked"" into a pyramid, the escape of the airship from a water wall connecting its turbo, the extremely artificial look of the local pygmies and, mainly, the scenes that perhaps most people remember in this film, which is the regrettable and shameful CGI of the Scorpion King, amazingly, is one of the main characters in the plot. The most powerful warrior in ancient Egypt, here, seems to have come out of a video game whose lack of budget did not allow it to be finished. Not only the face, but the whole movement of the character takes away all the sense of danger and urgency from the climax of the film, causing laughter and greatly impairing the final experience of those who watch it.Even the elements of terror and a good capture of the period and its classicist features from the first film, are completely discarded here. Becoming just that big-scale action-adventure movie that, while fun, doesn't have the same charm as before. Sommers certainly wanted to adapt new blockbuster rules and please the general public, and he still does not do badly in directing the action that is well shaped and still has matinee elements. Even if you come to opt for generic elements of constant slow motion and quick cuts, with some vexamous visual fuss. ""The Mummy's Return"" is not a film that can be considered bad. He has good times, despite a substantial amount of poorly performed effects along with recycling and repetition of past plots, not to mention some rather stupid and even contradictory decisions to the first film. Arnold Vosloo's Imothep in the first film had the power to control the ten plagues that plagued Egypt, an even smart and cool balcony, and here out of nowhere he apparently has the power to levitate people by hand; climbing walls with your hands; create tsunamis with a gelatinous face of yours; anyway ... he became a perfect villain of the X-Men that the X-Men never had.The film, like the first one, has a good sense of rhythm and never fails to slow down in a way that is always direct to the point of the thread and surprisingly cohesive. And even with the countless new villainous characters and the presence of almost 5 different macguffins, nothing gets confused and everything is quite understandable. In the cast again we have the greatest virtues of production. Brendan Fraser, despite being more of the same, he has a lot of charisma in his Rick, and he nourishes a good chemistry with an always great Rachel Weisz who manages to be the only character to demonstrate a clear evolution from the silly historian character in danger from the first film to a woman who knows how to fight practically everything she sees ahead and her stimulus is in love for her family. And young Freddie Boath completes the family triangle that is certainly the efficient heart of the film. We have more of the same with John Hannah, the clumsy man who manages to function as comic relief as possible, and Oded Fehr with his Ardeth once again fulfilling the quota of the Arab franchise, but without any charisma.The film goes far from having any more essence to make here a perfect continuation of your great and charming first film. Overall, the film ends up working well, as the action sequences are really breathtaking - but when the story comes to an end, the viewer ends up discovering that his 'old friends' remain Indiana Jones, Luke Skywalker and John McClane, not Rick O'Connell or Ardeth Bay. And this is, after all, the big difference between Stephen Sommers and other storytellers: his characters are for immediate consumption, not for a long trip.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Okay, but not as good as the orginal.","Well, I just watched the Mummy Returns and really it was better than expected. First of all, The Rock (Dwanye Johnson) didn't do any of the wrestling faces, moves, or sayings which would cheez it up. Second, Brendon Fraser attemped to be funny, and the audience kinda got it, but not really. Third, the special effects were great, better than the orginal. (except for the Scorpion King in the final scene. BAD!) Finally, the story tying in the first movie, and kinda answering a few question.An amount of problems though. Next to the kid that played Alex, none of the actors were spectaculer. Second, the story was too unbelieveable, and didn't really make sense.

my notes,"The biggest garbage ever. completely lost the charm of the first movie. it's worse in every way. it seems like they tried using as much CGI as possible, when they definitely weren't ready to be doing all that. and it looks baddddddd. the first mummy came out 2 years earlier, and the CGI was outdated, but they didn't use is as much so they were able to mask it a lot better. and this movie tries to copy so many of the moments from the first movie, it reeks of desperation. so many dumb parts, i could barely finish. monkey mummies, smh. gg (about 2 viewings)",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Something different,"Saw the first ""Mummy"" and loved it. Even gave it 9 out of 10 points. Saw it three times. Bought the DVD. Went To Egypt. Started robbing Tombs...The Mummy Returns (M2) is different, a nice sequel if a slightly weaker. While ""The Mummy"" was an ""adventurers stumble across terrific ancient curse"" movie in the tradition of Indiana Jones ( and a good one at that !), ""The Mummy Returns"" is more of a ""free for all adventure extravanganza"". No real secrets or mysteries, little suspense or plot twists, huge amounts of supernatural ( read ILM ) fireworks.To be precise - while M1 built up the supernatural side of the story slowly and very deliberately over the first hour, increasing the sense of mystery and the audience's expectation to good effect, M2 hits the viewer full in the face within the first 10 minutes.  Soldier mummies on speed, undead warriors of Anubis, huge ILM-animated battles and deadly trap-riddled tombs abound - after this the pace only increases only a little and tries to keep the audience glued to their seats for the remaining 2 hours from the sensory overkill from the beginning of the story. Almost all the mystery and supernatural effects are introduced in the initial onslaught, and what remains is reserved for the final 30 minutes ( except for the ultra-cool ""Mygmies"", who get far too little time and exposure, IMHO ) which again is furious, breath taking and entirely ""over the top"". The ""time shift"" scenes, as well as the airship sequence do not offer anything great or original, but are nice eye-candy. The plot is not all that unique either. Still, its likable.The smart, poignant dialogues and character interactions which made ""The Mummy"" special, unfortunately are far rarer and less witty, and what remains of it requires a good working knowledge of ""The Mummy"" to really enjoy. Also, there is no real villain for the viewer to hate, dislike or fear like slimy ""Benny"" from the first part or the mummy Imhotep himself who never seems really terrifying or threatening throughout the movie and the ""Ultimate Evil"" Scorpion king remains a plot device straight out of the script (""look, the wicked archfiend !""), a major mistake in my book. Heroes need great villains to shine.As for the cast, the character development of the protagonists from ""The Mummy"" is notable and plausible (in my book), if not spectacular, the acting solid ( especially John Hannah ) with the single noteworthy exception of Patricia Velasquez. As for her, great looks do not great actors make.... sorry most of the statues and background scenery deliver a better mimic performance ! 'nuff said !Overall, its an enjoyable movie and I expect much weaker offings this summer, but ""The Mummy Returns"" would, on its own merits that is, not fly very far or successfully. One really need to have seen ""The Mummy"" to fully enjoy the second part.....7 out of 10 pyramids for this one",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Appalingly awful,"This is quite possibly the most cynically awful piece of exploitation film making I have every seen.  The alleged plot is a series of cliched vignettes stolen from other movies, there's no dialogue worth mentioning (except for some stolen lines), the acting is utterly perfunctory, and the effects are quite astonishingly shoddy.  I mean, they are embarassingly bad; think Army of Darkness without the cheesy charm.  The cinematography and score are barely competent, and that's the best thing I can say about it.It's a vile little quota film, aimed squarely at the lowest of the low brow audience.  They will doubtless chew their popcorn, slurp their sodas, kick the seats in front of them, and lap it up.  Shame on you.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Unpretentious fun.,The term roller-coaster ride is most befitting this movie. The storyline is intentionally thin and tongue-in-cheek. The cast seems to be having a lot of fun (just like last time).

No complaints here. Just grab your bucket of popcorn and sit back.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
As good as the first,"The unnecessary sequel to the 1999's ""The Mummy"" proves to be twice as campy, twice as dumb, and twice as CGI-heavy. It's the same formula, so if you enjoy the first, you'll likely enjoy the second. However, the movie gets rid of all attempts to scare the viewer, which was a bit disappointing. After all, the Mummy is at its core a monster movie, not an adventure. Oh, yeah, that CGI Rock is beyond hilarious.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining in Style but not Substance,"7 May 2001. While I enjoyed this sequel, I began watching the first Mummy and found myself more captivated. Perhaps, it was the actual action without the special effects and the use of more mystery and substance that made the first film more intriguing. The ending was a bit of a let down because the biggest weakness about the characterization of the evil Mummy's woman was that she was a weak flake, which really bums me out, because she really would have sacrificed her life to save her man too. So much for consistent characters being sacrificed for easy plot endings.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the better sequels,"I had such anticipation when this was coming out and while I didn't see it in theaters, the fact that they showed the armies of dog-men made me interested. It continues the saga of the O'Connells (from the first movie) and brings back many of the original cast members. My reasons for liking this movie are as follows:1) It has Oded Fehr, one of my favorite actors
2) It's about Egypt with action, adventure and humor
3) It's got Anubis, my favorite Egyptian godI admit that it's not as good as the first one, but this is one of the better sequels out there. It's no Empire Strikes Back or Dark Knight, and it's no Oscar contender either, but it carried its weight well. It's a popcorn movie. Just relax and enjoy it without thinking.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not very original!,"I'm always wary of films where I can pick holes early on, and I was right to be wary of this one.  I saw 'The Mummy' and enjoyed it, even though it was horribly inaccurate about Egypt (ancient and modern).  This film just took 'The Mummy' and did it over again.  Many of the special effects, although exciting, had been used in the first film.  It's as if the production team decided to use them over again to save money.  The dialogue was sometimes unintentionally funny, the acting was mediocre at best and there didn't seem to be an original idea in the whole film.

It didn't have the suspense of the first one, and I agree with all the people who said that there was just a bit too much CGI.  Although I give the writer a thumbs up for actually having this couple stay together from one film to the next, rather than have then split up between the two films and meet up again the the sequel, there was something about the romantic tension between the leads in the first film.

A breakneck ride into rudderless inanity.,"This ""film"" was really more of a scattershot exercise in pointless, mindless visual excess and absurd bombast. Rarely does it ordain to slow down and focus on character, motivation or theme. When such attempts are made, they are outright laughable. At times, early in this picture, the breakneck pace, absurdly wafer-thin awestruck dialogue and farcical bouts of violence, do amuse in an admittedly mindless way, but as the movie progresses, such hilarity (presumably unintentional for the most part) is harder and harder to find. It frankly descends into what is literally a barrage of pointless, scampering special effects-endowed images. The characters are scant, of course, with the actors probably better, but failing to truly rise above the material. The best that can be said about the child actor is that he is less inappropriate than the one in ""Enemy at the Gates"". Fraser, and certainly Weisz fail to truly characterize. Fraser is tolerable, and at times comically adept, but presumably is wasted in this film. John Hannah is relatively effective in the film's context, but the character is rather a tired stereotype. The least said about plot and script the better. Oh, and The Rock? A pointless appearance in keeping with the arbitrary ""qualities"" of the film. It is indeed no ""Citizen Kane"", and folks, it is yet another film that makes one wish more mainstream producers, studios and directors at least aimed for the vision and entertainment offered by the man Welles.

Not as good or as funny as the 1st,"A classic case of sequelitis.  Take those aspects of the last picture that everyone liked, multiply by 10, cut character development to make room and viola, instant sequel.I will admit to not liking Mummy the first time I saw it either.  I was expecting a horror film and instead got a cut-rate Indiana Jones adventure-comedy.  But after watching it again on DVD I developed an enjoyment of the film for what it was- a fun, light-hearted adventure romp with excellent special effects, witty humor, and engaging (if undeveloped) characters.  I even was looking forward to the sequel.Maybe it will take another viewing of this one as well, because on first viewing I found Mummy Returns to lack the fun of the first one. The humor is carried mostly by Rick & Evie's son Alex and Evie's brother Jonothan.  While they have some good lines, they don't measure up to Kevin J. O'Connor's Benny of the first film in terms of comic relief.The film is composed primarily of action scenes that simply lead into one another, many without much purpose other than to show off digital effects- Where did those pygmy mummies come from? and who controlled them?- and others simply a direct lift from the first film - Im-Ho-Tep blows a wall (this time of water instead of sand) at our airborne heroes, complete with his face which again ""eats"" the airship.The hand-to-hand fights were well staged as were nearly all the action sequences (although we have seen the double deck bus into a bridge gag before in a James Bond movie).  The only special effect I was disappointed with was the final Scorpion King.  Why was a digital version of the Rock's face used instead of his real head?Im-ho-tep himself is sadly under used, his place being taken by a couple of forgettable lackeys and the reincarnation of Anck-Su-Namun, along with the ever present threat of the return of the Scorpion King hanging over their heads.An entertaining, if somewhat jumbled & unfocused summer diversion, but don't expect too much.

Fight scenes are cartoonish!,"I loved the first one. So I was really looking forward to seeing The Mummy Returns. But as I sat watching it, I found myself feeling uncomfortable. The fight scenes are shown speeded up,slightly blurred and with in your face closeups. Kind of cartoonish. The sound is very loud and there were way too many special effects. No real story, just lots and lots of action. A bit like wrestling. My four year old loved it, which is probably somewhat the audience they were aiming for. I gave it a 6, I liked a lot of it.

"Sacrifices quality for quantity, but not bad","The plot of this sequel picks up where its predecessor left off, with most of the cast from the previous film intact.  The plot itself is pretty interesting and well done, which is fairly unusual for a big sequel like this.  Unfortunately, the film spends most of its time on overdone action sequences.  When I say overdone, I'm talking about the fact that there is tons of CGI and martial arts style fighting, and everyone knows that you sacrifice quality for quantity.  What we're left with is a bunch of endless scenes where no take is over 2 seconds long in order to disguise the poor quality CGI and fighting skills of the actors.  It gives you a headache after a while.  However, most of the CGI where they actually give you time to look at it is beautiful and quite creative (with the exception of the final action scene, which is pretty pitiful).

Great Sequel.,"Often I visit these pages for different movies and find it disheartening to see so many critics not being fair, they either say ""Pathetic, Terrible"" or ""Best Film Ever, A Must See""Well, I hope to give you a balanced understanding of the film as I saw it. The film overall is very good, the sequel follows pretty close to the original scene set out in the first movie and so fairs well with those who have seen the first whilst still maintaning enough material so that viewers who have not seen the first can enjoy the film.The Acting is not perfect but is still put accross well. I agree with some of the comments posted here, that the child does not fit with the characters and plotlines, there should have been some development with the main characters' relationship with each other before a family was introduced, especially if they are releasing a third!Sadly though the film falls into the tired stereotypical view of a sequel, where the writer has not spent enough time in developing the plot so that each event affects the relationship between all characters. As a result the characters appear flat and do not relate very well with the audience. However this is still no where near as bad as some of the sequels I have seen before, like the terrible regurgitation that Disney's ""Dinosaur""  is to Don Bleuth's  ""The Land Before Time""If there is one word to describe the plot in this movie, the word would be ""Linear""I will add a bit more though and talk about the SFX for a moment, generally the sfx were good but in the last scene when the Scorpion King appears I laughed at how terrible that effect was, it seemed to me that they wanted to finnish this scene as quickly and as cheaply as possible(Perhaps their budget ran out?) It was terribly unconvincing,  but that is not to say that it is easy to do - it takes a lot of skill and I always respect that no matter how unconvincing the effect.My vote for this film is 6/10 as it was enjoyable and entertaining but lacked the proper depth that is needed to make a good film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mummy Adventure,In some ways I like this better than the first Mummy...This actually feels more like a serious adventure film (well it doesn't quite pull it off) and less like a comedy BUT the CGI effects work proves terribly disappointing especially with regards to the Scorpion King at the end.

Missing Some Things,"After having The Mummy (1999) perform really well at the box office, Universal pictures decided that a sequel HAD to be made. So it was done, and this film plays nice and retains a lot of it's genuine feel but it seems like there are things that were sorely left out. In other words, things were given precedence over other things instead of the other way around. What seemed to get more attention was the aspect of special effects and the characters were left in the dust,...sand whatever. There are just too many scenes that contain so much CGI, that it's difficult for the viewer not to imagine seeing the actors onset with a blue screen surrounding them.All main characters from the first movie are back in this film. Plus there's an add on. Rick O'Connell and Evelyn conceive a child named Alex. And of course to make the screenplay fun they make Alex an energetic brat that loves to be just as adventurous as his mother and father. Nothing like family genes to keep the entertainment high in this franchise. Rachel Weisz looks even more attractive in this film and she's not as klutzy as she was before, which is good for an undead vanquishing mother. Her brother Jonathan still learns nothing in this film and its funny to see him try and do things right and ends up failing. Nothing changes with his character that's for sure.What's doesn't work is how the story involves so many ideas and concepts that it looks like this film could have maybe passed as the first film. Arnold Vosloo returns as Imhotep, the evil, life-absorbing mummy who cares for nothing except his girlfriend and himself. He didn't even care about his high priest that helped him get to where he had to go. Jerk! Adding to this though is a character called the Scorpion King played by Dwayne Johnson seems to take hold of the reigns in the finale of this film. Wasn't this film about Imhotep returning for his own needs? Well yes, but his focus is to gain control of the Scorpion King's army who is not yet destroyed, yada yada yada. So in a sense, no it's not really about him returning. Imhotep's in this film to create a race against the O'Connell family but he's not the important person the O'Connell's need to kill.The special effects of this film really starts to overwhelm its characters when the end of the film approaches. The action sequences are still cool to watch but to see giant armies of dog headed zombies, massive forests surround a pyramid, and the Scorpion King himself is just not convincing enough to be real. I think director Stephen Sommers took a chance with that. Although this film was a success, I think they could have held off on the majority of the CGI. It was almost like Universal was saying, ""Look how much stuff we can cram into this 24 inch screen"",...seriously, you don't have to overload a film with CGI to make it look good. Just look at the first one, it's a perfect example.The title of this film can be somewhat misleading due to the fact that Imhotep is in this film but is utilized only as another plot device. For the most part it keeps all the elements of the first movie the same, but sometimes CGI is all the audience looks at which doesn't make it anymore unrealistic than it already is.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too entertaining,"The top line might sound absurd, but thats exactly my problem with this movie.It is just too much mainstream. Plenty of good jokes, good action, very good effects, very good design of the sets, good actors and everything, its all there. But on the other hand, the movie nearly never lets you breath, jumping from one event to the next without any pause, the story never really surprises, the characters lack any characterization, its just fun and action, action and fun.Following the mainstream is not in general a bad idea, but in this case there is nothing but mainstream, and in this extreme form it is really boring.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good new direction,"The Mummy is just one of those movies that I enjoy more each time I see it. In 1999 I was expecting an action adventure film and instead was treated to a nicely paced horror movie with a new touch due to Stephen Sommers. In the sequel Sommers changed the direction from horror to what I was originally expecting. This change in genre was one of the smartest things Sommers could have done in giving us more of the same, but different. Much like the difference between Alien and Aliens. They are really two different films.One of the reasons I enjoyed the Mummy more each time is due to the enjoyable characters. For one reason or another I really wanted to know what happened to these people and getting to see them 10 years later was a big bonus. Most of the characters have more defined roles this time and its good to see some character growth in a sequel.The plot is thrown at us faster this time around with much more going on. But Stephen Sommers never cheats with the writing. Everything is mentioned once, twice, and then action! A familiarity with the first one is helpful since Sommers has the kid experience many of the same things his parents did last time creating some cross generation/movie jokes. Sommers also respects the conventions of the original Universal Mummy movies giving us an excellent climax that is above the usual action. Like the original Mummy this plot is one that has the ability to grow on you more with multiple viewings.The crew behind the scenes do an excellent job as they did before. Cinematography, Sound, and Art Direction all create an engrossing movie experience. Alan Silvestri picks up Jerry Goldsmith's score and continues its themes. Their are some FX quibbles from ILM but mostly just some weird background and the finale features a creature on par with 1997's Lost in Space that could stand some improvement. But they also have some great set pieces with the returning Warrior Mummies and an impressive ground battle that reminds one of the Phantom Menace's. Meanwhile Sommers has obviously been influenced by some of his competition in summer's past. Some of the fight scenes have some Gladiator and Matrix-esque touches to them that seem out of place in a movie like this. Sommers directorial style was so clean in the Mummy and his previous adventure Deep Rising that these flashes of slow-mo stand out very conspiciously. To his credit everything else is framed very well with some great introductions for our heroes.While it's true that the Mummy Returns isn't terribly original, it does derive from the best. The Mummy had a hard time getting out from Indiana Jones' shadow and the sequel seems to embrace this with many elements reminisicent of Indy's first sequel The Temple of Doom. Spielberg and Lucas influences abound as well as an image from James Cameron and a small Kubrick nod. (See if you can find the Dr. Strangelove homage.) But it's all in good fun as we are taken on this incredible adventure. If you enjoyed the first film you'll be very satisfied by the change in direction for this one. Its far enough from the original to give you a new experience but it never forgets the original. While their are deeper film experiences out there you'll be very happy if you're in the mood for a fun adventure. This is a cast and crew that loves what they're doing and it influences the audience in a very positive way. Bring the popcorn and enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"great special effects,highly entertaining","This movie had an uneven,highly improbable plot but it was great to watch, never a dull moment. The special effects were first class.

"So Unoriginal, It Borders On Kleptomania","`The Mummy Returns"" suffers from heavy-handed thievery.  It's probably a terrific movie if you've never seen any other movies before in your life, or if you've been living in a cave for the past twenty-five years, but if you don't meet the above criteria, then you're in for a bland, shameless rehash of a dozen other action movies that are better than `The Mummy Returns'. Combine this with a rather dull story and shoddy CGI effects, and you've got the first forgettable, must-miss blockbuster of 2001.Ten years after the events of `The Mummy' ended (`The Mummy', incidentally, was a fun, much superior film to this dreck), we find erstwhile adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Frasier) married to his tempestuous love Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), living in London and leading relatively normal lives.  (The fact that such characters could ever contemplate living normal lives is possibly the only original part of the film.) However, fate and a heavy-handed script conspire to bring the body of the Mummy Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) to the British Museum.  Once again, the Mummy Imhotep awakens, determined to live again and bring about the destruction of the world. Only Rick, Evelyn, and their 9-year old son Alex (Freddie Boath) can defeat the Mummy and save the world for impending doom.  Blah, blah, blah.`The Mummy Returns' is wall-to-wall action, but that's probably due to necessity, since the movie doesn't have anything to say.  Action can be fun in its own right, but great action usually at least has a semblance of a story as its backbone, and `The Mummy Returns' usually has nothing.  When it does have something to say, it's cribbed straight out of `Indiana Jones'. Or `Romancing the Stone'. Or occasionally, when it's feeling ambitious, it stretches back to steal from Errol Flynn classics such as `Captain Blood'. There's no new twists in `The Mummy Returns', nothing that hasn't already been seen in a hundred other actions movies before . . . and definitely nothing that hasn't already been seen in its infinitely better predecessor, `The Mummy'.  Yes, some of the fight scenes are spectacular  a flashback fight between Evelyn and the Egyptian princess Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velasquez) is particularly outstanding  and the action makes for some over-the-top fun; but after awhile, it's simply gratuitous, mildly exciting filler.  (And the CGI work is uneven  while it's probably fun for the programmers to dream this cutting-edge stuff up, it still looks jarringly fake.) It's fun, even dumb fun, but dumb fun has been done in other films, and in much better films than `The Mummy Returns'.Performances:  Brendan Frasier is pretty good, but his character Rick is more or less a mechanism for delivering quips and punchlines, nothing more. Rachel Weisz, whose character is much stronger than she was in the first `Mummy' film, is actually quite good  she blends the cliched damsel-in-distress role with a certain amount of feistiness and sarcasm that makes her very, very appealing.  Arnold Vosloo is wasted yet again as the Mummy  all the guy does is sneer and flex his muscles.  The Mummy's not scary, he's boring cardboard.`The Mummy Returns' isn't nearly as good as `The Mummy'.  Then again, it's not nearly good, period.  Possibly worth watching if in you're in a mood for idiotic fun, but even then, you can do much better than this needless waste of film.  Grade:  C-",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a let-down.,"What was the hype about? $68million opening? Why? Occasionally fun and it always looks nice, but the acting and script were dire. The special effects, especially the Scorpion King in the finale were terrible. I have seen more impressive rendering on the PS2. The saving grace was the huge battle in the desert, which did surprise me with its scale, otherwise I felt pretty cheated. Hardly any Mummy, no Scorpion King, lacklustre action and only moments of excitement and cleverness. If I were you I'd wait for it to be released on DVD and hope they include tons of extras. Otherwise stick with the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
lighten up!!!,"I have been reading the abysmal reviews this movie is getting with amazement.  Since when did swashbuckling fun have to be high art?  I am convinced that Stephen Somers did something evil in a past life to deserve such a poor reception.  The original received a similar critical response which is what kept me from it.  Then when I viewed it recentley, I wondered if I had seen the same movie these critics had thrashed.  Luckily the public didn't buy it, and it doesn't look like they're scared away this time.  I thought for the moviegoer that might be a bit scared, I would like do address some of the critics complaints1. The plot is too convoluted: This is not a particularly hard plot to follow, though it has many twists.  while it is not a masterful work of logic that keeps you guessing, it gives the movie many venues for it's great action sequences.  The back story of the Mummy is actually quite sad and touching, and if you are willing to just let it wash over you and not over-analyze, then you will find it quite enjoyable.2. It rips off from nearly every movie ever made: This has a bit more merit, but still is misunderstood.  The movie makes many homages to adventure movies including Braveheart, The Lost World, Gladiator, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and all of the Indiana Jones movies.  The large battle sequences echo Braveheart when two charging armies collide in a crunching of steel, wood, and flesh.  But come on Mel, what did you expect?  That shot is waaaay too cool to be in just one movie.  The Crouching Tiger references are the new pet Falcon of Oded Fehr's character, and the multi-weapon girlfights between Rachel Weisz and Patricia Velasquez.  These are subtle at best. There is one scene which almost criminally rips off the tall grass raptor scene in the Lost World.  however it improves upon it.  Unlike the lost world, there are two opposing groups walking through the tall grass with the hidden nasties in it, trying to find each other, one character is trying to find another that has been taken captive, two adversaries are sword deuling, and two snipers are trying to help their friends.... you get the idea.  it improves upon the scene by adding elements and handling it well.3. it is mindless: it is not.  it is actually quite intelligent as is the original.  it takes time to poke fun at itself.  it never loses the sense that the audience KNOWS that none of this could happen and is able to appeal to that sense.4. Brendan Fraser is not an action hero - I couldn't disagree more.  Action hero's don't have to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone to be believable.  Fraser channels a mix between two of the best action heroes around; Harrison Ford and Bruce Willis.  He has Ford's sense of dignity and believable heroism mixed with Willis's dry sense of humor.  Also I guarantee you that Brendan Fraser is in much better physical shape than either of the two ever were.so there it is.  It's a great popcorn popper, and no matter what the critics say, I can almost guarantee you will leave the theatre with a smile on your face.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Thumbs Up!,"I greatly anticipated this movie, having been a fan of the first Mummy.  I do recommend you see the first movie before you see this one.  Some of the jokes relate to the first one.  This movie, in my opinion doesn't top the The Mummy, but sequels rarely do.  It does give a good try and if you liked the first one, you will probably like this one as well.  You will love Rick O'Connell, the boy has some witty lines, and Evie is more than just a woman screaming ""Rick!! every two seconds.

I think a bunch of college freshmen made this movie!!!,"This was quite possibly one of the worst movies I have have ever seen.  In all truthfulness, the script was like something to come out of a high school junior's pen.  The graphics were horrible.  I have seen better animation in video games and the Scorpion King animation reminded me of something out of the old Sinbad movies.  No knock on Sinbad but this movie has every advantage and squandered them.  It was obviously an attempt by a big movie studio to make a quick buck before the looming writers' strike (which, thankfully, didn't happen).  The only redeeming quality of this movie was the sound.  It was second to none but sound alone cannot make a movie.  I loved the first movie in the series but this one was a total bomb.  Bad show and the people who made it should be ashamed of themselves.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awful crap!,"First of all: I really liked ""The Mummy"", so I was looking forward to the sequel, but when I saw it I was disappointed. Ok, there are some cool special effects and action sequences, but most of them are boring and you know how they gonna end. Worst of all, the story takes place 10 years after and the protagonists have a little kid. Do you always need lil' kids or dogs to do a sequel? Like e.g. in ""Blues Brothers 2000""? I've seen much better action movies this year.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
as expected...,"the movie was as i'd expected. as usual sequals often depend less on storyline and more on things like action, humor and special effects. not that a storyline is always very important (i think it's often overrated very much), but the mystiqe of the first movie simply wasn't there anymore. the two most irritating things in the movie were probably the ""return"" of the scorpion king as a scorpion (i'd rather like to see him as a man) and most of all the fact that imhotep's girlfriend abandoned him at the end. but then again, here i'm almost making the same big mistake as most filmcritics do: checking storyline. who cares in a movie like this? o.k. the story isn't all that, and there are quite some mistakes, unlike the first movie, but sowhat? it is a great fun movie to watch and THAT'S what it's all about! period!.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
could easily be the worst movie i have ever seen,"The fact that the story line and the characters couldn't be any worse is acceptable.  Its the MUMMY RETURNS, you don't expect else.  i don't understand people don't dare to admit that the special effects in this movie were simply bad.  it was technical, no doubt, but can't get more artificial and fake as here (the scene with the Scorpion Monster is horrible!).  That's what you get when the story is made in function of the FX and  not the other way around, like it should be. The action pieces are all boring and are all done much better in other movies (Indiana Jones for example).  From the point where a character is introduced you can already tell what's probably going to happen, if he/she will survive etc...  What about Imhotep?  In the first movie they told us he was master over the sands and later we could witness he created a sand storm.  in this one he simply created a water storm/wall?  what's that all about?  When the heroes were so called trapped in the narrow paths with their ship, the only thing they had to do to escape was simply fly higher!  If you're going to see this movie, make sure your friends pay for this rubbish.  It's not only the worst movie of the year, it could easily be the worst movie of my life...and i have seen LOTS of them!!!",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bad And Weak Film,I am not sure at all if I understand what the crew were thinking or trying to do when they were creating this sequel film. This sequel film did not make any sense at all and did not have any direction at all. The storyline of this film was too basic and poor and simple and straightforward and weak. The cast selection was alright enough. They did not exactly fully commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. There was not any sign of real chemistry displayed throughout this entire sequel film between the cast members. This sequel film was a real disappointment to watch.,1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Definitely worth the ticket price!,"Go see this movie.I don't think you understood me.  Go see this movie NOW!While the first movie was, to put it nicely, less than stellar, the second incarnation more than adequately makes up for the failures incurred by its predecessor.  The much-hyped appearance of The Rock (Dwayne Johnson to those who don't recognize him from the WWF) does not exactly dominate the movie as one would expect, but when his character, the Scorpion King, does lend a nice presence to the film.  As this is his silver screen debut, I was expecting sub-par acting, only to find he actually did the job quite nicely. Brendan Fraser reprises his starring role, supported by Rachel Weisz, Oded Fehr, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, who were all in the first movie.  More of the movie is dedicated to the underlying story from ""The Mummy,"" which helps to somewhat improve the first movie in a post mortem kind of way. The special effects are greatly enhanced from the original, but there are also some completely new effects that lend the movie a great supernatural flair. All in all, this movie is, well, stellar.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Flat out awful, and time has not been kind.","This movie was a huge hit when it opened in 2001, and that can be basically be attributed to marketing, the huge CGI presence (back when CGI was still kind of new and fun), and the big screen debut of The Rock. But when I caught this on cable again the other night, I was asking myself all over again how such a loud, annoying, pointless mess could have sold so many tickets? Interesting that the third Mummy movie has taken more than seven years to get off the ground, I think perhaps the studio (or maybe even the filmmakers) knew that audiences would need years to forget how bad the first two in the series were before plunking their money down again. I'm ALMOST glad I caught this on TV, because I will definitely remember how bad these films are next summer and NOT be seeing Mummy 3, no matter how much marketing they hit us with.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

More inane fun,"What can you say? A return to the well with many of the same characters brings mixed results. Fraser and Weisz, now married with child, get caught up in a plot to conquer the world (what else?) involving their old friend Imotep and a new baddie, the Scorpion King, played by cult fave The Rock. If you look at it as a cartoon strip it's easier to take - while much of the dialogue and almost all of the plot are beyond mindless, the special effects and main characters are almost uniformly appealing. Weisz handles her expanded action role very nicely while doing repeated battle with a stunning Velazquez, who also gets a lot more air time. A reserved thumbs-up.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ugh.,"Since I was a fan of the original, ""The Mummy,""  I made the mistake of expecting the same witty (and oftentimes silly) action story. I should have known better.I don't know who the film-makers are aiming for with this film... it certainly does not seem to be the fans of the original, but rather, their children and to those who came to see the film because they love The Rock. It was to ""The Mummy"" what ""Phantom Menace"" was to the original Star Wars trilogy, a film seemingly made to appeal to young children and to sell action figures. There was _just_ enough clever banter thrown in, as well as some really great fight sequences, to make this acceptable to older viewers, in my opinion. The introduction of yet another smart-aleck 8 year old kid does nothing for me. A child in the story is fine, but this one was just a little over the top. The kids seem to love him, though, even though I imagine that some of the same children laughing at his antics could hardly have sat through and stomached the original movie with its much more adult humor.While some of the original characters are retained, only the personalities of the shifty brother, Jonathan, and the solemn tattooed warrior (I forget the name) are left intact. While I can see that the intention was to show that Rick O'Connell had grown in character to become more responsible as a husband and now as a father, it left him rather dry and boring as compared to the dashing Indiana Jones type which he had been. Quite a change, indeed, and it left me mourning for his previous flair. He was rather convincing as a concerned father and husband though. Evie also underwent a major change, going from a somewhat shy and awkward but entirely convincing bookish young woman with an honest appreciation and enthusiasm for Egyptian history to a scantily clad (is that tight, deep cleavage cut top and heavy black eyeliner _really_ what she wears as her excavation gear?) and completely confident woman. While confidence is nice, and shows the strength of a woman, I did not understand the depth of this change from her former sweet and appealing self... I suppose it is meant to appeal to men. I dunno. Or mayhap it was her ""mysterious dreams"" which instituted the change. She was not very convincing as a mother, either, it seemed. If my husband and I had been through what they had in ""The Mummy,"" I would never leave my curious and foolish young son alone in a tomb whilst I went exploring deeper to find an ancient artifact of great power which I had been dreaming about.... I would know that bad things could arise from such a situation.Imhotep returns in a much less frightening role, at times seeming to be just confused and lost in the story. It seems like he was just included so they could say that the mummy ""returned."" I would much rather have seen the O'Connells battle the Scorpion King rather than have the story muddled by a not very frightening (but handsome) Imhotep. He really didn't add much to the story, and toward the end I was actually liking him as much as I did the main characters, just because he seemed more human and somewhat bumbling. His mistress, once reincarnated, is interesting as a character and pulls off her role well.I was hoping that even if the story was not good, the action and special effects would still make the movie worth watching. True for the fights... they really were awesome and intense. But the special effects? Sigh. Nope! If anything, they pulled it down. The backdrops were fuzzy and too pale (they actually made my eyes hurt), the creatures looked as if they had a few more computer-imaging steps to go through, and the Scorpion King was just plain fake looking. Scary, though. I think that the battle scenes betwixt the army o' Annubis and the Magi were well done, but closeups of the jackal warriors left something lacking. Very smooth and battle-droidy, if you know what I mean. The airship was just silly, silly, silly. Why an airship? Why, oh why? It looked like something off of some made-for-TV adventure movie, and just made me want to giggle.Aside from the effects and characters, the story itself was disjointed and weak. Too many coincidences, too many subplots that amounted to very little, and horribly strained dialog and chase scenes that smacked of being forced. Take out the suddenly rather lame Imhotep, take out the whole reincarnation and ""chosen one"" deal, take out the whole ludicrous airship sequence, and take out most of the pygmy mummies... and perhaps that would have made it worth watching. As it was, I was ready to be done with it not even halfway through the film, and caught myself thinking about other things... my garden, whether or not to go to Wal-Mart after the movie, and so on. Not minding when you need to get up to go to the restroom is not a good sign.I think that the return of the Scorpion King and his legions of minions with their world domination plan would have sufficed for a good story without throwing in all of the riff-raff about Imhotep and past lives. It was simply rambling and long, much like my comments here! This film really semed like it wasn't finished, that there was still some MAJOR editing left to do, and of course the CGI needed to be actually completed rather than seemingly just thrown together for a test run. And the blaring, clanging music was driving me insane with its insistence.... WATCH THE ACTION! BE EXCITED! BE SAD NOW! BE SCARED! BE HAPPY! When the music tries to drive me along like that with its volume and clamor.... argh!!! I am not a fool and can deduce at which times I am supposed to feel a certain emotion without being led along by the hand by overpowering instrumentals.I am very disappointed, and I can honestly say that even if I HADN'T liked or even seen the first movie, I still would not have enjoyed this one.I gave it 5 stars out of 10.

"One of the year' worst movies, another mindless special effects extravaganza. * (out of four)","THE MUMMY RETURNS / (2001) * (out of four)By Blake French:I can tell you exactly what happened with ""The Mummy Returns."" The filmmakers of ""The Mummy"" were in stitches of the huge success of the first film and quickly had the original actors sign for a sequel. They got the green light based on the box-office grossing of the first film, and probably started shooting before the first draft of the script was complete. The results of this shallow, mind-numbing array of visual effects are ridiculous, frenetic, and spontaneous-one of the year's worst films. It proves when a movie is made with the intentions of grossing a lot of money, it does not provide audiences with much more than visual stimulation.""The Mummy"" was one of the biggest box office hits in 1999, but even that was no cinematic masterpiece. Considering the rule of thumb that the original film is always better than its sequel, my expectations for ""The Mummy Returns"" were not especially high. I expected the same kind of movie, where the plot is simply a clothesline for lots and lots of special effects and high-tech action sequences. I was right on the money, but I never expected the movie to be this horrible.The plot in the original mummy' was kind of interesting-but in ""The Mummy Returns,"" the filmmaker's do not really supply us with a plot-but with a string of incidences that setup for yet another pestering sequel. ""The Mummy Returns"" opens with professional wrestler The Rock playing the Scorpion King, a warrior who trades his soul to a god in exchange for military victory, but becomes frozen in time. Most of the original film's actors reprise their roles; Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and John Hannah as protagonists and Arnold Vosloo as the antagonist. Director and writer Stephen Sommers also returns, with a script created for the sole purpose of making a sequel.I will not waste my time with a detailed plot synopsis. The film is much too incompetent for such an explanation. Besides, does the story really matter? If you chose to see this film, it will not be because of a thought-provoking story, or even an interest in the actors, but because it is a big-budget, special effects extravaganza. Many people will see this film-my guess is that they will walk away loving the action and visual effects, but once out of the theater this movie may never account in their minds again. It is forgettable, disposable, recycled junk-and you do not even have to think. Before you see this movie, park your brain outside the theater, you will not be needing it.What about the action sequences and special effects? Even that aspect of ""The Mummy Returns"" fails miserably. The action scenes are predictable, superficial, and relentless. Action scenes relieve suspense. In this film, they occupy the tension-free plot. The film never builds for any suspense or momentum. This would not be a major problem if ""The Mummy Returns"" had other redeeming factors-but the whole thing is one extended action sequence. The insignificant exhilaration never stops to take a breath. Watching this movie is just like watching ""The Mummy"" again, but this time we expect every occurrence and see every turn coming from a mile away. The ""Indiana Jones"" similarities become even more obvious. The film also introduces several new horror creatures, including a Scorpion monster so badly created that many audience members laughed at its sheer presence.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie was a waste of time.,"All I can say is that this movie totally and completely SUCKED!  I did, however, enjoy the special effects and a few of the one-liners; on the whole this movie was a complete waste of time and money.  Among the things that I disliked, the reincarnation business, the predictability, the rocket power dirigible, the overly cutesy kid, and the hype surrounding the Rock (the guy was in 5 minutes of the movie and never actually said anything).  When you add it all together you get a ridiculous premise and a lot of eye candy equally a dismal film.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Step-Mummy: more bark than bite,"Set 10 years after the first film, this Mummy finds our Hero Rick (Brendan Fraser) and our Heroine Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) back to their old adventuring, excavating ways. And with them as always is Evelyn's brother Jonathan (John Hanna), who acts as the film's Comic Relief. But there's a newcomer: the 8-year-old son of Rick and Evelyn, Alex (Freddie Boath). The gang's brought back into more hair-raising experiences when a dig unearths a rather cool-looking chest that contains a sacred bracelet. Naturally, once the family gets back home to London, the first thing the little imp Alex wants to do is open it. And put the bracelet on.Turns out that whoever wears the bracelet is shown a series of famous pyramids, and only by going to each one in succession can he or she know what the next destination is. What's the point, you ask? Well, at the end of this whole thing our old buddy Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) is gonna defeat the Scorpion King (Dwayne Johnson) and take the king's army and conquer the world. I know, it sounds like Steven Somers (who wrote and directed) has been reading too many comic books. But this is the kind of movie that you don't examine too closely, at least not the plot.  The point is simply that there's an adventure afoot, and it's up to Our Hero to save the day.Rick, Evelyn, Jonathan, and Alex, joined by Ardeth Bay, the protectorate from the first film, encounter a series of mind-boggling special effects, all wonderfully done on someone's computer. Hey, don't get me wrong, they look real neat, like that giant waterfall and those freaky pygmy skeletons. The problem is that they're all stolen from other movies! The waterfall is a simple ripoff of the last Mummy movie, and the skeletons look a lot like the little demons in Gremlins.One fatal mistake the movie makes is in introducing the typical Annoying Little Kid. This is what singlehandedly sunk another wonderful movie, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1989) had a then-very-young Sarah Polley, and this one has the aforementioned Freddie Boath. Both actors speak with a thick Cockney accent and both have a tendency to get into mischief. But you know that all credibility is tossed kicking and screaming out the window when, in the very first scene, Rick and Evelyn bring little Alex to a spooky temple in their search for this chest, and wouldn't ya know it, they leave HIM out by the entrance. ""Stay here,"" they tell him. What kind of a parent brings their kid to a place like that? Ok, ok, I know it's a movie, but there was simply no reason to have this kid in the movie. He may be a good actor, but the character was unnecessary, unwieldy, and unlikeable. He was also a bit like young Anakin Skywalker from Star Wars, only not as cool. Now Alex had a few good lines and generally acquitted himself nicely, but he was more of a liability than an asset. If anyone should have played the role of buffoon and put the bracelet on (thus incurring all sorts of supernatural wrath), it should have been Jonathan, who was a wonderful surprise from the first. But alas, as is sometimes the case with casting people, they fall in love with cute little kids. Bah!Don't make the mistake I made and overexamine the movie. I saw some really dumb things, but most of them are inconsequential. There's one I'd like to point out, however: Rick, Jonathan, Ardeth, and Alex are running from the front of the outside of their house around to the side, where their car is. They RUN around the corner, and then the next shot shows them slowing down to a slow walk. Why? So they can discuss what's happened, what they're going to do, and so forth. Never mind that Evelyn's been kidnapped. Never mind that they were all frantic not 1 second ago, and suddenly when they go around the corner, they have time to chat? Sheesh! Such stupidity! Such bad editing!This very poor man's Indiana Jones isn't terribly inventive, even in its special effects, but it still is roundly entertaining. You could do far worse for two and a half hours.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Non-Stop Action with the Ancient,After all the hoopla surrounding The Mummy Returns I had to go and see it. The original Mummy was a pleasant surprise and the sequel looked promising. I must say that I was entertained throughout the movie but there were some problems with it as well. I was not impressed with the matte paintings used for the backdrops as they were obvious and not well done. The special effects as well lacked quality and at times I could not believe this motion picture was a result of 21st Century movie making. All in all I think Universal rushed to get this picture made and it seems cut corners to get it out to theatres. Even with these problems I enjoyed the film. Some of the script was rather corny but again I think it is expected. I also did not really like the actor cast as the son. All in all though it was an entertaining film and at times the scenery was breath taking. The movie contains all sorts of action and thrill sequences. Approach the film with an open mind and prepare to expect an entertaining two hours of Mummy mayhem.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't waste your money; wait for the video game,"I found the first ""Mummy"" film to be rather a guilty pleasure. We were introduced to some fun and interesting characters, there was some snappy dialogue, and the effects were kind of nifty. It wasn't a great film, by a long stretch, and it certainly didn't give Brendan Fraser an opportunity to flash his considerable acting chops, but it was good summer fun.How disappointing to discover the sequel to be no pleasure at all, guilty or otherwise. The characters were cardboard cut-outs -- writer/director Sommers doesn't even bother to reintroduce us to any of them, much less develop them in any way at all, as if he didn't expect us to care about them; the dialogue makes ""wooden"" seem like an accolade; and the effects were so obviously computer-generated that they just looked cheesy. The point, I would think, of CGI is that the eye is fooled into believing that there is a desert plain filled with warriors, not into recognizing that there are about 100 actors in the foreground, and a teeming mass of pixels behind them.Worse, the money saved on box-top visuals wasn't spent on screenwriters or editors. The scenes are jump-cut out of all comprehension, and the dialogue seems to serve only for something to put on the soundtrack to break the stretches of John Williams-knockoffs. The director doesn't bother to pace the action, to build up from valleys into heights, most likely because he fears that slowing down at all would tip off the audience that there is no there there. Rarely does the viewer find any cause or effect between the characters' words and actions. When the hero's son is captured, the mother briefly grieves and the father sets his jaw, but one senses they do this because that's what parents are supposed to do, not because they are feeling the potential loss of their only childUntil I saw The Mummy Returns, I believed the worst film I had ever seen was George Clooney's zombie-state-inducing ""Batman and Robin."" I thought I would never see its like in terms of plot-deprivation, dialogic inanity, and gratuitous special effects. Congratulations, Stephen Sommers: not only did you make Mr. Freeze look like high art, you managed to make a movie less exciting than the video game that grew out of it.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Good start... Bad finish,"I have to say that I really like the first installment of The Mummy. It was so good that it, along with future sequals, could have easily taken up ranks of a new classic with the Indiana Jones series. So knowing this, I was very excited to see this movie. All the way into the theater I was excited by what would happen, and even through a good part of the film I was really liking it. It wasn't as good as the first, but what movie ever is? And I was even willing to accept the WRESTLER (not ACTOR) The Rock in the movie. Note: I am not one for accepting wrestlers in movies, sure they are both entertainment, but one all around sucks (wrestling) and one doesn't (movies). As I have noted to friends before, A wrestler in a movie is equal to a dog and a monkey having a baby. It isn't a good thing even from the start. But then it happened: The team of adventurers went and got into a big (extra fake and cheesy) hot air balloon. Yes that's right kids, they opt out on any logical means of travel for their time period and they get a (extra fake and cheesy) hot air balloon. Ever after I watched the film and only hoped it couldn't get any more unbelieveable. And yet it did! Yes thats right kids, it got worse. The Scorpion King shares his wrath with the audience, not that he is in any way scary it is just that he is so stinking cruddy (Badly computer animated, and even worse as a major bad guy!) Is what I am getting at is that it wasn't the wrestler that made it bad in the end (not that it helped), it was the overly done special effects. The difference between this movie, and the GREAT and AWESOME original is that the original was enhanced by special effects, the face in the sand, the plagues on the cities, even the  computer animated mummies were an addition, and an enhancement, to the already good story and acting. On the contrary in this movie, rather than going with the good characters that were already developed and just adding another plot like Indiana Jones, someone changed the entire theme of the movie from the original and made it special effects. And that doesn't constitute a sequal at all.If you liked The Mummy, don't see The Mummy Returns, it will just spoil the first film, and leave a bad (I just got ripped off 8 bucks) taste in your mouth!",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A second look: THE MUMMY RETURNS,"My Take: A ripping old-fashioned adventure with excessive special effects galore, but a lot of fun.Sequels have always been a part in Hollywood entertainment, most especially summer blockbusters. What we have here is a sequel, once again, to a surprise blockbuster hit. The film was THE MUMMY, which became one of the biggest hits in 1999. With more than a million bucks for another movie, writer/director Stephen Sommers is back for THE MUMMY RETURNS, with bigger plans, bigger budget and, of course, bigger special effects.THE MUMMY RETURNS has the usual trappings for a summer movie. Big special effects mainly. This one has more special effects than the first film. We get to see more than just mummies coming to life, or sand taking form of the large gaping face of a monster. This time, director (Sommers) brings out everything his imagination has brought up. The story seemed to be more than a decoration, rather than the special effects, which suddenly turn up as one of the films main target. It has special-effects over story and intelligence, but what do you expect from a summer action movie (a sequel, no less). I enjoyed THE MUMMY RETURNS, like all summer flicks, for what they are.Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are back as Rick and Evy, who's out to defend the earth, once again, from the mummy Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) who is resurrected to fulfill a prophecy, to slay the legendary Scorpion King (played briefly by The Rock), and gain control of the Army of Anubis and gain full immortality.The film has overtones of a horror story, but really is a big, bustling action movie. Obviously inspired by the INDIANA JONES series, like the first film, this film boasts a lot of daredevil action stunts, some totally unbelievable. A large suspension of disbelief is required, but the action sequences, as are the special effects, are so wildly exciting and silly (embracing the slight absurdity of a n old B-movie serial) that they are simply destined to please the eyes, and that's what they do, in spades.Best of all, it's that great new summer action movie, yet it embraces elements from the past. Like the first movie, it ain't art, but it's a well-written strictly old-fashioned adventure, providing chills, action and a lot of laughs. Sommers and his crew truly understood what the original such a hit. It wasn't a brilliant piece of movie-making, and neither was it a realistic lesson in archeology. It was big-time fun. Though it needed the most skillful special effects money can buy, THE MUMMY RETURNS proves that the good old times of action adventures are not extinct. In a time when very few of these kind of movies are being made, it's nice to see one done right. (and if you ask me, that's everything a long-time fan of INDIANA JONES, like me, could ever ask for). I think THE MUMMY RETURNS is just as good as the original.Sure it's a purely silly action-adventure of B-movie quality. Sure it aspires to be mocked. But that's just it, no matter how silly and overblown this movie is, it never forgets to laugh at itself and just have fun with it.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Even the special effects could not disguise the weak plot,"Even though I did not care for the first Mummy, I was suckered in by the trailer and the big box office opening.  My expectations were low, but I still was surprisingly disappointed.  Every line was predictable and nothing could hide the fact that the script took about a week to write.  The plot was thin at best and the action sequences (barring the pygmie scene) were not enough to mask it.  Skip this and rent Raiders of the lost ark.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the few times I enjoyed the sequel just as much as the original.,"If there is one thing that a sequel is always able to promise (in Hollywood at least), is more action and a more complex plot.  I won't go into what it's about since if you're reading the comments then you must already have some idea as to the plot.  To sum up the point of the story, there isn't really one.  This movie was meant to reunite an excellent cast and to have fun.  You can tell this from many of the parallels between the original and the 2nd.  So, if you go into this movie with about the same amount of seriousness as the first, then you will have fun.  As for the SFX, it is also about the same.  Not meant to be completely realistic bordering on comic book style.  The majority of it fit the style of the movie perfectly which is good, since if the SFX were any more realistic, then it would force you to look at the movie more seriously than you should. The exception to this was that the Scorpion King was a little less impressive than what he could have or should have been.In terms of fun, it deserves a 9.  In terms of SFX, it deserves a 7.5.  So I gave it an 8, though I may change and give it a 9.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Entertaining, but very, very messy.","If you're thrilled by amusing one liners and nonstop special effects of all kinds of weird creatures, then you're sure to enjoy this second Mummy picture. If not, you will probably turn it off after a few minutes. The first Mummy picture was quite good, in that it managed to fit in characters and plot amongst the big budget special effects. The first picture showed that Universal movie monsters could easily be remade into big budget, special effect extravaganzas, and still be good. Everything I liked about the first movie (minus the characters) was overdone to the extreme here, and about halfway through or earlier, I found myself loathing this picture. The overall feeling though was not one of hatred...this is just an overplotted mess, with moderate entertainment value throughout.Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is back, nine years after the first movie (I thought it was two, but whatever), and he and Evelyn (Racchel Weisz) are married and have an 8 year old kid, Alex (Freddie Boath). Imhotep's (Arnold Vosloo) mummy has been brought back to life, and he wants the bracelet of immortality, which is now in the hands of Rick and company. The bracelet controls the Scorpion King's (played in a pointless cameo by the Rock) army, which consists of easy to defeat dogs who with one hit turn to sand. Chaos ensues throughout.If you aren't paying attention in this movie, or you miss the first ten minutes, you will be extremely confused. Heck, you could be paying attention the whole movie and still be confused. So much is going on, and so many special effects and new plot lines are shoved in your face way too often. Special effects on the mummies and creatures are pretty cool, but the bigger effects are just a huge headache, and they look very artificial. The plot is virtually nonexistent. I guess there are several plot lines, but in between them are many sidetracked scenes, and by the end, this just feels like a bunch of random scenes shoved together.This movie is full of cutesy moments. I'm unsure as to why a mummy movie needs any cutesy moments, but since this is meant for families, writer and director Stephen Sommers made this both violent and cutesy and comedic, so it never fully works as anything (though it does work much better as an action movie than anything else). Jonathan (John Hannah) provides many of the movies cringe worthy lines. He's one of those characters that is scared to death from anything and everything, and still quips out the bad jokes. Brendan Fraser does the same, but he has a charm he brings to the character, and is one of the few positives of the movie. The kid Alex was a good addition, and for some reason, he felt more mature and developed than most other parts of the movie.Overall, this is a pretty bad movie. It's full of effects that add up to nothing, and characters that do the same. There is some entertainment to be found, but you may find after you finish this, you'll be in desperate need for something intelligent.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 125 mins. PG-13 for violence.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Love it to death!,"The sequel to the granddaddy of all adventure films is truly mind-blowing, action packed, excellent, and a must-buy. It is ten times better than the original and that was the bomb. So if that was the bomb what would you call this? A WARHEAD packed with enough nuclear atoms to blow you out of your seat and all the way to Hollywood. The acting is even better than it's predecessor and it surely does contain more humor than the last along with better enemies. Stephen Sommers knew how to make one of the best sequels ever by including what the first film didn't have: Cooler and stronger enemies, more character development, better story, more adventure-themed style, and a great cast that has Brendan Fraser, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, and the beautiful Rachael Weisz. The new addition to the family is Rick's and Evelyn's son, Alex O'Connell (played by Freddie Boath). He is what every other boy wants to be. He is smart and witty, fearless, his personality is like any other boys but something about him makes people have a liking to him. The biggest surprise is the SCORPION KING played by Dwayne ""Rock"" Johnson but he is all animated and looks fake and he sure does make one of the best enemies in film history. This film is fun and original while it also maintains knowledge for the young ones.After selling his soul to Anubis, Mathayus, a young warrior commands Anubis's whole fleet of soldiers and wrecks chaos. Thousands of years later, an artifact known as the Bracelet Of Anubis is discovered by the O'Connell's but what they don't know is that High Priest Imhotep has risen from the dead once again and is after the bracelet for it holds great power. The only problem that stops him from getting the Bracelet is Alex O'Connell, son of Rick, has attached the bracelet to his wrist and the only way to take it off is.... (a long story). If the Scorpion King is defeated, Priest Imhotep will be the new owner of Anubis's fleet and with that power he will make the world bow down to him. The O'Connell's and their friend Ardeth Bay have to fight once again through mummies, soldiers, weird stick creatures, in order to save their son and most importantly, save the world.The action is tremendous and non-stop as the O'Connell's leave a trail of mummies behind them. The enemies play an important part in the film and it is really cool when they are being blown up to smithereens. The best enemies are probably the running mummies and the army of Anubis. People are complaining that the special effects are trash, and they maybe are, but that not the point of the movie. The effects are good but the story is even better. Who needs special effects when they have an excellent story? Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weisz, John Hannah, Oded Fehr, have good acting talents because they were made to play their roles. A few old enemies will make appearances in this film, like Imhotep, Anck-Su-Namun, and who could forget the lovely black beetles. The third film in the series is cr*p and should be avoided and you should instead watch Mummy Returns instead. (Spoiler!!!)The best scenes in the whole movie are the hot-air balloon being chased by water and the stick- men fight. Hilarious! Haters probably like complaining with everything and their comments should be discarded. If you guys haven't watched this, you must be living on mars because good movies hardly come out and the mummy is one of the good ones.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Jon Monsarrat review:  Painfully sub-intellectual,"This film is similar to Jurassic Park II, in that the computer graphics make the movie. A campy film that doesn't take itself too seriously is OK in my book, but this one is too campy by far.As in the first film, the plot makes no sense, the acting leaves one with no feeling of tension. The additional of a cute kid is not helping, as it did not for ""Blue Brothers 2000"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"".If you're an action movie lover like me, you will be tempted to try this film.

Bad beyond believe,"""The Mummy"" was nice and fun to watch, with the stress on ""fun"" in that the movie didn't take itself seriously at all, and had tendencies of being an action parody. I expected ""The Mummy"" to be a dumb action flick, and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't one. Now, knowing its prequel, I expected ""The Mummy Returns"" to be about as entertainingly funny. Well, I couldn't have been disappointed more. ""The Mummy Returns"" is just dumb. I mean, really dumb. Non-original, non-funny, non-entertainingly dumb. No traces left of the ""action parody"" approach, no traces worth mentioning of a plot, badly written and directed, really bad and most of all noticable CGI at times (while -strangely enough- being rather good at other times). It even fails on a design level in that the ancient egyptian look is totally unrealistic and over-the-top, all in all appearing rather un-egyptian (""The Mummy"" was halfway decent in this regard). ""The Mummy Returns"" tries to be a fully-fledged action flick, but even fails at that. The fighting sequences are lame and badly paced, the effects are silly and misplaced and barely state-of-the-art, even the sound design is awful as it often relies on known audio library effects that one knows just too well. ""The Mummy"" had a proper and fairly convincing feel in terms of showing 1920s people messing with ancient egyptian ghosts. Watching ""The Mummy Returns"" feels wrong throughout its entire length, it appears like 21st century people putting on a bad provincial stageplay or carnival show without really knowing what they're doing or how to do it. If movies are compositions, this one is incredibly badly composed. Don't waste your time or money unless you're expecting nothing, especially not a proper sequel.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Full marks for Dwayne Johnson,"What can be more interesting in a fantasy when 'The Rock' enters. He is one of the most powerful actors who adds much more to the story.

Unnecessary,"There was absolutely no need for this movie since it is pretty much a worse version of the first mummy movie.

One Monster of a sequel.,"This is not Citizen Kane Folks, It the Mummy. If you have ever seen the original, you will know exactly what you are getting yourself into with the sequel. A sequel in my opinion that is much better than the first film because it keeps you on the edge of your seat from the beginning to the end. The acting is very top notch, and the Special Effects are just breathtaking to watch. Brendan Fraser is Great, and so is Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah but the Real achievement in this film Is Rachel Weisz who literally steals the movie from every body with her performance. The fight scene with her and Patricia Velasquez is a sight to behold. If you want to  ponder the fate of movie making, and it's short comings, don't see this movie.

"Strangely Absent in Plot, a Largely Non Stop Action Demo with No Soul","Even with my eyes wide awake, it's difficult to recall or care about 'The Mummy Returns'.As a sequel, it fails to carry forth any sense of intrigue or meaningfulness to the characters, and they feel stuck in the same place throughout. Their acting chops are just as good, but they don't seem like characters immersed into a story, for the plot gives them nothing emotional to work with.The action senses are wild and childish; its descends into slapstick silliness that would be fitting for kids if it wasn't for the nonsensical and directionless adult script.The rendering of the undead and their motions in the first half are great, but nothing else truly stands out, and the final act is completely appallingly and pathetic.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One half of the BEST movie ever made!!,"What is wrong with people? And underrated director like Stephen Sommers comes up with an idea that completely overshadows the works of the VERY overrated Mr. Spielburg(!), and all a bunch of mindless morons want to do is put it down for no reason! The Mummy and The Mummy Returns are so equally great, I count them as one long awesome spectacular!! Take the handsome, talented, fun, and funny Brendan Fraser, give him a wonderful action hero to play, and you have a character that puts Harrison Ford's hard boiled, ""takes himself too seriously"" Indiana Jones to complete shame! Combine Mr Fraser with the beautiful and very talented Rachel Wiez, and you have an unbeatable team in more ways than just one. I could go on and on about the rest of this awesome cast, but their movies(raking in over 400 million each!) speak for themselves! The sad thing is, we only got to see these rare treats (the actors) come together twice. Thats Hollywood politics for you. Thanks to Mr. Spielburg and Mr. Lucas being put up on high horses they don't deserve to be on, next summer we get to put up with an aging Harrison Ford putting on a hat and giving us another bad Humphrey Bogart impersonation.

Nobody got older except the audience....,"Huh.... Sheer stupidity in a movie rankles me.... so the demise of both the kid and Brandon's grasping brother(Jonathan)would have improved the film....Too bad that there was not more of the Scorpion King(The Rock)in... especially in the closing scenes it seemed fairly obvious that computer generation ruled the roost....Imhotep's return was just that, but his date(Velasquez) was more evil....Same old, same old tricks by Imhotep, though somehow not as scary this time...The lovely Rachel Weisz is lovely and fits the role... Brendan Fraser could've slept through this... I saw no stretch for him from the first movie to this one, except excessive and inappropriate 'snogging', especially on the bus...I'm surprised Brendan Fraser's character wasn't a little more in control of his son, but I guess the makers decided they needed some sort of plot line, so they put a child in the line of danger to give some direction to the film..... Uuuuuurggggh!!!!! Am I the only one that found the boy's actions/interfering/meddling irritable? and Jonathan's continual self-enrichment program so unnecessary? I could only hope that Mummy 3 (if it gets made)can kill off the kid and his brother.... maybe they can use that as a story line with revenge for the deaths as the driving plot-line?.....Definitely NOT as good as the first Mummy film, .... by a long shot!

Stephen Sommers gets the billing, but was he there? Did he see what was being filmed? I think there was a story...somewhere in there. I think there were actors... or they may have been robots programmed to recite lines- that's about as convincing as they appeared. The chemistry between Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz was about as believable as a Barry Bonds press conference. They're relationship was soooo contrived and forced- it was actually painful (really, I was in pain). I'm not a casting director, but when you're casting offspring shouldn't he/she resemble one or both of the parents? (re: Jonathan Carnahan) Imhotep and Acnk Su Namun sounded like they learned the Egytian Language from a free pamphlet at Cairo International Airport. These are just a few things that a director should notice and remedy before innocent people pay good money to watch.I could go on and on and on... but this movie is fatally flawed in so many ways.I think they should've replaced all the star billing with a listing of the special effects crew.

Completely unbelievable and I enjoyed EVERY minute of it...,"I wasn't disappointed after having seen The Mummy.  Everybody was yahooing in their seats... which I think was the intention of the film... It had a great sense of humour, but then, Brendon Fraser always carries it off well.It's the kind of film you would enjoy seeing again and again.  Mindless rubbish it may be but we all need a break from reality now and again.  The sets, the costumes, the heroes and antiheroes were all larger than life and literally filled the entire cinema from the big screen.  Brendon was your classical 'sensitive on the inside, I adore my wife, rough round the edges slightly intellectual' hero... basically an oversized little adventurous boy in love... and the people loved him for it.  But, didn't we also sympathise with the mummy in the end also?...  Terrific twist... we didn't expect to show any positive emotions for that nasty number and the Scorpion King whose megalomanias made them hell bent on conquering everything and everyone... I loved the fact that we had 2 villains determined to turn each other to dust before having to deal with our 'cowboy', Rick.  But the real villain was the woman of the Mummy's veeeery long life... Rick's wife showed us one of the positive sides of a woman whereas the other one showed us what absolute bi...... women can be... {I'm a woman and what I said is God's honest truth}.

But why can't you stop it! or a good continuation of your favorite adventure,"Adventure. Continuation of the film ""The Mummy"" of 1999, and no less beloved by me than the first, because I grew up on it (well, not literally, of course). I remember that if I was sick, then without hesitation I took the remote control from the VCR, took out the cassette with the first and second parts - and enjoyed my favorite adventure for the hundredth time, because both parts occupied me for four hours. And here's my brief opinion - Why can't you stop it! And, despite my love for this painting, I will consider both the pros and cons of this adventure. Then I ask you to brew some tea, cover yourself with a blanket and enjoy.
So the pros:
1. Scenario - the picture is a direct continuation of the first part, and takes place ten years later. The young couple O'Connell had a son, Alex, who became his parents. Everything is as usual - tombs, treasures, ancient secrets. And again, some citizens dug up the unfortunate mummy, which means that the O'Connell couple, like the whole world, have big, no, huge problems. Again chases, fights, shootings, only the geography has expanded a little. Stephen Sommers (screenwriter and director of the first part) had to get out, because the box office was clearly hinting at the continuation of the banquet, and the producers were pressing, so Stephen, using all his resourcefulness, wrote a good script (if you do not go into some of the details below). He was able to survive as much as possible from history, and for that I can praise him. He could make it much worse. Personally, as a child, I enjoyed the story every time, and now the same thing happened.
2. Fights, chases, shootings - there are much more of them, but the quality of the production remains at its best. Dynamics, spectacle, exciting moments, emotions for the characters - everything is there, and not in small quantities. Even the scale was brought (though not without the help of graphics). For a little kid, what I was - the very thing, and even now all this disgrace looks great.
3. Humor - I can't say that all the jokes turned out to be successful, but most worked. After all, there is twice as much humor here, as well as characters who have only one task - to joke, and sometimes be useful. Some of the jokes caused me a real storm of delight.
4. Music - Alan Silvestri himself was invited to write it - a professional in his field, and he really did his best. And the pathos was able to highlight, and humor, and spectacular moments, and even hook the viewer with a drama, the mystery, the atmosphere - it's all about this musical accompaniment, which can be listened to separately from the picture itself.
So the cons:
1. Self-repetitions - I already wrote that Sommers got out of it, and as a result we have self-repetitions of the first part, albeit slightly modified. Frankly, some of them were beaten and it turned out well, but the other one - maybe I won't squeal like an old grandfather in the style of ""it was better before""! Just be ready for it.
2. Bloopers, nonsense, nonsense - there is much more of this here than in the first part, although they try to hide it, throwing fights, chases and shootings at the viewer. I've seen it all many times, but only now it dawned on me how much outright stupidity there was. This is the only reason why I put the final grade below, because I simply cannot ignore them, forgive me.
A little about the main characters:
1. Rick O'Connell performed by Brendan Fraser is a former adventurer and a hero without fear or reproach became a father now, which means that if you touch his son, then you will not expect mercy. Here he again shows himself from the best side. Brendan returned to his usual role - and coped with it perfectly. Bravo!
2. Evelyn (Eevee) Carnahan-O ""Connell performed by Rachel Weisz - from the first shots we are no longer the classic"" lady in trouble "", as it was in the first part - but a mother and a strong woman, ready to do anything to protect her baby. Rachel is charming and sweet here, just like before, but she looks a little tough and fights great. Bravo Rachel! Kisses!
3. Alex O ""Connell performed by Freddie Boat is the son of Rick and Evelyn, who, in addition to a hefty set of knowledge, also possesses inventiveness, resourcefulness and a rather good sense of humor, and Freddie in his years coped with the role of the naughty offspring of adventurers quite well.
Once again, John Hannah joked perfectly in the role of Jonathan and Oded Fehr in the role of Ardeth Bey, and Arnold Vosloo in the role of the restless Imhotep.
Even with an increased budget (almost one hundred million cabbage leaves), the picture not only paid off, but also brought the studio almost half a billion, and again decided to shoot a sequel, expelling Sommers, and releasing it, and in other matters I will tell you the next time I give a speech about the bad ending of this adventure series.
As a result, we have a good sequel to the action adventure movie with Brendan Fraser, a good script (not without blunders and nonsense), with excellent music, and with great acting.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Disappointing ending, annoying brat","Fairly enjoyable film, with good set pieces.Enjoyed the film at cinema, it is only when you watch it at home that some details start to annoy you.The computer graphics of the mummy and his guards were superb as usual, but the ending of the film was let down completely by the seriously ropey looking scorpion king at the end of the movie (didn't look anything like the Rock). What I have to ask is was the budget for cg spent on making the mummies look good, and they ran out of cash to polish the Scorpion King!The MOST annoying thing about the whole movie though was the inclusion of the boy. Within two minutes of him on screen I was rooting for the bad guys when they were going to get rid of him!I rated The Mummy as 10/10, and The Mummy Returns 8/10.

I wonder how the actors went, they must have got sick of cavorting in front of blue screens and dodging monsters who wouldnt appear until post production.

I was actually BORED!!!!,"I loved the last Mummy film, I thought it had an edge on many other Special effects films today by still having a style reminiscent of older films. Much of the action and atmosphere were similar to Indiana Jones, and it was well scripted and acted.But this sequel lost most of the best stuff, what a pile of tripe!First and very importantly is the fact that the special effects are either the same design as the first film (or even stolen from other films....Velociraptors in the tall grass!!) or.....oooh the shame with such a large budget.....unbelievably poor!! It at times looked more like those really old movies where they just stuck a screen behind the actors that showed lots of scenery, I'm talking big thick black matte lines here!!Also, admittedly I have a thing against children in films (most of them just can't act they simply imitate what they see older actors doing and therefore don't come across natural or like the children they portray), but here the kid always looks like he wants to start laughing.  All he does is come out with all the wise cracks that would normally be given to Fraser's character, and so they are totally out of place and not as funny.The Rock is hardly in it, the acting is mediocre at best, it drags on too much, like too many films it has inferior Matrix style fight sequences in (why oh why does every action film see a need to have martial arts that looks unrealistic and is too fast to look stylish because its just blurry images on the screen?), steals ideas and lines form other films in a way that doesn't do them justice to be a compliment.It was just a big disappointment, there were hardly any laughs or screams in the full cinema theatre and everyone walked out as fast as possible.I have only seen two worse films at the cinema, Street Fighter the Movie and Maybe Baby and both were really bad!!!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Special effects were good; the plot was not,"If you like to see state-of-the-art 21st-century special effects injected into a farcical plot with poorly written dialogue, then The Mummy Returns might be just the movie for you.  The special effects saved this movie from a disaster worse than the one the characters in the film face.  As in the first installment of The Mummy back in 1999, The Mummy Returns packs a punch with a lot of exciting special effects.  However, that is where the similarity ends.  Whereas The Mummy had some semblance of a plot, the plot of The Mummy Returns is used like a clothesline to display the special effects.  The entire concept is far-fetched: ""We didn't learn our lesson last time when we unleashed the most dangerous mummy of all-time.  Why don't we unleash one that is even more dangerous that we conveniently forgot to mention in the first movie?""  In addition, we see characters appearing, going places, and doing things that have no logical explanation for them. As bad as the plot was, it looked like Shakespeare compared to the dialogue, which appears to have been written by a 7-year old watching Saturday morning cartoons.   A sample: ""I really hate mummies.""  Wow, what insight into the character's mind!  This movie would make excellent fodder for a future Mystery Science Theater 3000 show. Here's my recommendation: if you want to see a lot of amazing special effects with little else, go see The Mummy Returns.  If you want to laugh at a completely incomprehensible plot and crude dialogue, go see The Mummy Returns.  This movie is a 3 at best.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"With so much going on, I still got bored...","I really liked The Mummy when it came out.  It reminded me (and everybody else it seems) as an Indiana Jones film.  It was fun and focused, so it was inevitable that a sequel would be put into production.  No big deal, the first one was good, second one should be as well, right? Wrong.Writer/director Stephen Sommers packs this film with so much action that I actually got bored with watching it.  He never spends enough time on anything for the viewer to focus on.  One explosion, a few semi-funny one-liners, and on to the next scene.  Arnold Vosloo as The Mummy is back, but unfortunately, this isn't his movie.  Yes, he's in most of it, but I don't actually remember much of him beyond the canyon wave (essentially the sand face from the first film, only with water).  This film belongs to the Scorpion King, which brings me to him...As far as The Rock as the Scorpion King go, what's the big deal?  For the few minutes he's in it (and I emphasize few minutes), he's either snarling and fighting, or he's snarling and running, or he's snarling as a very badly computer generated scorpion.  I'm wondering if Sommers just ran out of money, or perhaps energy when it came to completing the film, because the effects in the last 15 minutes are really horrible.There are good parts though.  The canine warriors are spectacular, and the little tiny mummy creatures are campy, but hilarious.  Plot?  Forgetaboutit. There is not plot to speak of.  Actually, to be honest, I can't even remember what the plot was to have supposed to involve beyond another little thing-a-ma-jig that would bring the Scorpion King back from the dead, and the reincarnated Anck Su Namun still trying to reunite herself with good 'ole Imhotep. Oh, and Brenden Fraser and Rachel Weisz are now married with a kid (the Action Movie Guide Book says it's better to involve children in those perilous situations for more suspense).Now, come to find out, Universal is in production on a movie based solely on the Scorpion King.  I certainly hope that they find a plot, invest more in some special effects, and let The Rock get his snarl back in practice, because I'm sure the critics are already practicing theirs.My grade: C-",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A big effects movie, with poor effects","The Mummy Returns, what a load of rubbish. For a start, the cast, could they not have ditched the hugely annoying, massively wooden Brendan Fraser, has he ever acted well, or delivered a decent line, I think not. The woman was OK and the Kid, yuk, It sickens me. However apart from the awful script and the hideous acting, there is the effects. Admittedly, some of the effects on the main baddy character are quite nice, and the pyramids are ok, but when a film is billed as a effects movie, you expect some nice effects. The waterfall effects were awful, it looked like a 2 frame bitmap image! The army fight scenes, some of the scorpian arm were simply pasted on to the top of the battle scene so it looks like they were on top of the other people. The so called river Nile outside the pyramid, it was two totally separate scrolling images running past each other with no attempt at intergrating them, and and..... the list goes on, and don't get me started on the bloody hot air balloon....",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A summer sequel spectacle that exceeds the original!,"Brendan Fraser is the only thing wrong with this movie.  He still hasn't learned to act, but someone at least learned how to handle him.  Give him short and simple lines and let the action support him.  Fraser would do well to emulate another top box office non-actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger and learn to make light of himself.  Think True Lies.  Has Arnold ever been better?Everything else is fantastic.  This film is infinitely better than The Mummy.  There is more story, more drama, more action, more special effects, more of everything.This time out, evil Archaeologists stage a battle between Imhotep (Vosloo) and the Scorpion King (The Rock) to gain control over the armies of Annubis. Along the way, we get deeper into the story of Anck-su-Namun and Imhotep. A new story line develops that ties Fraser and his new wife, Evie (Rachel Weisz), closer to the ill-fated couple than they could have imagined.  John Hannah, who returns as Evie's hapless brother, and Freddie Boath as her and Fraser's son, add comic relief galore.  Arnold Vosloo is once again fabulous, and I'd love to see him get more good roles.  Patricia Velazquez returns as the other half of the star-crossed lovers, Anck-su-Namun.The movie succeeds at tying the two stories together, and using the first film to raise the stakes.  The much touted Scorpion King role is a bit of a letdown, but the spinoff is already being filmed, without, unfortunately the majority of this cast.  I always thought that The Mummy might have been as good as the Indiana Jones films if Fraser could act.  This movie deals with that problem, and earns its place as a peer with the Indiana Jones trilogy in movie history.  It does everything well.  Even the credits are the best I've ever seen, and the ending song is tasty.A summer sequel spectacle that exceeds the original!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Man..why are people so unkind,"I love commenting on shows that generate such diversity of opinions. There are many people who seemed to love the Mummy Returns and an equal if not more hated it! To me I think those who hated it (i.e gave it 1 or 2 out of 10) often fail to see what the show was really intended for and go down to the technicalities of it all..That is was the script good, were the special effects serviceable, were the characters well presented. All of these areas are important but they pale into insignificance when all the show is there for is to entertain.Now lets face it...this would not and did not win Oscars at the year of its release so if you want an Oscar worthy movie watch Gladiator or Titanic. But if you want a movie where you can check your brain at the door and enjoy a rollicking good old fashioned action adventure yarn then this is it.The Mummy Returns can be summed up in two words....Bigger, Better. Everything is on a grander scale compared with the first one. More action, bigger threat and a larger scope. For Hollywood sequels that's what they do in action sequels...look at Xmen 2, Empire Strikes Back, Spiderman etc.The action is non-stop and has some great skin of your teeth type moments which are similar to George Lucas and Steven Spielberg movies based on the 1930's republic serials. The characters have changed notably Rachel Weisz's character but remember this is set 9 years after the original so this is believable. The son also is believable to a certain point as he would be influenced by his parents and the relationship he shares with his father is very touching.Imhotep has definitely been humanised and he turns out to be the sympathetic bad guy. The bad guys are all good except the Rock. he is very one-dimensional in this but then he didn't get much screen time.Overall I thought the movie was good. Look at what it is for what it is...just a goofy action movie that was purely made to entertain and try not to read into it too much.Just enjoy!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Inaccurate Egyptology: ""Evil"" god Anubis?!?!?","As an amateur Egyptian mythologist and Isiac reconstructionist, I have a couple of problems with this movie and it's predecessor, ""The Mummy."" Both were recently played back-to-back on the SciFi channel, so I got a chance to refresh my vague memory of them from several years ago. I watched ""The Mummy,"" and basically enjoyed it as an utter yarn, with one or two nit-picks (Seti I murdered by his high priest? Huh?). The thing that stuck in my craw the most was the bit about the vicious, flesh-eating scarabs. Scarabs are DUNG BEETLES! They eat dung, never live prey. Ever! They may occasionally feast on decayed vegetation and possibly even the rotted flesh of corpses, but they generally prefer the dung of livestock and are, themselves, a favorite snack of Egyptian bats. It was a minor issue and the FX were cool, so I let it slide ... sort of.I was far less forgiving with ""The Mummy Returns,"" which I turned off in disgust after about the first five minutes. The reason? Its portrayal of Anubis as a snarling, ""evil"" and ""dark god"" (I'm quoting words from the movie itself) was offensive and inaccurate, if not outright sacrilege. According to Egyptian mythology, the jackal- or dog-headed god, Anubis, was not and IS not evil, even though his alleged father, Set, might be characterized as such.For those who don't know: Anubis is the Egyptian god of the dead and dying, who protects and ushers the recently deceased into the afterlife, most commonly referred to as the Underworld (not to be confused with Hell, mind you). He is at once ruler, guard and judge of who is fit and deserving to enter the utopian Underworld by a test known as the Weighing of the Heart. (Sort of the Egyptian equivalent of St. Peter.) He was spared from death as an infant by the goddess Isis and remains Her loyal companion and protector (much like the faithful family dog). He is said to have taught the art of mummification and funerary rites to the Egyptians priests. He is also viewed by some as the patron god of lost souls and orphans. Dark? Perhaps, inasmuch as death may be considered dark. But, evil? Absolutely not. And I have come across no tales of Anubis ever having had an ""evil army"" as the ""The Mummy Returns"" portrays being led by the Scorpion King. This notion is so ridiculous it's almost funny. Almost.Either the consultants on this movie did not do their research, or they've watched the original ""The Omen,"" with the skeletons of demonic Damien's jackal-headed parents being unearthed in the Egyptian desert (and the obvious allusion to Anubis), far too many times.In any case, I was turned off by either the sloppy ignorance or the intentional maligning of Egyptian divinity. As others have stated here, there are even errors in the continuity in the timeline and ""historical"" references between the two films themselves, which might shed some light on the reasons for the mistakes in Egyptian mythology.I really wish Hollywood would get its act together when making action, horror or drama movies featuring pagan gods. I tend to get a little testy about how easily the label ""evil"" is applied in such cases. And for every ""DaVinci Code"" and ""Last Temptation of Christ,"" there are about a dozen other films that have served to spread fallacious and pernicious ideas about paganism. And yet, the last I checked, no Christians have had to go into hiding because of a vapid movie twisting the Catholic rite of Communion into a carnal act of cannibalism. And I can't help but be critical when mainstream movies such as this one, mold deities from other cultures into sinister action figures for an audience that may not realize that what they're seeing is a complete lie.Blessings of Isis,Lady P",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I'm glad your back!,"After seeing the first Mummy I was sure this time around there would be nothing new or original like most sequels.

Though the 'story' is nothing original, the action, characters, and special effects are SO GOOD that I could care less about the plot. YEAH!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
None of the original's charm,"I am at a loss as to why this movie is doing so well.  I haven't been this upset at public taste since Titanic *shudder*.  I loved The Mummy.  It had lots of charm and cheesy appeal.  To me it was Army of Darkness (a personal favorite) with a bigger budget.  The sequel is pathetic.  If it weren't for the humor (which is the only spectacular element in the film), I'd have rated it as a 3.  The CGI effects looked no better than those in the the original.  In the time between the films, computer animation has grown by leaps and bounds, but it's impossible to tell from The Mummy Returns. These improvements can be seen in the differences between Toy Story and its sequel.  I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when I saw the animated version of the Rock as a scorpion.  It brought new meaning to the word ""suck"".  AND THAT'S JUST THE EFFECTS!  The plot was nonexistent, the characters were cardboard, and the action sequences (the only things keeping the film going) were contrived.  I strongly suggest you rent this movie and save a few bucks.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Quite good for a sequel.,"Let's face it, all sequels suck.  They are only a small few that really cut it as good follow ups, and The Mummy Returns is One of them.

THIS FORMULA HAS DRIED UP LIKE AN ANCIENT MUMMY,"Very long, cumbersome, pondersome and sleep inducing sequel to Brendan Fraser's entertaining ""THE MUMMY."" The film simply went into too much simplistic detail, and the occasional homily. The worst part about this movie was the utter lack of suspense. Any indication of genuine starts or shocks were well telegraphed in advance, again hurting the overall efforts of the picture to entertain. Stick with the original, or the early 1930's Karloff version. Not recommended.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Mummy Returns: Empty Headed,"This is a prime example of Hollywood drivel.  All glitz and glitter without much plot or dialogue or acting or things that one would consider substantive in a film.  The scenes with real people were far and few between the computer generated portions of the film.  In fact, nearly the entire film was made on a computer.  Some are pretty good, but most are over the top and one is rendered numb by the end.  The best scene is the one with two HUMAN females fighting.  And it's because they are human, not CG.  This is not a quality film and best left to the 13-year old kids that love this stuff.  A three out of ten.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I want this two hours of my life back!!!! Boooo,"When you go into the theater, I guess you're supposed to be entertained and feel good by the time you leave. You're supposed to be whisked off to faraway places with clever characters and get lost in that feeling...and enjoy it. Ah, The Mummy Returns...Sure, you're whisked away to foreign lands with wonderful scenery. Sure, there's action and adventure. But can it pass off as entertainment? In my opinion, anyone with an intelligence level that surpasses the 6th grade should be disappointed. And if you aren't: shame on you. This film seems to have been made by drooling mongoloids and only is intended to be enjoyed by the same.Honestly, if this movie would have followed the premise and the story of The Scorpion King, I believe this could have been a decent film. The only things that the element of The Scorpion King does is: Get another big name into the film to make it look good while marketing it and to clutter up the story (if there really ever was one!).Look here folks, we all know the purpose of this film was made to make money. That's the bottom line. Am I wrong in expecting maybe something DECENT in return for paying for admission. You can take ANY part of the dialogue in the entire movie (and even the plot itself) and imagine this movie being written by a couple of 8 year old kids playing in the sandbox with some X-men and G.I. Joe figures. Its just THAT mindless.If you want a film in a similar vein that is of better quality, check out The 13th Warrior. But, if you're determined to see this movie, the only redeeming points you should find are The Rock's reported Eight Million dollar performance (for 5 minutes in the movie) and the stunning Rachel Weisz. I honestly believe she was the only thing that kept me watching. For those two factors, I am giving it a generous 3 out of 10. BEWARE, YOU WERE WARNED!!!",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Extremely Disappointing,"THE MUMMY was a surprise hit in 1999. It at all of the elements of the great INDIANA JONES films with a lot of originality. Plus the characters were all likable and the dialogue was extremely witty. Now, we are presented with THE MUMMY RETURNS, a highly disappointing sequel that is loud, noisy and impersonal. The movie opens with background information on The Scorpion King. This is handled well and this movie could have been just about him. Then, without ever getting a title credit, we move to Egypt of 1933. We already see our heroes stumbling upon relics that relate to The Scorpion King. They find an artifact and take it with them, but unknowingly start a trap. Needless to say, they escape back to London with their son, who places the artifact on his wrist and has 7 days to find The Scorpion Kings lair before he dies. This is an interesting movie itself, but no, we forgot about The Mummy. Well, an Anck-Su-Namun look-a-like and others try to resurrect The Mummy so that he can kill The Scorpion King and be ""more powerful."" Confused? I sure was.The plot to THE MUMMY RETURNS is simply a mess. It has too much going on and doesn't stop to let you relate and enjoy the characters. They give you just enough plot to put action sequences around them. The dialogue, while clever at times, is delivered horribly to even attempt to be witty or interesting. Sure, they are saying something but we really don't care, because if it isn't a Mummy soldier chasing them, it is little pigmy skeletons pulling everyone down under the grass similar to the raptor scene in JURASSIC PARK II. The things that made the first one so good (fun characters, good acting) are abandoned for non-stop and numbing action sequences. And on top of that, the movie isn't scary at all. At least the first film had its tense moments. And when the story tries to be tender and serious, you can't help but think, ""It'll be OK.""The special effects are also a problem. It seems as if the filmmakers want to show the effects to you so quickly that they abandon all tension or horror that the first film tried. You can help but think of the droid army in THE PHANTOM MENANCE when you see the ""dog"" army in the desert. How many times do we need to see a mummy or another creature stretch their mouth open wide? It was done a lot in the first film. Seeing it now didn't make it more interesting. And when we finally see The Scorpion King, we are just so overwhelmed that we just want it to be over.It was fun seeing the characters again and how they changed. O'Connell didn't change much. He was given some parental instincts, but the script made them seem forced. Evelyn is much more physical than she was before. She isn't afraid to make a fist and fight and some of this leads to her interesting past. Jonathan is back but he is given the worst dialogue, so it makes him look even more idiotic. The rest of the cast does a good job but is given little to do, including The Mummy himself.I just can't help but feel disappointed and bored with THE MUMMY RETURNS. If they had taken the time to stop and let us enjoy the characters rather than the effects, this could have been a better film.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Guess what. The Mummy returns.,"So here's the sequel to 1999's 'The Mummy'. I think that's the standard way to start a sequel review, but if you really needed me to tell you that, then get off-line, cancel your plans for the weekend, and rent the video of the first one!'The Mummy Returns' is exactly what it says on the tin. The Mummy returns. Chaos ensues. It has everything you'd expect from a thoroughly well-made sequel to a great action film - stunning effects, fantastic stunts, some nifty martial arts, just a dash of comedy to taste, and lots of improbable turns. And lots of creepy crawlies. The only thing that could possibly improve on this romp of a film is some attempt at a plot.The film is straight from the same mould as its predecessor - file under 'Excellent Mong-Out Adventure Film Entertainment' - totally mindless, totally enjoyable, from beginning to end. Hurray for dumbing down! Brendan Fraser perfects the unsubtle-but-lovable-American act and Rachel Weisz is ideal as his squealy-girly English wife, while being feisty enough to keep the character clear of slap-able uselessness. Their kid (Freddie Boath) is suprisingly tolerable (given my cynically low acceptance threshold for precocious kids in films) - amusingly gobby, and yet rarely crossing the boundary into irredeemable obnoxiousness. John Hannah is a bit pitiful playing the wet Englishman part. It should have been good, it's almost fantastic - it's a great role, well written, very capably acted, if a bit overplayed - but it all seems such an insult to his lovely Scottish accent. Patricia Velazquez as Anck-Su-Namun is frankly astounding. I could go on to commend the excellent roles of Lock-Nah (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Izzy (Shaun Parkes) and The Scorpion King (The Rock), in similar glowing terms, but this could get boring.And, well, I've saved the best till last. The nominees for sexiest man on the planet are........ both in the same film? Impressive! We get to see much more (wahey!) of the rather tasty Oded Fehr, as the dark and enigmatic Ardeth Bey, but he's pipped to the post by the delicious Arnold Vosloo, as Imhotep, who we get to see plenty of too. Really, lots and lots of him. And he doesn't have beetles in his head this time. Mmm-mmm. That evil undead charisma wins me over every time.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Back From the Crypt,"I think I liked ""The Mummy Returns"" even better than the first ""Mummy."" Brendan Fraser seems to be a pro when it comes to combining action hero moves and comedy delivery.  Arnold Vosloo does his role well as Imhotep, but it seems the focus on him yields to that of the Rock as the Scorpion King. I was impressed by the visual effects, particularly the scene where the oasis springs up around the Scorpion King.  But I must admit that the CGI wasn't perfect all the time.  When the Scorpion King comes out as the monster near the end, the Rock's face looks like it came out of a wrestling video game.  Still, an enjoyable stop before the release of ""The Scorpion King.""",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolutely overdone,"""All stories are like this"". What can you expect of a movie with a tag line like this one? While the first movie was one of the MOTS the sequel is just plainly boring. All the special effects do no good. The subtle but sophisticated cross of studio setup and computer graphics is gone, leaving mostly computer graphics in place. Film makers thought probably that if one would repeat a cheesy line twice ...err.. thrice... ..err... four times... it should make it quite intellectually challenging. The only good moment of the movie that I remember was the forest fight with zombie pygmies. I was seriously hoping they would kill every single character thus ending my 2.5 hour torture.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good rocks and evil will always let you down.,"Here's the dope, kiddies. Lots of new, interesting plot lines. The movie is a major thrill. The action scenes are creative and very fun. Many gross bug scenes, too. So, you're going to do all right just going for a a good time. However, what I am most excited to relate is you get a whole lot more! Coming away from the movie, what I am most impressed with is it's grasp of honor, love and good vs evil. There is no grey here. True love brings out honor, good rocks, and evil will always let you down. This is displayed with great passion, and it stuck with me.

I didn't think that the second part could be this good...,"Hello everyone, (Please read what I wrote about ODED FEHR at the end)Indeed I was waiting a lot for this film. But don't think that I am a fan or something. I always try to decide wisely. And this film didn't disappoint me. I like Brendan Fraser. He is capable of a lot. He acts great. If he keeps up this way, he will probably be a superstar. Indeed this films seems to be made him a superstar already...Anyways back to the film. I have heard about Stephen Sommers but nothing specific was in my mind about him. I mean there are lots of directors around and you know something in particular about each one. I can say that this is a great second part for The Mummy. He wrote a great script and a story. I thought that I would be disappointed by this film but on the contrary I like it a lot.I have to say that I didn't like the visual effects a lot. There are lots and lots of visual effects in the film but especially as we approach the end of the film the quality of the effects decreases. I think the effects guys were tired of making effects and as they come closer to the conclusion they didn't pay attention a lot.What I liked the most is something we don't see in the movies a lot. Everything collapses at the end and the good guys can't even have a proof or money or anything after all they do. In the first movie they able to take some treasure. And in this one too. I liked that. Why are the directors or the scenarists are afraid that the heroes will get rich? Are they afraid that they would feel sluggish and get out of form so that it would be harder to film the next movie with fat heroes? The small creatures were also very funny and creepy and scary. I appreciate the guy who created the model.And above all ODED FEHR. I liked him and the character a lot. He didn't make so much films but the character in this film and himself are in harmony. The best character of the movie is Ardeth I think. The Madji (I don't how to spell it) are very cool. Especially he is very cool. They fight great and never give up. You can always count on them.

It doesn't let you up for breath for one second, and takes all the Egyptian mysticism and beauty of the first film and cranks it all the way up.I personally didn't like The Mummy when I walked out of the theater, but it grew on me with repeated viewings. This film has wowed from the very start. With assorted fun throwbacks to the original (the clumsy knocking over of pillars recollects the collapsing library, as well as forgetting a heiroglyphic at just the wrong moment), all the best characters return and become even more detailed.  Look forward to the exciting backstory of Evie. The best parts about this one is the developed character of Ardeth Bay (why is Oded Fehr not a superstar?) and the truly evil Anck Su-Namun. The only real disappointment is The Rock as the Scorpion King.  He opens and closes the film, and is the underlying story that propels the film, but he isn't much of a presence onscreen.  Why they chose him for this role is a mystery, especially since he turns into CGI during his most dramatic appearance. Rock fans are advised to pass.But anyone who misses the Indiana Jones films, was a fan of the original Mummy, or a fellow believer that they don't make good adventure movies anymore, this is a film for you.

Bigger is NOT always better; here it's overKILL,"I'm a fan of the first movie from 1999 and was naturally looking forward to this 2001 sequel. I originally saw it at the theater with two friends; after about 10-15 minutes we were all bored by the bombardment of action and F/X. We just laid back in our seats in tedium for the remaining couple hours.It's a curious thing that too much action and F/X in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it's true; and ""The Mummy Returns"" is Exhibit A. I usually give certain movies second and third chances in the hope that my first impression may have been in error, which I've done with this one over the years. Unfortunately I keep finding myself relatively detached from the story even though there are all kinds of exciting things going on; or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting.""The Mummy Returns"" has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc. (although some of the CGI is woefully cartoony, like the Scorpion King at the close). It has great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a forgettable piece of cinematic dung. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. ""The Mummy Returns"" abandons the characters while the plot is utilized as a clothesline for action and F/X sequences.The flick curiously has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails to absorb the viewer. It is unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance or overKILL: having all the right elements, including budget, and yet stupefyingly fumbling the ball.The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes (overlong), and was shot in England, Morocco, Jordan and Egypt.GRADE: C-",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Dull, Inane","This took the step that the original Mummy never quite did: it went right right off the edge and into the abyss of boredom. It very occasionally scrambled to pull itself out but never succeeded, in part because it barely tried. While the first Mummy film was mildly fresh and fun in its modern take on old campy stories like this, the second film just rehashes that idea with a slightly different plot that is much more stupid and ridiculous. It is now quite tired, dull, and downright inane, with really very little of value. It goes without saying that there is little or no character development and it relies on cheap, worn-out gags and thrills. I wouldn't even have bothered to watch it had someone not given me a copy to see and I certainly have no intention of watching it ever again.I give it a 3 because it would have been a little (and I stress ""a little"") more fresh had it been the first one, was fairly well presented, and because there are many much worse films out there.

The computer generated sets were so obvious, I don't know why they bothered.My advice - go and rent Indiana Jones on video; sure you'll know what's going to happen next, but you'll enjoy the experience far more than seeing this drivel for the first time.My rating 2 out 10.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great sequel that builds on the lore of the original.,"It's rare that a sequel is better than the original, but I think ""The Mummy Returns"" improves on it's predecessor in every way, whilst taking care to not take away the lightheartedness that made the original so appealing and entertaining. Nor did they make the film's events to serious.Rick and Evelyn O'Connell (Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz) are back for more mummy hunting...which is just as well because another group of bad guys are keen to raise Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) from the dead once again.This time around, the O'Connell's will need to deal with the Scorpion King (wrestling superstar Dwayne Johnson, in his debut acting role) as well. Luckily Evelyn's brother Jonathan (John Hannah) and Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) are back to help. So is the O'Connell's young son, Alex (Freddie Boath), who takes after his parents.Fraser is fantastic as Rick, shooting and wise-cracking his way through a horde of mummies and other supernatural characters. He was perfectly cast, and will be fondly remembered by legions of moviegoers as a result of his role.Fantastic action sequences, some humorous moments, and memorable characters, all leading up to a suitably epic conclusion.""The Mummy Returns"" rockets along at pace, and doesn't ever take itself too seriously, and that's why it works so well.A great movie from start to finish - one of the great action movies ever released.

Tower Bridge (erroneously referred to as the ""London Bridge"" :) at night is fantastic. The endless desert, the ancient Egyptian sites, the Pyramids. Loved'em all :) 3. Cast! Now, don't get me wrong -- no stellar performances here. But neither such are needed here, believe it or not. It all blends together perfectly the way it is. And this is that way: all actors are very well-chosen and suitable for their roles. Including The Rock. He is great, by the way. In the beginning, that is. Some say the Scorpion King in the end is cartoonish and awful? Never mind, he's OK. Perhaps, could have been a little better. OK, I admit it: could have been way better. So what? The film goes along with it and is watchable and very much enjoyable. Nobody's perfect, ya know :) And one more note on the cast -- diversity! A LOAD of different characters, a majority of them are leading roles :))) It's FUN. 4. Battle scenes deserve to be a separate entry. Really. I was blown away!! The movie could have been titled The Grand Battles In The Desert. Again, enough to make the film a must-see on their own. 5. Sound and music. On a par with the best!! Very convincing, enjoyable, touching. Loud. And in this movie, it also is a merit. This movie startles, and terrific sound takes much credit for that.Now... STOP READING THE REVIEWS.

Feels like Mummy Reruns,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Same old story for a sequel.  Make it a little bigger and a little louder, and people will flock to the theatres ... especially if it is released at a very slow time for movies!  Rachel Weisz gets much more physical in this one.  This along with a ""smart beyond his years"" kid are two of the three changes from the original.  Still no story line to follow.  Just an incredible succession of special effects.  The early scenes with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, gave a flicker of hope for a real story; however, his screen time was disappointingly brief.  That is, except for the animated mess at the end.  You will not be able to stop shaking your head at his return.  Hopefully this was meant as a big joke by our ""director"".  Arnold Vosloo is the only one to put forth any acting effort, but the weak script prevents us from seeing what he's made of. Unless you have a high dollar home theatre, this will be a flop on video. Won't someone please cast Brendan Fraser in a daytime soap, so that we may be spared his moviemaking for a few years?",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lord Imhotep has Returned,"The Mummy Returns is the #1 Movie in the World, Brendan Fraser has done it again, it's action-pack fun. Full of adventures around the world, and now it's one of the best action/adventure monster film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
If you are a 10 year old boy you'll love it,"Saw a preview of this and it did not live up to my expectations set by the theater trailer.  A weak follow-up to the original.  The kid does to this movie what Jar Jar Binks did to 'Phantom Menace'.  The special effects in the final fight scene were awful; the Scorpion King looked like a cartoon.  Overall not a ""bad"" movie, just not a ""good"" movie either. The homage to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" at the beginning was appreciated.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
better than i hoped,"it often seems sequels are doomed to mediocrity.  this however was not the case of the mummy returns.the plot did a very good job weaving together the protagonists and balanced the introduction of the son.  while periodically a bit contrived and predictable, there are precious few moments in movies today that are not.while the character of imhotep, once again, only periodically reached three dimensions, what i found very confusing was the presence of the rock as the scorpion king.  the producers could easily have found some musclebound struggling actor and given him that role as well.  i don't know what the arrangement was, but his presence added nothing.the CG effects, while good, were perhaps distributed with too generous a hand, especially the scorpion king encounter at the film's climax.  but that's an issue i have with the director, not the script.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A good sequel, although not surprising","In this movie the mummy will return to wake up, this time in London in the thirties. Rick and Evelyn will have to run against the clock in order to save the world again, and most importantly, to save their son, Alex. This is the sequel of ""The Mummy"", movie of 1999, and has the direction and script by Stephen Sommers and the participation of Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, added by Patricia Velasquez, Freddie Boath, Dwayne Johnson and Oded Fehr.It's always difficult for a sequel surprising the audience that saw the first film. This film suffers from this difficulty and therefore couldn't surprise the same way as the first one. The script could also have been more interesting: the ""Scorpion King"" story is hardly convincing and sounds like a sort of publicity for the movie with that name which came out the year after. Dwayne Johnson, in turn, played his role perfectly well: this ""pseudo-actor"" is good for any role where he has to punch four times more than talk. The rest of the cast is perfectly fine, particularly Freddie Boath, who was brilliant in his role, and Arnold Vosloo, who gave his character a psychological depth that he hadn't had the opportunity to show in the first film. The soundtrack continued to be good without being exceptional, the special effects and make-up continued to make their role positively but without surprises. The computerization and digital resources surprised me most at the end of the film, which is very well done.This film comes on the trail of a great movie for the family and for almost all ages. I believe that, despite not having been exactly a surprise to the public, this shouldn't be a big sin. It remains a film made with great care and in an intelligent and humorous way. It's a movie for everyone.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fast-Paced, Fun Action, Thoroughly Enjoyable","I took my 12 year old daughter to see The Mummy Returns -- I didn't know what to expect, usually sequels aren't as good as the original--but I was very surprised to see this sequel is equal to or in some scenes, better than the original. I am glad they expanded Patricia Velazquez's role. The movie is still campy horror like the first Mummy, and I am glad they refrained from a show of blood and guts, which make it more suitable for younger (11 and under) viewers.I do wish they had named the Pharoah's daughter a name other than Nefertiri, that was used already in The Ten Commandments -- they could have come up with a more beautiful name. Other than that, this mom & daughter enjoyed it. It was a lot of fun! I'll be buying the video, definitely.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
