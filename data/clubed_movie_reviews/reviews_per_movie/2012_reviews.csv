This film had so much potential. What went wrong?,"They had all the money, actors and special effects they needed so how did they manage to screw this one up? Obviously they thought exiting moments were more important than developing deeper characters and that's why this story that had great potential stayed so shallow. The dialog was always cheesy and none of the 'hero's' in this film really showed any real emotions nor did they give any of those speeches that give the audience goose bumps. Another thing that really bothered me was that so much was almost going wrong the whole time. Every second of the film had a 'close call' which made the film seem totally unrealistic. Examples are planes taking off just before the runway collapses or driving just fast enough to not get hit by an explosion. This can be very cool if it doesn't happen 100% of the time and I have never seen a movie abusing this way of creating excitement to this extent. So to sum up: If you feel like turning your brain off and watching special effects and big explosions with a very shallow storyline then this movie is for you. But if you feel like watching a movie with a bit of depth then go and see something else.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun For the Kids,"I had a lot of fun taking my 12 year old son and two of his friends to this movie. 2012 was no more far-fetched than; e.g., Independence Day, The Abyss, Armageddon, The Core.... I could go on and on. Further, the ""Gremlins""-like touches of humor made 2012 go down much easier than the afore-mentioned films, which mildly insult by pretending to be plausible science fiction. I get annoyed reading the showy displays of ""brilliance"" by reviewers who point out that the events are ludicrous, melodramatic, over-the-top, etc. OF COURSE THEY ARE. So was King Kong in 1933. Such critics remind me of sullen adolescents who've just learned the moon isn't really made of green cheese. I recommend they have young children and take them to a Saturday matinée featuring a Jane Austen flick. I'm sure it'll be a swell time for all.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
And the public gets what the public wants.,"Roland Emmerich was armed with a $200 million budget, and this is what it produced. It's an easy film to dislike from an intellectual level, artistically as well, while the science fiction boffins no doubt had kittens where the science was concerned. It's also easily one hour too long in length, and come the second half of the marathon it starts to sag. There's only so many times you can watch your lead protagonists escape crumbling carnage - via various modes of transport - before the fun factor begins to wane. However.The carnage effects are grade ""A"" stuff, eye popping and ear splintering, Emmerich is a master at this sort of thing, and with a likable cast comfortably chewing through the safe disaster film making screenplay, it's a very decent popcorn blockbuster. It also isn't afraid to explore some dark moments, all of which - while not all being a surprise - strike strong emotional chords. It knows its disaster movie roots and is happy to tug on them.2012 made a $500 million profit, that's a figure not to be ignored. The blockbuster movie loving public lapped it up, they often love this stuff, they just want to see the world exploding and chases and crashes and humans imploding or being heroic. If you have to strip it bare on any sort of cerebral level, then of course it's naked. But fully clothed, attired purely in modern film popcorn clobber, then it's grand dramatic and exciting fun. And this even as you have to massage your buttocks at the two hour mark. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It's the end of the world, not anybody's career","Anybody going to this movie to learn about the Mayan prophecies for 2012 or for any true science, is going to be sadly disappointed. But, that is not why we go to movies anyway, is it? That is like going to see Godzilla expecting to learn something about giant lizards that vomit radioactive spray. Emmerich has taken a fictitious subject he knew would be controversial and woven some drama into it. People who tend to be slightly paranoid will no doubt be even more so after seeing the world destroyed according to interpretations of prophecy. The people who sell the books promoting the fear make money, just like the movie producers. So what? I didn't see this movie to pick up any information I haven't learned from the History Channel, nor do I believe any more than I did before, that anything bad is going to happen on December 21, 2012. Did I go expecting to be highly entertained by great CGI and action? Yes! And I wasn't disappointed! One thing many reviewers haven't been picking up on while watching this movie is the very slight tongue-in-cheekiness of the subject that Emmerich cleverly wove into the plot. He obviously doesn't believe any of the prophecy any more than most of the rest of us do. You can see it in the actors' performances too: Woody Harrelson, to wit. It is the same as a weatherman who can deliver his forecast each night without laughing because he truly doesn't know with certainty what is going to happen, but he tries to make us believe nonetheless.See this movie if you love cinema. Enjoy the things about cinema that make it great. Take a small pillow for your butt cheeks because almost 3 hours of sitting in an uncomfortable theater seat will make you wish you had. But fear not. There is so much non-stop action you won't notice the discomfort too much.The film has obvious flaws, trite clichés, and phony science, but if you are a fan of 50's sci-fi, you will love this movie. And remember, don't take it too seriously folks, just enjoy it. The end of the world isn't going to happen in 2012, there really aren't any giant grasshoppers, ants, or lizards roaming the Earth, and no one's career is going to end because of their role in this movie. It is Hollywood having a good time with a controversial subject. Nothing new there.Enjoy the show!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What happened to the Mayan prophecy?,"I went to an advance screening of 2012 a few nights ago and I have to admit that this movie was entertaining at best and that's it. The whole movie is almost entirely comprised of special effects. Of course you'll see all of the lead characters survive scenarios that a regular human being would not. Some of the scenes are so ridiculously unbelievable that you want to laugh at the fodder that's being expected of you to believe. Emmerich certainly pushes ""suspension of disbelief"" to its limit.John Cusack and Woody Harrelson are the only actors that attempt to hold the film together, while Danny Glover and Thandie Newton were an utter and complete let-down considering their previous work history. You won't see any remotely Oscar-worthy performances here. The casting of this film seemed off and poorly executed. You could tell the bulk of the financial budget went to the special effects and not the actors.The thing that I found thoroughly disappointing about 2012 is that it's almost entirely lacking of any interesting backstory or intellectual substance whatsoever. There's very little mention of the Mayan calendar, Mayan history, or any of the prophetic wisdom that has foreseen the supposed end of days. The fear, analysis, curiosity, and everything else you've ever wondered about this new mysterious year that is quickly approaching is almost entirely removed from this film. That would have and could have made this film closer to a 10 if I didn't feel like my brain was utterly wasted on this CGI and special effects bonanza. They try to cram so many explosions, eruptions, earthquakes, and natural disasters into two hours that I might be a little desensitized to the real thing if it ever happens. After awhile nothing felt realistic or interesting about it at all.It's novelty entertainment at best and that's it. You won't wince at how painfully awful this movie is, and you won't walk away knowing anything meaningful about 2012, but hopefully you'll help repay Sony pictures for the exorbitant amount of money that they and Roland Emmerich spent on their special effects budget. Don't say you weren't warned.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great campy fun,"It was pretty much inevitable that someone would make a movie based on all the 2012 hoopla. Nor is it surprising when that someone is disaster maven Roland Emmerich. His latest effort adheres closely to the formula established by his earlier films ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow""- in other words we get to watch a typically flawed-but-lovable American family (headed by John Cusack and Amanda Peet), along with a range of supporting characters, attempt to survive the end of the world.That's all there is to the basic plot. The real stars of the film are the truly spectacular special effects. Emmerich really pulls out all the stops and creates some truly awesome set-pieces of destruction. In order to ensure that the main characters have endless perilous situations to escape from, we get to see a bunch of natural and man-made wonders get totaled by Mama Nature. Highlights include Los Angeles falling into the sea, Las Vegas being swallowed by the desert, and the Himalayas being submerged by tidal waves.Improbable? Definitely. Ridiculous? You bet. But none of that matters since ""2012"" is exactly the film it was intended to be- a great big popcorn movie that offers big laughs, big thrills, and a lot of good old fashioned fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great roller-coaster ride,"Okay, the first thing I'd like to say is, ignore those comments from members who belong to 'the worst movie ever club!!' These members think it is way cool to label every slightly disappointing movie as ' the worst movie ever' and emphasize their juvenility with tons of exclamation marks. They think it is way cool to trash movies.The movie just isn't that bad. It's not that great either so ignore those who gush and tell you how awesome it is and rate it 10 out of 10.This is a film best viewed in the movie theaters on the largest screen possible to enjoy the thrilling sensation of cities breaking up, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. This is indeed a thrilling roller-coaster ride. It is best to leave your brain at home, however, as you will cringe at the clichés, the schmaltz, and the absurdities. That doesn't make it the worst film ever, though. So go for the ride and enjoy the CG effects.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Classic Emmerich, You will get what you pay for.","If you've seen Independence Day, Titanic, or any recent vintage of the well-worn disaster film genre, you will not be disappointed at all with any of 2012. Its 2.5 hour+ running time moves at a great clip, and there's enough science and pseudoscience running around to give the film a certain of-the-moment wonder and clarity. The many destruction sequences throughout the film are absolutely breathtaking to behold, and one wonders if Roland Emmerich starts every film imagining how he will destroy the White House. Like all of his other films (except for The Patriot) it has big names but no huge names and really is a blast to watch. It has just the right balance of action and melodrama, often, as with all good films of this genre, in the same scene. The audience I watched it with was laughing and cheering throughout, and I'm sure it will be the definitive event movie of the holiday season, critics be damned.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Heavy and absurd..,"After watching this movie I really needed time to figure out what to think of it. I heard a lady sharing her first comment to her friend: 'That dog sure was ugly'. What else was there to say? After a while I found out:The action was truly formidable, demonstrating the power of 'mother nature'. Collapsing buildings, jumping flaming cars, planes falling down and manage to pull up a second before touchdown, it was a real trip and a feast for the eyes and ears.But then again... the acting wasn't that good, a bit over the top. In one scene in the movie, where every wasted second could be the cause of a terrible disaster, *they* waste their time being...ROMANTIC! At times like that the acting became very juicy, making me think I was watching 'Titanic' instead.One point of advise: Do not take this movie too seriously. It's almost stuffed with jokes instead of showing us the real drama of an earth that is about to be destroyed. But keep this in mind and you'll have a heck of a 2 hours and 40 minutes(!) in a movie that is made for the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Funniest tragedy ever,"There is now a long, grand history of disaster films in Hollywood. The best of the lot have combined suspense with cutting-edge effects to keep your adrenaline pumping. The worst combine cheesy CGI with shallow characters whose deaths won't affect you much.Here's 2012, summed up: Look, some recognizable landmark! Kablam! Look, a giant wave! Wooo! Do our intrepid Good Guys have enough time to outrun the imploding planet and foil a plot to save only the pretty, rich people? Probably! It's pretty clear what happened to bring us to this point. Roland Emmerich, who's made such cinematic classics as Independence Day, The Patriot, Godzilla, and The Day after Tomorrow, was asked if he wanted a quintillion billion bazillion dollars to make a movie about the end of the world, and he said sure. Then he took parts of each movie's script, filmed them mostly with CGI, and pocketed the rest. Viola! Greatest movie! (A quick break to sum up the plot. Apparently, the sun and the planets have all aligned with the center of the galaxy, which winds up causing the Earth's crust to break up, which then causes the tectonic plates to shift. Mass hysteria! Dogs and cats, living together! The End.) See, there are two ways Emmerich could have gone with this movie. He could have given us characters to follow whom we cared a little about, thus involving us in their plights, and mixed in some convincing special effects. Or he could have said, ""The heck with the characters, give me blowy-uppy thingys."" This sometimes works: See Independence Day, a movie that made me feel pretty good when I left the theater after seeing it but that ultimately, frankly, was pretty bad.Emmerich chose the latter. Which would have been fine, but the effects themselves are wildly unrealistic and often take so long to set up that you completely notice how godawful they really are. For example – and if you've seen the trailer, this is in there – there's a scene in which the Sistine Chapel falls, crushing thousands of spectators. Because the toppling is so slow to complete, it becomes painfully obvious that it's just a film running on a screen behind people running away. Sad and unintentionally hilarious.And you can forget about the plot, really, because most of it makes no sense anyway and would happen only in a Big Movie like this. Of COURSE John Cusack is divorced from his hot, bitchy wife (Amanda Peet) and of COURSE she's hooking up with a plastic surgeon who of COURSE winds up having had some flying lessons that of COURSE will save them all and of COURSE Cusack's young son will somehow save the day as well and of COURSE there is a Russian businessman who used to be a boxing legend and of COURSE he punches someone out. And of COURSE people say ""My God!"" a lot, because that's what people do in crappy disaster films. And of COURSE the president is black, because in Hollywood black people get to be president only if disaster is a-coming.At least the acting isn't horrible. Because everyone just runs from place to place in an effort to escape the horror, there aren't any subtle, low-key scenes that would allow good actors to flourish. Cusack is good in general, but what the heck is he doing in here? He's usually so good at picking projects, and he chose this? Willingly? Oliver Platt plays the kind of role that Bruce McGill typically gets, the hamhanded, I'm-in-charge, Al-Haig-like politician. I can't even remember his title. Danny Glover gets to be president and does get the best dialog in the film, even if his role isn't a big one. Woody Harrelson, as a crazed DJ deep in Yellowstone is also a lot of fun, although he's not the kind of guy you'd want to sit next to on a transatlantic flight.Final verdict: Yikes. Yikes, yikes, and yikes. If you dare watch this travesty, you might find yourself laughing hysterically at things – and this is important – that were not meant to be funny. If that's your thing, this is your movie. I managed to see this as a matinée, so I'm not out the $10-$15 that some people are right now, so at least I got that going for me. Best advice: Watch it for free at home on a big-screen TV to fully appreciate the magnitude of suck.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good cataclysmic Action, but waayyy to much bad kitsch","I loved the first half of the movie with Roland Emmerich seemingly back to form (from his disastrous ""10,000 B.C.""). But as the movie drags on, even the smallest character gets his ""i have to say goodbye to my loved ones""-scene - which becomes quite annoying after you've watched this for the 5th time in a row. then comes a great destruction scene and then we're back in soap-opera territory. don't get me wrong, basically that can be said about most of Emmerich's movies - they are just popcorn cinema - leave your brain at the ticket counter. still, i enjoyed the likes of ""Independence Day"" or even ""The Day After Tomorrow"". But the one thing, he can't do properly is ""good""-emotional cinema - which works fine in some of his other movies when his pathos-laden, goofy dialogue writing doesn't get in the way of the big explosions - it fit's, makes them funnier to a point. unfortunately this doesn't work for 2012. if somebody could actually cut this movie down to 90minutes running time, i'd even be lining up for a second ticket.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
great addition to the end of world movies,"It's always amusing to read and/or hear people going on about the realness (or better lack of it) of event movies like this. Something along the lines like: That (stunt) couldn't really happen in real life! Really? Is that all you got about this movie? It's not real? Isn't a movie ""not"" real by definition?Writer/director Roland Emmerich sacrifices dialogue and depends on an almost comical story line to wow viewers with mega destruction. Sure the CGI, sound and special effects will sell a lot of popcorn and soft drinks. Even word of mouth will put people in theater seats. Just leave any semblance of real intelligence at the box office, lean back and hold on...and let your eyes feast on the powerful scenes of devastation.A geologist(Chiwetel Ejiofor)has the facts and figures that prove validity in the ancient Mayan belief that the wold will come to an end in 2012. He at first will have trouble convincing the President's(Danny Glover)people of the pending doom; but a novelist(John Cusack), who just so happens to have written a book about the lost Atlantis, is an easier believer...and the story line has him and his family out driving and flying the massive earthquakes and tsunamis. And somehow cell phones periodically still work. The finale is actually clever; and as the story eases into salvation, heroic feats of bravery run from sappy to bittersweet. You do end up thinking you got multiple big bangs for your buck. As for entertainment, I really enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not the best disaster movie, not the worst.","So I'm a HUGE disaster movie buff. Absolutely love them, especially when it's made by Roland. This one is probably my least favorite Roland disaster, but I still really enjoy it. Just like in most disaster movies, there's of course going to be unrealistic scenarios. Because well, it's a movie. If you're one of those people who dissect every scene & try to decide if it's realistic or not, then you just simply lack a creative mind, and this movie is not for you.. or any adventurous movie if you're like that. However, there are a few parts where I could see it happening if the world did come to an end this way, such as the arks.If you go into this expecting a perfect, flawless flick with no goofs, A ++ acting & dialogue, then of course you're going to be disappointed. Overall, the acting was definitely good for the most part & I would give it a B. This is how I would grade it personally.Acting: B+
Writing: B
Directing: B+
Editing: A
Sound: AI'm not gonna rate every little category but usually when I want to watch something new, I look at those 5 specifically.As I wrap this review up, there is one thing that I would like to mention that surprisingly, I haven't seen anyone else bring up yet. The one thing that absolutely drove me insane & wanting to rip my skin off my face was the little girl, Lilly who is Jackson's(Cusack) daughter, SCREAMING Daddy throughout the entire movie. There has to be at least 20 times if not more where she's screaming it! It's absolutely ear piercing the way she does it. I'm sure most of them were done in post rather then during filming. But they could've taken at least 17-18 of those out and I still would've enjoyed the movie.Hope you enjoyed my review. Take care.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than I expected,"If you've seen any of Roland Emmerich's previous disaster titles, you probably know what you're in for with this one. That being said, I felt 2012 had better acting and a more exciting storyline than the others.In order to enjoy this film, you have to ignore the ridiculously absurd premise about neutrinos and the sun catastrophically altering the earth's crust (forget about the Mayan prophecy, which is hardly mentioned). If you can overlook why the world is ending, this is actually an captivating film with some spectacular effects scenes. Yes, there are several perilous close calls that stretch the notion of ""luck"". Yes, the actors from all parts of the world become interconnected in what stretches the notion of ""coincidence"". No, it's not going to receive any best acting or screenplay nominations. Nevertheless, it's engaging.Cusack is great as the everyman hero. Ejiofor grabs your attention as the young government scientist trying to prepare for the inevitable. Glover and Harrison are also effective in smaller roles: Glover as the resolute President, and Harrison as the wackjob conspiracy theorist who might not be so crazy after all. Many other characters are merely stereotypes (like the Russian) or one dimensional (like the wife), but let's be honest, it's not the characters that we're coming to see. If you are, you'll probably be disappointed.2012 is not great but it entertains as a doomsday thriller. IMO it's better than Godzilla, Day After Tomorrow, and 10,000 BC.

The sound mixing is outstanding, and if you watch the movie on a nice surround system it sounds truly amazing. The actors all do a great job too. I know tons of people who like this movie, but unfortunately most of the people who actually take the time to get on here and rate it are the ones who think they know everything, or that they could do better, or just the simple few who are not into disaster movies. This movie didn't make hundreds of millions of dollars by being terrible.

The End of the World: The New Family Therapy?,"Who knew the end of the world could be such a bummer? In ""2012,"" the first and certainly not the last big-studio bid to cash in on the supposed coming apocalypse, Roland Emmerich once again lays waste to Earth and its assorted famous landmarks, but this time it's with a touch of exhaustion, an almost routine finality. Maybe it's middle age (it's his first apocalypse since he turned 50). Or, maybe, it's because to a consummate destroyer of worlds (four doomsdays and counting), the true end of days is really just the final dreary step. Few images, after all, beat that of the California coast crumbling into the ocean like a sinking aircraft carrier, or of the subsequent barrage of flaming volcanic rock that pummels the earth when Yellowstone finally goes kaput, blowing its literal top and the audience's already torpid movie-going mind.Both of those sequences are given high prominence in ""2012,"" though neither is predicted by the end of the Mesoamerican long-count calendar, from which this movie takes its name if not much else. Weaving escapist fantasy into scientific fact has long been the prerogative of high-concept vehicles like ""2012,"" which omit most of the finer factual details (the Mayans never actually wrote of the end of the world, for starters) to make their own pseudoscientific conceits appear frighteningly plausible. That may explain why ""2012"" takes a nominally more scientific approach to the cataclysm (neutrinos, crust displacement, blah, blah, blah), though even Chiwetel Ejiofor, as the president's scientific adviser, seems to know that it's all one big joke long before Woody Harrelson, as some sort of apocalyptic hippie fanatic, can pop his eyeballs and declare, ""It's the apocalypse, man!""Mr. Harrelson's character doesn't figure much into the story beyond the usual wise fool archetype, though at least his bug-eyed mugging gives oomph to what is otherwise a pretty unremarkable disaster flick. The real selling point of ""2012"" is, of course, the annihilation of our planet and most of our species, and, if nothing else, the destruction here can hardly be called boring. That's to be expected, seeing that Mr. Emmerich is certainly an old hand in the industry, having already vaporized, trampled, flooded and frozen the planet solid, not to mention raked in a collective ten-figure sum at the domestic box office. Considering the worldwide scale of ""2012"" and Mr. Emmerich's incurable tendency to one-up himself, it's also no surprise that here he works so relentlessly to cover all his catastrophic bases, from the pulverization of the Vatican to the inundation of D.C., to the purely extraneous sight of a cruise ship keeling over, Paul Gallico-style, upending the galley and its many digitally- rendered flailing human bodies.But, seriously, what's the point anymore? Like most apocalyptic trifles, ""2012"" trades on the doomsday scenario to stake the usual forgettable claims at the resilience of the human spirit (and the American nuclear family) but mostly it just wants to watch the world burn, sometimes literally. The human race is ending, after all, and if that end never really resonates in ""2012,"" it's because not even Mr. Emmerich seems interested in examining it beyond the visceral level. Although he duly taps his emotional well by occasionally bringing you close to the calamity – the tiny human bodies tumbling from a collapsing freeway are certainly frightening – it's hard to feel awed by or even care at all about any of it when all the man wants to do (and wants us to do) is have a good time.""2012"" is a pretty much a romp, then, and, for its first ruinous hour at least, a reasonably satisfying one. The sturdy B-movie screenplay by Mr. Emmerich and Harold Kloser actually picks up in 2009, giving time to introduce a few of the leading men and women who will figure into the imminent end, some of them likable (Mr. Ejiofor), others abhorrent (Oliver Platt as a blustering government bigwig), most of them just plain boring. Three years later, as the cracks in the Earth and the story become wider and more worrisome, more people come into play, in this case an everyfamily (John Cusack, Amanda Peet and their two burdensome children) we're meant to follow while modern civilization crumbles around them, in increasingly spectacular ways.But the spectacle wears off and the movie soon drags, done in when Mr. Emmerich's exuberant flair for devastation gives way to his seriously underwhelming affinity for family soap operatics and teary moments of worldwide harmony. Part of the problem with movies like ""2012"" is that even with the latest brand of pricey computer-generated effects at their disposal, such wizardry tends to undercut itself when you stop and realize that almost none of what you're seeing is really there, really happening. Mr. Emmerich is not entirely to blame, of course, though it's nonetheless a wonder that after three stabs at destroying the planet, he still can't avoid the disconnect between human tragedy and worldwide destruction that runs through ""2012"" like a fissure and keeps even its most realistic-looking disasters from ever feeling remotely real. Which may make it the perfect tonic to this particular ploy of the paranoia market.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Silly and Corny Disaster Movie,"When the geologist Dr. Adrian Helmsley and his team discover that the core of Earth is heating due to solar radiation, he advises the North American President about his findings.

""2012"" is the opposite: state-of-art special effects and an imbecile story, i.e., a silly and corny disaster movie. The physical absurd are usually OK for the action, but stupid attitudes is something that is annoying like, for example, the decision to open the gates with less than five minutes to be reached by the tsunami, or swimming wearing tie. There are some posts in the Message Board listing the implausible or stupid scenes and attitudes. The Church in Brazil is suing Columbia Picture for using the image of the Christ Redeemer without previous authorization in an absolute absurd and nonsense; could the true reason be indeed an indirect reprisal for the scene with the destruction of the Vatican?

I did like like Oliver Platt and the way they handled the attempts to keep the secret. 4.) I want to be Charlie (Woodley Harrelson's character.) That was a good role for him and he played it perfectly. Iagree that there was an Indiana Jones Adventure feel to the stunts chases and such, but that's what made it fun for me. I think it was headed for a 5 or 6 rating until the end action moments and they picked it up to a 7, although I liked it more than a 7, I don't think the movie as a whole is better than that.

You Were Warned!,"You were warned that possibly the worst movie made since The Monolith Monsters (1957) had been unleashed on the public.Almost all of the actors are unappealing. John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, and Danny Glover are not compelling actors. Cusack, as usual, plays the weary sad sack. Harrelson's attempt to channel Dennis Hopper's maniacal character in ""Apocalypse Now"" is embarrassing. And Danny Glover's role as the president of the United States is an insult. In his ""real"" life, he despises America and praises Hugo Chavez, the thug that runs Venezuela and its drug cartels. Putting that aside, Glover's pulse can hardly be measured.Child actors. Oh, if only we didn't need them. They are almost invariably portrayed as rude, contrary, and sullen. And the parents put up with it. But, never fear, by the end of the film, they are cuddly little teddy bears that have brokered a reconciliation between their estranged parents.The adult characters in this movie are not believable. They are either cads, unlikely heroes, or holy men. Adults in authority almost always have bad motives. The chief bad guy is supposed to be the president's chief of staff, Anheuser, but in reality he is the only guy that knows what he's doing and is devoted to his duty. That doesn't count much, I guess, in the prevailing culture.The story begins with some excitement, but eventually devolves into an overlong, overwrought cartoon. It's ""Earthquake,"" ""The Towering Inferno,"" ""Krakatoa-East of Java,"" ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" ""The Bible,"" and ""Airport '75"" on steroids. Too many anguished characters, too many anti-heroes, too many noble savages, too many plots and subplots, no coherence, and virtual chaos.Such is what passes today for entertainment. Yes, this is a disaster movie alright, but probably not the kind of disaster the producers intended.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
waste of money,"I could talk about this movie all day, but it already consumed too much of my time. They should have burned the money, and film it, the fire would be a much better show... I really do not want to believe that it is allowed to call this a movie. Shame on all the great actors who participated in this... I wouldn't even say that the effects are stunning, because they are just expensive and they do not serve any purpose. Everything is so pointless. All the ""emotional"" scenes made me wanna throw up. The lines are... don't know how to describe them. I think that you can hear the ""Mister president"" line, about a hundred times which is present in every single one of Mr Roland's movies. Music is so cheesy, every now and then the sad strings come up to pump up the heroics of brave individuals, or to make you cry or at least to make you realize the importance of the situation , and all they do is making it even more disgusting and eventually you end up actually wanting the world to end.

2012 a total disaster,"Well I'm just back from watching this movie at my local multi-plex. So what did I think? oh dear where to start.This had to be one of the most enduring movies experiences of my life. 2HRS 30 MINS, are you kidding me? I have to be honest the only reason I went to see this movie was to see the quality of the CGI on the big screen. I didn't go to see it because I wanted or thought I would see, intense character development, an intriguing story with an intelligent script, fantastic direction with a epic world class score. Thank goodness I didn't because none of these things are on show.So why did I hate this SO MUCH?No logic to the build up of the chaos.Cardboard cut out character with ZERO likability or progression. Were they all based on cartoon characters.OTT close shaves........CONSTANTLY.....FAR to many clichés, everyone possible for a disaster was thrown in there. Some originality please.Did I mention 2 AND A HALF HOURS.Poor script wrote I assume by a 5 year old?Forgettable scoreRidiculous over sentimental moments of intimacy between cardboard characters. Sorry but I don't care about them because of the poor story telling.Last 30 Min's dragged and was extremely dull, oh and how long can some of these characters hold their breath?I could go on.....but won't.What did I like.Not much, however there are a couple of AWESOME CGI scenes of destruction.Unfortunately thats not enough, not even close enough to make this an enjoyable experience, EVEN if your brain is in neutral.1/10 For the CGI and only for the CGI.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A really good natural disaster film. (NO SPOILERS),"This is certainly in my top 10 films I have watched. I really like these types of films and this one had it all for me. There is a lot of twists and turns as well as a lot of action.The plot is based around a family where the parents have separated and the mum has a new partner. There is a large earth quake where they live as well as other major disasters worldwide, they all have to try and survive, which takes them on an epic journey.The plot is well planned and has a lot of variety which gives you the sense of a worldwide disaster, which is always good for this type of film.

The case of when the special effects overshadow the script and the acting,"Roland Emmerich is like marmite, we love him or we hate him. Personally I don't admire him, then again I have nothing personal against him, other than to say I do sometimes find his directorial style murky and unfocused. So what about 2012? To put it simply, there is a lot wrong with the film, but I actually found it surprisingly watchable. The best thing about 2012 is without doubt the special effects. They are utterly mind-blowing, and the equally astounding sound and fluid cinematography added to the authenticity. The music score is great, and the idea of the story is intriguing. However excellent special effects can mean that the script and acting aren't as good, sadly that is the case. The acting was nothing special really, but John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Amanda Peet, Danny Glover and Oliver Platt do try their hardest with shallow characters as do the kids and it does show. I did think Zlatko Buric as Yuri was very one note though. These talented actors are cursed by mostly awful dialogue that is clichéd and stale, and the film did come very unrealistic in places. It also doesn't help that the pacing is too stodgy and the film is half an hour too long. Overall, not a waste, and visually mind-blowing, but nothing great. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
2012 A Decent Disaster Movie With Some Flaws,"2012 is a decent disaster movie with flaws which I'll get into later from director Roland Emmerich whose been known for making films of this genre like The Day After Tomorrow and Independence Day to name a few. Emmerich is admirable in making this movie giving audiences state of the art special effects with good performances from the cast for the most part. John Cusuak is solid as the lead Jackson Curtis a struggling writer and limo driver who tries to save his estranged family from the global cataclysm that brings about the end of the world. It has to do something with the earths core heating up because of solar flares from the sun causing massive volcanic eruptions unlike anything you've ever seen, destructive earthquakes that level cities, and giant tsunamis that destroy everything in it's path. The rest of the supporting cast are decent in their roles including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, Thandie Newton, and Oliver Platt. Danny Glover and Woody Harrelson make the best of their small roles in the film. Glover is convincing as the President whose faced with many difficult choices. I felt Harrelson went a little over the top with his character at times but he still turns in an humorous performance though. The serious mood of the film worked considering it's about the end of the world and there's some humor that could've been better but thats all right. There were many yeah right moments when Cusuak and his family were barely escaping one disaster after another within minutes of each other but I was willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of the movie. As I mentioned before the special effects are pretty amazing even if you can tell it's obviously CG. The movie is nearly two and half hours which made it a little long, the dialog wasn't the best occasionally, and there were some predictable moments, but overall 2012 isn't that bad. For the first half hour or so Emmerich introduces us to the main characters developing some of them with strange things happening which foreshadows that the worst has yet to come. The last two hours I'd say is pretty much non stop action with Earth getting relentlessly hammered by earthquakes that take out cities in minutes, volcanic eruptions that shoot clouds of smoke and ash into the sky with massive fire clouds miles high, and gigantic tsunamis which engulf everything in it's path. The global cataclysms caused by the solar flares end up killing billions of people around the world with only a fraction surviving which does make the movie sad at times because you know none of them stood a chance against mother natures destructive power. If this does indeed happen one day I hope I'm not around for it because none of us would probably survive catastrophes like the ones shown in 2012. If Emmerich had trimmed the running time a bit, cut out some of the humor that didn't really seem to work with the serious mood, then I might have enjoyed it more than I did. Overall though 2012 was a decent disaster film but I wouldn't call it a classic. This film however is sure to please almost any fan of the genre. The movie has amazing special effects, plenty of action, drama, and good performances by the cast (Cusuak and Ejiofor) who make 2012 worth watching at least once if you can get past the overlong running time first.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visually Stunning but scores low on content.,"When you are going to see a movie which has already impressed you with its outstanding trailer, then it's obvious to expect something great and out of the ordinary. That was the state I was in while entering the theater to watch 2012. Excitingly waiting for the movie to start, I had many questions in mind about how the director will tackle the various ongoing problems of the world while showcasing the Ultimate End of our civilization? And majorly what will be his take on the famous religions of the world when the characters will be talking about their Final Moments? And to my surprise the movie took off from our part of the world in 1999, where an Indian Geologist religiously named Dr. Satnam, discovers that the Earth is heating up to an extent that is causing a shift in its tectonic plates. He passes on the news of this deadly discovery to his American friend Dr. Adria, who straight away takes it to the White House as an emergency situation. Coming back to the future in 2012, the movie plunges into the amazing graphical world where the earth is sinking due to the high density earthquakes and all the historical monuments are falling left and right like lifeless toys.Visually it's a fabulous portrayal of the End of the World from the director ""Roland Emmerich"" who is known for his mesmerizing work in his earlier movies such as ""Independence Day"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""Godzilla"". The moment you witness the first shattering sequence of the earth making a huge wide gap and everything falling into it, you get transported into a gripping enigmatic world altogether. The spectacular special effects unfolding every 15 minutes in the movie, just keep you glued to the screen with your jaws wide open. The disastrous happenings worldwide, the enormous water tides coming over, the burning volcanic eruptions and ugly tsunamis spreading over the world map just bring on the viewer to the edge of his seat.Hence, if you are in for some great Computer Graphics and want to see a few terrific nail biting scenes where the heroes are just climbing up before the earth sinks in, then this is the perfect choice to spend your valuable time.But if you are expecting a great movie, rich on emotional and futuristic content as suggested by the impressive body of work by its director, then you may remain quite unsatisfied at the end. In simple words, 2012, undoubtedly scores high on technical and graphical terms but content wise it falls short of the earlier disaster movies from the director. It lacks the emotional depth in its characterization due to which the viewer is not able to relate with any of the characters fighting with the unwanted situation. In order to cover more number of people on the screen, the script fails to develop any one character in particular, which as a result leaves a very cold kind of impact on the viewer. The movie also tends to become a bit slow at times but bounces back with every new destruction sequence on the screen.The entire cast delivers fine performances as required by the subject, but they are also handicapped by the poor characterization in the script. John Cusack is pleasant to see but has nothing great written for him in particular. Amanda Peet is just there to give her constant looks of amazement. Danny Glover as the president, Thandie Newton as his daughter, Oliver Platt as the president's chief of staff and Jimi Mistry as Dr. Satnam simply play their parts as directed. Only Chiwetel Ejiofor looks like more concerned about the humanity factor in the movie and makes an impact.2012 also tends to be repetitive in few sequences which strongly give you a feeling of ""seen before"". The movie even reminded me one of the early 80's disaster movies called ""Earthquake"". In fact this time, Emmerich also seems to be inspired by his own masterpieces from the past. He surely surpasses them all in terms of mass destruction of the globe, but talking about the rich emotional quotient of those Hit movies, 2012 comparatively scores quite low. Emmerich, intentionally skips many important questions related to various countries and religions practiced by different people residing all over the globe.The main drawback of the movie is that even though it revolves around the concept of end of the world and its civilization, still it is unable to frighten you with the scary thought. The movie keeps on impressing you with its exceptional execution constantly but at the same time, fails to take you in on emotional grounds. In a nutshell, it's a film very rich in the Cinematography and Computer Graphics department, but is also quite unimpressive in its content.Interestingly the movie ends with a clear message to the World and its entire population. It simply says that ""Now is the time that we all have to unite together at the earliest or else the nature will unite us deliberately in its own destructive way.""",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Computer generated action sequences showing the end of the world.,"I expected a War of the Worlds sort of story and that's what I got.

What surprised me was the amount of wall to wall destruction and unrelenting pace of action.Lots of people died. Lots of the Earth was destroyed. Actual plot was scattered throughout in small doses. It was kind of predictable, most apocalypse movies tend to be a certain way. Especially when weaving a romance or family story line within the OMG of the world coming to an end.

The effects are there but the film has no real heart or tension to it,"The Mayans saw it coming long way off, but science has only just caught up as scientist Adrian Helmsley discovers that solar flares are having a physical impact on the Earth – heating up the core. It is getting worse and the only outcome will be the total collapse of land mass in just a few years. The politicians keep it quiet and begin planning for some form of survival of key people (and some from the private sector) while the remainder will have to be left to die as the species survives. As the physical signs of the end start increasing, one-time author and current limo driver Jackson Curtis is out with his children for the weekend and begins to put things together himself to get to a terrible conclusion.This was a big movie in the cinema and it continues to be so on video thanks to a massive advertising budget and like many others I was always going to watch it whether I fancied it or not. The film makes no bones about what it is and we are in on it from the very start. What we have here is another big budget disaster movie where lot of things are destroyed in detail before our eyes, while the narrative follows a small group of people as they try to stop/escape/survive the destruction. At its best this genre works by being thrilling and impacting but, when it is not working perfectly it is, well, 2012. The money is all up there to be seen and we have endless narrow escapes, lots of cars and buildings falling down and lots of spectacular forces of nature on display. Problem is though that all of it is computer generated and it is done in such a way that it lacks real heart or soul and never feels real. It also doesn't help that the narrow escapes and our heroes' ability to survive most thing stops us caring because there isn't really any genuine tension or excitement to be had.The plot has a stake in this too because it does what you expect from the very start. Of the main characters we focus on, the rich man was always going to get his while the ""normal"" family survive (along with the dog, which always has to survive in this sort of thing). The predictability of it hurts it but it is hurt moreover by what it is doing – OK so the normal family that we have been following are together and safe (thanks to the cruel and pointless removal of Jackson's ex's current partner) but they are the only ones who have not been powerful, ""important"" or rich enough to survive – we are meant to feel some sort of ""fairness"" as we watch the Russian Oligarch fall to his death but even if the film tries not to mention it – the arks are full of more like him while billions of others (which includes everyone watching this film) have been left to die. Asking me to feel things is not a good idea when you've got this scenario and the film would have done better to not have had an emotional core.The cast cannot do anything of real value in the face of the technological onslaught. Cusack is an OK normal guy but this just makes it less believable, not more. He is not strong enough as an actor to make me care about his character or his family though, but then nor is Peet or McCarthy (although Wire fans perhaps will not be too upset by his fate). Ejiofor is far too good an actor to be here while Platt, Newton and Glover have very little to do – although at least they are not embarrassing in the way that Harrelson is. It is not really an actor's film though so I should not be too hard on anyone in particular but they did just take their money and do the basics.2012 is not an awful film but it is a very base example of the genre. It delivers the effects and the noise but none of it has any heart or reason to be thrilled by it and the details of the plot is not only predictable but also rather irritating (the ""happy"" ending is that the rich and powerful survive while the normal overwhelmingly die). Make it an hour shorter then maybe it would be worth a look for spectacle but there is too little here to carry the near 3-hour running time.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Visually stunning...,"""2012"" is actually one of the best disaster movies to date in my opinion. Sure it had a very generic and predictable storyline, but the visual effects outshines all other disaster movies. And that alone makes it well-worth watching this movie.And as a disaster movie then impressive and realistic visuals are everything. And the special effects team were really delivering more than expected. It was almost as if the audience was right there in the mayhem, chaos and destruction.Story-wise, well, then ""2012"" was as every other disaster movie ever made. Mankind stares total annihilation in the face and stands triumphant against impossible odds. Yes, a very generic storyline and one that has been used countless other times in just about every other disaster movie.They had put together quite a good cast for the movie. Of course it was Woody Harrelson who outshines everyone with his performance as the oddball Charlie. But I will also say that John Cusack did quite well in this movie, despite being well out of his usual arena of movie genres. Oliver Platt was also quite good in this given role.I have seen this movie a couple of times already, and every time I am equally blown away by the impressive CGI effects that are shown in ""2012"".

A mean-spirited and profoundly stupid film with disaster set pieces almost too big to ignore,"2012 is Roland Emmerich's disaster movie to end all disaster movies. It is a melting pot of every disaster movie idea already imagined including his own. It doesn't promise the fate of the world hanging in the balance through global warming (The Day After Tomorrow, which this movie takes it's ending from) or alien invasion (Independence Day), but the unavoidable end of it. Period. But like all of Emmerich's movies he has taken a potentially thrilling, dramatically dire situation and turned it into a cheesy, popcorn, live-action cartoon where death and destruction stand along side 1D characters and terrible jokes.Still - and I hate Emmerich for making me say this - 2012 is almost too huge a movie to dismiss. The images in it are at times awesome (buildings collapsing, entire cities falling into the ocean) and - more interesting are the political discussions the movie has about the end of the world. The sacrifices that must be made to save a few at the expense of the many. How governments might be doing the right thing by keeping it under wraps. The premise is a frightening one and not even Emmerich's Crayola touch can diminish it entirely. In short, the movie does effectively convey a vision of the end of the world.It's also one of the more callous and mean-spirited disaster movies I've ever seen. When another movie would have humanity band together and face the threat, 2012's protagonist is all about me, me, me. It achieves the astonishing task of making John Cusack thoroughly unlikeable, even though the movie gives him kids to protect just so he doesn't look like the world's biggest coward. It's a bitter pill to swallow rooting for him to escape LA in a limo  while millions plunge to their death around him (a sequence that would make a great ride at Universal Studios, by the way, it's visually awesome). It's an even more bitter pill to root for him saving his family at the sacrifice of humanity in the finale. Ejiofor as the hopeful Helmsley easily steps into the protagonist role and becomes the heart and head of the movie. Who steps up and really keeps the movie together is Oliver Platt as the White House Chief of Staff who carries out Helmsley's plan to preserve a semblance of government across the world as it ends. The race to keep that plan in place is actually kind of exciting and the debate about how secret to keep it vs humanity's right to fight for their own survival is also intriguing.  I can't help but think 2012 could have been restructured for the better to be entirely about the political response to the end of the world and jettison Cusack's cheeseball, half-hearted fatherly redemption story entirely. The movie also makes a smart move in keeping under wraps the exact nature of the world's government's plan until then end, which makes for a fresh turn in the third act.The movie is worth a look for it's astonishing larger than life special effects set pieces, but it is profoundly stupid and you may hate yourself in the morning. And may I say simply that the ending is ridiculous. It's hard to shake the populast jokes, the tacky visual gags and even the cruel streak of the movie. Emmerich would make a pretty good horror director based on some of deaths he inflicts on the innocent here. There are a few character deaths in the 3rd act that are unnecessary and completely heartless in a way that slaps an ugly stink on the entire movie. Odd choices given that so many of 2012's characters think that the goodness of humanity is what will shine through in a catastrophic crisis. In Emmerich's vision, it's selfishness that shines through. Period. Which maybe a valid point but creates a schizophrenic tone in a movie so otherwise desperate for us to cheer the heroes. If the world does come to an end, I'm sure not following Roland Emmerich to safety.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not the worst by far...,"I'm sorry, but if you consider this to be an insult to human intelligence or the worst movie ever, you are sadly mistaken. Movies like these are not meant to be intelligent or sophisticated. Just take a look at the premise--2012 is not going to be the apocalypse, and not even modern day Mayans themselves believe in it. Emmerich (hopefully) just took the idea and decided to do something fun with it.What this is however, is a whimsical special effects bonanza meant to be taken lightly. The overload of close calls may be insulting to reality, but it does make for a lot of graphically impressive scenes. The shallowness of the main characters may make things dull, but it makes it far easier to take it lightly.

Absurd,"After seeing this movie I can almost picture the memo sent out by the studio with the requirements:Hire two random teens out of Facebook who like action movies. Use every possible cliché and stereotype from action movies from the last 30 years. Use every cent of the budget on CGI effects. Hire good actors who will do anything for a paycheck. And for the love of all that is Hollywood: do not come up with anything original.Seriously, this movie had every tired cliché in it and then some. The scenes are so unbelievable that the only people who will find this movie plausible are those that think that Star Wars was a documentary. An example being when Gordon is asked to fly a plane. He says, and I'm quoting here: ""I've only had a couple of lessons."" Now, the fact that once he gets airborne he makes Manfred on Richtofen look like someone who has never even so much as flown a kite is simply one of the hundreds of absurd things in this movie. But just when you think that there's no way they can top that joke then comes the two pilots flying the Antonov giant like it's an F-16. If this movie was marketed as a parody movie making fun of end of the world movies, it would have worked better.This movie is also a very clear character study. There's the good guy, the obvious bad guy and each character gets... well, pretty much what they've deserved and gotten in every action movie of the past 30 years. Woody Harrelson does his best Crispin Glover in this, which, again, works great as a comedy. There was zero imagination regarding the characters in this movie, it was so scarily predictable. Additionally, each scene tries to outdo the previous one and it just becomes a big, gigantic joke. I was laughing hysterically at all the ""tearjerker"" scenes of people about to die because they were so trite and had been done much better in movies before this one.

They also provide a cliché story of his family and wife who are divorced, the main character becoming the superhero of it all despite the destruction of the whole world how could he possible dodge death 10000 times to save the human race and what do you know he gets his wife back. This movie provided a thin plot which was none the less boring, while i was watching this it was like sitting there like a dog chasing his tail... endless. This movie shows nothing about society or contemporary science behind the actual theory of 2012. If i were you avoid watching you will be sadly disappointed.

Yes... we were warned... About how crappy this movie would be!,"2012... the number of people that had to see the movie before the public finally realized that it sucked. It's a shame because Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich can't direct action scenes to save their lives, and decided instead to write the movie to utilize every disaster movie cliché in the book since it was written in the 70's with the likes of ""Earthquake"" and ""Airport"". It's a cheesy story that you've seen before. There are cheesy death scenes where after somebody dies they look at the sky and yell ""MENDOZAAAAAA!!!!!"". Yes, it is that bad. This movie is so bad that even rednecks think this is way over the top. If Liberace were alive, he would say ""This is the gayest thing I've ever seen... and my house is covered in mirrors!"". Anyways, please skip it. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich are dried up hacks who don't know how to do anything but make disaster movies, which honestly takes a bare minimum of talent.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Special effects were great, movie wasn't","The CGI in 2012 was excellent, but it was way overdone. The special effects draw attention to themselves and distract you from the storyline, which could have been salvageable if it had been executed better.It's impossible to get engrossed in the film. The action sequences are so unbelievable that your intelligence is insulted, and the acting is so unrealistic that you can't relate to any of the characters. Even though there are a lot of fancy special effects to look at, it's a boring movie because the characters are so obviously fictional that you just don't care if they live or die. In short, it's an awful movie with excellent special effects.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It's the end of the world, but not the end of movie-making, as some would speculate...","""2012"" is the 2009 disaster epic from the ""master of disaster"" Roland Emmerich (""Independece Day"" - his best film, in my opinion; ""Godzilla""; and ""The Day After Tomorrow""). Whether you love him or loathe him, ""2012"" is his disaster epic, with plenty of spectacular scenes of destruction, a determined band of survivors (led by John Cusack as struggling writer Jackson Curtis) trying to live through the end of the world. Some scientific babble about the sun's rays heating up the Earth's core and loosening up the Earth's tectonic plates and shifting the poles has sped up doomsday from its predicted date (by the Mayans) of 12-21-12 to some time during the summer of 2012. Scenes of destruction are nothing new in movies like this. But what makes it all so very different is that the destruction on the scale as presented in ""2012"" is unprecedented in the movies. The scenes of mega-tsunamis engulfing Washington, D.C., and India, the super-volcano underneath Yellowstone National Park suddenly erupting, and Los Angeles (and pretty much the entire West Coast falling into the Pacific Ocean) are not only spectacular and awesome to look at, but are also harrowing and horrifying. I'm not a fan of the disaster movie genre, but the scenes of such mass death and destruction in ""2012"" are so unusually affecting and horrifying that I actually had a hard time watching it, but I couldn't look away. I don't know if that was intended or not by Emmerich, but if he wanted to scare the hell out of the audience, I think that in my case he succeeded in shaking me to my emotional core, and wondering if this is what the end of the world will really look like. While I don't think the world will end on 12-21-12 - I've read enough articles and discussions on the matter to convince me otherwise - there is no question, however, that ""2012"" may very well be the disaster epic of the disaster movie genre.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bloody awful,"All of the people raving on here about what a brilliant movie this is had to be paid to do so. What a perfectly, wretchedly awful piece of tripe. There was no acting to speak of and this only goes to show that CGI does not a good movie make. (One reviewer compared the action sequences to the Dukes of Hazzard and I agree; I kept waiting for the car to freeze midair with fallen leaves trailing behind it and Waylon Jennings to do his voice-over.) It seems that all Hollywood has to offer is poorly done remakes and special effects driven garbage like this. (Start watching foreign films; you'll be astounded to see real acting!) My only consolation is that I saw it for free on one of my movie channels and didn't waste a Netflix rental or money on a movie ticket. For those of you who advocate leaving your brain at home to go enjoy something like this, might I suggest staying in to watch ShamWow and Slap Chop infomercials with Vince. Those you don't have to pay for, at least. Save yourselves and avoid this movie at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Can we have a film without an AGENDA???,"I mean FFS.Let me say that again: F F S I go to the movies to be entertained and NOT FOR POLITICAL AGENDA and COMMENTARY by some obtuse twit that thinks because he can write a formula script cold to the letter, that he is somehow qualified as a political genius too.I am sick of this. If I want political commentary, I am bombarded by it day-in, day-out. It is inescapable and becoming more shrill every *@*&^) day.If it starred Bill Maher or Anne Coulter then SHAME ON ME for complaining. This was supposed to be a blockbuster actioner. A cheap thrill.

Did you fancy yourself an intellectual? I laugh at your insignificance. I might also point out that in pursuing a cheap and predictable projectile-vomiting excuse for -sly- (?) jabs to demonstrate your moral superiority, you reduced a text-book example of injury and redemption into an insult for spending $9.50 that would have served better as a flaming motion background.In other words, next time, I find myself contemplating one of your 'movies', I will just take a $10 bill and set it on fire and film it.

"Not quite the end of the world, but more than likely the end of Roland Emmerich's career","There are some movies that should just really not be made. 2012 isn't one of those, but its incredibly awful execution really makes you wish otherwise. What was a good idea (though it was the same good idea we saw in Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow... and so many other films of this nature) had potential. There was a lot of money behind this thing, obviously, but it would appear that all this money went towards the effects. The effects are stellar for the most part, but are so over done that you truly feel the extent to which the filmmakers failed in every other way. The plot is dumb, the acting, with the notable exception of Woody Harrelson playing... himself, is hard to watch, and the effects, believe it or not, are not worth it. I say this not because they were anything short of amazing, but because there is so much effect that you find yourself sick of it. It's not always easy to sit through a brainless movie without good effects. But it's quite difficult to sit through a near 3-hour movie with only effects. The film had nothing else to offer. The attempts to ask moral and ethical question are skewed and ineffective. The characters are so expendable, as you will quickly discover, that it's nearly impossible to care about them. And the few characters that you do end up caring about are the ones that the filmmakers seemed to care the least about, and so they get very little screen time. The camera work is alright at times, though there are a few awkward switches between techniques.If you, however, are only looking for a way to kill three hours, and you have not seen a lot of movies like this before, perhaps 2012 is for you. If you're looking for anything more to this film, though, you will likely be thoroughly disappointed. Don't spend 10 dollars on this, rent it on DVD, watch it on a big HD screen and huff a lot of propane, and this movie will be your favorite film of all time.It is a bit sad, because I must say that Emmerich's films in the past, particularly Independence Day, were quite good. This one just isn't.Hopefully Hollywood will figure out that bigger budget isn't always better movie... someday. For now, let us sit back and wait to see if James Cameron follows in Roland Emmerich's footsteps with his Avatar film.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Rubbish,"Tonight I went along to see this, the new Roland Emmerlich disaster epic 2012. It starts well enough in 2009, with shots of planets in our solar system lining up (the scale is all wrong) and a nice close-up of the sun. Then we're inside an Indian neutrino detector, and from here 2012 goes careening off the rails. You see, prompted by the alignment of the planets, the sun starts spewing out solar flares that contain, ummm, ""mutated neutrinos"". These particles somehow begin to heat up the Earth's core just as water heats up in a microwave oven. Yep, this is how it's explained in the exposition! Cut to three years later and the Earth's crust is going berserk, just like the screenplay. Look, the film is not that bad, really. I mean, it didn't make me want to drink bleach or anything like that. What you've got is one reel (20 mins) of set-up followed by a string of crazy cliffhanger escapes. John Cusack's in it, trying to patch up his broken marriage to Amanda Peet, and who can blame him? So that's interesting. California and Yosemite National Park are both destroyed with amazing photo-realistic SFX (remember, Emmerlich brought us that photo-realistic woolly mammoth stampede in 10,000 BC). Also, the third act has some great visuals but also the worst Touching Hollywood Moments we've seen since, well, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. Additionally, there's too many cringe-worthy speeches by assorted protagonists – not enough of them die horribly. That said, 2012 kept my suburban audience of plumbers, single mums, emos, and Japanese students entertained with its sheer excess; this punter just never wants to see it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Loved Almost Every Minute Of It!,"Yes it has flaws 100% undeniable. But. It does the 1 thing a disaster movie must do.

"Not Bad, Well Worth Seeing...","I've taken the time to write a number of reviews here. This was usually because I thought a film was so bad that I just felt compelled to share my opinions. My comment today is quite the contrary.I have to say that this is one of few films that I have liked in recent past. It wasn't the greatest I've ever seen, and many of the escape scenes were highly implausible. However, what this film did do was keep me on the edge of my seat. Action and suspense were the true highlights here.Everybody played their role well. There were a few characters that I might have picked differently for their parts. But again, not bad.Effects were spectacular. The end of the world looked quite real. As morbid as that might sound, the effects were great. This is one time I can't complain too much about CGI.Some of the events were a little too convenient or again implausible. But I repeat, not bad. It's expected that with a film like this, imagination needs to stretch a little bit to work in the dramatics. I believe that this film has just about all the right ingredients to make it worth while.One thing here, and I have to say that I appreciated this... Blood and guts were not the focus of this work. If you expect to see a lot of death and dismemberment with blood all around, you are in for a let down. You won't see much of the carnage up close in this film. The focus here is more on the survival of the main characters and civilization along with a race against the clock.So all in all, I give this film a rating of 7/10. I'd see it again and will be awaiting its release on DVD. Hopefully it's only fiction!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Waste of money,"How is it possible to make such a terrible movie with such a big budget? It really annoys me that a lot of directors these days think it suffices to make an excellent trailer just so that people will come to the cinema. Or did this guy actually think he was making a master-peace? Sure the 'special-effects' were great, although after seeing Avatar it's obvious that even in that area it wasn't top of the line. The plot is so lame, predictable and the acting is terrible. I had no feeling with any of the main characters and was actually hoping they'd all die by the end of the movie.

CA going down in chunks,"Emmerich really seems to be in love with runways collapsing behind airplanes taking off. We get this three times in the movie. Probably once would have been OK. Same with buildings on precipices so narrow due to everything around having collapsed a mile deep, that it is structurally impossible.But of course this is a disaster flick, not a documentary. So we can't expect the slightest physical accuracy in megavolcano explosions, continental shelf sinking into the ocean, etc.If you just hit the 'suspension of disbelief button' and get into the non-stop disaster action, the movie delivers pretty well, hence a 6/10. Not worth seeing more than once, but with a beer in hand, it can while an evening away. And Woody Harrelson is always great as the insane guy.Oddly, the 'bad guy,' played by Oliver Platt is actually right: you do not open the slowly operating hydraulic door of a humanity-saving ark a couple of minutes before doom, thereby endangering humanity's survival; you do not, like Danny Glover's US President, dramatically remain on the White House lawn while a tidal wave sends an aircraft carrier tumbling your way. Hurray to Platt for being the only person with common sense and the courage to make very hard decisions in this film. That was rather odd: most films at least manage to make me root for the hero and against the villain, but not here.Fortunately, neutrinos are not that bad in real life, even when the solar flares get big.

"A Complete waste of Money, Time and Effort","I think it is about time Roland Emmerich retired from making films.

The entire length of this film I was stunned, sitting there in the theater watching this latest baby from Hollywood that really should have just been aborted. The main problem with it is: A. Horrible, boring, and predictable plotting. B. Utterly disgusting and stupid dialog that makes screenwriters cringe everywhere, worldwide. c.

Hold onto your seat its going to be a bumpy ride!!!,"I am a great lover of disaster movies and until now thought that this generations brand of disaster movie didn't hold a candle to the 1970/Irwin Allen run of them - Posiedon Adventure/Earthquake/Towering Inferno. Sure there had been a few that were not bad, independence day/the day after tomorrow/ Armageddon but nothing earth shattering... Boy am I eating my words. This movie was in my opinion, the Best disaster movie I have ever seen. I give it a 9.5/10. I would have given it a 10 if Chiwetel Ejiofor had of punched Oliver Platt! Boy did he deserve it!! With a fantastic cast, including Danny Glover, John Cusack - who incidentally was awesome in this role, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt, and Woody Harrelson playing Charlie Frost, end of the world radio announcer and totally nuts, and h plays him so well, and someone I had never heard of before, Chiwetel Ejiofor, who played the major scientist of the piece. Not to forget the rest of the awesome cast, each of them adding to the layers of the storytelling. The movie was kept rolling along by telling the stories of several independent characters all facing the end of the world as we know it. The graphics were by far the best character of the movie and if you saw the trailer you would get just a hint of how exciting it is. I sat down at the start and said to my mom that if what we had seen in the trailer was all we were going to get when it came to excitement i would be very disappointed. Well I all the excitement I could handle.... and more! The story spent the first hour setting the premise for the film.... the world was ending... and the last hour and a half was spent holding on to my seat, squealing, ducking and weaving in the times of action, crying at the more poignant moments, getting angry at others, as we followed the stories of the characters. I think this movies stirred up just about every type of emotion. It was awesome. I have no doubt i will go see it again. Do yourself a favor and watch it on the big screen! Don't waste your time waiting for video, or watching it on the small screen. This Has to be seen on the big screen, with the big sound. It adds to the movies hugeness as much as everything else.

While this is an ending that many viewers have come to expect, for me personally, it feels too clichéd and doesn't fit with the theme of total destruction that has been built up throughout the movie.A more tragic ending, where most or even all of the main characters sacrifice their lives, would have had a much greater impact on the audience.

So much lost potential.,"This movie had the potential to be one of the greatest, if maybe not , the greatest apocalyptic movie of all time. It had all the prepositions, especially the story it was based on, since everyone in that period of time was starting to worry about the D-day and what the Mayans said about the year 2012- the year when the world and our existence would be destroyed. It had a huge budget, the visuals were meant to be and are AMAZING, crazy good, as I would like to say eye-watering, BUT, at some moments, they were used to much, almost every 3 minutes which led to the movie losing depth, losing rhythm, losing logic. The casting choice was also mistaken pretty bad, especially with the leading role John Cusack, who, altho is one of the finest actors, brought to much comedy, without taking any matter seriously, which is not logical at any means, since the ground below him is dissapearing while he is making jokes about it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Burst of Screaming Special Effects,"15 January 2010. 2012 stretches believability to the limit with a multitude of barely survival scenes, especially in the middle of this long disaster action thriller movie. The specials effects rival those of THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW (2004) which was to be expected at some point and the multitude of explosive disaster sequences and new disaster visuals and perspectives is impressive. The storyline seems credible if not convincing, except perhaps how the movie actual ends which seems to be over the top. For the most part the story is predictable though at times takes some care for attempts at substantive intellectual stabs, more than some disaster movies though not quite as convincing as THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. Overall, the movie was long, almost too long, almost became boring in places, but it was entertaining and provided thrills and action. An above average disaster movie that continues to use special effects pushing the envelope, though not quite there yet, but getting closer and closer. Some really, truly fascinating visuals in this movie. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worst Movie of 2009,This is indeed the worst movie of 2009. The only thing going for this film is the special effects and even those get tiring after an hour. There is no logic used in this film...everything thing happens just because the director and writer want it to happen. Yellowstone Park is only 8 hours away from Los Angeles...everyone one on the east coast is calm while the entire Pacific coast has met unbelievable disaster...cell phones still work even though most of the world is destroyed...our hero constantly outruns every disaster that is facing him. Nothing is believable in this film. And it is 2 1/2 hours long! There are several subplots that could have easily been deleted from the film to make it 90 minutes. Nothing makes sense in this movie. The director of this movie should never be allowed to make another movie!!!,2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
two and half hours of entertainment,"I have just seen the film and couldn't stop myself from writing this review. I heard many people saying that this film is a waste and it is just trying to give a wrong impression to the audience about the end of the world. i too don't believe in this whole thing, but still, why do we go for a movie? to expect some entertainment. isn't it? and i assure you of it.The visual effects are at their best. this stands next to lord of the rings in that category. apart from the graphic elements, the way the director brought together all the characters under one shed is good. he was successful in showing the love between parent and child, lovers.In the end, i want to say only one thing.

Don't waste your money seeing this movie,The script was unbelievably corny. The cast of players were 'pretending' not acting.They would struggle to get a part on anyone of the Soaps the acting was so bad.The Director should be restricted to making porno's.Technically the movie was also a great disappointment with substandard CGI and very easily I was able to pick where the CGI overlapped the real time movie scene.Sound also echoed in some parts. Staging of the movie would have us believe that the Shuttle loaded up with nuclear war head was launched by four people in a small room.I was unable to endure the movie beyond half way and I walked out.

Not quite so unbelievable,"A bit odd viewing this movie in 2012 after experiencing the Washington Monument (and my apartment building) swaying and sustaining damage during last year's earthquake and then the cruise ship tipping over last month off the coast of Italy.At times I thought I was tuned into the weather channel.With the recent tsunamis this movie doesn't have quite the unbelievable effect it would have had when I was growing up decades ago.I like all the actors and have appreciated their work in the past, but this doesn't seem to have the continuity or as much of a plot.

Crevasses open up in the earth just behind the fleeing protagonists.  For hours.,"Yep, that's the movie. Science very much like that in ""The Day After Tomorrow"", which was very, very, very, very terrible. Really terrible. Continents move ""23 degrees"" in a matter of hours without causing any apparent negative consequences for the inhabitants. Fortunately, no character development is necessary, because there's no time for it between the fleeing and the crumbling. Then when the end of the story finally comes, they can't figure out how to end it for another 20 minutes.I wish I understood why IMDb thinks a review does not count unless it has ten lines.

Destructions of biblical scale,"Greetings from Lithuania.""2012"" is a very solid entry into disaster movies genre. It has everything that one would like to have: great special effects, tons of action, larger than life main characters and destructions on a biblical scale. Hey, it's surely isn't the best picture of the year, but it does exactly what it promises, entertains us by showing end of the world and 2 dimensional characters trying to survive it.

Critically hated but very entertaining.,A lot of people have seemed to hate this movie but if you just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride its actually very enjoyable. It is very intense and epic in every way. John Cusack does a good job as well does the rest of the cast. Some of the parts are in this movie are pretty silly but its still fun.This movie is about a man who starts hearing about how the world is going to end. At first he does not believe it but starts to see signs and then as the beginning of the end of the world starts to happen he struggles to keep him and his family safe.This movie has a really low rating on this website but it is actually pretty entertaining.

"I'm one of those few ""idiots"" who liked and enjoyed this movie!","Firstly some qualifications for this review, and some may hate it. I'm not a conspiracy theorist! I didn't believe any of the 2012 theories. I wasn't expecting this to be some onscreen representation or vindication of the lunatic fringe. Secondly, i'm not a fan of all such disaster, over-the-top Roland Emmerich movies. There were many i thought were really bad and hated. But thirdly, i did NOT watch this movie hoping to debunk the 2012 end of the world mayan prophecies and calling it out for its stupidity if the movie did support that!I watched this movie i think in a very different way. As science fiction disaster movie. Ok, it remains of course a popcorn flick. Scientifically and philosophically, it isn't deep and profound! There are no stand out performances in acting and nothing particularly memorable. Thematically, it was quite simple. There were the usual tropes and ideas of hope, survival, life, sacrifice and friendship, but they were surprising toned down and none of it was particularly emphasised. But as i will come on to say, this actually helped the movie!So why did i like it, and thinks it warrants another watch and perhaps continual rewatches? Firstly, because it was watchable! It didn't take its themes too seriously (though it may have tried), and that the tone was far more mellow. Why do i say this? It was more a survival movie, than ""we save the day"" movie. Indeed, there was no real hero! Because of this, no part of this movie felt forced, overdone, cheesy, or jingoist, unlike Independence Day and Day After Tomorrow. One example of this is the presidential speech made by Danny Glover. It was actually cut short. Emmerich could have done a whole silly ID speech, but he chose not to and this created a sense of realism.Secondly, the acting though not sublime or profound, wasn't actually bad. Everyone played their character well. I'm not sure if this was conscious and perhaps because of the unintentional deemphasis, there was little overacting or personal drama. There were some stereotyping, but it was surprising tame and well-handled. Chiwetel Ejiofor was a diligent scientist. Believable and not a hero. John Cusack was just a normal family man. The Russians were a little more standard Hollywood, but it can be overlooked. The Tibetan monks were spiritual (i wonder whether that monastery on the himalayas existed!), but again it was tame.Thirdly though, and this is personal, i think the premise does work and steps into interesting! Why? Without consideration of scientifically accuracy (none whatsoever!), I think the idea of global catastrophe as depicted in the movie is much more believable. Its works far better than say an earthquake, or freak weather like in The Day After Tomorrow. We know that those weather patterns and earthquakes won't happen the way they are depicted. They are borderline comical! Now, will something like 2012 happen? Again, with no consideration of science...probably not! We know that geological processes are slow. Just as you can't grow an arm in 5 seconds, the earth won't just explode. BUT i guarantee you a science buff has asked the question, ""what if the Earth suddenly stopped spinning""! An exceedingly rare geological event will have almost the effects portrayed in the movie! And 2012 does do this! Not brilliantly or in a profound way, but it does! It does it in remarkably evenly handled way and one that is intentionally global in scope. It is also done commanding Emmerich's usual resources in CGI, which have never been bad!So i would argue that this movie is one of those that were good and enjoyable (possibly unintentionally) for me. I do have misgivings with regards to those silly references to the Mayan prophecies. Those should've be more coincidental and comical. Also, the stereotypes give the movie a mundane, routine appearance. But i maintain, the movie isn't half bad and can be an interesting experience!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What a waste,"Talk about wasting money, talent and resources. This movie just proves that although Emmerich has all the money in world, and top notch special effects at his disposal, he goes and mess it up by making 2012. Yes Im sure it will be a blockbuster, people around the world will go see this and the movie may even make a serious profit, and Hollywwod will praise Emmerich for making so much money...but thats about it. As far as the movie is concerned, its just awful. Great effects, but so exaggerated. Great actors, but no story. Any child could of made 2012. I'm not gonna complain about the $10 I wasted, but i'll complain about the effort it took me to get out of my comfy home, go to the movies, park the car, waste another 10$ on candy, sit through 2 hours of crap, back in the car and home.

Let's Hope the Future Isn't As Bad As This Film,"2012 (2009)* 1/2 (out of 4)The disaster genre is one of my guilty pleasures and it's funny to think that these films have been around since the 1920s. It's rather amazing that the ones made eight-plus years ago are the same that came in the 1970s and they continued in 2009. What we get are dumb stories with not-so-interesting people, dazzling special effects and a message of sticking together and fighting for your life. We could mention SAN FRANCISCO, EARTHQUAKE, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and countless others that followed but if you took the silly or unbelievable moments in any of those films and put them together you still wouldn't come close to the dumbness of this films opening hour. The sad thing is that after this dumb hour we still have 90-minutes of dumbness to follow. The only storyline has the world coming to an end with massive earthquakes, volcano eruptions, typhoons and other types of disasters and it's up to a loving father (John Cusack) to make sure that his ex-wife and two kids get aboard a ship that's going to allow certain people to live. OK, I didn't go into this movie expecting some sort of hard-hitting drama but when everything you see is completely stupid then there's really no way to have any sort of emotional connection to what you're watching. Like most disaster movies, you get a boring opening where we're given time to get to know the characters yet we never really have to get to know them because they're always the same. Dad Cusack is obviously being overlooked by the kids due to the great stepfather. We have the nerdy character who wants to save humanity. We have the obnoxious rich guy who only cares for himself. We have the lone nut (Woody Harrelson) who ""sees"" all of it coming.There wasn't a single scenario here that I believed and the screenplay is perhaps one of the worst I've ever come across and I watch quite a few movies. The amount of dumbness with incredibly stupid speeches or extremely bad action set ups are just annoying after a while and it all gets off to an incredibly bad start when the first major action scene has Cusack in a limo driving through all of this destruction. Of course, millions and millions of people die yet Cusack manages to get through all of this. Why? No logic is given as it just happens to keep the movie going. Each action scene just keeps getting dumber and dumber, which leads us to the final half-hour where this ship to the future is suppose to be helping everyone and then we have the greedy, evil character coming out and the speech about how we need to go into the future. What's even stranger is why on Earth they needed this thing to run over 150-minutes, which is at least twenty-minutes too long. There are so many characters here that many of them could have been cut out and we wouldn't miss a thing. This would have helped but cutting the running time down since we didn't really get to know any of them anyways. As usual, we get an all star cast with not only Cusack and Harrelson but also Amanda Peet, Danny Glover, Oliver Platt, Chiwetel Ejiofor and many others.Yes, this was meant to be nothing more than a popcorn movie but I need a little common sense with everything. This movie has none of that and we've seen destruction like this in countless other movies so there's nothing new here and once again we're just going down a road we've seen many, many times before. The CGI effects aren't any better. The obvious fakeness of them make we miss what we got in the 70s. At a point I just finally gave up and began laughing at pretty much everything that was going on. That's not something you want to be doing during a film where billions of people are being killed.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Entertaining non-minded funny ""catastrophy"" movie...","This was like a weird thing to do watching 'cause it was 18.12.2012 ..Humorlously I don't really care about catastrophe-movies never did and so.This one was still very funny from the beginning, entertaining, didn't have to use brains (i took this as sleeping movie..) somehow i managed to watch this throughout from beginning to end.Funny acting like everyone is ""whoa whoops"" like you slipped on floors or something when world is coming to an end, I laughed out loud. I guess that was mainly the idea ;) And the Mayans story, everybody knows the legend ..The minuses: 1) TOO long. 2) first part of the movie was real funny and get me laughing a lot but then like director was changed the movie entered to more ""serious"" theme and that didn't quite fit in this humorous set. 3) Totally illogical :D .. but there also comes PLUS with it, this beats titanic lol .. you know what i mean if you watch this. Titanic was based on true happenings though.So I guess 7/10 is not bad or so.

Gorgeous visuals but lacks the soul,"I remember the days prior to its release when people were terrified of the plausibility of an apocalypse, the end of the world as we know it.A multitude of ideas, or should I say, conspiracy theories regarding Mayan people and Nostradamus predictions, were perpetually floating around the internet, and those words led the world to believe that, yes, 2012 is when our beloved earth will come to an end.All this uproar immensely helped market the movie, resulting in a handsome box office return (Grossing a gigantic $769 million worldwide).Now the question is, did the film deserve this enormous success? Well, that's up for debate!As far as its visuals and presentation go, it shall be up there with the best apocalyptic movies. But when you consider the story, it does not perform to the same extent.Unlike other great disaster movies, it lacks that finesse, lacks that connection that binds the off-screen audience to the on-screen personalities, consequently resulting in a tale where we can't feel the essential emotions; thus, we mostly don't care.Yes, it's an entertaining ride, and people would enjoy it, but I'm certain not many would think back to it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
At half-time I wanted to go shopping,"You know something? It's like this: Me and my wife wanted to get a present for her parents' anniversary, so we went to the mall. We decided on the movie first, 'cause we had got there too late, it was starting in half an hour. We said, we'll get the present afterwards... Get this: the room was almost booked, but half of them were reservations, so we thought we'll wait to see if they'll come in time, to pick up their tickets. Some of them didn't, so we were as happy as kids because we knew we were going to sit in the back, where the best viewing conditions are. So... The review... Well... The next morning I told my friends 'Don't event dare to ask!'. I think I would've been the only damn person on this planet, that would've swear at the movie, hadn't been for my wife!!! At about half-time I said to her 'You know, we could go right now, and buy that present... I can't take this anymore!' And she really took her time, and evaluated what I said. There were some idiots on our left who were continuously laughing at the movie, who suddenly didn't seem the eternal idiotic spectators anymore, that always laugh when there's no reason to! Even I was almost laughing at almost each damn scene! I'm so sorry I payed for it! But I tell you, it's a scam! The picture will take the trip around the world, and will make so much money on behalf of us, the idiots! ... And we thought that action movies will be the only movies we were going to watch in a theater, from now on... Well... I guess, not even that genre is worth it anymore. I mean, come on!!! The only good actor was that damn dog of Natasha, or whatever her name was! And, yes! The final part, where the arks come in. The entire view of the huge caves in the mountain, where they were being built, that was fabulous! And people's will to do anything, in order to save themselves. It was epic! But that's it! Just for the info, I happen to like aircraft, and know just about anything concerning them. And I know that the Antonov 225 is the largest aircraft flying at this moment on Earth, but I can tell you that AN 225 seemed to be able to do aerobatics that only small Cessnas are!!! If one loses control of the AN 225, it would take some 6-7 kms height, before he could rise its nose again, not some 400 metres, as it looked quite clearly in the images where the earth was tearing apart, and the plane had somehow entered beneath its surface level. Let's be serious, man! There's no way, such a huge wave could ever cross India, and reach the Himalayas! There's no way, such a huge wave could ever form itself!!! Yes, it takes an earthquake, thus a continuous movement, for a tsunami to form. But for a 5 mile high tsunami... It would need some 10s of thousands of kms before it could reach that height. And the distance between the center of the Indian Ocean and Mt. Everest is about, I think, 4-5000 kms. It's outrageous! I'm only hoping some actors within this movie won't commit suicide...

Entertainment for the brain-dead masses,"In Roland Emmerich's latest film, the world is coming to an end just as the ancient civilization of the Mayans predicted. In their famous calendar the world ends in 2012 due to a global cataclysm.And that's exactly what happens in this film. Small signs start to show in 2009 and it all happens in full force by the 21 of December of 2012. The earth starts to crumble,cities collapse,the sea emerges,tsunamis start to form,volcanoes erupt, all kinds of natural disasters you can think of. And that is pretty much the story here. In the middle of all this is Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), the everyday man who is trying to save his loved ones, his ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and their two young kids. But to be honest, who cares? The central point of the movie is the on going disaster and therefor the characters are paper-thin and uninteresting. Now,obviously the cgi is good and the movie is all about the eye candy but the action is very silly,over the top and implausible.How many times can the main characters fly between falling buildings without getting hit?? How many coincidences and luck-outs does this boring broken family have? It doesn't help that with the exception of Amanda Peet who looked genuinely afraid and concerned, all the other actors did a terrible, let me re-enforce that, TERRIBLE job. John Cusack seemed completely lost and his dialog was as sappy as it can get, Danny Glover's portrayal of an American President was cringe-worthy ,Chiwetel Ejiofor who played Adrian Helmsley, the geologist helping the white house, was clearly an actor acting if you know what I mean, Thandie Newton( she played the President's daughter) was probably one of the worst despite her having the least lines and Hoody Harrelson failed completely at being the comedy relief. In fact, there shouldn't even exist a comedy relief at all; this is the end of the world and the writers are trying to make us laugh and break the tension? It just makes impossible for someone to take the film seriously. Also the film was painfully long, they could have easily cut 30 minutes of footage and it would have made for a better film. If you want to see a visual spectacle, then 2012 is definitely for you, if you're looking for something else( which most people are I hope) skip it.

2012 - The ultimate disaster movie,"The best disaster movie I've seen in many years. The special effects are spectacular and breathtaking. The acting is first-rate from John Cusack to Danny Glover. The movie's about a family who is trying to escape from the cataclysm. The cameo of Woody Harrelson is hilarious. The production of the movie is top-notch. The story is your basic end-of- the-world chaos.The Earth's crusts are shifting - causing earthquakes and volcano eruptions on a global scale, followed by unfriendly tsunami waves. As indicated earlier, a main reason the film worked for me was the emotional connection I felt towards some of the characters. The cast here is top notch, including some recognizable actors like Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Danny Glover, Oliver Platt, Amanda Peet - and of course, John Cusack.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's the end of the world as we know it,"Roland Emmerich's ""2012"" is the latest in a long line of apocalyptic popcorn flicks with more reliance on special effects than on story. Here, major problems with the heat of the earth's core threaten to bring about cataclysmic earthquakes and related disasters. Naturally, world governments have decided to keep a lid on the problem until it's too late for the common man to do anything about it (though a few conspiracy theorists know the score). With this backdrop, the film focuses on a family trying their best to escape the mayhem.The cast isn't bad, considering the number of recognizable actors present. Chiwetel Ejiofor & Oliver Platt deliver the best performances but it's clear that the special effects wizards are the real stars of the show. The effects are indeed striking though they later take a back seat to the human drama. That wouldn't have been such a concern if the story was truly compelling instead of rehashing the usual 'struggle for survival' plot points (eg. self-serving actions for some, pleas for humanity for others, etc...).Emmerich's bombastic style is well-suited to the subject matter but the film's bloated runtime may tax the patience of some viewers. While the effects may be worthy of Oscar consideration there's nothing else about the film that's exceptional. The bottom line is that ""2012"" is a competent special effects extravaganza which offers little to distinguish it from others of its type.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Utterly disappointing,"Being a sucker for apocalyptic films, I had high expectations towards this movie. The catchphrase ""is the end of the world as we knew it"" was there, so was the flawless CGI stuff. But once the characters start talking, you'll realize what to expect of the whole thing: clichés, moralist speeches, USA in the top of the world, pseudo-dramatic hero performances, and lots of special effects. By now you're already taking the whole picture. Yes, apparently ""Hollywood"" can't get enough of touching people's heart with great style (3D FTW!!!!!!), instead of plot twists, character evolution or complex dialogues, that IMO, would give at least, something to think about after watching the movie. Throughout the movie, I got blockbusters like Titanic, The Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day, Armageddon and War of the Worlds, popping in my mind, thus there's nothing really new here. The acting is cold, sure John Cusack, Danny Glover and the rest of the crew know how to act, however I think they real fail to portrait the emotions such film would ask for. In the end, I felt that only the 3D animations of the world collapsing were worth watching.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Two movies in one, one really dumb, the other not so bad","First of all, it's January 2021 and my home country Croatia was recently hit with numerous earthquakes, one really devastating (6.4). Add to that the pandemic of 2020 of course and this movie came to me as a fresh breeze. It's silly and dumbish, the cgi is not even that cool anymore, but in general it is entertaining and fun.
The best thing about it is actually that it's a patchwork of two movies, first part is dumb as hell, the scenes of devastation are completely illogical, but the actors and director did a great job nonetheless. And it has Woody Harleson.
The second part is plain awesome, put aside some other illogical choices and stuff. There is humour, bravery, consideration, heroics, leadership, unity, good visual effects and great scenes.

There's no plot and character development whatsoever, and the movie is bogged down by nothing but more and more special fx.Now, I love special fx. Heck.

Would've been much better if most actors wouldn't acted terribly.,"You can't make a real good movie by completely focusing on only one department, you have to focus on all departments (at least the important once) to make a real good movie. Thankfully in this movie's case Roland Emmerich did focus on more than one department including visual effects and screenplay but there is one important department I think Roland Emmerich didn't focus on or didn't focus enough and that department is the acting department.Except John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt, Woody Harrelson and Danny Glover, actors of this movie didn't do a good job as a matter of fact many of them did a terrible job. Actors including Chiwetel Ejiofor and Thandie Newton looked like that they came unprepared or they need supervision. In short only senior actors who can act good without supervision acted good in this movie.Except Chin Han foreign actors also didn't acted good as a matter of fact actors who played Indian and European acted terribly. When your movie feature a global crisis and global effort to solve it and to make it look like real you have to feature foreign countries and foreign people. But you can't cast any foreign actor to play a foreigner, you have to cast a good foreign actor to play a foreigner, if you can't find a good foreign actor you can cast an actor from your own industry to play a foreigner with the help of some make-up. Its not even necessary to include a foreign role you can still make it look like a global effort (i.e. an American scientist working in India).This movie has a good screenplay, visual effects are great and direction is somehow good too but acting by most actors let me down.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

They were on a plane for half the movie and the other half they were saying goodbye to their loved ones over the phone; just garbage. I don't even want to waste any more of my time writing about this movie. I expected more from this movie, but this was just another attempt by Hollywood to capitalize off of people's potential fears.

Amazing CGI and a script so cheesy and acting to go with it makes this a so bad it's good film.,"2012 I have been looking forward to for a while and suffice to say Roland Emerich delivers again though it's just not on the same level as Independence Day or The Day After Tomorrow as 2012 when it comes to the characters and the dialogue was very cheesy indeed and the acting was terrible (though the best performance I thought was Danny Glover who was OK) and wasn't on par with Emmerich's other films I've just mentioned.But the fact that it is so cheesy with all the usual disaster movie clichés is what made the film so entertaining as it was very funny like when Cusack's kid says to Yuri a Russian guy ""That's a big plane"" and he replies ""It's Russian!"" had me shouting with laughter. 2012 was a so bad it's good movie. Don't expect deep characterisation or an inventive script or even great acting because you won't get it. I don't think that was Emmerich's intention of comic relief however. It just sub-stained itself at the length of 2hrs and 40mins and the special effects are incredible to look at.If your in the mood for a really cheesy film that will make you laugh and you don't take seriously (but by looking at loads of reviews on this website that isn't the case) and jaw dropping effects, you'll like this like me.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Remember, you heard it first from Charlie!","I have to admit that my expectations were not very high when I walked in the movie theater to watch 2012, CGI is an annoying thing and the plot seemed rather opportunist. What a grateful surprise! The movie managed to stay away from a dull routine almost the entire time, those 'touching' moments came in the right moment and in a nice variety, I mean, almost everyone would find something in common with the characters, whether they're fighting for their sons, parents, themselves or even their dogs. Obviously there where some overdone parts, the ""I don't like my dad"" thing was used way too much already, we all know what it leads to. The runaways are quite entertaining, although predicable after some time.The acting was not, as said by some people, over the top, but the plot might have been a little, the cast just followed it, quite well by the way. And it is a good cast, Cusack is probably at the top of his career and Woody Harrelson was, in my opinion, the best actor in the entire movie, incorporated the character in a really intense way.Overall, it's surely not one of the greatest movies of our time, it's not some masterpiece, but surely a good movie, well worth your time, very entertaining, makes you really think about life and the way the world is run, got good actors, good director, some very funny lines and a nice story.

Metaphysical environment,"Sure this is crap in the usual ways.However, I dare anyone interested in cinema as cinema—in the eye as it 'writes' space by mapping—to watch this and not be transfixed by the visual accomplishment. If Harryhausen deserves praise, then how on earth not these guys? You don't just see here masses of metal collapse. There are small renderings in every scene, attention to detail. As we zip past an office building ripped in two, you will see human specks clutching at the edge.It comes alive.It is rather wonderful to watch this in the abstract mode—our eye is scudding through space as the fabric of the film is torn to shreds all around us. The film violates every law of physics as it does that, which fits here, because the abstraction is metaphysical, Greek for 'beyond the physics'. The sheer impossibility of anything around the Ark project underscores this—when in the end survivors get out on the decks, we are really seeing a glimpse of the afterlife.The overall enterprise captivates not because there is logic in what happens and you can latch on to that as navigation. Rather, there are suddenly cracks in normative reality as the world begins to spontaneously reconfigure itself around us to form the experience, a series of futurist paintings. I am talking in particular of two scenes here, the race through LA and Yellowstone, which are on par with the best of Spielberg's War of the Worlds—another film structuring collapse around the eye in some great ways. The known geography is thrown askew, its gears melt, a train undulates across frame like a piece of ribbon tossed by the gods.In the macrocosmic plane, the cracks are about the confrontation with the inevitable passing of things, echoed in the Buddhist lama ringing his bell before the cosmic wave of renewal.In the hero's microcosmic plane, the protagonist is a failed writer who neglected parenthood to work on his book, which incidentally was about the apocalypse. So, in the film he confronts his creation while shielding his kids from it.The rest is almost not worth it, almost.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Catastrophe on screen and behind the camera!!!,"It's been a while since a decent ""end of the world"" movie and this was a breath of fresh air to the back of our seats. From start to finish you are on the edge, waiting to see what gets destroyed next and how the characters are possibly going to survive.There is everything you would expect: Great visuals fast paced action, world destruction and nail biting suspense. These make the film what it is and bring its success; which will keep all viewers happy and put bums in seats. However there are some very big holes created which aren't results of the end of the world but the making of the event.The calibre of actors is a bit flat, a couple well known people but none who have the big Hollywood status right now and so lack star quality. Bigger names would have drawn bigger audiences however I suppose putting in top action stars would have eliminated the peril as you would expect them to succeed. With these actors you are constantly wondering.However the big problem is in the story telling is there is none of it. The 2012 doomsday theory is a preconceived idea so the film makers already had that in place. They simply destroyed anything that hasn't already been blown up. And the rest of the story surrounds the relationships between the characters, which we have seen a thousand times. This film lacks originality and you constantly feel like you've seen it before. Everything has been put into blowing s**t up and the visual effects. The other factors to the film have been put on the back burner with little or no effort to address.While this film won't win any Oscars for its story telling or acting it will get endless honours for its colossal creation and groundbreaking effects. There is enough going on to keep everyone occupied and the majority of people will simply pass over the lack of story.The only way I can rate this is to say it is not as good as Independence Day, but better than Day After Tomorrow. A great action packed movie which delivers again and again and so succeeds at its goal; creating a movie spectacle worthy of destroying the world.Overall Summary: Bit hit on screen with dramatic action and effects.

I'm always disgruntled with horror flicks as with all rationale the first time I hear that crazy noise as any normal mortal man I would let out a high shriek and start running in the opposing direction. Yet horror movie stars are of the dumb variety and they want to see what made that deadly sounding noise.Disaster movies work because whilst the setting is mostly science fiction, the reactions are at the very least humanly possible.

"The effects are better than ever, everything else is as laughable as before","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningSerious film connoisseurs will be familiar with Roland Emmerich and the type of epic, big budget, effects laden blockbuster films he specialises in. They never fail to impress with the 'wow' factor, from the alien spacecraft towering over the White House in Independence Day, to the world freezing over in The Day After Tomorrow. His latest effort focuses on the Ancient Mayan prediction that the world will end in the titular year, when the earth splits open and sinks under a tonne of water. The focus falls on errant father and failed author Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) who's left to save his estranged wife and children and the new man in their lives when the disaster erupts. Meanwhile, government researcher Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) has returned from India with some unsettling news for those in power, which riles Chief of Staff Carl Anhauser (Oliver Platt) who first doubts the severity of the threat before becoming a bureaucratic fascist when deciding who gets space in the bunkers to survive. All the while, President Wilson (Danny Glover) tries to lead his people to a noble victory.There's a selection of decent supporting players here too, including Amanda Peet as Curtis's disappointed, stern ex wife, Thandie Newton as a conscientious member of the administration and Woody Harrelson in a brief role as a crazy sounding guy warning of impending doom. Quite a selection of characters in a lengthy, ambitious film that is somewhat overlong, and with not the least flimsy of scripts in the world, that will challenge your attention a little bit. There's just nothing overly outstanding about the film, with the typical characters (the flawed good guy, the conscientious voice of reason, the uncaring bureaucrat, the conspiracy theorist nutter, the good guys and the bad guys, basically) and the usual wild suspensions of disbelief required as the heroes are the only ones miraculously surviving collapsing buildings, engulfing fireballs, shattering fragments and all manner of dangers. A younger person may find it the most incredible film ever made, and in terms of special effects it quite possibly is, but an older, more cynical critic is likely to sit there finding it all rather corny and hard to hold their attention.It's not even jabbing at any social or political subtext (unlike the folly of man causing the end of the earth in The Day After Tomorrow) just feeding off a most likely ludicrous prediction from some ancient people. Those who've seen most of Emmerich's films will know what to expect, but in more cynical times, he needs less throwaway material than this if he's to keep making films on such a big scale. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Nice visuals, but lacking script and performance makes a forgettable film","The movie 2012 is (obviously) based around the popular myth that the earth will perish after 21-12-2012, but this movie certainly does not boost the myth's credibility. While the (mostly computer generated) special-effects are impressive at times, the chaotic script and the laughable acting-performances are nothing to write home about.2012 has all the ingredients of a traditional disaster-movie as we know it, and like I said the special-effects are good as you come to expect from a movie this recent. The only significant difference with this movie is that this time the disaster takes place globally.The movie suffers from overly dramatic scenes that drag on far too long and have no appeal what so ever. I think they could have easily cut out a good 30 minutes or so of soap-opera esq scenes.The acting in this movie is very below average, to the point that its almost embarrassing to watch. No matter what the situation, the cast always seems very unenthusiastic in their roles and the sometimes plain uninspired dialog doesn't exactly help either. I think the movie would have worked out a lot better if they would have taken a more adventurous approach with the story. Now 2012 turned out like a movie that relies too much on special-effects. But if its special-effects you want, you will be pretty bored with this movie as well I think, because 2012 has little other redeeming features to offer.Director Roland Emmerich said that 2012 will be his final disaster- movie, and frankly this is a very good thing before his movies turn out even more disastrous then this movie. 2012 is a very mediocre and in the end forgettable film.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

However, I don't really understand how they figured this would be appealing to audiences outside the United States. The movie has almost nothing to do with the Mayan calendar, though.. There are some vague references and allusions to it, but it's basically about how the rich people of the earth will survive, the Chinese people provide all the manpower and die anyway, and the rest of the world can just die. Sort of like the banking crisis.. The rest of the world supplies the loans and the goods, and the top 5% of US citizens reap the benefits.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The End of Days meets Woody Harlson,"First of all, this movie was not meant to be taken seriously. There is no way that a person could drive a limo all over town while the world was crumbling underneath. That was a very unrealistic scene. I thought it was almost amazing when John Cusack drove his limo through a building and then somehow made it to the airport and took off while the Langoliers were closing in behind him. Yes, you hear me right. This movie reminded me of Stephen King's The Langoliers. Of course, Woody Harlson was the highlight of the movie as that person in Yellowstone where he was able to predict all of these events. I was shocked at the outcome of him. I was also noticing that when the Washington Monument crashed, a ton of ash and debris flew all over the place and landed on Danny Glover's face. He looked identical to his Predator Character in that scene. Speaking of Predator...that was a terrible Arnold Shcwartzeneggar actor pretending to be him.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Oh, Emmerich what were you thinking?","This is a movie I find it hard to write about because there is just so much to attack - and a complete flame isn't fun to read, so I'll try to be balanced - but I may fail:Personally I can accept the end of earth premise with only a twinge of ire at the unnecessarily improbable reason it happens. That's pretty much all I can accept because the rest is horribly bad. The acting would have been OK if the dialogue had at least been mildly interesting - Woody Harrelson's portrayal being the exception, and at 158 minutes there is way too much of the boring dialogue to be had - they could easily have cut an hour.The action sequences are completely over the top which is expected in a disaster movie, but here the characters aren't on a cliff's edge the whole time they are for the most part over the edge yet somehow survive.Adding to the calamity is the fact that the internal logic is deeply flawed. There are systems that we have been told are gone forever that suddenly work just to create another emotional scene - of which there are plenty, but none that works. Cusack's character is hailed as a hero for nearly killing everybody. They try the emotional President speech but Danny Glover doesn't pull it off due to both the writing & acting.If you still feel like an over the top disaster action film after this outpouring then go rent ""the day after tomorrow"" by the same director which is a superior film in every way.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why Am I Not Surprised?,"Once again, Roland Emmerich has raised an enormous budget and spent it all on CGI special effects. In a way, I'm happy for him and his family that he has found gainful employment, i.e., a paying job, but why must we allow the ENTIRE WORLD to think that Americans as a society are THIS STUPID?! For obvious reasons, we must view the end of the world in the cinema because when it really does come we'll be too busy running and screaming. And for the record - the end of the world is JUST THAT. There ain't no survivors, Ark or no. The levels of volcanism and fire would consume all the available oxygen, so even if you were one of the lucky 14 people to be in an area that wasn't drowned/burned/or broken open and roto-tilled into the depths of the planet, in a very few short hours you'll be asphyxiated. Last year's 'Knowing' was at least realistic. Giant solar flare = End Of Life. But even they just HAD to have a 'happy' ending where benevolent alien visitors save some of the children. A more realistic scenario would be: ""End of the world's coming - make your peace with whatever type of God you can be comfortable with.""And there'd be a LOT more looting, rape and pillage...

Cliché last minute escapes,"The story was pretty good. There are historical, albeit vague references to this December date in 2012 and the premise is scientifically believable. It could have been a relevant movie.The effects are wonderful; as good or better than any of the top movies in recent years..Where it went wrong: The separated husband winning back his wife is really cliché. It's been a reoccurring theme in movies for that last decade and therefore seems a cheap way to inject conflict into a story.The constant ""deadline effect"" in the movie is so over-worn that it is likely to become a cult joke. Every exciting scene has our protagonists just, and I mean just escaping the oncoming cracks in the world, the falling buildings, the ever increasing range of a volcano blast, The lowering of a heavy metal door, an airplane crashing on a glacier, or the . you pick the disaster, our heroes will just barely escape it. Scene after scene of epic disasters, each outdoing the previous one and every one of them is a miraculous escape. This comic-book thrill-making method is probably more responsible than any other problem in the movie as to why it was panned so badly.The actor playing the President should not have been the wonderful character actor who mumbles and is too much a normal, likable guy. Articulation and elocution are essential in winning office. Danny Glover was not a credible President. All the other key actors are perfect for their roles. In fact, I don't think that such a splendid cast would have signed on to this movie if they had known what the ""Deadline Effect"" would do to the movie.It's a shame, because the premise, the basic story and the special effects were wonderful.

Plot's sucked. Effects hasn't.,"Well, yes, this is a bit worth watching (because of the effects, I must say). Since the tickets aren't expensive, it's not a loss. When I came into the cinema, I had an expectation that the movie would talk more about the 2012 Maya prediction, than any other thing. This wasn't what happened. The movie barely talks about the prediction. You can't make a comparison between the Maya prophecy and the movie, except for the year it occurs. I was a bit disappointed, because I thought it was going to be a fiction movie, but based on true facts. For my sadness, it wasn't. They could call this movie ""The Day After Tomorrow: 2 - the remake"".Despite of visual and good effects (that's why I gave 6 out of 10), the history is totally nonsense, is totally waste of time and has nothing to do with the Maya prediction, as I've said before. I was hoping this movie could be the best one, maybe for this decade. A shame it wasn't. Had everything to be a success, and failed, badly.Now talking about the plot, totally disposable. In the first minutes, I really enjoyed in, specially in India, when they've discovered that the world would ruin. As of this moment, the writers got lost in the plot, trying to juggle a sci-fi and a family story, always having the American ""dad superhero"" that does everything in the right way, saving the world. Fortunately we still had a few nice things that make you think, such as in the end, when everybody move to Africa. When would someone move to Africa nowadays? It's shown that we may need them in the future, and this was well done. The rest of the plot sucked, unfortunately.Even though that sucked, I can't say the same about the effects. This was the best part of the movie for sure. When the White House fell down, it was the beginning of a new era. When California was swallowed by the ocean, you could see the world changing. And at least, it had substance. That was happening because of San Andreas Fault; a shame they didn't mix everything they showed in the movie with Maya prediction, that was unused in the movie.6/10. Not the best movie I've seen so far. Seems media is exaggerating again -- talking about the expectations about the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Now, about the 10 stars...","My Take: A big-budget guilty pleasure blockbuster with spectacular special effects. You get what you pay for.You can keep your TRANSFORMERS 2, and I don't even need to see G.I. JOE and even TERMINATOR:SALVATION anymore. Roland Emmerich's latest end-of-the-world blockbuster 2012 is my favorite guilty pleasure blockbuster of year, perhaps even for a long time. It's been a long time ever since I saw an end-of-days disaster movie. And come opening day, I invited a date, lined up to get tickets, bought a two tubs of popcorn and my date and I were lucky enough to get two front row seats. Anyone going out to see a disaster movie by Roland Emmerich will know what to expect: A wholesale planet-wide demolition derby filled with several stock characters and some clichéd situations washed down a potpourri of impressive special effects, top thrills and an all-star cast. So why, you ask, do I think the movie deserves a 10 stars? Simple: It was fun. Great fun indeed. And at several occasions, pretty funny too. 2012 isn't just a disaster movie, it's every disaster movie ever made before rolled into one, and maybe multiplied to 10. Not only does the film tips its hat to every major disaster movie of yesteryear's, from THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, to EARTHQUAKE and WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE; It also references every disaster movie cliché in the book.The plot is pure sci-fi hokum about solar flares slowly heating up the Earth's core, not too fortunately coinciding with the Mayan civilization's prophecy of the Apocalypse. Scientist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) warns the White House chief-of-staff (Oliver Platt) and even The President (Danny Glover) himself about the impending doom. But what every end-of-the-world disaster flick needs is that everyman character. That character is Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), a failed writer-turned-limo driver who must try to save his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) and her new surgeon boyfriend (Tom McCarthy); as well as his their two kids (Liam James and Morgan Lily) from a crumbling California and possibly take them to China, where supposedly the government is building ships to carry enough people in case of the upcoming deluge. Keeping up with his tradition of a ""small-end-of-the-world-after-all"", the characters' fates are intertwined. Coincidence? I think not.Wait, don't throw your stones at me just yet. 2012 does have its ridiculous moments, plenty of them in fact. The clichés are fairly obvious (Don't worry, dogs never have their bad days in any Emmerich movie). There's isn't a cliché in the genre that Emmerich and co-writer Harald Kloser didn't embrace. You'll probably laugh at these clichés, and yet you don't really laugh at them, but with them. But perhaps what really makes the show are the special effects. Emmerich reportedly informs that this would be his last doomsday epic, and he definitely goes all the way here; the effects are par excellence here. Cities are ravaged by multiple earthquakes and tsunamis, active volcanoes appear and shoot great balls of fire, and in typical Emmerich tradition: national monuments are blown up real good (most of them, you might have glimpsed at the trailer). The story may be pure pseudo-science, but the effects seem to make the catastrophe almost too real. In one instance, when St. Peter's Basilica gets a shaky tremor, I had to lean over my date and jokingly tell her that it was alright and it wasn't real.2012 is spectacular fun, and ""fun"" is the key word here. The effects are truly marvelous, and unlike some of the other ""great"" CGI these days, I actually had the time to absorb and marvel at how awesome they are. And for a movie that's built entirely of spectacle, the actors are surprisingly capable and sometimes believable. It may not be what the critics call a great movie, but for sheer escapism, the movie gives the audience what they pay for and will no doubt rake a lot of money in the box office. By the time the credits roll, my date and I had a good time and that's all that matters. And that's my 10 stars there. Take it or leave it, I loved this movie.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A mixed bag.....,"2012 really is a mixed bag. I liked the actors and their performances, including Amanda Peet, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson and more. The special effects are also pretty great, it should be, that's what the whole movie is supposed to thrive off of. Now where this film does fall kinda short is the writing. To be completely honest, the dialogue between the characters isn't all that great, just not too creative. Great effects and even good actors unfortunately cannot make up for weak writing. The movie did have some promise, but unfortunately, it didn't live up nearly as much to what it could've been. There are some interesting scenes involving prophecy and the telling of the end times in the beginning of the movie. Although I did think that Harrelson's performance was a bit too crazy and overly comical. So basically 2012 is a mediocre end of times disaster film with pretty good performances by good actors with less than average writing. 6/10 for 2012.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Awful, truly truly awful, but there's promise...","OK so this is a diabolical film, the story is poorly constructed, the characters are one-dimensional and poorly acted. There has been enough written about how dire this whole film really is.Onto the promise, 2012 feels like a prequel to something much more interesting, the arcs are full now, there is a definite Orwellian feel to the surveillance on board and definite resentment toward leadership, and a definite class structure between those who paid and those who just got a place. Perhaps a film set 30 or 40 years after the events of this film based on one of the arcs, none of the characters are the same (please) perhaps there can be something kind of interesting made from the premise, it may be a bit '1984'esque, but blended with some 'Minority report', 'Metropolis' & 'Battlestar Galactica' the reimagined series. You could have the story complete with revolutions, class struggles, ration issues, political corruption, medical issues (disease spread etc.) an increasing population, the premise is there, not that it will ever have a chance of being made, and even if it did, you just know Emmerich and the studios would make it awful.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Too many flaws but a must see movies.,"I enjoyed watching this movie. I researched about 2012 long ago & I knew what was coming, so the movie did not scare me at all and it was fun to find how people reacted to this movie.Do not take this movie seriously, if the disasters take place it will and it's useless to be anxious about it. So relax and enjoy the movie. But if u are frustrated and worried about the future, waste some more time watching the documentaries about 2012.Coming to the flaws, (1)The story writer always unnaturally saves the hero like a Bollywood movie. Similar to Die Hard series whatever happens, the hero will never die. (2)The use of mobiles is not possible in such horrific weather conditions. (3)A polar shift , that is shown in the movie , effects the winds in the atmosphere to blow around 300 to 600 km/h , which is avoided in this movie, makes it impossible for planes to fly. (4)Such spaceship or submarine will never help to escape such a disaster and people would die in short of food. (5)Africa's shape can't remain same and should have changed into another shape. (6)The movie shows us only the worse things that might occur and gives us no advice how to survive it.Although the movie comes with several flaws it's a great movie to watch, I'll score it as follows out of 10:- Story – 8 ; Acting – 6 ; Special Effects – 10 ; Sound – 10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"better than I thought, same as I expected","After months of procrastinating on it, I finally decided to watch the film. The visual effects were interesting enough, as expected. But rather than a sinister glee, I reacted to seeing the world ""destroyed"" before my eyes with an unexpected sort of sadness.I enjoyed 2012, but ultimately the plot is pretty much what one would expect. What I think is 2012's real triumph is not so much the survival of ""humanity"" - that is, human compassion - but to capture the ""quiet"" moments of the humanity in grief and loss: a father failing to reconcile with his son, a son and father privately coming to terms with the end, a family huddled together as they watch a tsunami crash down on them.The film's most irritating aspect is actually Roland Emmerich's own personal opinions that littered the film.

Will Nostradamus and the Mayans be proved right?,"The film 2012 starts with the premise that out in the movie-going public there are a considerable number of people who are aware of the prophecies of Nostradamus and the fact that the Mayan calendar ended in our year 2012. Otherwise the title and film would have really little significance.In point of fact there have been several times in history when a lot of folks thought that certain years would mark the end. In the 19th century a gentleman named William Miller managed to convince quite a following that 1844 was going to be the end of the world. When it didn't happen, he lost a bit of credibility.2012 is a combination end times film you see normally out of Christian productions and the end product of those Seventies era disaster movies. Solar flare activity has been on the rise and those flames of burning hydrogen are heating the Earth from the outside and from the inside like a microwave oven.However this has been foreseen and a disaster plan is put into operation by President Danny Glover and other heads of state. But his top science adviser Oliver Platt takes operational control and he's a nasty dude with his own ideas of maybe ruling a post apocalyptic world. He quarrels with another scientist Chiwetal Ejifor and the two have a running Spock/McCoy battle for pure science over humanity throughout the film.At the same time hack novelist John Cusack learns of the impending cataclysm and works quite a few miracles to get his family out and be listed among the survivors. In fact he plays a key role in everybody's survival in the film.One memorable character you won't forget is Woody Harrelson who runs a doomsday pirate radio station. As all his conspiracy theories are proved right, his dying reaction is positively orgasmic.Barack Obama could not have been better portrayed on the screen even in pseudonym than by Danny Glover. He gives his blessings to scientist daughter Thandie Newton and to Ejifor for their hoped for survival. Newton and Glover's scenes are the most human and humane in 2012.Is there validity to all of this? Those earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand and Fugoshima, Japan certainly give one pause to reflect. On the other times a whole lot of my credit cards have been renewed past 2012, one of them up to 2015. Can Visa, Mastercard, and American Express know something we don't.2012 set out to be the ultimate disaster film and it came considerably short of the mark.

Awesome for Effects,"My review for 2012 is very much overdue. I didn't review it earlier because to me it was perfect. Firstly, I had no problem with the movie as I am a number one fan of Roland Emmerich. I went to watch this for all the awesome effects even if some of them were a bit unrealistic as some would say. But hey, this is one of the best disaster movies of our time if you don't mind some funny bits. I gave this movie a 10 for all the blow it up stuff I always wanted. The story is your basic look at our hero of the day who just happens to be a frustrated divorced writer and drives a limousine for rich people. Not much of a story really although it tries to stick with it even after all the running around and getting on something in the nick of time. I know most of it was ridiculous, but I ain't stupid I just enjoyed it for what it was. An earthquake of that magnitude in this movie? You couldn't run, walk or even drive around like John Cusack did, and he wasn't even a professional race car driver. And I know from personal experience with earthquakes with lesser magnitude.

First thing is that it wasn't a great movie, but it certainly wasn't bad like a lot of people said it was.Obviously, the first positive of this film was the special effects it had. The CG was amazing, like the best I've ever seen. Everything was so massive, it's actually quite scary to think about it, how they created and destroyed the earth so realistically. Los Angeles was ruined so amazingly, it just stuns you. The acting and character development wasn't that good. The movie was very emotional since of course this movie is about the apocalypse, but the main characters themselves didn't show too much emotion. At least not as much as expected. Storyline wasn't too original and was seen before, but the super cheesy dialogue actually fit in very well with the scenes (if you've seen it, you'll understand).It's also a lengthy movie - 2 hours 30 minutes, but I think most of the scenes were needed since 1) it covers the whole world, not just America for example 2) it's more dramatic 3) the film doesn't just start in 2012, and some years are talked about before.For those people who rated it under a 4 or something because of character development, one bad aspect doesn't bring down an entire movie, and if you rated it because of that, it's probably just a rant.All in all, this is an okay movie. It's not exactly everything you'd expect from the trailers and the topic of doomsday, but it's not a bad movie either. Characters and cheesiness were bad, but special effects and the message of hope was good. Plus it being epic.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Garbage...pure garbage,"Thankfully this will be Rowland Emmerich's last disaster flick...so he says.I think we've all had enough of this type of film now, where special effects take the place of story or plot.If you haven't seen it already then don't. There's nothing we haven't seen before a thousand times, usually from the same director. Of course one needs to suspend reality constantly throughout the film and aren't we oh so bored with that?So don't watch it and if it's special effects you're after then go and see Avatar again.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

At one point, I actually started tuning into another movie on the TCM channel, but again, the first half of the movie fun... the second half, where one life out of billions lost, is cheered ... give me a break... wine break preferably.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Pretty Enjoyable Disaster Movie,"When I saw this when I was young I love it, but now I still enjoyed it but it's not my favorite. The movie is the end of the world type of plot that been done before. It's build up really well when it gets towards the disaster moments and brings tension to the movie. The disaster scenes are easily the highlight of the movie that contains gets special effects in it and looks terrifying to be in the same situation. It really shows how much work the filmmakers put into the effects of the movie. The movie is also suspenseful with the characters trying to survive against the disaster, but it does seem ridiculous how the main characters can easily survival this type of disaster. Just like the director previous disaster movie, there's a bunch of plotline that are connected to the disaster, but I felt they could cut some of it down. The characters themselves are one-dimensional and lacks any interesting traits to them. The acting itself is decent and the cast does a good job.Overall it's a enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I had very low expectations for it, but the movie has some intense, action oriented cinematic moments from beginning to end. If you a fan of action flicks and heart pounding action, then this movie is for you. Now for the obvious sides of the movie. If you are a scientific person like myself, you will probably hate this movie and bash the crap out of it. First off, most, if not all of the action sequences, are unrealistic. Crazy car driving scenes with the ground crumbling around the vehicle, planes taking off before they fall to their doom, it gets very unrealistic. Top that off with a relatively poor story line and inaccurate scientific facts about how the world is going to end, it can make some movie goers sick!Just to end it, 2012 has some good action sequences, and the average person will most likely enjoy it.

The next $260 million should be spent like this.....,"I was looking forward to seeing this film, and having done so I have come up with a plan that may appease a number of other viewers whose comments I have read and absorbed. The CGI costs a fortune right? Actors like John Cusak and Woody Harrelson don't come cheap either. So, I reckon quite a number of people left the theatre say ""Wow"" to the effects, but few were uttering ""awesome"" to the acting. And this is not damning criticism upon the actors, good as they are, more upon the material they were given to work with. Therefore remove the actors and spend the money on more CGI. Drop the pretence at trying to hold a storyline together with cliché (we all know what's going to happen) and just put a simple narrative in place for the sake of continuity. Cut the time to less than two hours and do the whole thing in 3D. Just a thought....and a fervent prayer!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great popcorn entertainment...,"So, where should I start? If you looking for great character development, brilliant acting or fantastic dialogs, this movie is not for you. Also the plot is a bit too simple to be enjoyed by a thinking mind and the characters pretty one dimensional, directly borrowed from many worn out disaster flicks. Scene after scene occurs where the director wants to have these emotionally-charged scenes where you're affected but, because there's no foundation, so you really don't care. The only noteworthy performance is that from Chiwetel Ejiofor as Adrian Helmsley.But where this movie does score is the jaw dropping unprecedented scale of destruction that you see unfolding before your very eyes. The computer graphics are awesome and so is the direction. The cinematography is near perfect. The film has a 2hr38 min runtime but it flies by as director goes on destroying one city after another. Earthquakes tearing apart freeways or huge tidal swallowing entire cities has never been shot better. As the end credits roll you can't help but ask yourselves a question? In Godzilla he destroyed NYC, in Independence day a lot more cities, in TDAT the northern hemisphere and now the entire World. So what next does Mr. Emmerich have in store for us? Unlike Day after tomorrow where the subplots were just contributing to runtime, while being sappy, idiotic and totally unconnected, here they serve its purpose quite well.So get set for the ride of your life and sit back any enjoy as Emmerich has fun destroying our world once again.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
If it's not the stupidest movie ever. . .,". . .What is? I like crash, boom, burn, as much as anyone. I like chase scenes. I like action.BUT, I also like at least some of the laws of physics. Or, even if I don't ""like"" them, I appreciate that they have some relationship to how things crash, explode, etc. And when a movie persistently flouts every possible law of physics just to inject artificial drama into the scene, it results in less enjoyment of the action sequences, not more.Also, I like love stories and human interaction. But when the clock is ticking down to the last minute or two of total annihilation, and people who are purportedly intelligent, thinking people, chose that moment to have an extended discussion of their feelings, GIVE ME A BREAK.And I usually don't mind movie that run over 2 hours because, sometimes it just takes longer to help the audience understand the human motivation, or to give the plot enough time to evolve logically.

a recipe for disaster,"Here is the recipe for the 2012 disaster as we now know it: Take one chunk of CHARIOTS OF THE GODS, add NOAH'S ARK, some SODOM AND GOMORRAH, mix with an EARTHQUAKE, a shake of TOWERING INFERNO, some AIRPORT '75 cockpit grunts, some KARKATOA boom-box and flying island chunks, a serve of Yellowstone level VOLCANO and DANTE'S PEAK antics, two tsunami sized POSEIDON rolls, a SAN FRANCISCO shake up of LA instead, no-Hanks everyman family glue repair, some TITANIC vessels and a hilariously sloshy LOST HORIZON sequence with teapot monks and a monster 'plane skidding along a glacier, add $200million mix in some Teutonic severity about humanity and - DING - cook in the CGI microwave.

For those who don't drown in destruction and can last the 158 minute apocalypse of suburbia slipping like cakes into the sea, you will marvel at the inhumanity of it all as everything we have ever known gets pushed over.

2012: breathtaking effects and a solid story,"I saw this movie today, and it was really good. I don't know why people are complaining that there is no story, there is plenty of it.In my opinion it is too much story. Much of drama and human emotions. There are some clichés, but in general the story is good. In my opinion it is Roland Emmerich's best script yet.The special effects are really, really the best there is. And better than Avatar. It is very, very hard to tell that all these images are computer generated. On the big screen the effects look at least twice as good and realistic as in the trailers. I think the cartoonish effect that some people claim is due to the low resolution of the trailers. Even 1080p is not enough to do these effects justice. Only metallic surfaces look a bit ""fake"". but the rest is truly unbelievable.I think some effects shots are a bit short. I do not want to spoil anything, so i keep my mouth shut.If you want a good evening in the cinema: here you go.

A Nutshell Review: 2012,"Roland Emmerich has already established himself as the go-to man if anyone in Hollywood wants to make an event film to entertain the masses. We've had an intergalactic portal open up in Stargate, an alien invasion with Independence Day, a bastardization of Japan's iconic monster Godzilla, a what-if tale of a freezing winter when hell turneth over with The Day After Tomorrow, and now, 2012.Instead of repeating oneself on the negative outcomes of global warming and a consequence of our raping the environment, this one breezes you through some mumbo-jumbo physics, which ultimately translates into the Earth's core heating up and Mother Nature running a severe fever, which results in hurling everything at mankind, from volcanic eruptions, massive tidal waves and of course, some insane shifting of tectonic plates which only mean one thing - an immense and tremendous cinematic destruction of the world as we know it on celluloid.To some, you'll be told to park your brains at the door. To others, they wonder how dumb a film can be in magnifying some hocus-pocus doomsday scenario. Bottom line in my opinion, this is nothing but a tentpole pop corn film for purely entertainment purposes, so if you can't accept this, then don't buy a ticket and be the party pooper. In essence, this film is more like an amusement ride, where the price of an admission ticket almost guarantees a thrilling roller coaster ride from start to finish, despite a relatively slow opening to establish a whole slew of key characters and their relationships with one another, before allowing Nature to unleash its fury in all its digital glory.Effects wise, the teaser did just enough to pique one's interest. I have to admit that watching entire land masses swallowed up by the oceans was pretty terrifying, yet these money shots are just that, the hook for someone to bite and make a beeline for the theatres. CG is carefully crafted here to make it look realistic, and detailed enough for anyone going for repeated screenings to pick out additional, minute attributes that were missed the first time round. After all, it's world wide pandemonium we're talking about here, and there's a systematic way in how the world gets destructed on screen. Unfortunately though you would be able to notice that some of the simpler effects don't get properly rendered and may come across as cheap, though thankfully the larger spectacles clearly got more devotion in getting them done right.That aside, the mammoth run time allowed for a lot of subplots and themes to be discussed, which turned out to be the surprising gem within 2012. Granted there are unnecessary tangents that could have been removed to allow for a tighter story, such as the entire cruise ship arc which turned out to be nothing more than a pissing competition at Poseidon's (the remake) way, and didn't contribute much other than to allow alternative, uninteresting perspectives besides the cursory warning of never to allow regrets to remain status quo. Or the usual lapses into bravado speeches to rouse the human spirit in survival, which turn out to be rather cliché and boring as well.The world as we know in the film is into its bleakest hour, and how do you inform anyone about the magnitude of disaster to come? Public announcements would lead to no law nor order, and the breakdown of civil society, and it's up to a group of G8 governments to set a secret agenda in a race against time to ensure that they can ensure the continuity of the human race, by playing Noah themselves.Emerich has this time round become a little bit more all inclusive in having some non-US centric participation, though this did also seem like a statement to be more politically correct than anything else. Infusing some real world sensibilities, even the location and prowess needed to embark on their massive projects, were left to the Chinese for their impeccable diligence and hard work (not to mention being the world's factory too), and probably a nod to their engineering.What would raise eyebrows in its morality tale, is how proponents in the way this hushed up secret project would become, and the silencing of detractors or those who cannot keep a secret. Natural selection based on superior gene pool got thrown out the window as well, as predetermined survivors were chosen on the basis of wealth, which of course reflects the way how capitalist societies operate in with money talking loudest. Which makes you wonder how other science fiction films which have similar premises, would have tackled this issue, from Wall E to Pandorum even.Anyway those are things that were touched upon, but not dwelled in further detail because as I mentioned, it's a film for mass appeal entertainment, finding time to poke fun at world figures and politicians such as Queen Elizabeth II, and the Californian governor. Having a large ensemble cast is part of the fun as well, and they play nothing more than cardboard characters each given a specific thing to contribute in the film. If I lists some of them down as average Joe Jackson Curtis played by John Cusack, his estranged wife played by Amanda Peet, Kinky Boots' Chiwetel Ejiofor as a prominent scientist, Danny Glover as the US President, Thandie Newton as the First Daughter, Woody Harrelson as an over the top doomsday soothsayer, and more from Morgan Lili, Oliver Platt, Jimi Mistry and Lisa Lu, to Singaporean Chin Han, who plays a young TIbetian worker.If you're looking for entertainment, then look no further than 2012, the tentpole film for this week. Just remember to check your expectations, and buckle up for that adrenaline rush. Make sure you're opting to see this in a digital hall, with a good sound system enough to reverberate the audio shockwaves across the entire screening hall.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

And he'll have fun fun fun 'til his daddy takes the CG away...,"As disaster movies go, 2012 is definitely the big one. I mean, how do you outrun the world?An inordinately large neutrino burst from the sun causes the Earth to break, and creates much employment for special effects companies. Also, the planets in our solar system have aligned (which doesn't really mean anything, considering the gravitational force they would exert is microscopic) and narcissistic humans who still can't shake the fact that the universe does not revolve around them, seem to think it affects tectonic activity on little old Earth. Also - Mayan Prophecy. Now there's something REALLY scientific that proves all this is true!The Mayans predicted that in 2012, Digital Domain would have the computer graphic technology to wipe out the Himalayas and New York with tsunamis. This they do, as well as other cool stuff like raining down the John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier on top of the White House and the noble president, who is tending injured people on the White House lawn by asking them if they'd vote for a public option.In 2012, writer-director Roland Emmerich has balanced his admittedly masterful use of CGI with his usually prosaic handling of human stereotypes. All the stereotypes are still here - the Everyman (John Cusack), the young scientist with all the answers and the body to go with them (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the noble President (Danny Glover - being black is now less of a fantasy than the nobility he displays in staying behind, which is absolute fantasy), the wacky prophet (Woody Harrelson), the ambitious politician (Oliver Platt), the brainless automaton military - but they either feel more organic to the plot, or the trillion dollar promotional campaign which could have gone towards bailing out another crybaby corporation on Wall Street affected my Discernment Gland.John Cusack uses his knowledge that he is the Leading Man to narrowly escape Earth-splitting cracks and falling objects, while wife Amanda Peet does her job of looking hot and screaming a lot; while her New Boyfriend (Thomas McCarthy, who can't stop looking like Patrick Wilson from WATCHMEN) pilots all of them unselfishly away from danger, when he should be familiar with enough disaster movies to realize he has to fall down a crevasse or something soon because his salary is nowhere near the Leading Man's.Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Emmerich, Chiwetel Ejiofor actually does some exceptional acting up against Oliver Platt, causing them to almost disappear into another movie with more credibility and less screaming.Amidst Roland's advertisement for a suite of outboard tools, there are some genuine touching moments: Chiwetel's father onboard a cruise ship that ultimately goes Poseidon; Russian pilot Sasha's (Johann Urb) camaraderie with fellow pilot McCarthy - that's not to say there's anything original about these moments. Apart from the Leading Man's relationships, the strongest emotional bonds are the ones set up to specifically destroy and target our Weeping Gland.Final scenes show desperate humanity trying to board gargantuan ""arks"" that billionaires have paid to have a berth on. Chiwetel curbs the inherent selfishness of the species by giving Oscar Speech Number 23-a, ""What is it that makes us human?"" rolling smoothly into importuning, ""What will we tell our children?"" and ending with the glorious ""We can't build a civilization if our first act is one of cruelty!"" which amazes us at how much it makes our flesh crawl.Okay, so let's deconstruct.1) ""What is it that makes us human?"" Apparently, money. The people clamoring to get onboard the arks, who are in danger of being left behind on the docks - ARE OTHER BILLIONAIRES who already paid for a berth, whom the arks were leaving behind because tsunamis were almost upon them. Opening the giant doors to let them in was not an act of kindness towards homeless bums and underprivileged day workers - it was a contractual obligation to other billionaires!2) ""What will we tell our children?"" How about, ""I paid a billion Euros to save your necks and you should be building a shrine to thank me!""? Now go clean out the poo in the gorilla cage.3 ) ""We can't build a civilization if our first act is one of cruelty!"" Sounds kinda morally correct - but is demonstrably wrong. Firstly, you already HAVE a civilization built on cruelty. The passengers onboard the arks were chosen because their pockets were one billion Euros deep. What exactly happened to all the middle class personnel who built the ships and maintained the infrastructure while you collected your billion-Euro payments? Oh, that's right, after they complete their menial jobs, they're dead to you. At least, they will be when that tsunami hits 'em in their poverty-stricken asses. Secondly, Mr. Black White House Official, have you forgotten that America's ""civilization"" was built on the skulls of Native Americans and African slaves?It's a good thing no one is paying attention to anything except the special effects.

Wonderfully preposterous,"I always find it amusing when people get angry with movies like 2012, saying they are an ""insult to human intelligence"" and so on. I guess 2012 really would be an insult to human intelligence if it had anything to do with human intelligence. It has not. To say that Roland Emmerich is the kind of director more interested in going for the direct visual impact is quite an understatement. Kind of like saying Michael Moore is a bit of a political film maker.2012 is a good Emmerich movie, a good disaster movie and a good piece of junk food cinema. There's nothing - I mean NOTHING - here for anyone interested in character development, realism or any other kind of adequate storytelling devices. I think this is pretty much the reason it works fairly well. It all boils down to keeping it simple. The more ridiculous and huge your disaster is, the less you can risk messing around with it. The world ends, lets keep it at that. The problem with some of Emmerich's previous movies were that they fell on their own weight - The Day After Tomorrow was preposterous, yet tried to carry some kind of environmental message, and Godzilla was moronic but would probably have been more acceptable with a more charismatic monster (not named Godzilla!).In 2012, nothing is in the way for the simplistic entertainment value. The simple beauty of it can be found, for instance, in a scene featuring Danny Glover as the US Preisdent actually presenting the news to the rest of the world's leaders, by simply saying ""The world, as we know it, will soon come to an end."" WHOAH! That's quite something. It's a wonder nobody gets the impression he has lost his mind.No, it's not realistic. Yes, it's silly beyond belief. But it doesn't insult your intelligence, because I believe the movie trusts it's audience to be clever enough not to take it all that seriously. It's not like Transformers 2, which was a fantasy movie that actually was in need of some kind of consistency but just decided it wasn't important, and Emmerich is Bergman in comparison to Michael Bay anyway. In 2012 we actually get at least 30 minutes of tension building and we actually get Actors as our cardboard characters. Nothing in the movie is plausible, but it does make (it's own) sense. It's odd to me that anyone would look at the premise of 2012 - mind you, this is a story of The Mayan Apocalypse! - and not see that it's impossible to make this movie without humor and self-irony. Good character development has nothing to do with a movie like this. In fact, I dare say it would just bog it down. In a movie where the world ends at a specific date in 2012, an actor like John Cusack is certainly more than enough.So we have a movie that works despite it's lack of any real conventional quality, since it's a campy roller coaster and that's really it. Does that mean it's a GOOD movie? Not really. Call me a snob, but under the circumstances these movies operate under I can't see how they would ever be properly good. On a star rating, I'm giving 2012 six out of ten. Giving it more would indeed be an insult to human intelligence.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Anybody with an IQ over 100 and a decent science schooling will HATE this one. Neutrinos cook water, small airplanes out-fly raging storms, big Russian aircraft ""land"" on a glacier and don't break, cars jump from flying planes and ""land"" without dent, tsunamis create big waves in the middle of the ocean, the earth crust moves 1000s of miles and there are still buildings that stand, even the Himalayan mountains are filmed from the wrong (Indian) side when supposedly the act happens in China, and thats about 10% of the goofs. The acting was pathetic too. And what a slimebag Emmerich is, that pathetic cartoon of a heroic president. Must have gotten him applause from the whitehouse. The entire movie is just a waste.

The clock is ticking,"...for now. In a year's time this film is going to seem extremely out of date. The end of the world plot is ludicrous, but it might have been easier if no mention of the Mayan calendar was made. The legend is obviously nonsense, and it would have been a much less silly film if it stood on its own two feet, independent of such bad science.John Cusack (who is surprisingly good here) plays a failed, but good, writer working as a Limo driver for a wealthy Russian bully. When camping with his estranged kids in Yellowstone he discovers that the Caldera, the San Andreas Fault, and the rest of the world, are about to go down. What follows is more than 2 hours of utterly insane set-pieces, split-second escapes, breathtaking visual effects (which, for once, don't offend the eye), and lots and lots and lots of mega-destruction as Cusack and his family flee from the crumbling world beneath their feet by multiple means of improvised transportation. You've never seen a spectacle like this before, and it raises the bar ex-treme-ly high for any and all disaster flicks that might follow. Emmerich certainly knows how write action scenes.Chiwetel Ejiofor (also not as annoying as he usually is), Oliver Platt, Danny Glover, and Woody Harrelson fill out the rest of an expansive cast as the scientists, President, and Art Bell-style conspiracy theorist. I'm glad that the politics were played down and the 'harsh truths' angle was left unchallenged for the most part. Like The Day After Tomorrow, there are no winners here, but I am beginning to notice a recurring theme among Roland Emmerich's work. It seems that he believes that our world as it is is so broken, corrupted, and irredeemable that the only way to save it is to wipe the slate clean and rise again as one species unrestricted by political or ethnic divides. So, in a way, it's a good ending despite billions being dead.I fear that this might become dated and unwatchable in the future, which is a shame since it's definitely Emmerich's best film. Independence Day is a relic of 90s optimism and the polar opposite of 2012, which deserves better. Only time will tell I guess. If we are all still here come January 1st 2013, then perhaps we should be grateful.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
hokey movie,"Wow...what a cheesy movie. The cast and acting pretty much lacked any talent except for John Cusack and he wasn't really the main character. In fact, I don't think there was a main character. Very convoluted. Notice who they cast for the good guys and who they cast for the bad guys. This is a typical movie for the present Hollywood mindset. It started out OK but went downhill right up till the end. The story became more unbelievably sentimental with each scene. The special effects were the only thing that made the movie worth watching. A waste of time...I started reading a magazine halfway through the movie and turned it off before the final scene.

"Dismissing extraterrestrial or environmental reasons, Roland Emmerich intention is only to exaggerate, exploring all the possibilities that special effects provide","Roland Emmerich learned well the lessons left by producer Irwin Allen, who, establishing himself as the master of disaster films in the 70s, could perfectly be considered a kind of ""spiritual father"" of the director responsible for features like ""Independence Day"". , ""Godzilla"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"". German by birth, but American at heart (see the patriotism he exudes in his productions), the filmmaker surpasses himself. Dismissing extraterrestrial or environmental reasons, the director proves that his intention was never to question, but only to exaggerate, exploring all the possibilities that special effects provide.Written by Emmerich alongside composer Harald Kloser (yes, composer), ""2012"" uses the old myth about the ""prediction"" made by the abrupt end of the Mayan calendar as a starting point for what will surely be his definitive disaster film (already that its only alternative from now on would be to start destroying other planets): destabilized by the greatest solar radiation in history, the Earth's core begins to undergo transformations that lead the tectonic plates to move radically, taking with it the terrestrial crust - or something in this sense, since neither I nor Emmerich are physicists (something that becomes clear right in the opening minutes of the projection, when even the scientists created by the director are amazed at his poker face when they say that all that is ""impossible!"").Meanwhile, at the White House, geologist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who has been working for the US government since 2009 regarding the fateful date, follows the catastrophes beginning all over the world on television. Large earthquakes cause huge cracks in several cities on Earth, even making pieces of Christ the Redeemer. Helmsley, under the tutelage of President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover), is part of a team that has the task of rescuing as many humans as possible for eventual colonization. Feeling the effects of the proximity of the end firsthand, Jackson Curtis will face the most apocalyptic of phenomena and, armed with a map that has China as the central country, will try to get his family to embark on this project idealized by the heads of government of several countries.Roland Emmerich this time justifies the end of the world via scientific studies and ancient beliefs. The Mayan calendar indicates that there is nothing beyond the 21st of December of that year, and the prophecies are confirmed by the exaggerated heating of the Earth's crust. As a result, the surface of the planet will crack, causing earthquakes and tsunamis. As much as this justification is somewhat attractive, mainly because it inserts History into its plot, the film, like most of Emmerich's films, goes beyond the limits. Signed by himself, in partnership with Harald Kloser, the script exceeds in every scene. As if it wasn't enough to destroy the world, they had to do something incredibly implausible, so much so that ""2012"" must be awarded, handily, the title of the most lying film of all time.In ""2012"", John Cusack takes on the role of a family man who, away from his children, tries to get closer while the world literally collapses around him. A writer and limousine driver (just like Hemingway and Shakespeare), Jackson Curtis goes on a weekend with the kids even though he knows his eldest son would probably prefer to stay home with his mom and stepdad - something Emmerich subtly illustrates. By showing the boy playing video games and rolling his eyes five times in their sockets when listening to his father's jokes. However, after meeting a crazed radio host who claims the government is hiding the imminent end of the world (Harrelson, always amused by impersonating eccentric types), Curtis sets out to rescue the family, revealing himself, in the process, to be the best driver in town. History of humanity - which, incidentally, demonstrates that his ex-wife (Peet) knows how to choose her husbands, since her current partner, a plastic surgeon (McCarthy), turns out to be the best airline pilot in history, although he had only a few lessons. And this is quite convenient, since, throughout the projection, we accompany these characters several times fleeing the destruction in their cars and planes.Fortunately for them, Emmerich is a conservative: his main characters usually make it to the end of the projection alive or, at the very least, are the last to say goodbye to the viewer, which also applies to the dogs - whereas the supporting characters rarely have the same luck, as evidenced by the poor figure who, locked in a compartment located between two others in which the stars are found, is the only one to drown, since, mysteriously, her chamber is flooded more quickly than those that surround her. However, let no one accuse the director of a lack of internal coherence, since his dialogues are equally schematic (""I have the proof! Tomorrow I will tell the whole truth to the press!"") and his scene constructions (as in the moment when a girl decides to confront her father and turns on the TV just as the news she wants to show is starting to show). Furthermore, Emmerich does not deny his roots and, like a good German born on this side of the Wall, he paints his Russian characters with the coarsest and most caricatured paints he can find - and you have to see the two twin boys of 2012 to believe the impossibly one-dimensional filmmaker.Less clear, on the other hand, is his religious position. If, on the one hand, Emmerich embodies the perfect Christian presumption of North Americans when conceiving their ""arks"" and naming Curtis's son ""Noah"" (Noah), on the other hand, it is interesting to observe how he seems obsessed with destroying symbols of this same current. Religious, from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (separating God and Man while transporting Michelangelo's painting to St. Peter's Basilica) and even Christ the Redeemer. What does the director intend to say anyway? What religion is an empty and meaningless comfort? Or that we should cleave to God and Christ? Or, again, that Christianity, imperfect as it is, remains better than any other current? It's possible, of course, that Emmerich simply didn't think of any of this, but it all sounds too purposeful for the audience to really believe it - or is it possible that the director simply didn't see the irony of the offensive arrogance of the President of the United States (Glover ) when saying that he understands the differences between the different Faiths, but that he is certain that his next words will manage to comfort all Religions - just to start an unbelievable ""The Lord is my Shepherd and nothing...""?The narrative structure of this destructive production is extremely similar to that of multiple cinematographic products of this genre, that is, we are constantly confronted with devastating, mostly unnecessary and largely exaggerated sequences that rarely allow for a minimally interesting or captivating narrative exploration. The characters are clearly secondary because the true protagonist of this story is the natural destruction that devastates humanity, a destruction provoked by events that are easily explained by the stereotyped dialogues of the film. Roland Emmerich's cinematographic work is visually overwhelming, but it is also excessively exaggerated, as the first destructive sequences of the film prove to us, where we are confronted with some truly frantic and unrealistic escapes by the ""main"" characters who manage to avoid all the wreckage and all the disasters at the controls of a limousine and a plane, a situation that is simply ridiculous. The destruction of the cities is well coordinated and orchestrated, but it is too superficial, that is, it does not correctly convey the despair and anguish of the apocalyptic situation, a characteristic that invariably reinforces the unrealism and commercialism of this production, which constantly appeals to the clichés of the genre. The extravagant sounds enhance the destructive sequences, but don't suitably appeal to viewers' feelings when millions of fictional characters tragically die during the overwhelming events.And here we come to the main point of 2012 - and what, for many, redeems most of the narrative's problems: the destruction of most of the planet. For Emmerich may not know how to create characters, dramatic arcs or have no idea what kind of message he wants to defend, but the fact is that he is a master at engineering sequences that revolve around the collapse of gigantic structures. Employing several long aerial shots that focus on the extent of the damage, the director deviates from the Michael Bay manual of montage by allowing the viewer to see what is happening on the screen. The director opts for common shots and uninspired shots. If editing saves it from a cataclysm, the soundtrack and photography try to push it down the drain. But what really comes to the rescue are the special effects, the reason why they made the film and why most audiences will check it out. In this, ""2012"" never fails. The film meets the expectations of the audience, saving its best part for the end, precisely when the focus is not on destruction, but on saving humanity. It's ironic, isn't it?Suggesting an interesting discussion about the cultural legacy of Humanity by pointing out that Curtis's failed book could become part of this heritage only by accident, 2012 also quickly abandons this idea in favor of what really interests its director (the action), which represents yet another frustration among many awakened by the feature. Still, it's hard to condemn Emmerich too vigorously, since, while longer than ideal, the film is effective at what it sets out to do. Throughout its 158 minutes, which, by the way, go by very quickly, ""2012"" explores the Hollywood fetish for the end of the world with an intensity never seen before. This time, there's practically nothing left.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Not the worst movie ever, but almost.","2012 was probably not the worst movie ever made, but it is close to being so. Vapid storyline, silly acting, cartoonish FX, Dukes of Hazard stunts, and 158 minutes long. I never wanted the world to end sooner than when I was enduring this bore of a movie. Out of the six billion people doomed to perish, I had to watch the half-dozen or so morons that I could not care less about. The endless sad goodbye's were terrible, but at least they offered some respite from the cartoon-like scenes of ultimate destruction, with horrible yawning chasms that always seemed to begin opening just where our stupid characters happened to be standing, or driving, or taking off from. The cars narrowly evading disaster and leaping over hazards, I swear I could hear Banjo's and YeeeHawwwwws!!!! in the background.

Disaster-movie 101: Blow Up Everything,"Why are so many people hating on this movie? If read up on anything about it, it's a DISASTER movie! Not a Best Picture Oscar-winning film, not a perfectly acted feature, but a disaster movie; everything blows up, people die, and no one has (or should have) any clue of what to do as hell is being unleashed. That's almost what happens in 2012, and it works. I can see why some people do criticize aspects of the film, but if you don't want a disaster movie, go somewhere else; watch Schindler's List (great movie) or something like that. 2012 is a fun, intense adventure that is a HUGE ""what if"" on the supposed Mayan Prophecy.The two main actors in this movie (John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor) stole the show, portraying the two main protagonists in this story about the truth behind the Mayan calender ending on December 21, 2012 that proclaims the end of the world is coming. The one character/actor that should have won critical appraisal for his role was Oliver Platt as the main antagonist; he believes the needs of the few surpass the needs of the many, which doesn't sit well with others.Overall, with great CGI, decent to good acting, pretty good story, and some likable characters, 2012 is a fun and entertaining ride into the end of one world and the beginning of another. The big question that haters should ask themselves when reading this is, ""What would you do when the end comes?"" What i know is that you don't know what others would do if it did come. Therefore, the actions of the characters in the movie are plausible (except for some of the incredibly close calls).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I refer to the notion that the Chinese would build those enormous arks and then let a SINGLE non-member of the Chinese Communist Party on board. In fact a far better ending would have been for American submarine commanders to issue.an ultimatum: Let everyone else on board or we nuke them all. Then the Chinese call their bluff, and the only survivors in the entire world are those on the subs. Plus some dog. This may sound silly, but it would be far better than this very bad joke of a film.

One of the best disaster films in a long time,"2012 has received a many mixed reviews since it was released but this is by no means a terrible film. It however does feature things that will annoy people such as a character risking their families lives to run back to a burning vehicle and clichés that we have seen many times before but if you watch this knowing what to expect, you will enjoy it.In some ways this is the disaster film to end all disaster films. There is so much destruction that the special effects crew have had to work incredibly hard to show cities being torn apart by earthquakes. Those who do not like special effects in films and prefer practical effects will not like the film. 2012 overloads on the amount of special effects completely but without it, the makers would be restricted to what they could pull-off.As mentioned earlier the story is clichéd and generic. You know how it will end but that does not take away from the enjoyment of the film. I do however wish that they added something supernatural about the film. At the start it mentions that there has been a mass suicide where many hundreds of Mayans have killed themselves. After that there is no other mention of it again and 2012 becomes just another disaster film. They could have made hints that aliens were involved etc but we are forced to forget that. Had they of tried something different, this could have made the film more exciting and interesting.While the film is not perfect, it is enjoyable and Chiwetel Ejiofor does another good performance adding to the human element of the film in how we must stay together during tough times.

Well executed and surprisingly satisfying.,"I went into this movie with much skepticism. Afterall, this year's mega budget pictures have all ended up feeling like a high-class tranny hooker. Good on the outside, but in no way pleasing nor satisfying on the inside, not that id know. (ie. Transformers 2)Especially with such a huge topic of THE END OF THE WORLD, you'd expect this movie to fall flat on its back after half an hour or so (ie. Knowing, good Lord what was that). But this movie did surprise me.It did not try to conjure a convoluted and nonsensical plot-line to justify the end of the world, and the sub plots all come together a tad shakily but albeit, steadily eventually.What I enjoyed most was the attention put to the different moral aspects of human nature and survival, and the reign of goodness vs selfishness in human morality. It wasn't deep, but just addressing this seemed sufficient to bump up a couple of points.See this movie. Its well done (for its genre of disaster flicks) and is a visual treat.

"""When they tell you not to panic... that's when you run""","The quote I chose for the summary is an example of how this may frighten people(and I mean outside the safe environment of the darkened movie theater). Let's start by getting that out of the way; the world is not going to end in three years, scientists agree that it will not be that soon. And before you say ""but the Mayans said..."", no, they did not. That's a common misunderstanding. No, the fact is, their calendar *for a certain period of time* ends 2012. And then another one starts. Actually, as far as I understand, they did not really predict an Armageddon. There are people who want it to mean that the planet will be toast in that little time, and, hey, if you want to, I'm not going to stop you. Just... if you want to be informed, look it up. Don't listen to every self-proclaimed Nostradamus. With that out of the way... this is typical Emmerich stuff. If you've seen one... yeah. The effects, which are excellent, are the focus. A lot of them don't affect the viewer; their grandeur and epic scope alienate us. FX improve and their status gets upgraded from ""story-telling tool"" to ""main attraction"". There is not room for much emotion, though this does evoke a bit here and there. And it definitely is a cool ride of dumb, fun thrills. I can't claim that I wasn't excited and entertained, at times, or that I was pulled out of the experience by anything. The pacing varies, and the thing's at least half an hour too long. Tonally, this is mostly serious, with some comic relief(and the majority of that is not irritating, and that's a nice surprise). It even garners a few laughs, here and there. The acting tends to be great, and the cast is good, and well-chosen. Unusually, the children are not annoying. With few exceptions, this has marvelous editing and cinematography. The script displays naiveté and contains clichés. There is violence(largely mild) and intense sequences, as well as infrequent moderate to strong language in this.

not that bad!,"OK so this wasn't the greatest action film of all time, nor the best written, but the film isn't that bad! honestly i don't know what people expect the idea of this film was always going to be purely for aesthetics! the scene through the streets of California is jaw dropping yes they do survive a thousand falling buildings, but at the end of the day it is still a film. designed for entertainment. a lot of the comments on this film say how unrealistic it is, and that some of the plot is unacceptable, but i think there reading in to it too much, the film although long does not drag like the last 30 minutes of the legendary lords of the rings finale! overall the film is a good action film just to sit back and watch, with some of the best CGI to date. If the viewers want to watch a realistic film then watch a documentary!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Great CG work, predictable story.","Watch the film at cinema this early morning in China. Very impressive CG work! The story is predictable that from the beginning you know what will happen at the end. I rate 9 for the CG effects and 6 for the story itself. An advice: If you choose to watch this don't wait for DVD release, watch it at a cinema will give you unforgettable visual effects:)And something funny is that I heard this film was never cut by gov when delivered to censorship board just because in the film China build the arcs and save the world... That was really funny because gov always want to cut something from almost every film comes from overseas.Anyway, it's a good film:)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Woeful,"Terrible. Just awful. I'm not a 2012 enthusiast by any means but it's a giant mystery, it's meant to have a bit more substance, a bit more plausibility than just another block buster movie with terrible acting, a poor script, a non-linear story line and poorly inserted ""sentimental moments"".Nothing about this movie made any sense whatsoever, and had I the time to put every reason why it was so poor right here, I would. Well I do have the time. But I have a 1000 word limit.Poor acting (through poor scripting) made me hate this movie after half an hour.Too many ""disastrous"" and ""suspenseful"" moments that were both bland and predictable.Too many scenes with sentimental moments that were poorly orchestrated and didn't fit into the current scene.There was no immersion and I felt like I was watching a B-grade movie.You can't win people over any more with the George Lucas way of doing things.

My Comment,"Spectacular ride depicting disaster, Best what Roland does. Tried to have too many emotions which made the movie a little loose at those moments; Independence Day had good emotional moments. What amazes me are the depiction of Director's imagination of destruction so well put on the screen without any flaw. Few scenes were unnecessary like Jackon's son trying to help his father specially after an emotional moment with him earlier; Jackon taking his daughter to meet Charlie knowing very well that it could be dangerous. It is also not known how the AirPlanes arrived near China without any Air-Trafic contact when everything down there was destructed. But I guess we can skip all this to be amazed by the special effects. Roland should definitely survive the End of this world :).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good To Inspire People To Do Something,"Many people around me went to the cinema to watch this movie thus I heard different tunes from this people. Some didn't like it at all, some say I loved it. For me, it's a masterpiece to show everyone what kind of an end is awaiting us, even tough it's a bit (more than a bit probably) exaggerated. Then why did I give 6 out of 10 ? Here we go..First of all, the movie was toooo long. You had to sit about 2,5 hours to watch the movie. If I were at home and watching it on BlueRay, I'ld probably give 3 breaks. That's one big minus for my sake.Also, regarding the music, I didn't hear too much. Did you ? You might say ""why on earth are you complaining for not hearing music?"" but for my sake,music is a must in a movie. And I believe there are excellent scenes for musics. That's also another minus.The relationship between father and son.. That's a bit strange. I didn't really like it.After all, this is a disaster movie and it shows all of us how bad things can be if we still keep on devastating the world. From what I learned so far in my life, there is no joke you can make to nature! Eventually nature takes the revenge and it usually happens with a very bad ending.I don't know if you noticed but, there are only a group of people survived after the disaster. So we're all dead! Ready yourself or do something to avoid it happening. One man can't save the world, but if there are hundreds of millions of these ""one man""s all around the world, something can be done.

Hysterically bad,"2012 is undoubtedly Roland Emmerich's worst ever film, worse indeed than 10,000 BC. It's an outrageously bad movie, a bloated and laugh-filled variant of those late '90s disaster movies that proved popular for a time (DEEP IMPACT, VOLCANO, etc.) Clearly a labour of love for the director, who wrote as well as directed, I'm frankly incredulous over the huge amounts of money spent on this movie's production costs.The plot, in essence, sees the Mayan prediction of the end of the world in 2012 come true. Yes, it's already dated, and yes, it leads to the same old disaster movie guff. Danny Glover's the shoe-in for Obama here, while the likes of Oliver Platt fill suits and Woody Harrelson frankly embarrasses himself as a conspiracy nut. Thandie Newton reminds you of why she hasn't been seen on screen since MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2; she's simply a not very good actress.Best of all is the sub-plot involving John Cusack and his whiny/bratty kids. Cusack is like Road Runner in this movie, outrunning various disaster scenarios over and over again, until I lost count. He outdrives earthquakes, outflies volcanic eruptions, the list goes on. The special effects are admittedly spectacular - and the only reason to keep watching, I have to say - but the repetitive nature of watching Cusack escape from the brink time and again really shows off Emmerich's lack of creativity. Why not employ some help, somebody to use their imagination instead of simply repeating stuff over and over? Only in Hollywood!",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
entertainment above all else,"2012 is a AAA Blockbuster, a popcorn eating summer film, a movie one watches for a single reason: Entertainment. 2012 immediately establishes a visual style that can transition from ordinary scenes to special effects sequences nearly flawlessly. Pace is very well managed, and all the scenes follow a logical tempo - depending upon the nature of the given content. In other words this film is well produce and well directed.2012 is a highly kinetic, outlandish natural disaster movie - that easily could be considered the best of this particular genre. The absurd, over the top nature of the special effects sequences has to be seen to be believed, and even more recent films like San Andreas are 2nd class compared to the audio visual display in this film.Casting and performances are way better than one would expect in this type of movie - for all the action and spectacle? The characters carry this film from scene to scene, with no weak links. There are some stand out performances by Woody Harrelson (short but sweet) and Tom McCarthy (who's strait guy act in insane situations is so convincing, it's easy to overlook his excellent performance throughout the film).While I'd consider this a movie the whole family can watch, there is an element of darkness in the content. While this movie isn't violent, implied violence occurs as a result of the disaster, regularly. Even the main characters face consequences, which is necessary to maintain the films tension.I'm a huge fan of the overall morality of this film. It overtly maintains an optimistic attitude, while tragedy occurs in every major scene. Perhaps this is because this isn't a serious film, but it is an interesting dynamic regardless. The film clearly takes sides in any science vs religion debate - taking the side of science, which is perhaps ironic? Because many very basic scientific principles are regularly broken in order for this film to work stylistically. Not to mention the title of this film presents mystical prophecy. Regardless, I appreciate how this film presents this argument through storytelling, right from the opening scene.I would say this movie gets off to a fantastic start, starting the tension off with big ideas. The first act is by far the best part of the movie. It's punctuated by (imo) one of the greatest special effect sequences ever created for the big screen. It relies heavily on computer graphic effects, and I think many viewers simply can not suspend enough disbelief to fully enjoy this scene, but if you can? Strap in! and enjoy the ride!There is another noteworthy action scene that lives up to the first, but other that that - the effects come when needed to show the spread of destruction and chaos. This would be my one major critique of the film. The best scenes are in the first couple acts, then the final act is more about individuals being brave in much smaller scale scenes. While this allows more focus on all the main characters, I'd rather have the mother of all spectacle scenes to end the film, actually trumping the scenes earlier in the film.But that may be a bit of a harsh critique, when really? This movie doesn't make any huge mistakes. The story is complete, characters are developed, and spectacular large scale scenes unfold in (somewhat) of a believable manner.One more comment on the special effects. In all of the large scale scenes, the way water, chunks of earth and buildings crash against each other? It looks... realistic! I mean, if a 5000 ton chunk of a mountain was thrown a mile in the air and landed 100 meters away you in reality? It would probably look and sound something like the special effects in this film! While this movie relies heavily on computer graphics, all of the CG has an actual depth, and the consistency of the lighting in the CG that is combined with live action shots? All I can say is the visual style of this film is quite the achievement.2012 was made for 200 million (quite a bargain, really) and made 150 million in the US and 550+ million overseas. So in a way 2012 is one of the movies that can be blamed for insipid AAA films that, attempting to gain the largest world audience, end up being an unwatchable mess to seasoned fans of films. But I would argue that movies like this and the original Charlies Angels had such great overseas success not because of universal appeal, but because they are examples of quality AAA films that emphasize entertainment above all other qualities. Great filmmaking still needs to occur! Emphasizing entertainment may cut some corners with logic and force an audience to suspend disbelief... but you can't make trash films like the Transformer sequels and then just expect they will succeed! And this is why I really appreciate 2012, and feel it holds up to multiple viewings. Regardless of its ridiculousness - 2012 contains a ton of quality film making.Entertainment! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not A Bad Film, For What It Is","Rather than write a full review at this time, let's just sum this up: the plot is implausible, the science ridiculous, the jokes cheesy and the action way over the top. That being said, if you want to see John Cusack living a fast-paced world of action, Woody Harrelson as a manic preacher, and don't mind a near-infinite series of improbable coincidences and things falling apart, this movie is for you.One side note: what is up with the romance and family stuff? Cusack's character is separated from his wife (Amanda Peet) and she has a new beau, who seems likable and the kids love. There's sort of a subplot of Cusack and Peet maybe getting back together, but what's the motivation? It never really makes sense.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What happened to the Mayan prophecy? Only one place survives in the whole world?!!,"An epic adventure about a global cataclysm that brings an end to the world and tells of the heroic struggle of the survivors.This is what the plot is supposed to be, a heroic struggle & epic adventure. But, that was all only on the paper & not on screen. What you do get for your money is over the top special effects, with lots of good looking people having family crises & personal battles & they come together to save the world!! If you think Twilight Saga films dialogues are cheesy, this gives the word cheesy a whole new meaning on an altogether different bad level. You don't feel for any of the characters even when they are about to die. Every 5 minutes, there is a 'close call' that our heroes have to survive. How I hate myself for getting sucked into this garbage. What is more disturbing is the amount of success this film had. With the amount of money this film had riding on it, it could have given us a wonderful insight into the Mayan world & the present world when the catastrophes begin. But, it doesn't deliver. Even John Cusack, whom I like is bland. Everything about the film is boring & the special effects don't save the movie.I was aware that I should not expect much when in all the trailers they only showed things being blown up or cracked open. But, what I saw I couldn't even believe it, the characters are there only as an after thought to the effects. Ronal Emmerich's latest film had an amazing PR mechanism in place which drove herds of people in & many were tricked into believing that what they were seeing was actually good. This film was racist & idiotic. I am really glad this is Emmerich's last film. He seems to have lost his touch.Neither John Cusack's candy floss image, nor Amanda Peet's oomph manage to salvage a film that was meant to survive solely on mind-blowing special effects. What the makers seem to have forgotten is the fact that we've better video games today that allow us to create our own endings with similar special effects. Don't even think about watching this garbage even if its for free. I hate myself for paying to see this.2/10-Girish, 20",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

We were warned,"At this point in history we are not going to discover Roland Emmerich and we are not going to get our hands on the head because of his way of conceiving what they call the seventh art ... but, on the other hand, it is fair to recognize that Emmerich does not deceive absolutely To anyone, that their creations are alarmingly spectacular, and that their products radiate honesty and sincerity as few.With respect to '2012', we can say that this film can be evaluated from two different perspectives: letting ourselves be carried away by the monumental circus of fireworks that is offered to us, or by valuing the film objectively as a mere cinematographic product. In this second case would come very badly, as expected ... then, let's see that offers us as a visual show capable of leaving the mouth open to the viewer.With respect to the above, the goal is more than fulfilled, because if other ""fantastic"" films have achieved a level of spectacularity and special effects almost insurmountable, there is no doubt that Emmerich exceeds that quota here, and In addition with much difference. Without going further than reality, the film is a constant roller coaster of incessant spectacle, without limits or concessions. The action scenes and hecatomb are captured on screen with a realism and veracity that, honestly, is not remembered if we look back. The truth is that '2012' is nothing more than a fun ""blockbuster"" of escape that does not bore a bit, since we do not give us a second of respite. Each scene is bigger and more surprising than the previous one, and this added to the terrible and deafening rumble that accompanies each and every one of the most striking sequences of the story, turn the tape into a true pyrotechnic ""show"" that keeps the viewer with the Eyes like dishes An attraction that does not leave anyone indifferent. '2012' is the 'mother' of all catastrophic genre films,In short: This festival of Roland Emmerich fulfills what it promises: earthquakes devouring whole continents, volcanoes erupting in unison, meteorites destroying everything there and for having, and tsunamis as incredibly shocking as unlikely. So do not look for anything more than an effective entertainment product, because you will not find it. But who wants to see the greatest destruction on a world scale ever told in a movie, this is the perfect product for it. Of course everything depends on the level of tolerance of each viewer.Pros: Their incredible and dazzling scenes of destruction and the amazing special effects!Cons: We are not going to complain about the absurdity of his script, the histrionics of some of its sequences, or the simplicity of its development ... but of its certain excess of duration.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Doomsday, Roland Emmerich Style","The same director responsible for previous mega budget extravaganzas as 10,000 B.C., INDEPRENDENCE DAY, GODZILLA, and the often-maligned DAY AFTER TOMORROW is at it again. This time, Roland Emmerich destroys the world with a specific date in ""2012."" The whole premise of the film is based around the ancient Mayan calendar, which predicts the date of December 21, 2012 as signaling a profound change in our globe. Of course, this gives rise to all manner of speculation and debate among scientists and theologians alike. But in this film's case, it involves a severe solar storm somehow affecting our planet's geological plates to the ultimate extreme, and the arks that are being built to house as much of what will be left of humanity as possible. Among those caught up in the calamity, and those the audience can feel some empathy for while the world is being swallowed up whole, are a failed sci-fi author (John Cusack) and his family, and the geophysicist (Chiwetei Ejiofor) who saw this Apocalypse coming in 2009. In the meantime, during the 156-minute running time of ""2012"", save for a typically Hollywood nut job role for Woody Harrelson (as a Manson-inspired conspiracy theorist), we are witness to every disaster possible in reality, and possible only because of the special effects.As his filmography shows, Emmerich is more in the Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay school of super destruction than the more refined nuances of a Spielberg or a Kubrick, so nobody should go in with any grand illusions that ""2012"" is another ""2001."" It certainly doesn't have the poignancy of the earlier 2009 doomsday drama KNOWING. Still, the performances by Cusack, Amanda Peet (as his wife), Ejiofor, Oliver Platt, Danny Glover (as the last U.S. president), Thandie Newton, and, in a minor cameo, George Segal are at least enough to cover the frequent lapses in its credibility.In every sense of the word, ""2012"" is as insane a film as has been made in Hollywood in a very long while, and that's saying a lot. It's certainly not a masterpiece in the traditional sense. But in terms of extreme spectacle and CGI genius...well, it might as well be.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A Great, But Eventually Drawn Out Movie","The movie 2012 had heaps-of-hype around it, and I finally got to see it after 4 years. My friends who had seen it said it was absolutely fantastic, and since they have pretty much the same taste as me in movies I trusted them. I rented it from my local library's movie section and watched the next day, after watching It. It started kind of slow, with all the bits and pieces, and eventually it just got boring. Soon after, though, the real stuff started happening. Explosions, People dying in horrific ways, buildings falling - all that jazz. For the first 90-100 minutes the movie was enthralling, and that was the beginning/middle, and eventually it just got to a point where it was still good and entertaining, but got kind of old after a while. I was hanging on until I got to the end, though, because I knew with a movie like this, the end must be awesome. I was right. I'm not telling you what it was, though. There were absolutely astonishing visual effects in the beginning/middle of the movie, and they looked oh so very awesome. Nice job, Mr. Emmerich and VFX team! Anyway, there were very few scenes in the beginning/middle/end of the movie that weren't awesome. Except in the end, I got kind of bored because it was long, and drawn out. Was it intense? Yeah! But it was just one of those movies that you really really like, but just want to end about 20 minutes earlier. The end was, hover, a subtle retelling of Noah's Ark, and that's really all I can tell you about this movie's end. There were some real shockers, too, and they will probably leave you in disbelief, if you are interested in the movie. By the way, only a 1 or 2 of my reviews have spoilers in them, so you should go check those out, too. The acting was everything you would want to have in a disaster flick, screaming, yelling, and tears, and everything else. You can really feel the emotions of the characters at times, especially with Harry who has a small role played by Blu Mankuma, a very skilled actor. The end was where the tired wall really hits you. It was good, don't get me wrong, but I really wanted to shave off maybe 15 - 20 minutes of the run time. My apologies if this is a bad review. I'm kind of out of it because I just went jogging, and before that watched a 158 minute movie that I'm reviewing right now. Anyway, I do recommend this movie to you if you like good movies, disaster movies, or are in the mood for some good, old -fashioned explosions. See ya!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This should still be watched in ten years,"When I went to see Independence Day, I was expecting to see a apocalyptic aliens-destroys-humans that would nonetheless be a realistic portrayal of how humans would react in such dire circumstances, and how with cleverness and with spirit rather than sheer power, we would triumph over the aliens.I left that movie very, very disappointed. However, watching Independence Day 10 years later, I really enjoy what it is. Dumb, escapist cinema with amazing special effects, cheesy over-the-time action sequences and corny dialog. But what a fun movie it is! 2012 (from the same director) is exactly the same. If you go into the movie expecting to see an intelligent warning about the effects of global warming, explanations and links between different apocalyptic predictions and any scientific plausibility, you will be desperately disappointed.However, if you love ridiculous action sequences, cities crumbling and being swallowed by giant tsunamis, really corny dialog, over-the-top characters and are prepared to sit back, enjoy the ride and occasionally laugh your head off, then this is for you.I loved it. Its like one of those cheap b-grade action/sci-fi movies with dialog that are so spectacularly bad, that its actually funny. Yet it still has some legitimate, intentionally funny moments - despite being about the apocalypse. The only difference is that this movie has the budget, the actors and an amazing crew and special effects team to make it work.For the people who said it was boring, I just don't get it. They must not be a fan of action movies. Or prefer something that actually has hand-to-hand combat.The only reason I gave it a 7, is that although its a pretty looking movie, I can't really excuse the bad writing. I didn't really care too much about the central characters enough and there wasn't an emotional journey there. Even the huddled masses didn't seem real, so that made all the death and violence was very detached.But regardelss, I was thrilled, amused and had a great time.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The end of world?

There wasn't a moment where the Lucky Family That Survives wasn't a few feet away from seething magma, tumbling tube trains or colliding skyscrapers. While films of the worst sort are sometimes made bearable by the very idiocy of their plots, this piece of flavourless chewing gum just kept giving back the same cardboard taste, with plot and script fitted into the tiny cracks between the action scenes.

"OMG2012 might happen. Actually, I'd rather die on 12/21/12 than watch this again.","Funny. On a recent episode of Family Guy, Brian gets a earful of truth serum from Quagmire and the last thing (of many) Quagmire said was: ""You know what, I could forgive all of that, all of that, if you weren't such a bore.""I forgave a lot of what was wrong in 2012 but the one thing I couldn't bypass is that it was such a bore. And that was the one thing that surprised me the most. Even knowing it was way too long at over 2½ hours, I didn't expect such Pearl Harbor moments that made me yawn and wonder what the heck were they thinking?What I did know, was how silly it was from the 5-minute internet-released trailer. I figured I would laugh, or at least snicker at some of the scenes. I found myself doing that at more than one occasion, and it wasn't the blatant and unrealistic destruction scenes. It was just how bad this movie was, when they tried to show ""heart"" or ""feeling"" or ""warmth."" Or at the consistent ""near-misses"" for our, uh, so-called, ""heroes."" Or the number of plane dipping.Despite the sometimes good special effects – I honestly can't justify giving it an extra half star for that due to the overwhelming negatives, I will say this in the movie's favor: I didn't snicker or laugh out loud as many times as I thought I would. (Side note: I watched both Twilight and The Happening because I was in the mood for a comedy and for the most part, I did laugh heartedly throughout those two films.) In this film, I was just simply bored. And also previously mentioned, this movie was so Pearl Harbor, where there were just a few scenes of mass-destruction, the reason people would want to see this mess or the reason they made it, and the rest was just plain awful. Awful, awful, awful and terribly bad.Shame on you, Cusack. Selling out. Again, that is. You could've been one of my all-time favorite actors. It all started going downhill since Con Air. Sure, he's had one or two good movies since, such as 1408. (Weird, perhaps he should choose more wisely for movie titles that contain only four digits.)Following Emmerich's very similar The Day After Tomorrow, a million things completely impossible happen within a matter of days. Here we have the very wrong theory of 12/21/12 where the Mayan calendar ends and the world as we know it shifts axis, thus destroying all mankind and man's kind of civilization. Enter in the very stereotypical divorced dad (Cusack here, Quaid in Tomorrow) and his ex, his kids, the new beauthe whole cast is recycled sitcom/disaster-movie characters.Butthat's not what you bought a ticket for, right? It was to see big explosions. Am I right? Well, unfortunately, they're so few and far between, it's hard to justify a recommendation – heck, it's like 40+ minutes before anything happens. And what's worse, is the fake ""heart-filled"" scenes and really, really, REALLY bad jokes and puns.Okay, this movie is fairly, make that enormously easy to ridicule. It wasn't made to earn Oscars – though I am sure it's going to be up for special effects, but come on. Try a little bit. Try to show real emotion, real dialogue, real people. Do something memorable.I expect this out of Michael Bay. He cares more about using gasoline to explode stuff than character development, genuine thrills, emotion and plot development. Though Emmerich is only a half a step higher, he will genuinely win the contests between the two buffoons. Here, he not only matches Bay's horrible movie-making qualities, he almost takes the prize away from Transformers 2 as the worst of 2009.To sum up, this movie is all disaster movies in one: Armageddon, The Day After Tomorrow, Poseidon, Pearl Harbor, Independence Day, Deep Impact, Dante's Peak and many more. Heck, it mimicked Wall-E, and I should be shot for stating that. It has horrible acting, clichés (oh, the clichés!), dialogue, comedy and thee most unrealistic scenes of flight ever on film. I mean, really, how many lives do these nobodies have? How many times do we have to see a plane dip? Seriously, how many coincidences and luck-outs do this boring broken family have?I think this was sincerely made for only two types of people: those who actually believe 12/21/12 is the end (ha ha ha ha ha – I've said this before, but I sincerely don't believe in this ""end of time"" conspiracy theory, but even if I am wrong, I'll be dead with everyone else, so who cares?) and for those who just blindly want to see millions die as buildings collide. To each their own, but I appreciate a movie-goer who appreciates film as an art and not as mindless special effects engine.And the joke's on you people. Both kinds. But, speaking specifically to the later group, you'll get like maybe 30 minutes out of 158 of what you paid your money for. I'm glad you'll have to suffer through the rest, for the low taste you have.(Okay, that last part was harsh. Again, to each their own. But each ticket sold – like the never-ending Saw series, justifies these crappy movies. I have made it a point to cease watching the Saw movies for this very reason: I have to stop being part of the problem. For the money I spend, I expect more.

A Spectacular Mess That's Still a Thrill to Watch,"2012 is the kind of movie you go into expecting chaos, and it delivers. Directed by Roland Emmerich, it's a full scale visual spectacle that shows the end of the world in ways that are both thrilling and wildly over the top. With entire cities crumbling into the ocean and waves engulfing mountains, the film doesn't hold back on the effects. It's a wild ride, especially if you just want to watch things explode.That said, the story and characters are pretty basic, almost feeling like an afterthought. John Cusack plays a down on his luck dad racing to save his family, but the character arcs are shallow and the dialogue borders on cheesy. However, if you're here for sheer disaster and action, 2012 doesn't disappoint. It's loud, relentless, and at times even unintentionally funny but it's also undeniably entertaining.So, while it may not be the most intellectually satisfying film, 2012 is a fun disaster movie if you're willing to go along for the ride and not think too hard.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
At least the popcorn was good.,"In case you haven't heard, ""2012"" is about the end of the world. Actually, that's the entire plot, so maybe this should be considered a spoiler.Estimates are that this movie cost about $260 million to make. I guess a quarter-billion dollars just doesn't buy what it used to. It's roughly twice what Roland Emmerich squandered on ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" which is apropos, I suppose, since ""2012"", believe it or not, is every bit of twice as bad as ""Day After.""I'm not even sure where to start, but writing is always a good launching point. ""2012"" is a careening, convoluted cacophony of practically every possible disaster movie cliché. We have the usual ticking clock, a common literary device, arbitrarily accelerated when the writer/director felt a need to heighten the tension. We have flat, transparent characters who end up being little more than placeholders around which to construct the endless, tiresome special effects. And, of course, we have the special effects, so shamelessly and randomly contrived as to render the destruction of the world tedious. I ended up wishing the world would hurry up and end already, but no, there had to be yet another, and another, and another, plot twist; inartfully conceived, predictably staged, and completely inert.The cast fared no better. John Cusak is one of my favorite actors, but he had no character to portray. Do we really need another hack writer, failed husband derelict trying to remain relevant in the lives of his children vis-a-vis mommy's new, rich husband? The kids were just two-dimensional cutout characters - mere props in the CGI scenery. Danny Glover, a passable character actor, was completely out of his depth as The Last President of the United States. Even George Bush seemed competent and intelligent by comparison. Oliver Platt, Thandie Newton, Amanda Peet, Woody Harrelson - all fine actors, were lost within characters lacking even a hint of humanity or depth.The only thing this movie has going for it, although obviously not what Emmerich intended, is that it is pathetically funny. We laughed till our sides hurt as we called out each and every plot device before they were hauled out with all the subtlety of a train wreck and the unfailing predictability of an atomic clock. What's worse, each new twist was more ridiculous than the last until, as we roared with laughter, the entire Earth itself was conveniently shifted at the exact moment and extent necessary to start another cycle of completely absurd events.""2012"" is epically bad, monumentally stupid, and cataclysmically boring.

There are multiple scenes that will make you jump off the couch and spill your popcorn. Dare I venture to say it is even a ground-breaking film? Sure, why not. This film is made up of several different disasters, and each one puts its reigning genre kingpin to shame. For instance, the volcano scene is better than ""Dante's Peak,"" the flood is better than the ""Day After Tomorrow,"" the tidal wave is better than ""Poseidon,"" and the earthquake is better than, well, ""Earthquake.""

And I will never ever see any of Mr Emmerich's movies after this catastrophe.The story is stupid, but that's OK - no one expect it to be any different, it is a disaster movie after all. But there has to be some nice characters, some jokes and funny moments, and a totally unconvincing but happy end. In 2012 there are so many characters, and none - none! - of them has any charm. There's too much of them and they are all dull. How is that even possible?! John Cusack was in this film just because of the money. Like Sean Connery once said: ""Good actors sometimes do stupid movies for lot of money"".No jokes. Not one. No happy end. What kind of movie is this?!I'm sorry I watched this film. This is Emmerich's bad - and 2,5+ hours long! - ego-trip. I wish I could know how it's possible to make such a bad film with so much money and so much levels of control - which producers, editors, art directors etc. said to Emmerich ""Yes, this is it!"".Don't watch it.

"Check it out, just don't take it too seriously.","Going in expecting the worst (I'm talking Transformers 2 bad), I came out pleasantly surprised and satisfied.However, there are more than a handful of critical issues with the film. The biggest and most prominent one that continued to strike my nerves was the comic relief. In a film depicting the end of the world where millions upon millions of people are dying comic relief and any sort of humour at all is BEYOND unnecessary. It just doesn't work.Period. It seriously hurts the film and without it, I would have awarded the film with at least another star Also the dialogue and most of the characters are corny and poorly written.This is somewhat expected from a disaster flick. However, it gets really distracting and for such a grand scale disaster film, some more time should have been put into fixing this problem to enforce the credibility and believability of the whole film.The visual effects in the film are easily the strongest point but we all knew that anyways. the scenes of disaster are beautifully crafted and look wonderful on the big screen: this is definitely a must see in the theatre. There is enough destruction to keep the film interesting and it is properly spread out throughout the 2 and a half hour runtime. SO surprisingly, the film kept me entertained for the entire length and I never once thought, ""When is it over?"" The story is much stronger than i would have expected and does a decent enough job at setting up the disasters and stitching them together well enough. It is in no way excellent but it gets the job done.The film plays out like a corny 70's B-disaster-movie when it was advertised as a dramatic, ground-breakingly real and chilling depiction of the end of mankind. The later is what it should have been. However beyond all of it's flaws the spectacular visual effects and solid enough storyline are enough to merit a recommendation.Check it out, just don't take it too seriously.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It ended the day this movie was released!!!,The fact that it has been three years since a movie motivated me to write a review should tell you just how bad this movie is!I love John Cusack. I ignored all the negative comments about this movie to see him in it. John - I hope you got a huge paycheck for this movie cuz it STINKS!2012 is just over the top stupid! IT is way too long. You would have to check your brain at the door to miss all the plot holes in it. There are glaring factual errors throughout! The running time keeps you checking your watch wondering when will all the lameness end!

The acting is better than average for a movie of this sort, and the special effects, although a bit cheesy, are adequate.Mind you, had I paid ten bucks to see 2012, I might not have been quite so amused — but if you can get a free ticket, or if you're willing to wait for it to reach cable TV (probably a month or two), it's not a bad way to kill some otherwise unoccupied time.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Is this the title or the runtime?,"One of the most tepid, vapid and intelligently challenged films to come down the pike in a long time. The film is a catalyst for this star studded cast to arrive together and deliver what I think is each of there worst performances to date.At 2.5 hours, and a series of clichéd written, clichéd driven scenes, we are impatient and rooting for old mother nature to devour every single person in this film. It's a sad state of affairs when we watch films about the end of the world, and we have no emotion towards the outcome.Oliver Platt plays once again the moral slime-bucket that he's done in previous films. Danny Glover feels like a night custodian at the local hospital than he does as President, and Woody Harrelson delivers a performance so misguided and buoyant that I thought he was channeling a retarded version of Hunter S Thompson.

"Passable Special Effects, Wasted Actors, Done to Death Story, Almost Three Hours Long, Verdict: Terrible","Normally, I would say movies like '2012' are unintentional comedies because they're so bad that it's funny. '2012' has all the clichés: You've got the hero and his family who will survive no matter what. A majority of the survivors are Americans. Hero's kid also contributes to saving 'humanity'. You've got Russian who speak in such a terrible accent that one barely understands what's being said. You've got the American president who is so good at heart that he stays back to die with his people. You've got a madman who knows where it's safe. Blah blah blah. Now the thing is such movies have already been made so many times before that this isn't even the least bit amusing for the most part. The special effects are mostly good but in some parts they are downright terrible. The enviable cast that includes John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Woody Harrelson, Danny Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Oliver Platt and Thandie Newton are entirely wasted. You don't see actors act here. You see them either running, screaming or gasping. Thanks to the terrible writing (yes, even the dialogues are atrocious) none of the actors are given scope to perform. My parents tend to enjoy such movies, mostly because of the amusement and special effects, so for me watching it with them would be spending quality time. I certainly didn't expect it to be any good but I thought at least there would be something to look forward to where acting is concerned. Little did I know that '2012' is additionally almost three hours long.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Special Effects good, everything else ridiculous","This is an archetypal disaster movie that closely mimics the directors previous efforts (Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow) in many plot aspects. There is very little in this movie that comes as a surprise, except perhaps for the number of times certain characters survive ridiculous situations.That being said, if you don;t take it too seriously (which is a pre-requisite anyway for most disaster movies) this is an enjoyable effort, if a bit over long. Some of the special effects are superb and fully enhanced by the cinematic experience,I can imagine it would be a good choice to watch at an Imax. The acting is in general pretty good, an area a lot of these films can fall down on, with John Cusack his usual brilliant self in the main role and he his ably supported by the rest. I especially liked the appearance of Lance Henriksen (Bishop from the Alien films, a legend in my mind).If you want a fun and exciting film this definitely delivers, if you want something original or thought provoking this is not for you",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Worst. Movie. Ever,"Writing a review of this worthless movie would even be too much effort. This is total crap. The most impossible things happened, cliché after cliché.

A shotgun pointed to my head would be the only way to get rid of my frustration at the moment.I'm just happy I've downloaded the movie, because going to the cinema would be the worst 5,- ever spent. There are just so much impossibilities in this movie, writing a review would just take me as much time as watching the movie. So, this was a waste of what used to be perfectly usable bandwidth, not to mention the devaluation of my TV.Lol@myself. After a few months I see this review again and decided to mix a bit of nuance into it. First, I gave it 3 stars instead of one. That's for the visual effects that aren't that bad. The story however is still one of the flattest, nothing-containing ones ever.Some explanation is needed for those who did not see the movie. You do not get to know the personages anyhow, they remain flat and anonymous. The acting is just bad. Why is there suddenly a romance that did not grow on any way out of a divorce full of irritation to each other? 'OH, my beloved husband is dead, let's just kiss with my ex-husband who I have hated for years?'So many things that happen are so just NOT possible. The coincidence is just totally over it's head. By the way, I don't write English essays often so please excuse me for English is not my main language, if I do make some mistakes don't mind that too much.

Will the end of the world really be this cheesy and ridiculous?,"Eye-popping, cheesy nonsense. A vote of at least five just for having a good laugh at how dumb it gets. Production wise, it's a disaster, and I'm not referring to the earthquakes.A note to the writer/director: Earthquake faults do not chase people. Not even when they're driving on suburban sidewalks at 100 miles an hour. People do not drive through collapsing buildings or collapsing freeway bridges. Guys with two beginner's flight lessons cannot pilot anything, let alone giant specially designed Russian planes. There is no such thing as a ""countdown to tsunami impact"" device. No one, not even John Cusack, survives 50,000 life/death situations in a single day without getting killed a few hundred times or so. Nobody on this planet can climb out of an RV falling into a giant sink-hole, and then outrun an airplane on foot, and get pulled into it by the arm as it takes off. That's just a few of this film's outlandish moments. You expect exaggeration and chaos in a disaster movie, but 2012 just blasts you like an atomic bomb.Forget about the Mayan calendar premise. Instead, we get some nut who looks like a cross between John the Baptist and Howard Stern. He's hiding out with a mammoth radio transmitter in an old trailer in Yellowstone Park, and broadcasts his meandering conspiracy/Armageddon rants. Why nobody triangulate his signal, or notices him hanging from trees yelling at the top of his voice, is never explained. Yet Cusack listens to the guy's ravings from 1,000 miles away in southern California, and hopes to get some map from him.Other annoying characters: essential divorced father with brat kids. (At least the little girl was good in her role, really the only character worth caring about. But even with her, they introduce a useless sub-plot.) The Russian billionaire or whatever he was and his doggy-toting blonde bimbo? And don't get me started on those twins from a horror movie. Why all these fools? By the way, Oliver Platt is third in the line of Presidential succession, in case you didn't know. Just ask him. Character and story line clichés assault the audience mercilessly. The line ""Nothing should come between us,"" is sad.After all the explosions, they find a few last things to destroy, until there's finally just nothing left to blow up. Such a whimpering end would never do, so the film desperately resorts to utterly pathetic plot contrivances.

A very entertaining disaster movie,Wasn't expecting any deep meaningful characters and story-lines from this so I wasn't disappointed. This is a disaster flick and it so delivers. The best part is of course all the natural disasters and destruction. And it is brought to life by very realistic looking CGI. Even after a decade later effects look real. There is a decent story about a family literally outrunning natural disasters.

"If Mankind Can Survive This Turd, It Can Survive Anything!","From the director of Independence Day, Godzilla & The Day After Tomorrow, 2012 features all the ingredients that one may find in a Roland Emmerich movie; be it the total disregard for science or logic, his obsession with the destruction of the world, nonsensical storyline, annoying characters, near-fatal overdose of visual effects & countless facepalm moments.Inspired from the 2012 phenomenon that made a bunch of retards actually believe that the world is all set for an imminent apocalypse near the end of the mentioned year, the story of 2012 follows a science-fiction writer who struggles to keep his family safe when a series of global catastrophes threaten the fate of mankind, and covers his attempts to bring his kin to refuge.Co-written & directed by Roland Emmerich, 2012 is another addition in the long list of brainless blockbusters that he's churned out throughout his filmmaking career. And although most of his works do rank amongst the worst movies ever made, there are still a few that are fun to watch, like Independence Day. However, 2012 simply sets a new benchmark for how dull & stupid a movie can actually get.The set pieces are grand & digital, and their destruction is what this film relies on to entice its audience. The plot is illogical yet highly predictable, the script sucks and the dialogues are eye-rollingly cheesy, Camera is busy capturing every cataclysmic event this movie has in store, Editing is virtually absent for its 158 minutes of runtime actually feels like eternity. And its background score is loud & irritating for the most part.The visual effects are all over the place for it's quite impressive in a few sequences but look totally cartoonish in other effects-laden segments. Almost every natural disaster make its way into the final print, and is so much exaggerated that it looks real funny & is eventually made all the more hilarious by the characters caught up in that situation. Coming to the performances, everyone attempts career suicide here but few still manage to survive.On an overall scale, 2012 is by every means an insult to human intelligence. There's no fun to be had here unlike a few earlier works in Emmerich's filmography and just being able to sit through this turd of a cinema should be considered an achievement in itself. Guaranteed a place amongst the worst things anyone has ever made, 2012 effectively captures the indomitable will of human spirit to survive against all odds for if one can sit through this torture, then one is definitely capable of surviving an apocalypse!

"Wayyyy too long, 100% reliant on SFX but annoyingly effective.","2012 sh*ts me. Not because it is terrible or hackneyed or lazy, but because it is none of those things. It is actually pretty effective. Annoyingly so.Why I even chose to pick 2012 off the rack I'll never know but one way or the other it made it to my pad and sat happily in the DVD tray for 157 minutes(!) while I hated myself for actually not hating the film, which is at least 30 minutes long by the way.So the film. Scientists do sciency things and perform sciency type tests. The upshot of the matter is it appears that the human race is soon to be forked, as in stick a fork in it, we're done. This is relayed to the Prez of the U.S.A. (Danny Glover. A BLACK Prez? Yeah right!) who initially sez let's keep this on the low-low.Meanwhile Jackson (John Cusack), an author/limo-driver (now there's a winning combo!) picks up his two kids from the ex-missus for their Daddy-Kids weekend that is to be spent camping in a National Park Let me just zip through 90 minutes of not much by saying that after meeting a scientist who has the answers but ain't telling, and a pot smoking hippie played by Woody Harrelson (WHAT A STRETCH!) who claims to have the answers but who can trust a pot smoking hippie? Jackson, kids, the ex and her current hubbie end up fleeing the West Coast of the US as it crumbles and falls around them.The benefit of CGI is that they can be shown just evading certain death in dramatic fashion. The pitfall of CGI is when they do it 77 times over an hour constant near death becomes a little dull.Roland has the nous to show enough famous landmarks going under so that the audience can identify them and say ""Oh, we went there honey!"". This always annoys me but what can you do? In Independence Day it was the WhiteHouse, in The Day After Tomorrow it was the Statue of Liberty (Yeah I didn't see it but it was on the cover and trailer), and here it is a variety of well known locales and landmarks.It turns out the well-to do and those in the know are all heading to China where a Plan Z is in effect, so Jackson and hangers-on hitch a ride with Jackson's mega billionaire employer, a Russian mogul for whom he chaufferred and off they go. Once in China they realize that not all will be admitted and that sacrifices must be made so that many can survive. But do they need to all die or are some decisions made so that the wealthy have more legroom? There are weasely politicians who do weasely things, especially as the deadline approaches, good people who make the ""Big"" decisions and try to convince others of the ""right things to do"", and the usual coincidences that keep embroiling Jackson and co right in the middle of the action.The film is essentially a big SFX extravaganza like Titanic and Avatar, you can see exactly where the money went. Like Titanic it is an overlong film with near miss after near miss that gradually gets stale and loses impact, but unlike Avatar this just doesn't have the ""WOW"" factor that gets you moving around in your seat.Near the end I asked myself just how many near misses I could take before I started rooting for nature and natural disasters to take 'em out. Fortunately one of the redeeming factors is that the kids aren't just little smarmy sh*ts, in fact further to being merely tolerable near the end Jackson and son have a ""serious"" chat that was actually surprisingly effective Then something exploded, some people screamed and we were back to business.Final Rating – 6 / 10. If this really was the end of the world I'd want then to hurry it along. 2 ½ hours of disaster gets on my last nerve! The film is frustratingly effective for reasonable periods though.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"The Trailer was a Masterpiece - The Movie, not quite","When I first saw the Teaser for this film (way back in July), I had a feeling that this could turn out to be a masterpiece. The second trailer released later only seemed to strengthen my beliefs. It's only when I saw the five-minute clip that I started having my doubts - after all, I was seeing a scene play out from the movie (almost) exactly the way it was meant to be seen. My doubts were confirmed as I watched this movie today (as a matter of fact, I'm writing this review just an hour after I saw the film).There's very little of a premise or plot here (which, though expected, is disappointing). An American scientist learns from his Indian friend that the Earth's crust is heating up and proceeds to warn the White House about the same. The U.S. President, together with the heads of the other nations chalk out a plan to assure the survival and existence of human species. Meanwhile we have Jackson Curtis, a writer cum limo driver who is going through a troubled relationship with his wife and kids. After some initial build up (as is the case with all of Emmerich's disaster films), the world starts coming to an end.From here on, the film becomes more of a CGI spectacle with Curtis and his family escaping one disaster after another. And therein lies one of the fundamental flaws in the movie. The family manages to make many nail-biting escapes (as is visible in the five-minute clip) which, after a while becomes a bit tedious to watch. Sure Emmerich tries to make up for it by killing off some characters (which I would rather not reveal) but by then, you've already lost most of your interest.Also, there's not much of a back story behind the doomsday and build-up to the D-day becomes a tad too predictable. It would have interesting to have got some more insight into the end-of-the-world prophesies. It almost feels as if the actors are trying too hard to be serious while none of it transfers to the viewer.The performances come across as average although I really liked John Cusack as Jackson Curtis as the writer - limo driver. The effects are quite well executed and although at times you can make out it's CGI, I believe it is still the main reason why most of the people are seeing the film (and it better be the only one).On the whole, although I liked the movie as a whole, I really hoped for it to be better (at least as compared to Emmerich's previous disaster flicks). Perhaps Roland's insecurity after 10,000 BC prompted him to cram this movie with as many effects as possible which makes it nothing more than an apparent excuse to make a disaster flick. So I suggest those who can be quenched by VFX alone, go for it. Expecting anything different would only be a disappointment for you.Score:6.0/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

And this film delivers all the calamity of a hot Italian family feast without the mess.Speaking of hot, the core of the earth is boiling over from too much sun, spots that is, and John Cusack, in a role usually reserved for Nick Cage's bank account, plays a writer fated to save the world from earthquakes, tsunamis, and Woody Harrelson.It's all good fun, actually witty in parts, with alternating state-of-the art CGI and cheesy process shots.The only real disaster of 2012 is the 157 minutes.

I found myself jaded. There were some really ""cheep"" shots that you were not even amazed because how cheep it was. You could practically see the green screen. Then there were shots that were pretty remarkable. Like, at one scene there was a Indian family kneeling and in sorrow. Then there's this considerable tsunami behind this family whom on their knees, and they have this dismay look on their faces. This was great scenery. Honestly I'ts nothing to waste money on. Just wait till it comes out on HBO, or something. It's entrusting because this movie was written to have this Bible and Titanic perspective. It built this arc and crowded animals and limited people on it. Instead of birds there are helicopters, it also involves to the bible but the greed of David, and a chain of killings. In Titanic their ship gets git by an iceberg, in 2012 the ship gets hit by Mt. Everest...??? Also this one ship type thing hits the other ship type thing.

With Deep Impact and the Day after tomorrow firmly in my top 10 films, I had high hopes that 2012 would be just as good, if not better than these incredible films with its use of the latest advances in cinematography. However a great disaster movie it was not meant to be, as a general film straying into science fiction it was enjoyable but not thrilling.I think my main issue with the film was that normally there is a hero or a few heroes, who you are rooting for all the way through to survive. 2012 bills John Cusack as the hero of the hour, who realises just how important his family is to him. However although I adore Cusack normally, my heart just wasn't in it and while I want him to survive, it doesn't ultimately make a difference to me either way. The film also was jam-packed with action, probably too much so, nudging on the edge of believability, with cities crumbling within the first half an hour and whilst it was very dramatic, it feels that it's been drawn out and it's not until the last 45 minutes that you truly got into and felt your heart start to race.My other issue with the film was the way in which some characters were portrayed. Adrian Helmsely was presented as a hero who argued back to his boss, who said that it wasn't right what they were doing and demanded that more people should allowed to be saved. As a scientific adviser he seemed rather inept with ""temperatures are rising with incredible velocity"" just one of the many unscientific phrases tumbling from his humanitarian lips. Carl Anheuser was shown as the bad guy, the one who tried to control who would be saved. This is all very well and good, but if this were to happen then I would argue that Anheuser is actually the one in the right. Human life needs to be preserved and to do so does mean some sacrifices.Despite the incredibly dire nature of several aspects of the film I found myself actually rather liking it and am a tentative fan of the film. It does require a suspension of reality on the viewers part (but surely that's what films are for) and it does turn into an enjoyable film with a twisting plot that whilst it doesn't leave you aching for more does mean that the film seems to fly by as though you are strapped into a roller-coaster instead of sat on your sofa. The special effects used are brilliant and the actual plot line and ideas put into it are fantastic. The actors play their parts superbly, particularly Woody Harrelson and it is an enjoyable movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
My favorite disaster film,"English is my second language I apologize for my mistakes. It's my homework.I was pupil when film was premiered. This film is fantastic! I adore it. I rewatch every few months and always watch on TV channel.I can say that is one of the best disaster films. The cast is very good. The plot is very exciting. The special effects are high level. We thought what we will do when 2012 years start, after watching we understood, that we do not have any chances. The plot shows different scenes government, poor and rich peoples, relationships in families. When the world crashes, you are feeling different emotions from scared to exaltation of movie picture. I advise this film for everyone, because it worth to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great special effects!  Awful script and directing.,"The single most disappointingly moronic big-budget sci-fi movie since Independence Day.I'm stunned. How do these people get jobs in the movie industry? I feel genuinely insulted by this movie.So much money. So, SO much money. On what? There were probably 3 characters out of the 20 or so the movie focuses on that I actually gave the slightest smeg about, and that was purely because of the actors in question's previous roles prior to this movie, not because 2012 had given me any reason to like them.So many great actors, such a feeble script.I'm struggling to find the words. I'm simply blown away by the sheer scale of this trash movie.The special effects are superb, don't get me wrong, but it's like a couple-of-hours-long advert for a special effects company, seemingly made in the prime vacation period for all of the good scriptwriters and directors in the world.Insulting? Yes, insulting. It's every movie cliché you ever rolled your eyes at, tied together into a feature length bundle. I couldn't have felt less insulted if a flock of doves had appeared next to the ship at the end, carrying the dog and the Indian scientist guy to safety.Has to be seen to be believed!

Forget leaving your brain at home you need to be a zombie to enjoy this,"I remember seeing the first trailers for this, and like everyone else i thought. Wow! this looks great. I suppose it's hard to argue with the fact that this movie does look quite good and some of the CGI is impressive,however, the story is just so awful that it makes you throw your hands in the air and exclaim; ARE THEY ACTUALLY SERIOUS? This thing is an absolute disaster. Character development is terrible. Plot holes abound. The laws of physics or just common sense are just plain non existent. I enjoy video games so i don't want to make the comparison that this is like watching a video game. It's Not! Video games at least make an effort to develop a plot or make you feel something for the characters. This movie does neither. This appears to be the remnants of several other unfinished disaster movies all mashed together into a giant mess and unleashed upon the public. This is a stinker.

Why all the Hate?,"I don't understand all the pure hate shown for this movie. It's a disaster movie wrapped up in an end of the world storyline. Did anyone expect to actually learn anything from it? It's just entertainment. Mindless entertainment, really, but it's a fun ride. There needs to be a certain suspension of belief on the viewer's part. Of course it's not realistic, but it's not meant to be. It's supposed to be suspenseful and take you for a fun ride, while trotting out some decent special effects. I didn't see it in the theater, so I didn't pay anything to watch it. I enjoyed it.

Cheese Factor,"The largest problem with this film (and every film this director gets his cheesy paws on)is the same as films by James Cameron. The budget is bloated, the direction is over the top (which can work to its advantage) but the director deceives himself and tries to convince his audience that he can actually ""write"" the film as well. Both directors are terrible screenwriters or both came from the same grade school of ""Saccharin and Cloying Nonsense."" Someone needs to tie these guys up the second they decide to put pen to paper. I should have known from ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" that I would have to be carried home in a diabetic coma. Never again. If any producer with too much money on his hands needs to overdevelop a failing high school project, please give me a call. At least, I will not proclaim to be a talented writer. And I can make better for a lot less. Thank goodness it was digital. Imagine all the acetate created for this to only end up polluting the trash dumps of this country.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

What Entertainment is About,"2012 was one of the most sophisticated, high concept speculative pieces of film making in recent years. Big budget ""Event"" films are always panned by critics because they have garnered a stigma for lacking substance and relying on special effects to rake in the box office dough. Sometimes this is true. In the case of 2012, however, it is absolutely false. It reminded me, as someone who hasn't been to the movies in a couple of years (I tend to be indifferent to recent titles and wait for the DVD)what entertainment is about. It reminded me that films don't have to be super-serious art house dramas to be enjoyed - or at least to be confident in admitting We enjoyed it.I spent a roller coaster ride in a darkened theater for over two hours. It was intense, thrilling, emotional, and SHOCKER - it even compelled the audience to think. 2012 never tries to pretend it is anything more than exactly what it is - An adventure thriller that speculates the end of the world. It introduces us to relevant characters so the story is not simply one special effect after another. You develop an investment in their plight - rarely do big budget films allow you to make that connection with fully realized characters.This is more than just a disaster film of epic magnitude: Although Roland Emmerich has rightfully earned the title ""The Master Of Disaster."" It is the perfect film to lose yourself in for awhile, and leaves you with great tabletop conversation afterward. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys great character driven films with high octane visual spectacles!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fun,sad movie","Well I re-watched the 2012 movie since I last watched it about 2011, well back in the days I thought it was a beast of a movie but now it's not that beast, the storyline is alright and the CGI effects good depending on it was made 2009 So I'm giving it a 6 star score since it was a decent movie and I recommend this movie if you like those world end typed movies, I would like to see a franchise made when they start the new life after the disasters I think that would be amazing. Otherwise thanks for the joy the movie gave me.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Emmerich lost his touch,"I've seen most of Emmerich's films. Stargate, Independence day, and The day after Tomorrow we're fun, enjoyable blockbuster films. I enjoyed The Patriot, hell even Godzilla as fun in a way. After seeing 10 000 BC I felt he lost his touch.I did give him another chance with 2012 but he failed to deliver. I've never seen so many sappy clichés in one film. Some of the characters are more annoying than funny. The drama isn't believable at all.Still I have to say, the visuals are stunning most of the time.

Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow are definitely on my next-to-watch list though. Anyways, all I do know is that my heart was pumping the whole time, and I seriously yelled at one point in the theater. I haven't done that since I was in eighth grade.

Disaster Movie which became Soap Opera,"NO MORE HD-SCENES LIKE THIS PLEASE. I 've seen the film on one of the largest screens of South-Germany. The movie was projected digitally.

I was satisfied with the scenes which were shot with Panavision Camera and Lenses (35mm), but the scenes which were made with the video cameras ( Panavision Genesis HD Camera) I was very disappointed. Some water scenes at the end of the movie were shot on video and this destroying the atmosphere totally. It began as a great movie and ends partly as a dramatical soap in old fashioned ""Springfield Story"" 80s video picture quality. You are feeling you are in a catastrophe and then ...

My 2012th review...,"Subatomic particles from a massive solar eruption cause The Earth's core to heat up and the crust to destabilise, resulting in massive earthquakes, super-volcanoes and huge tsunamis that threaten to wipe out mankind. Amidst the chaos, author Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) attempts to save his family by taking them to China where the world's elite are boarding several top-secret 'arks' built to survive the disaster.2012 gets the scientific mumbo jumbo out the way pretty quickly so that it can concentrate on the emotional human dramas and spectacular scenes of destruction that are the staple of modern big-budget disaster movies. Director Roland Emmerich, who is no stranger to the genre, having already given us Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow, confidently handles the CGI-packed action, but with his film clocking in at a massive 158 minutes, and each successive scene attempting to outdo the previous one in terms of excitement at the expense of all logic, the film eventually collapses under the weight of its own preposterousness.The heroes of the picture face all manner of perils, always managing to escape death by the skin of their teeth, whether it be careering through the streets of L.A. as California slides into the sea, taking off from a disintegrating runway as Las Vegas collapses around their ears, fleeing Yellowstone Park in a camper-van while molten rock spews into the air, or conveniently crash landing in China (rather than the sea) thanks to the rotational shift of the planet. If it wasn't for the small fact that the world is falling apart all around them, I'd have these guys down as the luckiest bastards who ever lived.To be honest, the film's lunacy would be somewhat more bearable if only the film didn't go on for quite as long as it does; I'm more than able to suspend my disbelief for the sake of fun, but by the umpteenth incredible apocalyptic set piece, the special effects have lost their wow factor and the movie's melodrama has become so clichéd that it only serves to annoy. If the world does come to an end on the 21st December 2012, I sure hope its doesn't take as long to happen as it does in this film!Oh, and if by some small chance you find that 2012 isn't as far-fetched as you hoped it would be, be sure to watch the alternative ending—it's really, really, really dumb!5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for taking such an unapologetically absurd approach to Armageddon.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Special effects - great; everything else - should carry a serious health warning,"*sigh* Painful. Excruciatingly painful. Stupid, trite, clichéd, cheesy, corny, predictable, platitudinous, illogical, shallow.

An abortion of talent, intellect, mental stimulation... It's so dumb that it cannot even constitute mindless (literally!) entertainment.

This is one such instance, par excellence.It was only the cuddly company off whom I could bounce my searingly cynical comments that prevented me incurring brain hemorrhage about a half hour into it.If you have the slightest temptation to watch it, don't.

Don't think .. Just watch it and you'll enjoy it !,"This is the best disaster movie that I've seen after Independence Day. Amazing CGI action.

Do not expect a well-phrased script in this movie. The movie has exactly done what it was meant to do. People have been complaining about laws of physic and lack of realism.

You go wrong in few aspects, there will be people giving 1/10 ratings. They will have a dozen lines to write ""how the script was not good"", ""how the movie lacked realism in that X scene"". May be everyone wants everything to be damn perfect. I agree that movie could have been better with a better story line, but you surely can't rate it awful! The movie does has some flaws and it is not the best movie in the Hollywood. But also, it is very much better than many movies to which you have rated more than 6-7/10.

it was entertaining,"if nothing else,this end of the world flick form disaster specialist Roland Emmerich was entertaining.there sure was a lot of CGI used here.in fact probably ninety percent of the movie is comprised of it. December 21,2012 is the day that the Mayans predict a cataclysmic event will occur on earth,which has led to speculation that the world as we know will cease to exist.the movie only makes passing reference of the Mayan's,and instead just focus on on the destruction and mayhem side of things.maybe it's just me,but the special effects don't seems to have improved much in the last six years or so since the The Day After Tomorrow another big budget disaster opus,also from Roland Emmerich,which had a nearly comparable amount of CGI.or maybe i'm just jaded,and CGI really isn't that exciting more.either way,2012 failed to fully engage me,on an excitement level.the movie does however,has one thing in its favour.unlike many flicks of the genre,there were no real maudlin or sappy moments,no over the top corn ball inspirational speeches.and i loved Woody Harrelson's character.i also thought Thandie Newton was good as well.the movie wasn't boring.and for a movie that clocks in at 150 minutes before the end credits roll,that's something.for me,2012 is a 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A cheesy yet entertaining end-of-the-world film.,"2012 is not a particularly hard movie to review - that's because it belongs to such an specific sub-genre - the disaster/end of the world film - that it's almost impossible to be disappointed by it. That is, of course, if you watch it with the right expectations. One doesn't watch a film like 2012 expecting thorough characterizations, believable drama or exact science. All I expected from the movie was likable characters, amazing special effects and lots of destruction - and that's precisely what the film delivers. Because I went to see it with the right frame of mind, I enjoyed it. Granted, it isn't a good film by any means, but it's ridiculously entertaining, cheesy and visually exciting. And unlike films like Transformers 2 - which has very little redeeming value -, I didn't feel like my intelligence was being insulted. It simply wasn't required.2012 follows fiction writer Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), who is on holidays in Yosemite with his children, until an earthquake warning makes them return home, but not before he meets a seemingly-crazy guy named Charlie Frost. (Woody Harrelson.) He warns Jackson that the end of the world is coming on December 21st, and although he may seem to be talking rubbish at first, his theories - based on the Mayan calendar - eventually prove to be true. Anyhow, Jackson arrives at his ex-wife's (Amanda Peet) house, just as the destruction of Los Angeles is about to begin. And this is where all the special effects start appearing, and also when our protagonists have to start fleeing from all sorts of disasters in the most seemingly-inane ways possible.If there's one reason why people have flocked to see the movie, it is the special effects. And yes, these deserve a paragraph of their own because they are, simply put, amazing. Not credibly, mind you - these kinds of visually awesome disasters are almost impossible to make credible, and if they were, I'm sure they would be really boring - but interesting, tense and awe-inspiring. I'm not too sure which scenes involved a mixture of techniques and which ones involved pure CGI - well, maybe the more obvious ones would be the giant tsunami scenes -, but they all look breathtaking. Mind you, this is the end of the world we're talking about, so not only do they look incredible, but they also convey a sense of terror and desperation very hard to find in cheaper, lazier disaster films. The destruction of L.A. would be my favorite scene - not because you see lots of landmarks and recognizable places been destroyed - the city is pretty generic - but because it's a tense, pulse-pounding sequence that feels almost like a roller-coaster ride.Now, don't get me wrong - although that's the best scene, it is not the only one involving chaos. Unlike other disaster pictures - including director Roland Emmerich's own The Day After Tomorrow -, 2012 doesn't involve a couple of cities - it involves the whole world, and it involves a whole variety of disasters. We get floods, tsunamis, earthquakes, ash rain, volcano eruptions... well, you get the idea. And although the main focus of the film is on the U.S., we also get glimpses of Brazil and even the Vatican getting blown to smithereens. It's all very entertaining and also very visually dynamic, and the variety of it not only left me in awe, but also made me realize I was watching the ultimate disaster film - it will be very hard for any filmmaker to top 2012.And what about the actors? Emmerich, surprisingly enough, managed to get a very impressive roster of character actors - John Cusack, Amanda Peet and the amazingly insane Woody Harrelson I've already mentioned, but we've also got Chiwetel Ejiofor as a scientific adviser to the U.S. government, Danny Glover as the President, Thandie Newton as his daughter - and a potential love interest for the aforementioned scientist -, Oliver Platt as a somehow tired stereotype of the overambitious, selfish politician, and even Chin Han (""Mr. Lau"" from The Dark Knight) in a small but significant role. They all fulfill their roles adequately and without looking too ridiculous but, most importantly, they understand that for both the filmmakers and their audience, they are less important than the special effects and the thrills the film has to offer.The conclusion is silly - and has a very sci-fi feel to it - and there are some very fatuous, ridiculous moments, but the overall package is satisfying, if not completely successful. The screenplay is unapologetically cheesy - and some of the lines these respected actors have to say are simply terrible, but in a hilarious sort of way - and the direction is as over-the-top as it could be, but the amazing special effects and the whole grandeur the filmmakers convey more than compensates for it. And unlike directors like Michael Bay, who don't seem to know how to hold a camera still or how to maintain a shot for more than half a second, Emmerich allows his audience to be amazed by the special effects, providing with many epic ""money-shots"" and competent action sequences. 2012 may not be a ""good"" movie in the traditional sense of the word, but it certainly is lots of fun. Yes, cheesy, over-the-top and even a little long, but fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not as bad as everyone's saying,"Most of the reviews I've seen for this movie label it as a terrible film. it's really not.While the CG effects could've been better in some areas it was still really well done and the script could've used a bit more work. There was too much talking in some scenes where there should've been more action. The acting wasn't bad either. A lot of people seem to think that the actor's weren't really trying. I didn't notice that, I felt they did an okay job at least.Overall, if you really think about this movie it makes you think. How would humanity handle the end of the world. Honestly, I think if we knew the end of the world was near, something very similar to what happened in the movie would happen in real life. Questions pertaining morality, the government, our relationships with everyone around us would really be put to the test. The film had me almost crying in some places.Overall, not a bad film. It certainly IS a rush and will have you going ""WHAT THE -"" a lot with all of the disasters going on.

The worst of all end-of-the-world movies so far!,"The only bit of true acting is by Woody Harrelson. The rest of a very talented cast are just slaves to the green-screen and it shows.The story progresses at a nice pace up until woody harrelson exits the movie (and the destruction begins), and after that it is nothing but one 'huh...wtf!?' event after another. The vague attempts at humor, personal tragedy and emotions, or a humanitarian message all fall flat.And truth be told, the effects are not so good either, even if compared to Roland's own movies like independence day. And these movies are usually all about the effects! It is one thing to exaggerate and accelerate the progress of natural calamities to fit within the limited time of a movie and to keep the pace intact, but another thing altogether to insult the viewer's intelligence by random meaningless important-sounding dialogue and events just for the sake of it.

Another 'End of the World' Movie,"2012 was just another ""Apocalypse"" movie that was a stroyline off of the Mayan prophecy of the end of the world happening near the end of 2012. It was a baffling movie to me. John Kusack, was the average writer being portrayed and in the middle of what looks like a divorce with his former wife, who was hooked up with this ""rich and snobby"" surgeon. The movie started also with a Scientist, who came to another country and visited a friend, and discovered the truth of the temperature of the Earth starting to rise. The story takes us back to Washington DC, where the scientist demands a top official looks at the documents stating the facts. He reads it, and makes a call for his car to be out front and the scientist to go with him, next we see the United Nations, and the US president, played by a legend, Danny Glover, who inform that the world is coming to an end, and that their wasn't much time. That's when we see John Kusack, running to the kids, and proceeds to take them in a limo, to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. During the trip, while the kids and their dad are taking a walk, they cross a restricted area in Yellowstone, and a whole brigade of the U.S. Army shows up and takes them away. Throughout the entire story, we see the planet being destroyed by huge earthquakes, tsunamis, and other natural disasters, as well as the great and fatal Yellowstone Super Volcano. Every important person in the government, or children and spouses thereof, were given tickets to board huge ship vessels to survive the end of the world when it flooded. Towards the end we see, everyone fighting to get on, and a few people, sadly who I turned out to like in the end, die. The public was finally deemed freedom and safety onto the boats, just minutes before the water sweeps in and floods them, and they launch. There is so much argument and validity to this movie, it's confusing, yet gets exciting, it's emotional, yet happy in the end. There could've been a lot more done, and realistic scenes added to make this movie better.Overall Rating: 6/10 Overall Reasons: - Confusing Story -Wasn't exactly realistic looking all around -Acting and production could've been better",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

BIG Hollywood blockbuster action. Quite enjoyable!,"You want action? You got it. Get the popcorn ready, this is as huge as blockbusters get.The good: the CGI effects are stunning and impressive and even hilarious at times. You wont see anything better than these CGI effects, even in these days. The world is coming to an end, everything gets destroyed in a marvellous CGI special effects party. Great fun to watch!Any bad? It has got lots of quite cheesy feelgood scenes, but then again these are so masterfully executed that I can only enjoy them, however corny and silly some of them are.More good: lots (LOTS) of great actors starring in this blockbuster (Woody Harrelson, Dany Glover, John Cusack) and even the supporting actors are fun to watch.Everything you could wish for in a disaster movie.

This is a fun movie,"This movie was fun. It's a popcorn movie. The earth is ending and the cgi looks great on a really global scale. No, it's not academy award level for acting or story line but it was an enjoyable, fun, edge of the seat movie like independence day (not humorous though). I had fun and the time passed quickly for a long flick. It didn't seem as though there were any slow spots and plenty of nearly caught in the crevasse get-a-ways. Getting the cgi to make believable effects on global level, like you see in the trailers was kind of awesome especially on he big screen. If you're looking for a fun movie then go see it. Some movies are best seen on DVD or not seen at all. You won't regret this one if all you want is a fun time and not some meaningful epic. It delivers on all the popcorn levels.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's all been done before... and better.,"I was very lucky to get to see this movie before its official airing at a press-release in Riga, Latvia. I was so excited! I had been waiting for this movie since I first heard about its being in production. It has been a while since there was a decent catastrophe-movie. Well, at least not since The Day After Tomorrow (I so loved that one!). So, that was the idea I had bouncing in my head when I trotted down to the theater to see the end of the world in 2012. I got comfortable in my seat as I waited impatiently for the show to start. After all, it is more than two hours long. And finally it started! So, for me this was the peak moment of the movie. From that point on my excitement got deflated. Well, I admit, I might have been over-excited about it. I might have been too caught up in The Day After Tomorrow. It is one of my favorite catastrophe-movies. I was expecting an equally good story. Something new, maybe. I don't know much about making movies - I haven't made one, but I can recognize a good story. That is the key element I am looking for, but didn't find in 2012. In fact, it was a bad reproduction of The Day After Tomorrow. It's greatest problem is the incredibly week storyline. Come on! If you are going to spend millions of dollars on CGI, you might as well come up with a good-enough story to go with that. Something new, maybe This one is so predictable. It does not have a shred of originality and it is filled with clichés, and it is out of balance. I felt like there was the idea of the end of the world, which was not the background situation against which the story took place, but, in fact, the main character itself. I guess, I could say that it was overwhelming. Then there was this whole bunch of other stuff going on which didn't really made me care. It was like Yeah! So? I have seen it before. It was exactly the same. As you might have understood, I was disappointed in it. 2012 had some good actors playing the parts, but the story was all empty and cheesy, and the characters were not developed enough.However, I must admit that the CGI was awesome. If nothing else, you can enjoy that. And if you sit close enough to the screen (like I usually do), you might almost get to experience the feeling that you are witnessing the destruction of the world right there on the spot and get the sensation of general closure. That is the way it might happen. Any way, don't expect any more of it than the special effects – there isn't. In spite of my disappointment, I strongly believe that people differ and so do their tastes in films. No objective opinion is possible. I'm just expressing my own. If you feel that you might like this movie, go right ahead, and see for your self. Then write your own comment.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
the story was better than I expected,"I didn't see this at theaters because I thought this was just another special effects movie with a really poor story. After finally seeing it on cable, it was actually pretty good. The special effects are really good like everyone says; and I liked the story also. But I do think John Cusack was miscast as the action hero because when was the last time he played one. And also Amanda Peet is not a big enough star for the leading female role.Just get over the fact that the hero, Jackson Curtis, accomplishes some impossible feats and just enjoy it. Sure can one really believe Jackson driving a limo and old RV over cracks in the earth and jumping huge holes. Or flying a plane though a huge volcano ash cloud or missing all those firey rocks spit out of the volcano. At least the Russian guy Yuri got what he deserved but why Tamara?

Unbelievably horrible,"This film was soo long. Every character so unlikeable and unrealistic. Everything was such a cliche. Every ten seconds they escape by the skin of their teeth. How stupid does this director think audiences are. How mind numb do you have to be to enjoy a piece of garbage like this. I felt violated by the time I got to the end. Like a long hot shower would not get the bit of soul that died while watching this back again.Non existent plot. Why, when every single person on earth is dying or dead do I care what happens to this boring trite family? Why do they think I wouldn't just rather watch then get squished or drown or burnt or disappear into an abyss.

Entertainment at its best,"This movie was so much fun to watch! I went in with my best friend to watch it, and I walked out of the movie theater very satisfied with the experience. Emmerich is a great director and writer. Special effects were awesome, John Cusack performance was very believable. All the children were amazing. However, Amanda Peet's performance was terrible. It was so fake. And although Thandie Newton is an amazing actress, her role here was redundant. The movie is over 2 hours long, but the time went by pretty fast, it has non-stop action scenes, and emotional moments at time.

The normal things happen, like big disasters and stuff, but there is a lot more. This movie is really long so a lot of stuff happens. I was never bored with the movie, because they always keep having different things happen. So yeah I was entertained throughout, but that doesn't really justify the insane length for the movie.

gargantuan disaster,"The biggest single problem with 2012 is the length. It's butt-numbing runtime saps the soul as much if not more than the tired excuses for characters the film inflicts its carnage on. And because it goes on so long the unfolding disaster, shots of tsunamis; earthquakes et al become increasingly repetitive and the very small but eminently predictable plot twists barely register as surprising or important given the film's grander scheme. The leaps in logic are too big and the reality-stretching scenarios seriously beggar belief far too many times. To outrun one disaster is entertaining, but to outrun 3 in one day seems just plain silly - even in Hollywood's no holds barred world of the disaster movie. There's no dialogue to speak of (how apt!) and the cannon fodder is dispatched in mighty world-shaking style but after peaking early with the chaos in California the film has nowhere left to go, no higher gear so the end finale seems little more than a damp squib. Thos are 3 hours of my life i'm unfortunately not going to get back.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fall of Roland Emmerich,"Well this was heartbreaking film from beloved Hollywood director Roland. Though I am pretty sure that this movie going to earn at least twice or thrice of its original budget.. Well thanks to Sony pictures marketing strategies and awesome trailers. Yeah Trailers are the only thing abt this movie that are awesome.Well let me start my review with little more un conventional way I am not going to describe anything about the story (Because there is hardly any story that exists!)The term ""Jaw dropping"" is used so many times relating to this movie and I am also no exception.. In praise or in hate..(huh!) Visual effects of this movie was jaw dropping.. The attention of details and massive scale really never seen before. (I guess) its very difficult to tell which scenes were vfx one and which were not. The plot of the film was Jaw dropping (I could not control laughing) when end credits started and they said Written By: Roland Emmerich & Harald Kloser ? written by..? are u kidding? they haven't written anything.. this movie has only some good shots featuring VFX and no story no character development no good duologue's, no praise worthy performances.This is going to strike hurricane in worldwide box office but people with brain going to hate this one. this one can surely compared with Transformers-2 in No brainier category.

Mediocre film.,"The film can entertain when we focus on the catastrophe sequences which are spectacular. But to our bad luck, the film has a plot and is weak to the extent that it presents us with a misunderstood hero with too much family attachment, a series of secondary characters who are either frivolous or unbearable and finally shows us in the broadest way a humanity. Incapable of foreseeing or solving a single problem jointly. The pace when it accelerates is good but the little empathy generated by anyone who appears on the screen makes us concentrate on the technical aspects and not on their story. This is where the film's flaw lies and that is why, despite having memorable moments, the final result is mediocre.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Because I always get a kick out of the ridiculous, unbelievable, impossible things happening on the screen. This movie is the worst in terms of logic, but the bonkers stuff I see makes up for it. The effects are fantastic, as is Oliver Platt, who comes close to being the most rational character in the movie, even if he is a bit heartless. He even comes out better than Cusack, whose reactions are logical, but his actions and escapes highly improbable. I know Ejiofor is playing a role, but boy, did his character annoy me. Thanks in part to the brief and wacky appearance and info dump by Woody Harrelson, I consider this to be the best disaster-themed B movie I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Drenched in exaggerated drama and clichés,"If you combined Independence Day and The Day after Tomorrow, took out the cool one-liners and added the most amazing SFX you have ever seen, you would get something like this.It has all the characteristics of a bad mainstream action movie. The plot, characters and dialogs are so predictable I found myself laughing during some supposedly dramatic scenes. Every time the protagonists make a close escape from the Cataclysm happening around them, it's in the last possible second. Every time the vehicle passes a potentially deathly obstacle, it's by a few centimeters. Such close escapes CAN create drama, but they are happening throughout the entire film, at every possible moment. At some point, you will get bored with the predictability. The whole movie is so full of clichés, part of it is actually painful to watch. While most of the actors are doing a solid job, they can't overcome the awful script.The special effects, however, are what makes this movie worth watching. You can overlook the terrible stuff that usually makes up a good movie when you watch the destruction of a whole city, a huge wave rolling over the Himalaya or the eruption of what was once the Yellowstone National Park. These are truly the best SFX I've ever encountered in a movie, and they are the reason you should watch it regardless of its bad, well..., rest.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pathetic Random Movie,Totally nonsensical movie. I gave this movie 3/10 just because of the special effects of this movie. The movie did not have any story sense and all the characters seemed very weak. I am not sure what script writer was thinking when he was writing the dialogues of the characters while they were in grave danger they were sounding like they are out on some kind of adventure ride and everybody knew they are going to make it and there was no sign of doubt in anybody's mind which made the whole plot very weak. Also there were some scenes which actually disrespect certain countries and their beliefs. Overall a total non-sense movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS C-grade movie.,3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Roland Emmerich's bloated excess: either it works for you or it doesn't,"In 2009, geologist and presidential science advisor, Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor), uncovers evidence that a new offshoot of neutrino radiation is destabilizing the Earth's core which will in turn cause plate tectonics to destabilize. White House Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) brings the news to President Wilson (Danny Glover) and at the G8 summit the attending nations formulate a last ditch effort to save a select few of mankind before the projected end date of 2012. Failed science fiction writer now limo driver Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) eventually stumbles across information of the inter-governmental cover-up spurring Jackson to take his estranged family on a journey across the world to reach salvation before it's too late.2012 from master of disaster Roland Emmerich came about from Emmerich's desire to do a ""biblical flood"" movie while putting his own stamp on it. Written on spec, Sony Pictures acquired the rights to the production and gave the film Emmerich's largest budget at $200 million (though Emmerich claims it came in below that). Bolstered by a gargantuan marketing effort across theatrical trailers, TV spots, and internet marketing. Released to negative reviews (typical of most Emmerich movies) the film nonetheless paid off big time making $769 million against its budget making it the fifth highest grossing flm of 2009. The movie is pretty standard for Emmerich at this point featuring all the hallmarks that are routinely tapped into by the directors, and while I'd rather watch 2012 than 2009's other high grossing box office trash fire Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, that doesn't make 2012 ""good"", just less bad.2012 is a showcase for cities and continents being blown away by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and floods. 2012's aspirations are about topping the world destroying superstorm Emmerich created in The Day After Tomorrow, and while he does so (at least in terms of sheer enormity) at a bloated run time of 2 hours and 35 minutes 2012 overstays its welcome and becomes grating rather than endearing with its stupidly explosive excess. Our plot armored group of heroes led by John Cusack's Curtis Jackson (50 Cent reference because reasons) go through a cycle of narrow escapes from exploding earth and on two instances fly a plane of a crumbling runway. Despite the silliness of The Day After Tomorrow, the characters at least seemed to be under some level of threat from the disaster and didn't always narrowly escape it. The movie tries to frame the debate of pragmatism versus humanism with Chiwetel Ejiofor and Oliver Platt representing the two sides and the movie inadvertently works against itself by having Platt's character (who I'm pretty sure we're supposed to hate) be the one spouting the most reasonable arguments for his position while Ejiofor's points are strings of flowery cliches that feel pretty empty. The characters we follow are pretty grating and may be the worst characters I've seen in a Roland Emmerich movie since the ones from Godzilla especially with a pair of Russian twins named Oleg and Alec who belong to a sleazy oligarch named Yuri who are prominent and abrasive supporting characters in the movie. While character is not at the forefront of this movie's mind, even the spectacle feels ""been there done that"" with the money shot featured in all the trailers of flood waters crashing over the Himalayas just reminding me of the much more visually interesting tidal wave sequence in New York from The Day After Tomorrow.2012 is an excuse for explosive disaster carnage, but with a bloated length and underdeveloped characters it wears out its welcome as mindless fun and becomes grating stupidity. Emmerich's destruction is here certainly, but it feels like a more overstuffed version of what was already done with The Day After Tomorrow. If you're just looking for a mindless time killer this might fit the bill, but I can't give it any more than that.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awful,"If I was told this movie was conceived and written by a brain-damaged eight-year old, I wouldn't be surprised; and I would, in fact, probably feel justified beating up said kid and taking their milk money. I used to be a pacifist. Then I saw this film. Now I hate humanity.Everything about this film is cliché. The absolute worst part of this atrocity is that it's so poorly thought-out. Even the special effects are mediocre and not worth sitting through the film for.And since this is an end-of-the-world movie, I don't think it's much of a spoiler to say that a majority of the world's population gets killed; what is especially offensive about this movie is who survives, and that we're supposed to be happy that the people who do 'represent the future of humanity'.Absolute and total garbage.

This is as fun as they come.,"If you want the world to end then hire Roland Emmerich. He has alien spaceships at his disposal. He can turn on a global warming crisis that causes a modern day ice age. Heck, he even has a giant lizard to cause a bit of damage. If all of that wasn't enough the German director can now make the Earth's crust shift so much that cracks consume entire cities, Yellowstone park turns into the largest volcano in the world and tsunamis almost reach the peak of Mt Everest. Damn.Looking for bang for your buck? Look no further. Emmerich's latest in all things destructive is a spectacle like no other. What makes it so impressive are the remarkable special effects; if buildings and freeways were ever going to fall into mile long crevices in the ground, then this is surely what it would be like. The abundant use of CGI is not subtle, but it doesn't matter, because it seems so real and the gigantic set pieces that it features in are so bloody exciting. Of the multitude of adrenaline pumping sequences the plane taking off in L.A. is a highlight; seeing Jackson and his family fly between 80 storey buildings that are collapsing is a sight to behold. The U.S.S. John Kennedy aircraft carrier slamming into the Capitol Building is a quick scene that stands out as well.There's probably little point talking too much about the plot. Unsurprisingly it's a load of baloney, but the fact that you're not thinking about its implausibility and predictability due to the constant action is a feat in itself. The cast do well to provide entertaining pawns on the Emmerich chess board: the always likable Cusack makes for an easy hero to root for; Ejiofor gives his scientist a humanistic element; whilst Harrelson is the standout in his deliriously amusing role as the whack job who predicts the end is nigh.It may be slightly long – the final 30 minutes can't keep up the pace of the preceding two hours – and naturally there are plot holes galore, however this is as fun as they come.

However, if you are looking for a thought-provoking, profound commentary on human society and a movie that will leave you pondering your own existence...you may be slightly disappointed. 2012 really came through with the much-hyped special effects and budget, proving the money was well spent. The action was well directed, the CGI flawless, and the carnage displayed in truly impressive epic proportions. Unfortunately, this movie suffers from being preachy, and VERY cheesy and clichéd at several moments.

Roland Emmerich - what else is there to say,"Would somebody PLEASE, for the sake of good movie making, take the directors chair away from Roland Emmerich. Along with Shia Labeouf, Emmerich ranks as one of the two most inexplicable people coming out of Hollywood in my entire lifetime. All they would have to do is get together for a project and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" will no longer be the worst movie ever made.To be honest, I did not even know that this film was directed by him at first. But it didn't take long before it became obvious who was behind the camera. It had the same warm fuzzy feeling that all other Emmerich movies have, yet still manages to fail at making an emotional connection with the viewer. He just puts a few basic dramatic elements together, adds a shallow attempt at political commentary, dubs in some melodramatic music, then pours on the special effects. That in a nutshell is the official Emmerich formula (also see Independence Day, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow).As for the characters, there are basically four types in the majority of his films. The first three are unbelievable a-holes in power, cool old men who are fathers of the protagonists and crazy, but intelligent nut cases. Most others fall into the third category as passionate and sensitive wimps who always do just the right thing even if it is completely stupid. Makes me feel all furry inside just thinking about it.If I had to say anything positive about 2012, it would be that it is at least better than Godzilla. But not by much.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Is this a poem about a tidal wave? Or are you trying to tell a story? If you want to write a story you'll need one or MAYBE two of the three conflicts and these will need to be Major recurring themes in the plot, person vs. self, person vs. nature, person vs. person (( and then the ever popular person vs. divine occasionally crops up)). THis movie has no fully developed conflict. 3) Amanda Peet is still hot hence 2 stars. 4) Crossroads = awesome. As in the song by Bone Thugs in Harmony. They are not in this movie, nor is the plot device. the characters in this movie are somehow on different planes of existence when I am pretty sure they were ""acting"" right next to each other.

It was honestly not that bad,"I am serious. I am usually pretty harsh when it comes to critiquing movies, but this definitely didn't deserve all the horrible reviews I read. I think it might have been one of those cases where one person pointed out a flaw, then everyone saw it and only judged it based on that. These flaws were the characters' never-ending ""clutch"" escapes from their doom. Constant death-defying moments. I mean, how many times can you escape the Cataclysm? I guess more than 5 times, according to this movie. One particular example was when the family got in the car right when the earthquake happened to be at their doorstep, literally. The ground was collapsing just a few feet behind them as they ""out-drove"" the apocalypse. Okay now that I am done bashing movie, I would like to say some good things about it. John Cusack, once again, never fails to bring a calm, cool hero to the screen. Well there were a couple times he shouted and cussed, but who wouldn't if the world was ending? There were a few corny dialogues shared in the movie, but definitely not enough to lessen the score. The CGI was great and entertaining. Most might say the movie was far too long, but I think that is because movies have become far too short. I was satisfied with this movie. I think it is a great family movie, aside from the inappropriate cussing, but it was seldom. Definitely worth a rent. Though a scary subject, the apocalypse is always something interesting to see how others would portray it. Don't let these other reviews hinder you from watching this movie! I just wonder if the leaders of the world really would abandon their people to save themselves...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointing disaster movie,"As a lover of disaster movies, this was a big let down. The special effects were excellent but the back stories and dialogue were disappointing to say the least. John Cusack is a very good actor but was totally wasted in this.Most major disaster movies demand you to suspend belief a bit but this film took that to the extreme. Some of the films set pieces were so improbable as to be laughable.Compared to higher quality disaster movies like Deep Impact and The Day After Tomorrow this comes across as laughably amateur. The ending like most films of its type is predictable and dull.On the upside the scenes of destruction are well done and entertaining.Overall I expected a lot more but there is enough entertainment (just) to merit further viewings.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Disappointing movie with great special effects...,"OK people, I'll try to be as objective as possible in evaluating this ""blockbuster"" and give you a hint whether you should watch it...The only reason I gave it 4/10 is cause of its really great and ultra-realistic special effects that puts us in the center of apocalypse...BUT.. and this is very big BUT- this movie contains almost NOTHING else to offer besides those effects. The storyline is non-existing, characters are.... wait?.. WHAT CHARACTERS?? They are just pile of stereotypes.And even the main ""virtue"" of the movie- special effects, are rolling one after another, working against themselves, because after a first 10 minutes of destruction (seen in trailer anyways), which btw. are the best part of the ""2012"", you became desensitized and detached from the happening in the film and believe me- you will not care if any of the main characters live or die, which is death sentence for any kind of movie.This also has a lot to do with Emmerich's constant forcing of ""nearly escaped death"" sequences which are, in their unbelievability, more appropriate to some action-hero type of film then here.And, bear in mind, that I wasn't looking Oscar-worthy performances, wasn't comparing it to ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Gone with the wind"", just wanted it to be at least as good as ""The day after tomorrow"", or ""Independence day"", but this one is sooo inferior compared to those earlier works of Roland Emmerich...So, all in all, to conclude- 1) Should you watch it- Yes, cause you want, cause everyone else will, and you need to see those effects on big screen. 2) Will you like it- I really really doubt that, unless you are 10 y.o. 3) Is it a good movie- ummmm...

Worse than I had imagined,"I heard about the movie later than most because I don't watch TV so much. When I did it was something like ""hey, did you hear about that movie that comes out this winter with the end of the world?"". So, naturally, I thought the worst of the film itself. Then I heard about Roland Emmerich directing it and started to have hopes. Then the first reviews from friends came out. I was told it was nothing else than the total destruction of the Earth, but not much else. Well, that should be fun.Now my subjective view on the matter: they hired some graphics engineers and told them to destroy the planet. Engineers, given their nature, happily obliged. Meanwhile, the director was looking for actors that are cheap enough, but known to all, so that people actually notice the scenes they are in. After the graphics guys did it, they shot the actors around the scenes and tried to give the film a story. And failed. But who cares about the story anyway? So they shipped it. (well, it's a pun in there, but you have to see the movie to get it).Le me recap. Neutrinos mutate! they come from the Sun! they interact with matter! so the Earth crust crumbles worse than in Neverending Story under the assault of the Nothing (here is the part you want to see), while cars honk and subways continue to function (meh, engineers). In the end the people of the Earth (the rich ones) regain their humanity and help a bunch of other stranded rich guys while the world ends. Why didn't they just make it a game? Or an animation movie? What was the purpose of all that pseudo scientific mambo jumbo?Bottom line: watch it with a lot of popcorn and sickly sweet juice, preferably with some mutated neutrinos. They'll get the joke.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Don't expect much, but just enjoy watching the world destroyed","I didn't remember what I had heard about this movie, but I knew from the TV listings that this was a movie about the Mayan prediction that the world would end December 21, 2012. There is the obligatory expert trying to convince those that can do something that this is a big deal. And the something they can do is prepare. This cannot be stopped. But as in the case of ""The Day After Tomorrow"", once it starts and cannot be stopped, it's happening too fast for anyone but a select few to survive.And only wackos will believe it's happening. One in particular is a major focus of this movie. He is the standout performer by far, and not once before I saw the closing credits did I imagine this would be Woody Harrelson. He has too much hair to be recognizable, but still--this guy is good! With some sort of low-budget connection with the world to get his message out, he has a few followers. And he takes risks. When will he ever get another chance to see such calamity?Danny Glover as the President gives a dignified and authoritative performance that made me think of Sidney Poitier. I knew he wasn't old enough and didn't look quite like the man.Another standout performer is the quiet Tibetan holy man.And of course the visual effects are nothing less than fantastic, if you had the ability to advance one frame at a time, which I didn't. It all happened too fast. And miraculously, almost every disaster happens in such a way that a main character or characters escaped JUST IN TIME! Yes, I said every disaster. This is not one disaster. This is many disasters, all over the world, happening in just a matter of days. Pick almost any world landmark (okay, that's an exaggeration--they picked about a dozen or so) and you can watch it crumble.And then of course there are the people. Not a lot of quality performances, but a bad Lifetime movie where it just happens the world is ending. That's fine for me. I like having this dysfunctional family as a focus. A scared 7-year-old girl who is actually quite resilient. Her slightly older brother who resents that his father is no longer around, even though circumstances have sort of reunited the family. A pretty mom with an attitude. And a rich doctor whose contributions will prove invaluable. And let's not forget Dad, the hero of the whole picture--who knows how many lives he saves?You have to look at this film with a sense of humor. For example, the couple in the supermarket is growing apart. And then, the floor cracks open and separates them--literally--and swallows the food on the shelves. Way too fast for me.Let's not forget the obligatory speech toward the end by our other hero--the man who tried to warn everyone in positions of authority (as opposed to ordinary people, who the Glenn Beck of Yellowstone wanted to reach) but was pretty much ignored. Toward the end, he has to quickly change attitudes before the end of the world becomes something much worse (Worse? Really? Yes.). It's a corny but great moment.This just keeps growing and growing. Just when you think it can't get any more complicated, it does. The end is very exciting, with deadlines that can't be moved, actions that have to be taken fast, with possible deadly consequences for those who do (but thousands more will die otherwise), arguments between world leaders, ethical dilemmas--you can't say it's not a thrill ride. Whether it's actually good--who cares? It's kind of scary watching everything blowing up, disappearing, thousands of unseen people surely dying, but you knew that coming in, right?Just go with it.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
worth a look but I question the originality,"All the usual elements are here ... the estranged couple, the ungrateful son, the goofy new boyfriend, the power made bureaucrat.

What Roland Emmerich calls his last disaster film,"2012 just basically tries to impress the audiences with special effects showing destruction after destruction and that is all it basically does. But that is just what you would expect from a Roland Emmerich films, although I will admit some were actually sort of entertaining. But since this is his last disaster movie or so he claimed, I actually sort of had a bit of expectations for this. But besides the special effects all it offered was hollow characters and very stereotypical and dumb characters, the plot wasn't even intelligent and was actually dull. The destruction is cool to look at but after a while you start to get numb to it. So what Emmerich does is show destruction after destruction of certain monuments around the world. So the plot is basically this, in the Mayan calendar it is predicted that in 2012 on winter solstice the planets will line up which will cause solar flares and it will effect earth in a way it will cause major destruction and during this chaos people are trying to survive. And while this is going on it hardly shows any death, mainly just destruction. This is a silly disaster film and a very long one at that, I mean it was actually kinda fun to watch the destruction and all but when a film like this is over 2 and a half hours long, than you just start to get bored. Anyways as dumb as it is, this is worth checking out on the big screen to get everything out of it, which is basically the special effects.6.2/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I could pick any number of things in this movie that are absurd beyond belief. Driving his limo *through* a collapsing skyscraper as it falls?

"I liked it, but lacked information","The movie was good, many effects and quality, but for my taste, lacked relevant content related to 2012: December 21, 2012, the final date of the Long Count Calendar created by the ancient Mayans in Central America. Countless books, journal articles, websites and newspaper headlines discuss its meaning. With fans on the 2 sides, some advocating the end of time and others who speak of a rebirth of Consciousness. Adding fuel to the debate, some scientists see a growing number of natural disasters in recent years as evidence of a catastrophic climax shall entail in 2012 ... They foresaw the coming of Christianity and the Spanish conquest of America. Written over eight hundred years ago, the Mayan prophecies predicted the First World War, the rise of Hitler and the December 2006 tsunami that devastated Southeast Asia. And within a few years, the 21 December 2012 Mayans predict a natural disaster of unspeakable proportions that will destroy the earth and humanity erased.And since the December 21, 2012 approaches, the Mayan prophecies are gaining worldwide attention. In the winter of 2009, the overproduction of Ronald Emmerich disaster leads box office. Emmerich's film tells the story of the prediction of the Maya and how the destruction of the earth can occur.

What really stands out in this movie are the special effects, which are absolutely groundbreaking. But the characters are as boring as always and there are absolutely no scenes, that'll make you emotional. With 150 minutes in length, 2010 is about 30 minutes toooooooo long.

"A disaster movie ?  No, just a disaster.","I didn't have high expectations about this movie. Well, first, the director is Roland Emmerich. The King of apocalyptic movies full of clichés with no interesting characters. Then, the budget of this film is 230 million dollars. So I knew before watching it that it would be a movie with a terrible scenario, terrible actors, but I said to myself: hey, at least it has nice visual effects ! I was right. There were nice visuals. The problem is that there were too much. way too much... The movie lasts 2h and 30 minutes. So picture it: 2h and 30 minutes of unbelievably bad dialogs, unbearable patriotic scenes that alternate with huge stuffs falling down, breaking down, tumbling down and (especially in the last 30 minutes) flowing down. Why is there so much water ?? When I came home from the theater I couldn't believe how long I stayed in the bathroom. And about the actors: oh yeah, the actors... Danny Glover as the president of the United States is pitiful (but he hasn't been in a good movie since Lethal Weapon 2) and John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor are quite bad compared to their usual performances. 2012 is terrible movie only to be watched (if it is to be watched) in theater.

All Effects. No Substance.,"Really the only thing I can recommend about this film is the special effects, especially a spectacular sequence of the destruction of Los Angeles. That part of the film is a technical masterpiece (and it's what they showed in the trailer for good reason). The first half of this movie is watchable just because of the special effects. Once you get to the halfway point, the effects start to slip a little bit (I felt the ice and water effects weren't that good) and once the effects go, the film goes.The story and characters are all bland clichés. You've got a several people trying to save their broken families and coming together or saving each other at the end, which has been done a billion times. You have the passionate scientist who cares about people against the dickish politician, which has been done a billion times. You have a bunch of landmarks getting destroyed, which looks cool, but it's been done a billion times. And you have arguments of humanity vs. survival which have been done a billion times, and much better than they're done here.When there are no special effects, there are one of two possible things going on. The first is broken families trying to survive (yawn). And the second is politicians arguing. Because when I think cataclysmic destruction of the world... my first thought is C-SPAN, and all the excitement of... watching senators, scientists, and yes-men getting annoyed with each other, making veiled threats, passionate speeches about what the other guy is doing wrong, and yelling about principles and matters of procedure which no one else really cares about.In all, I was really bored by this and the political BS just got on my nerves. It's really not an interesting movie. And I did start to nod off towards the end when it got REALLY stupid (they have the happy ending that defies all logic, just to have a happy ending).I could go into more detail, but I really just thought it was boring, especially after the half- way mark when the special effects started to look a little shabbier.3/10 - If you want to see some cool effects sequences, give it a look.

2 and an half hour of pure destruction,"2012 is a thrilling and emotional ride. Scenes of the cities/countries are amazing, the CGI looks so real that almost convince you that they are really being destroyed. I am sure the CGI is the one that stands out in the movie. People would watch it for the CGI. There is also a lot of emotion added into this movie, the acting including the children's is quite good.The story: First, it starts off a little slow but when it comes to second destruction, that is where pace becomes faster due to the thrilling escapes of destruction. When the destruction comes, a lot of people die and become selfish. John Cusack plays Jackson who is a writer (John also plays a writer in the thrilling horror movie 1408) trying to save his family. That is usual in a disaster movie. They then meet some other characters and try to plan their escape. Everything is destroyed and not one thing is spared. The music goes well especially with emotional scenes.Overall: Even if you don't like the plot, you would enjoy the fantastic and realistic destructions of countries/cities. Even if you find the story lame, you have to admit that the CGI is really well done. Though the CGI stands out in the movie, I find that some emotional scenes are good as well.

Taken too seriously,"I think people take a movie like this entirely too seriously. We all know what we're going to see here. People criticize the film, with respect to it's execution, like it's an Oscar quality film when we all well know that this is a blockbuster movie made for summer audiences to enjoy in the masses and with their families. It's not a family film per see, but the is not The Godfather, nor was it ever intended to be such a film.The major draw of the film is the subject matter; how that relates to the religious predictions and media spawned fear of the end of all time. It makes for an entertaining subject matter because it creates a buzz in our general culture that is all too familiar, with respect to previous predictions of disaster. I.E. Y2K, etc. I find that the deeper meaning is that it is a pivotal way in which we, as members of society can be driven away from some of the urgent matters that effect our society and our world. It is a distraction from what's actually going on.Obviously a lot of money went into this film and was mostly spent on visual effects. How is that different from any other Roland Emmerich films?

This includes everything from mass wildfire the likes that will shame any real fire of the Californian landscape. Earthquakes which will dwarf the intensity of even imagined earthquakes such as the ""big one"" of North Pacifica and floods and destruction the kind one hopes to never have to have the misfortune of being in vicinity of. In other words if you want to see the planet barf you will enjoy 2012. If you are in for some characterization or plot than this film is bound to leave you disappointed.

If you see this movie you will see Malibu (or maybe Venice Beach) tilt up and slide right into the waves.In the trailer, you see all these gigantic catastrophes and might think you're seeing the end of the movie. You are not. That all happens about halfway through. The first half hour of the movie is set-up. It all begins in 2009 (whoa, the same year as the movie's release!). Scientists discover things going on deep underground that ""just can't be true."" Warnings are sounded. Governments are put on alert. Then 2012 arrives and fissures appear, the surface of the earth begins to collapse, buildings fall ... It looks like mankind itself will not make it. But ... and then comes the second half of the movie, which I will not reveal. But I'll hint — the species survives.What do you see get destroyed? Southern California, of course. Las Vegas. Yellowstone National Park. East India. Washington, D.C. Tibet. What am I leaving out ...Star John Cusack has a movie family. He's estranged from his wife. His little son and daughter have issues. Mom's seeing the plastic surgeon neighbor, who ends up a key character. Woody Harrelson (Hi Woody! Loved Zombieland!) chimes in as a crazy hippie prophet who gives info to Cusack so he's one step ahead as events go south. There's a superrich Russian oligarch (the movie's more or less bad guy). A brave Russian pilot. A sympathetic Russian bimbo mistress (whose fate is shamefully glossed over). There's also the president's chief of staff played by Oliver Platt who's basically doing a take on Henry Kissinger at his most Strangelovian.Roland Emmerich, all along you've been the guy who when Hollywood comes around and says, ""Roland, will you take all the money in Switzerland and make the most eyepoppingest movie imaginable?"" has always modestly said, ""Why, yes.""Here's to you.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worst of 2009,"After all the advertising hype, 2012 was the worst entertainment disappointment I've experienced in a long time. It is disappointingly predictable and at the same time unbelievable - we've seen it all done before in many other movies of this type. I'm sorry to say that there is no adrenaline rush to be had from this one.I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone so I'm not going to provide the detail of my biggest complaint except to say that with all the care they put into not offending Muslims in making this movie, they missed the boat completely for Christians and Jews! The climax of this movie is something that is in complete conflict with the teachings of the Old Testament and the Torah – somewhere over the rainbow.On the positive side, the scenery is breathtaking at times.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
2012 is a nice film !,"2012 was a nice Hollywood film & definitely a heart wrenching story of as it is a disaster film.The cast actors did a really well job..I appreciate..
It was a Pleasure to watch on Theatres 🎥 😀",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Most of the time I was trying to work out how I could leave the,"private theater I was at...without offending my host! What an appalling load of twaddle this comic strip is.I was rooting for the tidal waves and could barely restrain a cry of,""Go get 'em tsunami!"" I can do the ""suspend belief bit"" but I really can hack screamers who want to argue the point when they are in clear and imminent danger.I felt really sorry for the poor giraffe being tossed around like a rag doll.Otherwise I didn't really give a fig for what might happen to the principals of this special effects extravaganza.The hero(I use that word loosely)seemed to have a thousand lives and what's more,this, ""sedantary computer addict whose claim to fame was the fact he had sold 500 copies of a novel he authored"",also evidently held the world record, for holding his breathe under water.Don't they make flicks for grown-ups anymore?",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"good,very spectacular.","I confirm that I have written previously on this site Hemmerich films are viewed in a bad way, the disaster film receive little more than enough, the same happened to the day after tomorrow. This film I consider great, great special effects in the great tradition of hemmerich and presents numerous questions how and if it were true? The year 2012 is really a disaster? Now I have a follow question critics alleged, because the film is not for intellectuals rewarded them with great ratings??? Maper be promoted on this site have to do drama?? Try to be less partisan and less intellectual intellectuals also be broken because very often the hilt. Changmow try to be less rigid on this site will think you are all film critics in the world and then increases the vote.W 2012, I still think that this site hates the disaster film and horror, do not judge him as a courtesy, this film of its kind that is part 10.a references with Deep Impact.Including to the Best specttacolare the world you would have to say, but the cinema is not the crime, there will always be errors. are crazy, frustrated and crazy.Even movies with a lot of special effects will continue to break the balls, the film must be heavy to please just like that ball of There Will Be Blood. you gave more than 8.0, is ugly. We hang every little detail just to discredit the film, but you do not understand that films are a representation of reality ', CAN NOT BE THE TRUTH', WILL ALWAYS ERRORS AND THEN DO THE INTELLECTUAL Shut up. You Gave more than 8.0, is wrong W 2012,GREAT FILM.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent visual effects but only an average movie..,"2012 drops the best visual effects for any movie that talks about the end of day. the visual effects are so stunning that can make you jump out of your seat, but that's it!!! This movie, with all the resources that were available, could have the movie of the year, decade. It could have been iconic, but it seems that the producers and director, only wanted an average movie with some supreme effects.The movie is being killed by the silly funny remarks at some points, come on guys billions are dying and you are joking? Also, the unnecessary romance, guys you cannot guarantee your life for the next five minutes and you are flirting with the woman??!!! Watching this movie can never make you feel it realistic, only because 2012 fails to read the correct reaction of the human nature in similar situations. furthermore, killing the characters when their part for saving the family (main focus of the plot)finish, example, you drove our plan and reach us here, thank you, you can die!!! and eventually saving the marriage, who cares??? the world is ending buddy!!!Finally, the movie can only touch you visually, and when the movie finish, the effect is gone. Will you enjoy it, probably yes. Will it touch you in the core? probably no.It is disappointing how they can convert a potential masterpiece movie into an average box office hit movie. I am disappointed...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
