Definitely not as good as the first Incredibles movie,"Good: The animation for this movie was excellent just like most other Pixar movies, it was funny (especially Jack Jack) and I really liked the action sequences throughout the movie. I liked that the movie showed that parenting (when done right) can be heroic.Bad: I thought this film has quite a few problems, the biggest problem was that the ending was pretty predictable, I could see it coming. Also, there was a feminism theme with Helen which was okay but at times it seemed to shove it in my face and it got to be annoying. There seemed to be a little too much going on in the movie and a few too many characters.I'm glad I saw the movie, I just don't think I would see it again anytime soon.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly overhated,"While I understand the disappointment, this was NOT a bad film. It isn't as good as the first one, but I think it holds up pretty well! There's lots of fun to be had watching this from the animation to the humor, and there are still some touching scenes that show there is heart put into this film. I recommend seeing CinemaWins ""Everything GREAT about Incredibles 2"" if you want to see why this film is still pretty decent. Only somewhat weak spot in my opinion was the main villain who was somewhat predictable, but man the animation at times truly is ""Incredible"" (pun intended)!Go see it! It was well worth my time and I enjoyed it, so I'm surprised to see it get all these 1 star reviews. Far from Pixar's best but still a good flick. I know you can't please everyone but I think this movie is terribliy overhated. That's just my opinion at least. 9 stars out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Simply Super Movie,"Having grown up in the 2000s and being an advid fan of animation and superheroes, I'd be lying if I told you that I wasn't entranced by Disney Pixar's Incredibles from 2004. Fast forward fourteen years and I found myself sitting in a movie theatre with a bunch of other twenty year olds excitedly waiting to watch its sequel. But was Incredibles 2 able to reach the high bar set by its predecessor?I'd personally say yes. This movie was an incredible success!I just love how Incredibles is able to expertly mix superhero action with the struggles faced by your average family. When they're not fighting crime, the members of the Parr family find themselves dealing with basic human predicaments, like trying to raise a baby and figuring out how to do math homework. These two genres may not seem compatible on paper, but Incredibles is just able to make it work. This results in Incredibles being a truly unique feature.Of course originality alone isn't enough to make a film great, especially if the writers are unable to compose a comprehensible story for their film. Thankfully, the plot of Incredibles 2 was able to exceed the basic fundamental requirements of storytelling, especially for a superhero film. Yes, the plot is somewhat predictable and it is honestly quite simplistic at its core. Nonetheless, the story is executed quite well, and there are relatively no plot holes present in the movie. Although the story is fine, what I found to be a major highlight of the film would definitely be the characters, specifically the protagonists.Each of the main characters added their own little flair to the movie. Helen takes the spotlight for a decent portion of the film, and viewers got to see her awesome crime fighting abilities as Elastigirl. Violet was pretty amazing in this movie. She went through development as a person, as a superhero, and had some pretty hilarious moments like when she squirted water out of her nose. Dash also showed some character growth in the film and he ended up being an enjoyable presence. When it comes to Bob, I do wish that the creators would have showed off his prowess as Mr. Incredible a bit more in the film. But since he got some enjoyable scenes as a stressed dad trying to take care of his children and was the primary focus of the first movie, it didn't bother me too much.The biggest surprise for me ended up being how great I found the Jack-Jack scenes to be. I couldn't believe how entertained I was by the antics of a baby in a movie, and he actually wound up being one of the most memorable parts of the film for me. Returning characters like Frozone and Edna maintained their charm from the previous movie, and some of the new characters ended up being pretty decent as well.I simply can't finish this review without talking about the breathtaking aesthetics of the film. The animators really outdid themselves with the movie's technical aspects. Expressions, movements, and scenery were impressively well animated, and the visuals have set a new standard for animated movies. Of course, this is to be expected. The creators did have a solid fourteen years to make this film as spectacular as possible you know.Overall, I was genuinely satisfied with Incredibles 2. It maintained the quality of the first film and even surpassed it in some aspects. Pixar did a lot of things right with this movie. And if you're unsure of whether or not to watch it because ""it's for kids,"" I would wholeheartedly recommend giving this movie a shot. I doubt that you'll be dissapointed by it. It is a pretty incredible movie after all.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Predictable, But Perfect","I cannot believe it has been 14 years since The Incredibles came out. The gap between sequels seems to be getting longer, but the director, Brad Bird, said he wanted to wait until he had the perfect story. There's even a clip before the film starts where actors, Craig T. Nelson, Samuel L. Jackson, and Holly Hunter tell us it will be ""well worth the wait""--and they were right!Though 14 years later, the film takes place minutes later. The first film ends with the Parr family having to fight the Miner who pops up out of the school parking lot, just after Violet gets a date with Tony. The sequel starts with that fight and we see how it backfires as the Parr family get arrested for destroying part of the city and because superheroes are still illegal. Enter our new characters, siblings Winston and Evelyn Deaver, who both want to help superheroes step back into the light, but they believe the way to do that is with Elastigirl. Therefore, our sequel twist is that Mr. Incredible becomes a stay-at-home dad having to babysit Jack-Jack and learning of his dozens of powers, teaching Dash ""new math"", and inserting his foot into his mouth when he tries to help Violet with her crush--all while Elastigirl is improving superhero relations.Personally, I thought the movie was predictable but perfect. I loved it for its simplistic plot that was not hard to figure out. I knew right away who the ""villain"" was and what their motivation was; however, I did not know exactly how the climax would occur, so I was still very much engaged. Not to mention there was enough character development and funny scenes to space out the predictable plot arch.Often times animated films are more for the adults who are taking the kids, then for the kids themselves. Most kids will not understand half the references, but will still enjoy the overall concept. At the same time, this film comes out when the kids who saw the first are now adults, possibly with kids of their own. Therefore, this film is a great blend of adult and child humor. I found it hilarious, and as a teacher, I particularly loved when Mr. Incredible stays up all night reading Dash's ""new math"" textbook so he can teach him new math, which was what it was called in the 60s (the time period this film alludes to) and is a shout out to our modern common core confusion.What I really love about this film is that there is even more Frozone and Jack-Jack, which brings me to my all-time favorite scenes--learning of Jack-Jack's powers, particularly when Violet and Dash call Uncle Frozone over because their dad is going insane from sleep-deprivation and trying to keep up with Jack-Jack. I lost track of how many powers he has and all I will say on the matter is that the best scene in the whole film is when Jack-Jack fights the raccoon.If you want a light-hearted comedy with some fun action sequences then this film is for you. If you loved the first one then you will love the second one. If you have not seen the first one, what's wrong with you?",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Predictable and old goods but in Fun New package, family entertainment.","If you have seen lot of movies and read tons of comic books like myself it would seem predictable plus movie does have certain base plot elements similar to original. But don't run away yet because that is not fun part about the movie or what movie makers were focusing on, it was the family dynamics, role reversals and yes the much anticipated Jack Jack the Big bang in the small pack and all his wonderful powers which wreck havoc and yes make him most powerful member of the team.
 I can't say anything else without dropping spoilers but its a movie about a family that can be enjoyed by all families young and old together.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Incredibles 2 is... Exciting and Acceptable.,"'Incredibles 2' was probably the most anticipated movie of the year; it's hard to believe it's made 14 years since the first original. So obviously everyone was more than ready for this.The film does come through when it comes to entertaining action and comedy, with Jack-Jack, Bob, and Edna providing most of the biggest laughs. The plot is interesting, because we've got to know what happened to the Parr family. As far as the supervillain mystery, it's acceptable and somewhat entertaining, but a bit predictable and generic. The final criticism I have is that Edna definitely deserved more screen time.That being said, it is still an entertaining movie and not at all ""painful"" to watch.In conclusion, 'Incredibles 2' is funny, exciting, and really worth a viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Intense seizure warning!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is fantastic, loved the story and the characters. Where this movie loses points is in three separate continuous sequences of intense flashing. My sister is epileptic, and with no warnings we weren't prepared for any of it. She ended up seizing after the first sequence, and we had to cover her eyes for the their two. If you or any family members are sensitive to this sort of thing, AVOID THIS MOVIE.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Average-ables,"Oh boy was this film a disappointment and I dreaded this review but I will as usual at least try and look at the good first.Technically The Averagables er...uh...well I mean The Incredibles 2 is technically a slicker than the original tech wise but that's about it.If you haven't seen the original this is probably a wow of a film, but I had seen the original.But it just is not in the same league as the original or for that matter any Pixar film.Harsh words? Not really, the big problem is that this is the same film as the original except they swap the parents places and replace the baby sitter for a Racoon.WOWEE!I remember the DVD extras for the original where Brad Bird made it clear that he would absolutely, positively, definitely not make a sequel unless he had a good enough story to warrant it that it had something new to say.Well that has gone out the window, as its just the same story again.The wrist watch test:
I was part way through this film and I'll be honest I started checking my watch for the time, why?Because I was BORED!The final bit of WHY DID THEY BOTHER is that this film cost 200 million just to make, HOW?If it was new story wise I could understand but Its the same film and most of the same 3D resources could have been re-used, where did the money go?Not on the story or script that's for sure.So is it a bad film?NO it is not bad it is an average film that cost 200 million to make.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but not great!","There is much to like here and not much that is outright wrong or bad. It's funny, fast paced, clever and overall works quite well. However there is an ever present feeling that the first one was better.. Maybe it's cause the plot is maybe a bit too predictable and cartoonish(yeah it IS a cartoon, but still..) or that the wait between the first and this one was so long and I expected something more?

Great Family Movie,"I took my 5 year old daughter to see this. With all the family friendly YouTube channels covering it and McDonalds toys etc. it is very geared towards small children obviously. We went to a noon showing on a weekday and it was packed with young kids. They all loved it. There was lots of laughter and even kids clapping at the end. As a dad, I call that a win. I enjoyed the story and crazy action scenes. The animation and talent behind it blows me away.The animated short at the beginning is kinda strange and sad, and a little too deep for young kids.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Falls short of super or incredible,"Have always been a big fan of Pixar, liking to loving pretty much all their short films (particularly 'Presto', 'One Man Band', 'Geri's Game', 'Piper' and 'Knick Knack'). Also like to love a vast majority of their feature films, my favourites being the 'Toy Story' films, 'Up', 'Coco' and 'Inside Out' and my least favourites being the 'Cars' sequels and 'The Good Dinosaur'.While not one of my favourite Pixar films, 'The Incredibles' is still a very, very good film that has gone even higher in my estimations after a well overdue re-watch to get myself prepared for 'Incredibles 2', fantastically animated, exciting, funny, emotionally investable and ground-breaking with great characters. Expectations were high for its long awaited sequel fourteen years on, and while it is not as good a film, and what could and should have been super and incredible wasn't quite, on the most part 'Incredibles 2' was worth the wait.'Incredibles 2' does lack 'The Incredibles' originality (not much new here) and its emotional impact and character development is also not as good, the latter particularly is noticeably thinner (Bob for example was more complex before). It was a little too long for a story as slight as it was, would have trimmed it by 15-20 minutes and tightened the first act's pacing with it taking a bit too much time to get going.Like others, among my biggest problems were to do with the villain. The villain was forgettable (one of Pixar's weakest easily), the twist concerning their identity that was too obvious too soon. Found their plan convoluted, that when explained made me want a re-wind button which was not possible in the cinema, and the motivation was pretty weak and extreme, took a while for me to get my head round. While the characters are fun, it did feel like there were too many, not sure whether it needed that many superheroes that aren't given enough to do other than in the climax.However, it may sound like 'Incredibles 2' was a bad film. It wasn't. Actually enjoyed it a good deal. The animation is fantastic, smooth, vibrant in colour and meticulous in background detail, some very striking details, a richly immersive setting and the characters are well designed. Michael Giacchino's score gets one in a rousing mood while also being dynamic with the action. The action is superbly animated and thrilling with real suspense and excitement.Writing has many moments of humour that provides a lot of laughs (Jack Jack steals the show here, especially with his powers and his fight with the racoon, with some nice lines later from Edna), moments that probe thought and drama that's relatable and never too sentimental (if not as poignant as one would like). The story does grip, more so in the Elastigirl story that really held my attention before the villain reveal underwhelmed. The family drama stuff is also very prominent, and while it is repetitive at times and there could have been less of it the best moments are very funny and it is very easy to relate to the dilemmas the characters face. Pacing mostly excites when things get going.Character development is nowhere near as strong here and it would have benefitted from less characters and more done with the existing characters and more thought with the villain and their plan/motivations, but the characters are mostly fun with the highlight being Jack Jack. The voice acting is terrific, especially from Holly Hunter, Craig T Nelson and Samuel L Jackson. Brad Bird is a lot of fun in Edna's small role and Catherine Keener, Bob Odenkirk and Jonathan Banks are good additions.Overall, very enjoyable but wanted to like it much more. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Can't Escape the Incredible Legacy of the Original,"Since I already know you are going to rate this review as ""Not Helpful"" because I didn't rate this 10/10 stars, I figured I might as well start off by telling you how much I love the original Incredibles. The Incredibles (2004) is one of my favorite films of all time and is my second favorite Pixar film (right after Finding Nemo). I got to see Incredibles 2 early because I caught a double feature of the two films in IMAX, just in case you were thinking of complaining that I didn't see it since this review is out early.What I loved about the original was the authenticity that the story, characters, and animation had to it. It felt more creative, natural, and beautiful. Syndrome was one of the greatest superhero movie villains of all time, not because of the amount of damage he was able to inflict upon the world, but because of the emotional pain he was able to cause Mr. Incredible and his family. The moments in which Mr. Incredible regrets his past mistakes and realizes how his actions affect others, especially his former biggest fan, are what makes the film stand out from any other hero-villain dynamic. Sadly, Incredibles 2 does not have a villain or story as deep or as thoughtful as Syndrome.Incredibles 2 boldly and intelligently begins right where The Incredibles ended. This smart move on Disney Pixar's part eliminates all confusion and time gaps that may arise after a hiatus of any amount (especially fourteen years) between a sequel and its predecessor. The story that follows is relatively contrived and characters are clumsily introduced in order to expand the universe instead of expanding the emotions of the beloved characters. The action scenes are creative and well-animated, but they aren't memorable enough and take place in bland settings and accomplish nothing for the characters. There were many points during this film where I noticed how hard Brad Bird was trying to replicate the formula of the original film, but it became more and more noticeable to the point that it detracted from the story itself.The great Pixar films all have excellent, fluid stories. The great Pixar films also have superb plots that deepen our understanding and feelings for the characters. The good Pixar films have entertaining, sensible plots, but they rarely deepen our love of the characters involved in them, such as A Bug's Life, Cars 2 (don't hate me!), Cars 3, and The Good Dinosaur. Incredibles 2, sadly, falls into the latter category that has a fun, creative plot, but a plot that does nothing new for its characters.Since the villain is introduced in the trailer, I don't think that it's a spoiler to say that it doesn't feel authentic or inspired enough to be considered one of Pixar's best villains. While the motive for the villain is there, it is simply unnecessary, contrived, and unexciting. New heroes are also introduced (as seen in the poster and other promotional material). Many of them are underutilized or unnecessary. The film's weakest parts involve the newly introduced characters because they all lack the liveliness and creative spark of the original characters that are explored slightly more deeply in this film.But enough of the aspects of the film that let me down. For all of the disappointments, Incredibles 2 also has many surprises and amazing qualities. For one, Jack Jack's new abilities are basically perfect, both in what his powers are and in how they are revealed. At first, I worried that too much of Jack Jack's powers were revealed, but that was hardly the case. Jack Jack is actually one of the best parts of this film. He is easily one of the funniest parts of any Pixar film. I couldn't help but burst out in laughter every time he made a single noise. The humor in this film is slightly more present, or maybe more memorable, than in the original. The film's message also tries to be more important and necessary besides highlighting the importance of family.Obviously this review won't stop you from seeing this film, nor was it intended to, but I encourage all of you to see this film in theaters, but heavily reduce your expectations and don't think too much about what made The Incredibles nearly perfect, or you are sure to be sorely disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved it,"We had low expectations going in. 99% of the time, Hollywood sequels are lazy productions that are made to cash in on the original's good will. Twenty minutes in, we happily realized that the writer/director Brad Bird actually put as much effort into this movie as he did in the original Incredibles.To echo every other reviewer- it was worth waiting 14 years. I will happily wait another 14 if the third installment is up to the caliber of #2.The animation is top notch and the script is surprisingly deep- Superheros are struggling to regain their lawful status in society. Violet is going through teenage dating pains. Family finances and stay at home parenting are heavy themes on top of the standard villain vs. Hero struggle.Still, it manages to be laugh out loud funny all the way through. Jack Jack's ability reveals are easily the funniest scenes in the movie, and we love the Poltergeist Easter egg. Wonder if Craig T Nelson had anything to do with it?Yes, the main villain is kind of weak and predictable, but that only took one star off. The story did drag at spots, as in the editor could have cut 10 minutes without losing much.Like the original, we will watch it again and again when it comes out on disc.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worth the wait,"It's been a long wait. 14 years since the first film and at long last we get the continuation of the story. This movie picks up right where the first one left off. Supers are back in the light and the public opinion is mixed as always with the law not taking too kindly to the Incredibles' efforts.
Honestly with how the movie goes, I can see that their really wasn't much else they could do with the story or where to take it and it still feel like Incredibles and carry the same spirit as the first film. It could easily have just become just another super hero movie with the family stopping some big threat or some other. They went deeper with this story and kept the similar tone of the first, and it works wonderfully. It may be more of nostalgia talking, but the first film still seems to hold up better. Then again I've only seen the sequel once in theaters so far. I was not disappointed and think the movie was wonderful.
Just hopefully we won't have to wait another 14 years for part 3... if we ever get a part 3.Also. Whats up with the girl Evelyn looking almost identical to Roxanne in Megamind?",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Incredibles deserve better.,"This could have been an amazing sequel, if the motive of the studio was to tell a genuine good story, as the first film did.Sadly, they focused on cheap rehash of the first film, and reversed the roles, while lowering the role of Mr. Incredible, and pushing a political woke messages.Which hurt the flow, sense and story of the film, which was one of the longest awaited sequels.The outcome is extremely underwhelming film, forgettable, boring at times, and lacks to repeatable viewing experience the first one had.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
There have already been 888 reviews....what's one more?!,"I hate most sequels and don't think most of them are necessary...they are just an excuse to squeeze money out of the popularity of the first film. This is especially true to kids' films in recent years an it seems like a bazillion cartoons and CGI movies have been made and remade in a cynical attempt to make money. Are they any good? For most, I'd say no. However, I am happy I saw ""Incredibles 2"" as it was worthy of the franchise and offers enough new content to make it worth your time.In this follow-up, super-heroes have been banned and the Incredibles family is not about to break the law. However, when an eccentric billionaire offers to help the family rehabilitate the image of heroes in an effort to get them unbanned, bad things are in store. It's not that he is evil....but someone around him has an agenda of their own. In the meantime, Mr. Incredible is forced to become a house husband...and he struggles with learning to parent effectively and live without using his super skills. Ultimately, however, the entire family is forced into action to not only save the day but Mrs. Incredible.Of all the recent kids films, I must say that ""Incredibles 2"" has the strongest feminist message. This is NOT a complaint. I liked seeing Mrs. Incredible become the family breadwinner and Mr. Incredible learn to be tender and a caregiver. There are also other feminist aspects of the story...but I'll say no more since it would spoil the plot!Overall, an incredibly well animated and thoroughly enjoyable film. Not exactly original (hence a score that isn't higher), but well worth seeing....unlike the countless ""Ice Age"" sequels and the like.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too busy and not enough heart,"To say I was anticipating this movie would be a huge understatement. The first one was so amazing. One of the few movies that I have watched over, and over, and over. A straight forward and simple story that emphasized love, family, and good conquering evil. One protagonist and a very clear plot line. Who didn't get choked up when Syndrome sends rockets that destroy the plane the Helen and the kids are coming on to save their dad ""mayday may day, there are children on board!"" And the way they all came together as a team - so wonderful. Incredibles II is just too busy and goes off in too many directions. Too many new (repugnant and uninteresting) characters. I watched it through once and have tried on three occasions to re-watch it. I am probably selling it short and will enjoy it in the future, but that is my opinion at the moment.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great sequel! An impressive movie,"Pixar really pushes the super hero theme in this movie. An extremely colorful movie with spectacular details, alongside another fantastic soundtrack.

Entertaining but lesser than the original,"Following the superb 2004 original, the family of animated superheroes are back. This time, they are struggling to regain a good reputation for superheroes (ostracized due to the collateral damage of their heroics) while also getting caught up in fighting a scheme against Screenslaver, a villain who hypnotizes victims with TV screen images.The idea of Screenslaver seems clever and almost touches on the modern world's collective obsession with technical devices and other forms of media. It doesn't quite get to the heart of the matter and misses an opportunity to be a clever critique of our current times. The theme even seems to be jumbled and incoherent at times.But overall, the film is saved by funny characters and doing what action-filled, comical, Hollywood blockbusters set out to do: be entertaining. It also succeeds in adding a twist to the genre by having female characters in the centre of hero/villain conflicts. A rather smart move considering the current dynamic in the film industry. - dbamateurcritic",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Incredibles Return,"The Incredibles return in the highly anticipated sequel that fans have waited for 14 long years to arrive in theaters. The first Incredibles released in 2004 was a masterpiece of filmmaking for it's time and is part of Pixar Animation Studios's Golden Age of films along with past iconic titles Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo. What these films have in common is how they were able to touch the hearts of audiences across the world, as a result becoming cult classics. In the past, Pixar has produced sequels to their films from time to time, with the Toy Story franchise being the most popular and with the next sequel Toy Story 4 scheduled for a 2019 release, the franchise continues it's success. Cars and Finding Nemo both have had relatively decent sequels but this one was highly desired for the last fourteen years. That being said, there hasn't been nor will there ever be a case when a sequel to an adored iconic film is released that audiences especially fans of the original who hold it dear to their hearts will not perceive the sequel at first glance as inferior to the original. That can damage a film's reputation. Incredibles 2 does look different (the animation literally looks different) and yet is similar to the first film with a new twist. It's habit of bringing back the nostalgia that made the original loved is it's biggest strength.The film picks up right where the first film ended with the first superhero family facing off with the villain the Underminer giving viewers the idea of the kind of film their about to watch. One thing this film does well is develop each character's powers to new levels. For an animated film, the action sequences are thrilling, sometimes heart pounding and super fun to view. The music is similar to how it was before giving exciting 60's spy movie vibes. The best moments of the film are the ones where Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible is watching over his children while his wife is away saving the world, something we did not see in the first film was his relationship with his children. The theme of wanting acceptance in a world that hates you is back, a relatable subject in today's world for some people, and just as in the first film, it's presented well. Incredibles 2 is an enjoyable action packed superhero fest with a coming of age aspect to it. All the characters are under pressure by the world around them that's telling them how they're supposed to live their lives creating sadness and desperation for them. As time goes by, they must choose what they want to be. Pixar has always included deep emotional topics like this in their films all to their credit.Finally while the additional characters new to the film may not have been the most memorable Pixar has invented, it had an interesting story, entertaining action, a final act that pays off, humorous moments and seeing the characters return made the film worth the wait. It doesn't completely live up to the original though nonetheless it is a worthy sequel to one of the most successful animated films in history.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worse than original. Politically correct box-ticking. Bland story details.,"Half way through watching this in the cinema, I thought ""maybe it's me"". Maybe it's my fault I'm not into this movie. But I loved the original, so what's going on.No. The problem is this movie is a bland attempt to express messages about gender roles and current society issues. It lacks flow, it's just a bunch of scenes one after the other, there's no coherent thread or curious elements tying it together.Nice visuals goes without saying, but the story is let down by a sense that it's been engineered around a board room table by people referring to their social media feeds for inspiration, rather than dreamt up by talented writers.Sure, some scenes are fun. But we're not watching a youtube playlist here, this is a movie and it's supposed to work as a whole, not just momentarily.The script is uninteresting, the action is exciting sometimes, but other times you just want it to end or move on.

continues to be fun,"This follows after the first movie. Superheroes continue to be banned. The family battles a supervillain causing havoc in the city. They become outcasts, unemployed, and penniless. The wealthy Deavor siblings, heads of the tech company Devtech, recruit Frozone and then the family to make superheroes great again. They convince Elastigirl to be the face of the revival while Mr. Incredible has to play Mr. Mom.Generally speaking, this is fun. It's a solid superhero movie and a fine family adventure. There is one hilarious scene with Jack-Jack and a raccoon. The only misstep is wiping Tony's memories. It would be so much more compelling for Tony to know Violet's secret and have them deal with that. It would make the young romance much more powerful and more dangerous. He could be a damsel in distress or he could slip up with the secret. There are more possibilities with him knowing. I would like Dash to dial back the bratty kid act by a half level. This continues to be great for the loving family at its center. I love Mr. Incredible figuring out how to use Jack-Jack as a laser gun. It's a fun movie and a fun franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Worth the 14-year wait,"Great Movie! This movie seems to really improve on the original, with the same memorable characters such as Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Edna, with new break-out characters, notably Jack-Jack. Micheal Giacchino nailed the score, and like other Pixar/Disney films there are amazing visuals. However, the thrill and brain of this movie, differentiates itself from the traditional cookie-cutter PG animated films. So far, it has been highly rated by critics, and could be one of the biggest releases of 2018. I can't wait for Incredibles 3.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lacks depth,"I don't think this sequel is bad, it's a fine watch. An entertaining superhero movie for the family, but it lacks that depth that keeps people coming back to the first movie.I recently watched the first and second Incredibles. The first has such intensity and great pacing. Many layered thematically and presentably. Moments are allowed to be subtle, stakes are high. I mean, the plane scene get me every time. But this film lacks that depth. It takes the characters for what they are on the surface and runs with that.It's a shame, because I know it's this way because of corporate pushing. First they struggle with production, and then Disney cuts off a year of their production time, so they have to throw something together.In short: characters are reset, villain is a shallow bait and switch, characters are boiled down to their surface level traits, new hero designs are so off and underutilized, villain's motivation and plan is thoughtless, a bit too much Jack-Jack, lacking stakes, missing the thoughtful moments, and overall a shallow follow-up.It's not bad, just lacking, and forgettable. The visuals are nice, I almost feel like they went a little to exaggeration. Akin to pumping up the color on a photo to make it 'look better', but still, credit to the animators. If you remove its tie to the first movie, it would make a decent superhero movie, but that's it. It sadly cannot live up to the first movie, and corporate is to blame.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A BLAST, with one or two problems, BUT THE HATERS ARE NUTS!","Yes, the story is predictable (part of it, anyway) and yes, the animation is a bit odd-why does everyone look sunburnt?-but everything else, and it's a lot, is brilliant.
The people who hated it were likely very young for the first one, and no sequel would make them happy. They're just wrong: if only for the B stories, it's fantastic.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

An insanely fun movie.,"Incredibles 2 continues with the adventures of the Parr family including, Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible(Craig T. Nelson), Helen Parr/Elastigirl(Holly Hunter), Violet Parr(Sarah Vowell), Dashiell 'Dash' Parr(Huck Milner) & Jack-Jack Parr(Eli Fucile). This time Helen is out being the superhero, while Bob stays at home & takes care of the kids.Incredibles 2 is a supremely entertaining film. Writer-director Brad Bird makes sure that the 14 year gap between The Incredibles(2004) & this sequel, is definitely worth the wait. The animation is flawless. The 3D is eye-popping. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. The humor is another strong point of the film. The talented cast who have lent their voices, make this movie unforgettable. Craig T. Nelson is outstanding as Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible. Holly Hunter is spectacular as Helen Parr/Elastigirl. Sarah Vowell is brilliant as Violet Parr. Huck Milner is superb as Dashiell 'Dash' Parr. Catherine Keener is amazing as Evelyn Deavor. Eli Fucile is adorable as Jack-Jack Parr. Bob Odenkirk is awesome as Winston Deavor. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as Lucius Best/Frozone. Michael Bird, Sophia Bush & Brad Bird are great as Tony Rydinger, Voyd & Edna Mode(E), respectively. The supporting cast is impressive. Incredibles 2 surpasses The Incredibles(2004) in every way. It's a must watch. I hope I don't have to wait for another 14 years, to watch Incredibles 3!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Elastigirl: The Movie,"INCREDIBLES 2
RATING: 3.2/5Honestly, this should have been called ""ELASTIGIRL: THE MOVIE"" because she's really the main star. The rest of the Incredibles family takes a back seat to her, so much so that you barely even get to see the family suit up, much less work together as a real team. Dash suffers the most out of the family in that regard. If you're looking for character development, it's not really here outside Mr. Incredible learning how to be a stay at home dad, and even that's questionable. Frozone gets more screen time, so he's not just the token Black guy this time around. The villain is pretty meh by the end of it, and if you give their evil plan more than a passing thought, it ends up being pretty dumb and pointless overall.This film is basically a time capsule, being that it takes place pretty much right after the first Incredibles movie. After 14 years, 3 Presidents, and 10 years of Marvel Studios superhero movies, Incredibles 2 needed to be way more than just a run of the mil sequel. This may have worked when they were at the top of the superhero mountain in 2004, but they've been lapped by so many other superhero movies now that this really doesn't cut it in 2018. Add to that the fact that they're still on the whole superheroes being illegal thing, which Captain America Civil War covered much, much better, and Incredibles 2 just ends up feeling outdated.The score is pretty fantastic though. It's loud, it's bombastic, very 60s James Bond but with a superhero flair to it. The voice acting is solid with Mr. Incredible being the MVP with all the range of emotions he has to go through. The animation is great, no surprise there from Pixar. The action is pretty fast paced and serviceable, but for some reason, i just wasn't impressed by it. I really don't know how many other ways Hollywood can shoot a runaway train scene. It also didn't help that the first fight just reminded me how much of a Fantastic Four ripoff The Incredibles are too. I chuckled twice during the whole film, but my theater laughed a lot, so the jokes were clearly working on some level.One of the other issues is that there are really no clear positive male figures in the film. Mr. Incredible is relegated to a stay at home dad, and he can't even figure that out on his own. Mrs. Incredible though, she can apparently do it all. In fact, almost every female in this film is infallible, while almost every male has some character flaw or has messed something up somehow. It's really weird. Like, the movie props up the women at the expense of the men, which i think sends a bad message.If you're looking for a few laughs, action, and to go back to 2004, you'll probably have a great time with Incredibles 2. If you're looking for a good story, good villain, balanced positive male and female figures, and a superhero team that actually practices teamwork, then you should probably look elsewhere. Outside the animation, music and jokes, the movie fails on almost every other front and that's just unacceptable after 14 years. Beware the hype with this movie, cause it simply does not live up to the first Incredibles, at least not for me, not by a long shot.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Still good...,"""Incredibles 2"" is an Animation - Action movie which continues from the ending of the previous one, following the story of the Parr family as they balance their superhero duties with their everyday lives. The difference this time is that Helen (Elastigirl) takes the lead as the family's primary hero, while Bob (Mr. Incredible) stays home to take care of the kids.I enjoyed this movie because it's an entertaining sequel with plenty of action and laughs having mostly the same magic as the original. The plot feels a bit more formulaic but both the animation and visuals are stunning while the emotional depth is present as it was in the first movie. The direction which was made by Brad Bird brings back the same humor and action that made the first movie a hit, while introducing new villains and challenges for the family to face. The character development is still enjoyable with Jack-Jack, steal the show with his powers. Finally, I have to say that ""Incredibles 2"" is a fun and exciting follow-up movie that delivers what fans of the original expect with the same level of creativity and heart so, I recommend everyone to watch it and especially families.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
It was worth the 14 year wait!!!,"I've waited patiently for 14 years for the sequel to my all-time favorite animated film and I'm excited to say, it was well worth the wait; I just hope I don't have to wait another 14 years for a follow up. It did a great job of balancing comedy, drama, the action scenes were spectacular and I LOVED the new supers they added to the franchise; Sophia Bush's Voyd was my favorite out of the new characters, she was dope.

Incredibles 2? More Like Average 2,"Didn't hate it, didn't love it. It's an animated (dare I say kids movie) that had morals, feelings, clever jokes, and a glaringly obvious plot.

The Incredibles is one of the best Pixar movies in existence. I don't know anyone who doesn't like the first film. It's one of my favourites.

Although not as good as the original in my opinion, it was a great pixar addition. They keep finding new ways of making meaningful, inventive and entertaining content, appealing to both Kids and Adults. It doesn't treat the audience as children and that's what's great about it.

It doesn't try anything more than the bare minimum of a time waster for a few hours. It's overall just a generic movie that if it didn't have the Disney name, would be in the bargain bin.

A satisfying sequel the whole family will enjoy,"Fourteen years after the original, writer/director Brad Bird returns to helm the second installment of The Incredibles. The movie landscape has changed greatly since then. Many moviegoers may not realize that The Incredibles came out four years before Iron-Man, which launched the ""Marvel MCU.""So, for any fans who love superhero movies, don't just thank Robert Downey Jr. for kicking things off. Thank Brad Bird. For fans who are tired of the oversaturation of superhero movies, still thank Brad Bird because The Incredibles is a truly wonderful film.The sequel doesn't quite reach the lofty standard of the original, which would have been nearly impossible, what with the originality and seminal nature of film, the characters and the exceptional villain.But Incredibles 2 does boast improvements to the visuals. I advise you to sit relatively close and take a good look at the detail of every scene. The lighting, the color, the movement-it's all immaculate. In a visual sense, this movie is a marvelous achievement.The weakest aspect of the movie is the villain. The villain is obvious, predictable and unclear in his or her ideology. I get the sense that all the necessary pieces were there, but the filmmakers couldn't quite put together the puzzle.Fear not, the villain's shortcomings are certainly not enough to spoil the movie. It has the appropriate blend of action, thoughtful commentary for the adults and silly jokes for the kids.I opted not to mention the plot at all because I thought, ""why bother?"" The Incredibles have to stop a villain, and they also deal with other issues. Great, you get it. Now go see this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Brilliant Pixar Sequel,"Incredibles 2 was smart, action packed, visually stunning, and HILARIOUS! It's everything you expect from a Pixar movie minus the tears. Actually, scratch that. The nostalgia and the genuinely funny moments will make you cry of pure joy. I personally loved seeing these lovable characters fight their way through super villain mayhem on once again. Incredibles 2 takes place right where the original left off, so expect to jump right into the action. Some of these action scenes were so flawless and exciting that I could've sworn they were taken straight from a Marvel or DC movie. However, Pixar still managed to create original action sequences by using the Parr family's abilities in many creative and innovative new ways. The animation, lighting, and surface texturing was also something to marvel at. From the individual strands of Dash's hair to the wrinkles on Mr. Incredible's clothes, this movie was a detailed filled masterpiece. When using the word ""masterpiece,"" I must also mention Michael Giacchino's brilliant score. The Incredibles theme was brought back for this film and used in so many exciting new ways. You can tell Giacchino loved experimenting with this powerful score that he wrote over a decade ago. Be prepared for many laugh out loud moments in this movie as well. Jack Jack will melt you heart in one moment and make whatever you're drinking come out of your nose in the next moment. He really does steal the show. From a nostalgic stand point, this film did not disappoint. It hit all of the marks of a successful movie sequel and as a Pixar Fan, I couldn't be happier. All in all, this movie is a blast and will probably be amongst the top 5 movies of the summer. It DEFINITELY lives up to the original and some might even say it's better.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Up to the Parr,"Incredibles 2 has taken themes from films like X-Men. What do you do with people who have special powers? As well as movies like Hancock. What do you do when superheroes cause destruction in the city? Incredibles 2 also adds a feminist bent.The films starts with the Incredibles fighting a supervillain that causes major damage to the city. The villain gets away and superheroes still remain banned.The Parr family are without a job and put up in a motel until they can figure things out.Help comes from Winston Deavor, head of Devtech. He loves superheroes and along with his inventive sister, Evelyn they have a plan to remarket superheroes and make them acceptable.They want Elastigirl to be the focus as she causes less financial damage. This leaves Mr Incredible as the house husband and he discovers that baby Jack-Jack has incredible super powers as well.The story is not too deep, if you have seen other Pixar films, you could maybe guess the ultimate villain. It does have lots of action packed fun, frenetic animation and children will certainly enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A little bit below the original, but still an absolute blast!","Whilst I didn't expect it to top the original, I can safely say that Incredibles 2 is a little bit below, but in terms of enjoyment I'd say it's about on par.The story sort of follows the same structure of the original, but still has enough new ideas to make it stand out as different.The writing is funnier than the original, hell sometimes it's outrageously funny. But it's still pretty dark at points like the original, so you don't have to worry if you think The Incredibles has been dumbed down to a full on comedy.There's a lot more action than the original, which is a good thing because it IS a superhero movie, but it isn't completely filled to the brim with ongoing action so there's time for actual storytelling and plot progression.The animation is absolutely fantastic. It's stunningly detailed, expressive and stylish. Just like the first Incredibles, actually, except the fact that Incredibles 2 is obviously going to look grander than it's predecessor from 14 years ago.The characters are still great and they haven't changed a bit, all of them are just as lovable as before. But the new villain, Screenslaver, is quite a disappointment. Screenslaver's a decent villain, but when compared to Syndrome there's a clear step down. Plus, the twist for who Screenslaver is is very predictable and I could see it coming a mile away.The soundtrack is fantastic, it's great to hear the Incredibles theme again after so long and it's used in different styles to match the scene now.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I thought that because modern Pixar is a bit of a mess that I'd get a cash grab but it instead I got a well made and excellent movie that deserves the 2 in it's title. I will just address the whole feminism thing people say it's promoting. YES, there's a slight feminist message that you can only see if you really dig deep for it. But unlike that of the new Star Wars movies, it isn't shoved down your throat and is more ''equal treatment'' than ''kill all the white men'' so stop saying it's propaganda, coming from a male by the way.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

It is a VERY well animated, funny, sweet, and not even gonna lie, at one point kinda scary movie. Some scenes could be tense (elastic girl's fight against Pizza Boy), but lightened things with a comedic scene.

It Was Worth the Wait!,"Many people were waiting for a sequel to one of the best animated animated films of all time from Pixar, I still like the first Incredibles to this day, it's funny, thought provoking, relatable, action packed, has great characters, stylish animation that has hasn't aged badly at all and Brad Bird takes a simple premise and plot but made it bigger and relatable and that's what I like about his work like the Iron Giant, Ratatouille and the first Incredibles, so the Incredibles was a child good favourite and I still remember watching it when I was young, one of Pixar's and Brad Bird's best I've seen.So when I heard the sequel was getting released this year, I was really pumped and ready to see the Parr family back in action and trailers certainly helped, now that it finally came on Friday the 13th (least it's wasn't bad luck) in the UK and I got a chance to see it the day after it got released and....... not surprisingly I love it!, it's a little better then the first one honestly, so how did it improve?.Well the plot about Helen Parr or Elastagirl (Holly Hunter) taking Bob or Mr. Incredible's (Craig T. Nelson) role from the first film which is she is been given a oppertunity to bring superheroes to not only help the rest of the Parr family but also try and make superheroes legal again, while Bob takes Helen's role from the first movie which is to look after the kids, Dash, Violet and Jack-Jack while Helen is out to do secret hero work and try and take down a new villain Screenslaver before he hypnotises everyone in the city, so it may be slightly formulaic and predicable, but it sure did a great job of doing the best it can, throughout the whole thing I was hooked on what going on, the plot is executed smoothly and the two plots with Helen and Bob connect quite well with each other, everyone actually has a part to play instead of being there, the movie still has it's great humour and there are some memorable moments of humour that evolves Jack-Jack, there's a subplot with Violet that is having a problem with her date and that got interesting since she's my favourite character in the film series, however as brilliant, clever and well executed the writing is, the movie still has great heart, especially with Bob and Violet, but sometimes it just plays it for laughs instead of taking it seriously which does kind of ruin what makes the Parr family relatable, especially at the restaurants scene which didn't really help, that and the reveal of who Screenslaver is which may not be who you expect but at that reveal moment, it becomes slightly predictable, but those are nitpicks, the movie still has originality, good heart, great laughs, it's actually more adult then kid friendly like the first movie, you care about these characters and it gets more interesting and it all comes together nicely.The animation is a massive upgrade from the first movie, the animation in the first movie did look great back in the day and it hasn't aged badly or anything, but it's starting to look not quite as brilliant as it was in 2004, however I still like it, but this animation has improved a lot, the movie looks more colourful, each character's design may look the same from the first movie but here it has a nice upgrade to them, The Parrs looks so much better, the backgrounds and the city looks more down to earth, when not using their powers, the characters has a smooth but slightly cartoon movement, but it's mostly down-to-earth, the action scenes are very creative and fast, when Jack-Jack or the rest of the Parr family use their powers it actually looks really cool, although if you get seizures from flashing images, i don't recommend this movie though because the villain Screenslaver has TVs that he uses to control his victims and in a fight that has TVs with lots of flashing images, so yeah that can be debatable, but besides that the animation is massively improved from the first movie and it looks fantastic!.The characters are still entertaining and memorable as they were back in 2004, even the new ones has a lot to offer, the Parr family is still great, Helen is a well developed character who gets even more screen time and her plot gets very interesting, Bob still has his funny moments and is still a likeable father, Dash might be annoying to some but I found him entertaining enough, but Jack-Jack and Violet stand out for me, Jack-Jack brings some great laughs with his different powers and Violet is one I found interesting and I did care about her the most besides the Parrs, Lucius Best a.k.a Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) is still awesome, the new characters are also great, well mostly, Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) is charmingly and delightful character who I like all the way through same with his sister Evelyn (Catherine Keener) although he remind me of Sterling from Cars 3 at times but I still liked his presences, the other superheroes like Voyd, Brick, Reflux, He-Lectrix are basically just other heroes but they do play a part like i said before, the villain Screenslaver had potential to be a great villain but came out as disappointing, the reveal of who the Screenslaver is can come off as predictable and the villain's plan did start off interesting but then it made no sense and Buddy Pine is so much better, but how can I forget Edna Mode voiced by the director himself Brad Bird, she still is really fascinating, funny and very entertaining when it comes to her and Jack-Jack, but at-least the voice acting is still amazing, Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson return and they are still great as they were before, the new ones like Catherine Keener, Bob Odenkirk, Sophia Bush, Jonathan Banks and many more do a fantastic job as well, but even with a weak villain, these characters old and new are still loveable and wonderful just how they should be.So maybe not quite as well crafted and important as the first film, but it still has what made the first movie amazing, it has an engaging and original plot, the animation is fantastic as always, loveable characters with great voice acting, really good humour with great heart and amazing action, this is high recommendation, if you love Pixar, the Incredibles or superheroes, please do go check this one out, along with Deadpool 2, this is one of the funniest superhero films of this year, I can't wait to see what Brad Bird makes next.Of course I'm going to give Incredibles 2 a 10/10!.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good,"A lot of people say that the drinking and cussing was not needed, but you have to remember that even though it is pixar, that doesn't mean it always has to follow to rules of being nice at all times.

The villian gets taken into a jet engine. Thats adult. This second film exapands upon that level of seriousness. It is action filled and still has the same stylish tone as the first.

Lacks the INCREDIBLE-ness of the original,"Incredibles 2 is not a bad movie, per se, but it does not exactly take off the way the first one did. There was so much originality and genuine surprise in the first one and this one has little of that. The same great characters are there but the circumstances they have to face in this one are nowhere near as cool or interesting as in the first movie. There are a lot of nice moments here but they just don't add up to as compelling a narrative as we had in the first one. Which is too bad. They spend a lot of time and energy on the whole ""should supers be illegal or legal"" or not idea, and frankly I don't think the audience really cares too much about that. We've had X-Men movies and Watchmen traverse this exact same territory and the villain in this one is no Syndrome. So on the whole the film, especially if you are a fan of the first, is a bit of a letdown. There are some new supers here but they don't get much screen time. The most interesting ""new"" development is the discovery of jack jacks powers, which lead to the films most spontaneous moments.

Brad Bird is 5 for 6 (and even the weakest one is still pretty good), and shows why he's one of the vital comedy/action filmmakers around. I also dug how for a few scenes this kind of turned into hypnosis-laden V for Vendetta for kids (when it is already a bit like Fantastic Four meets Watchmen for kids).I kept wondering who the voice of Eleanor was; when I saw in the credits it's Catherine Keener, it suddenly makes sense why the character for the first two thirds of the movie moves exactly like Keener does. I also found there's a point Elastigirl and Eleanor have a conversation about gender roles and it suddenly occurred to me, ""wait... This is happening in *this* movie? Will anyone point to this movie being woke as a heart attack?",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Pure Fun and Enjoyment,"'Incredibles 2' picks up right where it's predecessor, 'The Incredibles' left off, with the titular heroes, the Parr family, thrust into an exciting new adventure. The plot focuses on Helen Parr, aka Elastigirl, with the help of millionaire businessman Winston Deavor and his sister Evelyn, trying to make superheroes legal again, while Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, stays home with the kids. When a new villain emerges with a dangerous plan to turn the general populace against Supers, the Incredibles, along with family-friend Frozone, must band together to stop the rogue. I found it humorous how Bob and Helen's roles are reversed from the first film, but it's refreshing and it works. I found the story very compelling, with the perfect combination of action, mystery, suspense, and humor. Unfortunately, the film's antagonist, The Screenslaver, isn't as compelling as the first film's villain, Syndrome. Screenslaver's identity is kept hidden for most of the film, with clues here and there to keep you guessing. Ultimately, it's not too difficult to figure out who is under the mask, but it's still an interesting mystery. Most of the cast from 'The Incredibles' returns for the sequel, and once again do a stellar job. The animation has greatly improved from the first film, with the characters and scenery looking better and more realistic than ever. One aspect of this film I especially enjoyed is that we see more of the Parr family working together to take down the bad guy, with even the kids, Dash and Violet, helping to save the day. The film's standout character is without a doubt the Parr family's youngest member, Jack-Jack, who is a delight to watch and steals every scene he is in. Overall, 'Incredibles 2' is pure fun and enjoyment from beginning to end, and I actually enjoyed it more than the first. Much like 'The Incredibles', the film's ending leaves the door open for another installment, and I immensely hope we get to see 'Incredibles 3' one day, because I can't get enough of this 'Super' family.My Rating: 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
STILL reinforcing gender stereotypes,"My partner expected me to like this film, given that it's got a lot of 'gender equality' in it. Erm, no, it hasn't. In fact, in many ways it serves to reinforce those messages.
Some examples:Mr Incredible insists on going back to work instead of Elasta-Girl because 'it's just something I've got to do' (read: '...for my male ego')Mr Incredible inferring that he would be better to lead the campaign to promote super-heroes because 'well,,,, you know?!' where he almost, but doesn't quite say 'because I'm a man and she's a woman'Mr Incredible struggling to manage Elasta-Girl's 'female' work - childcare, feeding, bedtime, homework etcMr Incredible gritting his teeth to be supportive but clearly hating it that Elasta-Girl is working and doing super hero stuff while he's a stay at home dadElasta-girl ready to come home at a moment's notice because she clearly doesn't trust her husband to have it all under control (she even 'mispeaks')To the people saying that this is feminist propaganda, I have news for you. None of these are positive messages, and all of them actually serve to reinforce the gender stereotypes Pixar appear to be clumsily attempting to combat.
In fact, a positive gender equal message would be Mr Incredible actually delighted that his wife is chosen to lead the campaign, and genuinely supportive. It would be to show him delighted that he can stay home and spend time with his kids. Or actually managing the household, and not being made to look like an incapable, incompetent twit. Her showing confidence in his ability to manage okay.
I get that these are plot devices, but they are OLD FASHIONED, and patronize both men and women (in many ways, men more so.)
You could have made the same film without patronizing men and their ability to be stay-at-home parents, or reinforcing the message that men should feel emasculated by women working and being more of a success than them.

Lost Vision,"Great visual animation does not make up for the cringey dialogue and uncompelling story. The characters that you fell in love with in the original act so different in this movie and sometimes contradictory to their character. Most of the scenes don't move the story and the ones that do have laughably unsmooth exposition. Most of the scenes are bits to try to get the audience to laugh which would be fine if they were true to the characters and there was a compelling story that they fit in. The villain does not work at all; dumb motive, dumb plan. They definitely had potential but for me it was not executed well and it wrapped up terribly. Granted, there are some cool showcases of powers that were creative and new which is where I thought this movie shined. And I also thought all the scenes with Edna were great and I felt like I was watching an Incredibles movie. It doesn't forgive the faults. One thing I was really excited for was the score from Michael Giacchino; In the original, he flexed such an impressive ability to compose emotions and motion while also fitting the score together, perfectly, with the pacing of each scene. In this one, the score doesn't get time to shine and is less noticeable. It's partly due to amount of dialogue in this movie. It came to a point where I felt relieved when there wasn't and I could just watch the action and listen to score. Overall, this feels like another cheap-shot try-hard sequel. They make incompetent references to the first movie. Everything seems forced and unnecessary. I found myself bored at points during this movie which really disheartened me. See it for the action, Edna, jack-jack's cuteness, and small gags that mirror regular family life and feuds but don't expect a compelling story, dynamic dialogue or interesting characters. I feel like an old man who doesn't understand the world anymore because I know a lot of people will like this movie. Maybe because the original was so magical, this one could never live up to my expectations. But to me, it didn't get close.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Horrible voice for Elastigirl,"Every detail of any movie counts and as far as the voices for characters go, they are not good.

The Inedibles,"I loved the first ""The Incredibles"" and remember wondering why a follow-up hadn't been made soon after its success. Better late than never you might say but personally after watching this 14-years later sequel, I'm tending to better never than late. Somehow, for me, the movie just fell flat and didn't please me to anything like the degree of its predecessor.Don't get me wrong, the Pixar animation is fantastic as always, but somewhere along the line, the story, characters and humour lack something. The outlawed super-heroes / aliens / mutants theme has been done to death, from the X-Men to the Marvel Civil War right up to the current Supergirl TV series, likewise the husband and wife role-reversal with Mr Incredible's turn as three super-babies and a super-dad again seemed old-hat while Elastigirl's elevation to solo superstardom also felt a little like a forced and belated concession to PC-dom.I'm trying now to remember a really funny, laugh-out-loud line or memorable eye-popping sequence and I find I can't. The sub-plot of Violet and her young beau reminded me of any number of ""Married With Children"" episodes with like I said, a lack of good gags, plus Dash's characterisation was just irritating and new shape-shifting baby Jack-Jack (what kind of name is that?) even more so.For me, I found the film really dragged in places with its too predictable villain and unmemorable climax which no amount of flashy graphics could disguise. In truth I think that this sort of thing was done way better in ""Megamind"", ""Despicable Me"" and of course the first Incredibles feature.At leat I can't accuse it of being a quick cash-in but really this is one set of retired super-heroes which should have remained on the shelf.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

What happened? Disappointing Sequel,"I have always been a big fan of the original. In fact, I consider it to be one of Pixar's best. Maybe that's part of the problem. It's difficult to follow up the excellent original.The Good:
1. The opening is a nice setup for a plot line that plays well throughout the movie and has an amusing conclusion.2. The opening and ending action sequences are excellent. Nice teamwork sequences.3. The Jack-Jack bits are fun and fleshes out his character significantly.The Bad:1. Far too much time is spent on Elastagirl. I thought this was supposed to be a movie about the entire family. Why is she doing pretty much all of the interesting superhero stuff while the dad and kids do mostly nothing for vast stretches of the movie (save for the aforementioned Jack-Jack bits)? I mean, I get that that's part of the plot, but it seems like a weird direction to go with the story in the first place.2. The identity of the villain is obvious from the beginning. I realize it's a movie for kids, but Pixar is usually smarter with their writing. I understand it's hard to top Syndrome, but this villain is uninteresting for the most part.3. The middle of the movie drags. It's far too long. At one point during the middle, I just wanted it to end. It was dull for too long. It would have benefitted from tighter editing and a shorter run time.The Ugly:1. Curse words and swearing in a Pixar movie. Really, Disney? There is no excuse for this. I should be able to take my kids to a movie like this without concerning myself with the language.2. Political nonsense. Elastagirl is made to looks like a nearly perfect superhero while Mr. Incredible is made to look like an inept parent. Of course, feminism and SJW trash seems to be slipped into just about everything coming out of Hollywood these days. We hear this stuff in the media all of the time. Is it too much to ask to leave it out of entertainment made for kids?3. Lack of humor. Maybe it's just me, but this movie doesn't seem to contain hardly any of the clever humor of the original. There are one or two scenes that are somewhat funny, but part of the charm of the original was the way the comedy was integrated. This one, for the most part, falls flat in that department as far as I am concerned.To be fair, I really didn't have any interest in seeing this movie despite my fondness for the original because the trailer was uninspiring. Perhaps the story and execution would have been much better if they hadn't waited 14 years between the original and the sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lazy stereotyping and boring dialogue,"Not sure what they were thinking when they wrote this, but it wasn't about the incredibles.Not sure where to start with this, there's not one original thought in this whole movie, it's almost as though someone's re-hashed the most mediocre bits of the first incredibles film and spliced it with one of the twilight trilogy films.I got the distinct impression this was an existing script that was adapted to fit the incredibles dynamic ~ and unfortunately it didn't quite fit.This is a huge wasted opportunity with a franchise that could have been a huge success (I avoided saying 'incredible').Both my kids (8 and 9) kind of liked it, but that's not enough to warrant the £30 it cost me in cinema tickets if you ask me.My advice, don't waste your money.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Big bright colorful entertainment, although doesn't have much to it in depth","I still remember watching the first Incredibles film and liking it for what it was, rather than what it had been marketed as. I liked its darkness, and how much of the character and plotting seemed aimed at someone much, much older than the marketing had suggested. By contrast, Incredibles 2 seems much more interested in keeping things light and fun. This makes it a slightly 'lesser' film in terms of the detail and observational elements but does make it easy viewing. The plot sort of follows a journey for Mrs Incredible, but it doesn't really build it so much as use it - likewise any emotional knock-on for the other characters is the same. In terms of what plot it uses to get with this, it is obvious enough in terms of twists and direction, but it does the job.That job is producing plenty of enjoyable action and funny moments, and does so for most viewers of most ages. The lack of darkness helps this slickness, and the 1960's vision of the future design adds to the sense of fun with its nostalgic references and look. The voice cast are all solid, even if several of them are essentially doing what they are famous for (Jackson, Odenkirk). As a whole there is much to enjoy in terms of spectacle and laughs, but it doesn't run much deeper than that, making it a lesser film, but probably one good enough that you'll not feel the impact of that till you reflect back on it.",,Anonymous,Animation
Fourteen years? Worth it!,"The Incredibles 2 has finally arrived and after a long wait does what few sequels can and probably should. It lives to the hype in the best of ways possible. Worth noting is that this movie might just be one of Pixar's most visually stunning and vibrantly animated pieces yet and that just adds extra atmosphere. The cast is terrific, with welcome returns from fan favourites giving solid performances to the franchise's fully realised characters. The story is simple, yet interesting and has several side elements that are incorporated very well. The idea of a larger superhero world and their legality is discussed with a narrative that is surprisingly mature and conscious of the message it wants to convey. The action and overall spectacle is beautiful and creative, even if its not as large-scale or grand as the first one. I will say though, Incredibles 2 has gorgeous scenery, an awesome cast and a great story, but it has a villain problem. ScreenSlaver isn't really connected to the world in any meaningful way and ends up being a one-off baddie with only a few memorable moments. But, in the end, the movie is still a win, and manages to tie up loose ends from the first and open up new doors for possible new instalments, which I honestly hope are yet to come.
 
The good: Visual design and clean animation, Performances from the cast, Good story that tied into the original, Great new characters as well as recurring older ones, Creative and vibrant action sequencesThe bad: Main villain is a little off and forgettable, Some characters may feel a little under-utilised at times",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Next Episode,"There's honestly nothing really wrong with The Incredibles 2. If all you're looking for is a solid family movie, it's enjoyable enough, with lots of action and fun characters.But I can't shake the feeling that there's something about it that's... ""off"" feeling. It took Pixar fourteen years to make a sequel that is, by all accounts, a little more than average. The original Incredibles was a breath of fresh air, and the best super hero movie in its time. It broke new ground for Pixar in every aspect.This just feels like the next episode of a television series. Everyone is kind of settling in to a status quo and the adventures continue. I know it's a weird complaint for a movie that's not actually bad.Part of that, I think, has to do with the film's themes. The first Incredibles had the villain Syndrome, who defined the whole movie's attitude toward super heroes. It touched on how fans interact with their idols, the reality of being a ""super"", and the very real reasons people may resent them for their enhanced abilities. Those elements anchored everything in something more thoughtful than just punching out the bad guys in a secret volcano lair.The Incredibles 2 lacks that anchor. It hamfistedly gestures towards the topics of media consumption and gender equality, but ultimately chooses to say nothing about either issue. Instead, it fills most of the movie with very standard superhero antics punctuated by smaller slices of family dynamic. It's all still fun... but they just aren't as deeply rooted as the themes of that first movie.Again, it's just The Incredibles, but more of it. And unlike some movie sequels that feel like they're trying to replicate the formula of the first movie, Incredibles 2 stands out as its own thing. It just doesn't breach any new subjects. Instead, it comfortably rests in the shadow of the original.For most people, that's good enough. But I was hoping for something a little more incredible.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
This beast bucks the formulaic trend of the recent Disney movies,"Kudos to Brad for making the movie tight like a mission impossible adventure. There is a sense of danger, anticipation and then delivery of that promise, against a very believable villain, and with none of the weird generic formula that plagues recent films like ""A Force Awakens"" and ""Star Trek Discovery"" which really gets in the way of telling a good story. I don't know what it is, but those aforementioned films feel the same and I can't tell them apart and always feel like I watched an alternate universe rerun of the same thing. I truly believe that Pixar is on a good path with exception to Cars 3, and that is a small price to pay to keep the lights on!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best ever.,"In Incredibles 2, how does writer/director Brad Bird make a family film that is adventure, thriller, and comedy? Well, he's had practice beginning with Iron Giant and Ratatouille and The Incredibles in between. With three distinct approaches to entertainment he has made a reputation of smart and fun and plain genius all over.Incredibles 2 is super family fun as the family picks up where they left off, specifically leaving a track meet and pursuing The Underminer (John Ratzenberger), who is digging under the city with a giant corkscrew. The importance of this successful sequence is that it's the first time for the family to work as a team in public.It's a regular family going through growing pains and a superhero family trying to reconcile its gifts with a society that the rules against them. That's right, super heroes have been outlawed because they're perceived as adding to the troubles. The answer lies in pursuing the law and changing it more than fighting a strange villain called The Screenslaver, who hypnotizes while you watch.Obviously, a subtheme of this multilayered allegory is the enslavement of the populace to it screens. Yet, Bird does not enslave the audience to theme, e.g., a race sequence in which Elastigirl, Helen Parr (voice of Holly Hunter), chases a hover train taken over to head to destruction is as furious a ride on a motorcycle as you have ever seen.Not all is heavy-duty: Baby Jack-Jack fights a raccoon, funny in himself, with baby showing hitherto unknown powers. The sequence is high humor using a baby as a rib-tickling comedian-hero. Add to this slapstick the light orchestration of composer Michael Giacchino and you have a sci-fi animation with soul.That's the irony of this inspired animation and real life--sometimes even the good has to fight to be recognized, or to be legitimized: ""You know it's crazy, right? To help my family, I gotta leave it. To fix the law, I gotta break it."" (Helen Parr) Incredibles 2 is primarily about bringing back heroes to the public fold and figuring out how to break the law in order to fix it.Furthermore, what's a super mom to do when duty calls and she must leave the family under the untrained care of dad, Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson). Bird doesn't make Bob a boob (although there are laughs at his expense), but rather has the rest of the family pitch in to help with major challenge, baby Jack-Jack with hitherto unknown super powers.Bird recognizes the need for dads to fit in the management of the house, for instance, as he tries to untangle a mess with daughter Violet's (Sarah Vowell) date, who discovers she's a superhero. He misses their date, and dad must do some intricate counseling of his head-strong daughter. Even for a superhero, that's a tough challenge.But the super heroism most prominent is that of Mom, as good an example of the best of #MeToo that allows a woman to be empowered publicly and fulfilled privately, with a little help from her family.One of the best films of the year and in the animation canon for all time.",,Anonymous,Animation

A Great Sequel but Just Falls Short of Incredible,"The animation in the original was great but this movie took it another leap forward. Having seen the original so many times, it took me a bit to adjust to it, but the movie never ceased to beautiful or have something imaginative. The attention to detail is insane (Bird has a reputation for being nitpicky, so much so that the animators of the original partially modelled the character Syndrome after him) and there was never a moment was I wasn't impressed or even blown away by how stunning this movie was. Adding on top of that, I would stack the action scenes in this movie up against any modern superhero blockbuster. They are thrilling, and I would even say astounding. My favourite was the runaway train scene. I hate to keep playing the same note, but I think the visual style in Incredibles 2 is as impressive if not more than any animated movie I've seen in the past couple of years. I also understand the worry about triggering epilepsy because one of the fights features a lot of flashing lights. I thought it was a sensational scene but the warning is warranted.Moving from the animation to the characters, Bird and his team do a good job developing the familiar and introducing the new. Instead of Bob/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) being the main character, the focus shifts to Helen/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter). I was worried when I saw the trailer, not because Helen was the hero, she's a great character and my trepidation was never about the story having a feminist slant. But the husband not being able to handle the family duties is a tired thing, it's been done over and over and this movie calling attention to it seemed counterproductive. Is anyone offended by a stay-at-home dad? It was a temporary arrangement and I feel like we've gotten past that being weird. Anyway, Elastigirl is a great hero and her narrative was compelling. I liked how she bounced off of her new corporate backers Winston Deaver (Bob Odenkirk) and Evelyn Deavor (Catherine Keener) and while those character play to the actor's strengths (Winston isn't Saul Goodman but he's not too far off), they had plenty of personality. I'll talk more about Bob later, but I also liked how Violet (Sarah Vowell) and Dash (Huck Milner) hugged the line between having issues yet not being too bratty. Violet is pretty moody throughout the course of the movie, but they give her a nice moment near the end that compensates. Luscius/Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) is a funny returning character but he drifts in and out of the movie, I would have liked him to have more screen time. Everyone's favourite characters are back in Edna Mode (Brad Bird) and Jack-Jack. Jack-Jack was a riot and I loved almost every second we got to spend with him. Edna stole the show in the original and while she doesn't get more screen time, her appearance is pitch perfect. They go with the less is more plan with her and she's just as effective as Bob's suit designer/confidant.Looking back on the trailer, a lot of the more annoying moments actually ended up being some of the better bits of the movie. Bob trying to handle Jack-Jack's endlessly varied power set was hilarious and although the movie centres around Elastigirl, the war on the home front occupied my attention completely. I still did find some minor problems however. Incredibles 2 shows off Helen's abilities superbly and she capably anchors the film. But on the downside, I thought the movie betrayed Bob's abilities as a superhero. He defeated a robot in the original that killed dozens of other heroes, yet he can't handle someone who has never tested their abilities in the field? I approve that the movie put Mr. and Mrs. Incredible on more equal footing (I'm also good with Helen being the more professional hero which is what Incredibles 2 seems to insinuate) but they didn't have to bring Bob down to build up Helen. I wish we had gotten more opportunities to see the family fight together as a team. As the trailer shows, the family each has their moments but rarely as a group. It doesn't detract from the action but the fight scenes with the group together were wonderful in the original and I wanted more of that. I would also comment that a lot of the subtext is going to fly over a younger kid's head. Its nice that they include adult friendly banter about complex issues, all the best family movies can appeal both to adults and kids. But I doubt kids are going to understand much of the debate that fuels the villain's motivations.I watched the original entry before going to see this and it only inflated high expectations. The Incredibles is a masterpiece and it should be regarded as one of the best superhero movies ever made. This movie had a lot to live up to and despite some minor stumbles, I think Incredibles 2 comes close. It boasts some phenomenal action, the animation is top notch and while some of the story elements were better handled then others, I still left the theatre impressed. At worst, I took a couple of small issues with the progression of some of the characters, which is a relatively minor complaint. If you've been waiting for another adventure with the Incredibles, I think you're going to be pleased. Pixar makes phenomenal movies when they're firing on all cylinders and this movie is no exception. I highly recommend this to fans of the original and newcomers alike.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
It was too many years apart from the first one,"It was too many years apart from the first one, but the plot didn't improve much. Instead, it became more traditional and conservative. Of course, there are also social factors in China. After all, there are too many double-workers in China. They don't understand the full-time father's laughing point as a key description. For the battle, except for the self-blackout at the beginning, the other parts are all normal. It's really boring.

More thrilling then the first!,"This review will be buried under 800+ others, but I just had to put my homage to the movie here. I lost count of how many amazing set pieces. Yes, there is little character developement, but we already know those folks. The movie puts them in new roles, and that is enough. We already know the universe they inhabit, and frankly exploring social themes would be a waste of computer power. I could get through even the overbearing feminism, but that is probably because with so much netflix, PC stuff has beaten me into submission. Also, because the elastic woman is so well used. So I ended up enjoying Mr. Incredible trying to be a stay at home dad (and relatively succeding, giving the utterly impossible circunstances). Yes, the plot is predictable, but this is kind of expected in such an action-oriented flick. Jack-Jack gives enough surprises.Incredibles 1 was good, but it dragged at times, specially in the 1st half. This one will not let you down, it really puts everything into the action scenes, and there is never less then 10 minutes between them. The chasing of the Screenslaver in the building and the Violet/Voyd fight were my favorites. Introducing new people with new powers was a smart idea, and it works better here then in the overcrowded X-Men sequels. The ending is overdone, but in the age of Marvel movies, ending battles have to be overdone, it's kind of a rule. I just took this movie like a Mission Impossible sequel: give me nonstop thrills, without being overbearing, and that is enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Suffers from predictability, but the presentation is still very good.","""Incredibles 2"" sees the Parr family split up: Helen 'Elastigirl' is now given the crimefighting to do, while her husband has to manage the family. If I recall correctly, their roles here are slightly reversed from the original, which is interesting because both parents get to show off facets of their characters that were not fully touched upon in the older movie. That's what a sequel is supposed to do, after all.The necessary result of the split-up is that the film is divided into A-story (superhero shenanigans) and B-story (domestic stuff) that have to come together in the last act. Unfortunately, the A-story is rather predictable and underdeveloped, the B-story lacks structure, and the connection between the two feels a bit forced.But before I get too down on this film, let me talk a bit about the good things, of which there are many: This is still a thoroughly entertaining film! I did not see it in its original language, so I can't comment on the voice acting (the German dub is pretty good, if anyone cares), but the animation is nice to look at; just detailed enough to make the world tangible, but never to the extent that the film forgets it's a cartoon. There are some very neatly designed environments and set-pieces that ensure the film never looks dull, and though there are funnier Pixar movies, they never go too long without cracking a joke or two. There are also a great number of visual jokes and clever camera angles. The only negative to the visual presentation of the film is that some of the action scenes don't follow any rules of physics, so there is very little tension to them.What made me have a rather middling reception to the film (at least compared to the first one) had mostly to do with the way the story was told. In the first act, the movie touches upon some interesting themes (Do we have to follow the law if the law is unjust? etc.), but it never gets too far in developing them before throwing in the generic villain of the week. The conflicts between the family are generally well-developed, but their solution is forced due to the formulaic structure of the movie.Another big issue to me was that the Helen-goes-crimefighting storyline was painfully predictable. Though it had some cool visual ideas, you can see almost all of the plot points coming from miles away. The family subplot was far more entertaining, mainly thanks to the larger number of jokes. None of the character arcs were too far out of the ordinary (Violet's crush doesn't like her back, Jack-Jack discovers his powers, Bob is in over his head being the stay-at-home dad), but from the storytelling in these scenes it is clear that Brad Bird and company cared more about the character interactions and dynamics than the story. As a result, some of the shifts between the family drama and the action-heavy fight against the villain are less than fluent, because the themes are so disparate.Like many other kids' animation films, this movie feels like there are two stories that weren't strong enough to hold its audience's attention on their own, so they threw them together and tried to make that work. As a result, ""Incredibles 2"" is a disappointment, but a minor one and measured against its (great) predecessor. So it's still miles above the last couple ""Despicable Me"" movies or similar films. I wouldn't rush out to buy the blu-ray, but the next time I watch the original, I might just make it a double feature.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Well worth seeing, but short of ""Incredible"".","3.5/4After 14 years, the highly anticipated ""Incredibles 2"" waltzes into theatres. Based on the trailer, and the fact that Pixar has (in recent years) started to become more hit-or-miss with their efforts, I had very low expectations set for this movie. Of course, I watch it opening night, and while it doesn't quite match the first one, it's still a great movie.Incredibles 2 picks up right where it's predecessor left off, at the track meet with The Underminer making his debut. It's general theme is concerning the Parr family's attempt to bring supers back into legality and legitimacy. This movie takes a shift in its primary focus and puts the spotlight on Elastagirl, as she takes her turn in saving the day.The Parrs were perfected upon, and the action was one tough act to follow. Some of the powers really make for some great sequences. The kinky romance between Violet and Tony was fun to view, and Jack Jack was incontrovertibly awesome. On the flip side of things, some of the ""new heroes"" introduced were simply downright annoying to me, and the villain was predictable (and maybe a bit ineffective if you ask me). However, a few unlikable characters aren't going to kill the fun.While this movie didn't quite resonate with me in the way the original did, the original set some pretty mean standards. The Incredibles one of the greatest family movies ever made. Incredibles 2 is great as well, just don't go in expecting a repeat of the first one.",,Anonymous,Animation
Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...,"To be clear from the get go, I'm a huge fan of the first film so my expectations were high.After watching it a few times now I've struggled to put my finger on what bugs me about it compared to the first one, but finally it came to me!First, here's what you'll love about this film:The quality of animation(colours, lighting, explosions etc) - They managed to beautifully create an even better world of super heroes compared to the first film.The storyline - This was somewhat predictable and they certainly made the direction of the film obvious in terms of the 'parenting' aspects of super hero life.The voice acting - As in the first film this has some great voice actors in to carry the film's drama and emotion.So, what wasn't so, Incredible?...sorry I couldn't resist:In non-animated films you have good actors and bad actors. Of course these animated films aim to create believable personalities and behaviours that are acted to a high standard. Unfortunately for me this film just doesn't achieve this, most noticeably with Mr.Incredible.I can't help but feel like I'm just watching someone overact every emotion possible, distracting through every conversation and even being flat-out annoying in certain scenes.The pacing is also off, the entire first half of the film feels like everyone's on cocaine. Where are the pauses? The contemplation before an answer? Nowhere.Still, it's admirable to see Pixar aiming for a down to earth, emotional films with action sequences often just about making up for the disjointed conversational scenes, also the twist in the story is decent and I for one did not make a correct prediction which is always nice.Bottom Line:If you've not even seen the first film, you'll probably love this.If you're a fan of the first film you'll probably enjoy this.If you're a super fan of the first film, this second instalment will remind you why.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"IT'S BEEN 14 YEARS?! WHAT THE .....,@^%# is going on!?","HOLY FUDGEMUNCHERS! Seriously? 14 years? Well that's just a kick in the nuts! I didn't see the first one until last year and I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around that little factoid.
And I haven't even seen the second one so what the hell am I writing a review about?! Well, my fan-boy 10 out of ten is actually for the trailer and the short that Pixar made by cutting it out of the original. Jack-Jack is just perfect, and hilarious; I love the delighted/amused look on his face when he discovers he has laser sight for the first time -lets hope the kid doesn't have allergies when he grows up or he'll be sneezing and blowing off people's heads off left and right every spring.
This review does deserve a ""no helpful"" rating since I'm really just saying they did Jack-Jack perfectly - whoever did the animation for his character deserves a big fat bonus for their work - I'm going to see the movie in a theater and will buy it from Amazon just to see him discover his powers - which are awesome by the way - and the music when he ignites is a perfect match also.
I'm sure this is going to be one of the rare ""Im going to see it 14 or 15 times"" movies - which is saying a lot because lately I haven't even been able to watch through the entire movie of the last few that I was looking forward to but they turned out horrible new release movies that have been released.

My biggest problem with this sequel was that the family did not seem to work as a team. In the first movie, the whole family was continually using their powers to complement each other. This movie had each Incredible acting largely on their own; all working towards the same cause, but usually not directly interacting with each other.

I know a few people didn't like it something about bad language and lifestyle adjustment but I thought that was good. Through life we always have to adjust and if we haven't had to do something before it can be hard and comical. The incredibles really showed this and by the end you can see that everyone has adjusted to their new roles in life very well. Is the the end?

I waited 14 years for this?!,"Although the plot is not as good as the first one, it is still worth the 14 year wait. The first half could have been improved immensely though, because for the first hour or so it feels like a gender-swapped rehash of the first one, and plays more like a direct-to-video sequel like the ones Disney used to put out. The first half still has its moments though, particularity the ones with Jack-Jack and the trouble he gets into. A lot of the humor in the first half does come from those scenes, and is more visual based. After the first hour, the plot definitely picks up and reaches a satisfying conclusion. There is still plenty of great action, and the villain, while not as good as Syndrome from the first movie, does deliver a pretty great monologue that makes you think for a moment that their goal isn't so bad, but simply the methods they are using to reach that goal. When it finally is revealed who the villain is though, it does feel stolen from a certain Marvel movie that shall remain unnamed so as to avoid spoilers. The animation is still gorgeous, (though the character of a newscaster does look like an animated caricature like the ones you would get drawn of yourself at a carnival and he just looks creepy), and some of the best voice acting is from Bob Odenkirk. He is one of the best characters in the film. It is disappointing that the film, in terms of plot and character development, had to take a bit of a step backward. What made the first film so unique was seeing the family dynamic and the family using their powers to help each other out. Here, we get very little of that. It has the typical ""The dad is stupid and hapless and needs the mom to fix all his mistakes, har dee har"" stuff that's done to death in just about every sitcom on tv, and that's disappointing, especially from a so-called ""family"" company like Disney. Haven't we as a society moved past this? In a world where everyone is crying for ""equal rights and representation"", shouldn't we get true equality? Equality does not mean superiority at the so-called ""privileged"" individual or party's expense,and that's disappointing to see here. It also had some unnecessary (albeit mild) profanity, which was also disappointing. (Again, ""family"" company) Overall, it is worth seeing. Just don't expect it to be as thrilling as the first one.

It's so, so silly compared to the first one. Incredibles 1 had some moments of levity, but it took itself pretty seriously and had something to say about people becoming stagnated upon settling down, not letting their gifts and passions see the light of day. This one isn't really saying much. It's trying to hard to be funny and wastes its time on Jack Jack, math homework, and pointless side characters. Honestly, they should have set this one at least a decade in the future and focused on the kids now become adults, telling a different story with different lessons. The fact that this takes place seconds after Incredibles 1 ends deflates that perfect ending. They really didn't need a sequel, honestly. It'd be like (God forbid) making a sequel to the Iron Giant or Ratatouille, two other Brad Bird movies. These movies are self-contained and pretty flawless: they don't need sequels to say anything more.

14 Years but Not Too Late,"Going into this movie I expected to see a film that just outright sucked. Too much time had passed, the voice actors had to change, the hype was going to be too great and there was no way it would please expectations which would be way too demanding. Then, when I heard this film was really good I thought that people might be overreacting and just saying it's great when really it wasn't. This is how I thought, this is how I was trained to think. Well?They're damn right! This film was awesome! It was on par with the original! It was super!In an age of superhero movies you'd think that they wouldn't be able to get it right with a sequel for a movie that came out 14 years ago.Yet they did, Brad Bird scored again! The key to this film's success is the pacing and flow. The movie feels very upbeat with energetic action and an engaging story. It has some quiet moments for storytelling but it never feels like the story comes to a halt. There is also plenty of humor but unlike say the Marvel movies it feels natural and doesn't come from dumb one liners but instead from slapstick and funny writing and a few running gags. This helps the story maintain a fast beat and the audience is almost always invested.The only real downside is that the villain is not nearly as good as the villain in the first movie. I don't wanna get into spoiler territory but it isn't as memorable or as entertaining as Syndrome (the first villain in these films). Once you watch it you'll see why. With that said, this is more than made up for with the family dynamic. This film continues the great family that we got a taste of in the first movie and devokes so much time into it. The only detracting flaw from the first movie that kinda pulls people away is the fact that a lot of the movie (at least in the beginning) deals with Mr. Incredibles mid-life crisis and not the family dynamic. But this wasn't a problem since this allowed him to be the main character and thus we feel a closer connection to him than we would with Elastigirl. Well, now it's full circle. Even if the first film has the better villain, this film gets the better family so it's pretty even.Holly Hunter, how do I say it, damn well killed it. She is so good in this movie! I had my doubts and I kinda expected her character to be a step backwards but she felt really natural. The perfect family dynamic from the first movie is preserved and even expanded on and Elastigirl is no exception. Also really liked Mr. Incredible who was my second favorite character from the last movie (Syndrome was number one). He goes through a pretty convincing arc and he is still a great father character, something that had become rare in animation today. The kids are great too, including Jack Jack who is hilarious as ever, and though Dash has a different voice actor (which I know is unavoidable) I am very pleased that it sounds so similar to the original and my suspension of disbelief was preserved.Go watch this movie, it's worth the wait and really fun to watch. If you loved the original you'll love this movie too. It's great. Super great. 9/10. Really fun to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Incredibles 2,"Walt Disney always said he wanted to release his films every seven years, I think, so each time there was a new audience to appreciate them. This one has waited twice that time for a sequel that is perfectly watchable, but boy is it wordy! Dad ""Bob"" swaps roles with wife ""Helen"" (aka ""Elastigirl"") only to find that it's she who falls foul of the latest government anti-superhero regulations. Fortunately, the wealthy ""Deavor"" brother and sister act have a cunning plan to reverse these publicity disasters and restore the public confidence in our lycra-clad citizens. The remainder of this film follows rather procedural lines. Dad has fun managing the increasingly active ""Jack-Jack"" (and his entertaining new powers) whilst mum has to combat the new enemy ""Screenslaver"" who has some fairly formidable mind-control skills which he intends to use for, of course, world domination. As a role reversal comedy, the dad definitely gets the better, and funnier, end of the stick. As an adventure film, though, it's all just a bit 'been there got the T-shirt' and there is nowhere near enough action to sustain the almost two hours of screen time.

A decent sequel..,"Not as good as the original but had a similiar atmosphere/vibe to it though but had some subtle differences.A solid story with positive messages but feels a bit too similar to the original with the centre idea being around the legalizaiton of superhereoes. In the last movie it was Mr. Incredible that try to fix that law but in this movie it was Elastigirl. The characters were alright, the Incredible family has been developing nicely but Jack-Jack seemed way to OP. The antagonist was just straight up lame, no super powers and her motives and personality seemed plain and stupid. The visuals have drastically improved since it has been 14 years since the last movie. The music was very good mainly with the use of trumpets.Overall a semi enjoyable film.Memorable: No Rewatchable: Unlikely..",,Anonymous,Animation
It's okay. It's NOT incredible.,"I think Pixar lost it's oomph after we lost Steve Jobs. The Incredibles' first movie is one of the perfectly executed family movies to me. But this one lacks of convincing character emotional ups-and-downs, innovative plot, and epic final scene. I can't say it's a complete disaster (compared to Escape Plan 2 - see it yourself at your own risk). I did enjoy the motorcycle chase, Jack Jack parts and Violet's emo little drama with her crush. All I can say is, unlike the first one, this is not a Pixar movie it should be.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

However, parents be warned-There are some scenes where lights flash brightly and rapidly. If your child can suffer from seeing this please wait and watch it on dvd or be ready to cover there eyes during the movie. Also for some odd reason this movie curses twice.

Slow & Predictable Not the Formula to Make It Incredible,"Slow and predictable is not exactly the formula to make something ""incredible"". Fourteen years after the original was released, Incredibles 2 picks up where the prequel left off. This time, the supers find themselves in a position to come out of the shadows led by Elsatigirl.Winston Deavor is the recruiter of the supers. Being a Disney/Pixar film, they gave him a Walt Disney (himself) look in a 1964 World's Fair Tomorrowland kind of way throughout his scenes and even in the monorail scene.With Elastigirl off trying to 1) put the supers back on the public positive and 2) figure out who the Screenslaver (see the pun!); it was up to Mr. Incredible to become Michael Keaton's Mr. Mom. From teaching new math to Dash (which, the education system really has created new math somewhere in the past 20 years!), to fixing Violet's relationship to taming Jack-Jack, Bob Parr has officially met his match.Throughout the film we are introduced to new supers along the way. Some with names, others, not so much. These events lead to a very predictable plot twist, but cool matchups of fight scenes.Being a Pixar film, be on the lookout for a Hidden Mickey and the Pixar light! But overall, Incredibles were more normal and average than super.charliemoviedatabase.weebly.com",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

The only character development is Jack Jack,"And by development, I just mean new powers. The Incredibles family were just dropped into a script. None of any of film's characters' core beliefs, including the villain, are tested or evolve over the course of the film. Sequels need to either double down on our known characters, or introduce fresh new ones to fall in love with, and this film did neither.However, the action and comedy are extremely fun! A good fight will easily make me want to re-watch a film, but I'm not sure sitting through the dull parts around the scenes that I do like is worth the trouble.I can only rate films an 8 or above if I'd gladly re-watch it solo on my own time, but this only gets a 7 because I'd probably only watch it again at home with the family if they put it on TV.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good Sequel! (Spoiler Free),"At long last here is Incredibles 2! Being a 2000's kid who saw the first one in the theaters, I have been greatly anticipating this movie for 14 years!! I loved the first one as a kid, and my appreciation has grown for it over the years as I have grown up and gained insight to the more adult themes of the film. It is so much more than a super hero film, and I count it as my favorite Pixar movie.I try with most films to keep my expectations low, and I tried with this one but because of the first one being integral to my childhood and t being 14 years it was hard. That being said, here are my spoiler free thoughts on Incredibles 2-The movie is absolutely hilarious! Defnitley the funniest Pixar movie in a long time. It's balanced out well with the more serious and emotional elements of the story. 
The themes of parenting and sticking together as a family are played very well, in this flipped around plot where Bob is staying home with the kids and Helen goes out to have the super adventure. I thought this was a great choice, because it provided great opportunities for character work as you see how they are tested and learn from the new experiences they have. I always appreciate when films take the time to do this, especially to give further dimension to characters everyone already knows and loves.Where the movie falters is the external plot, which unfortunately does not escape certain tropes of the superhero genre. This is especially noticeable in the 3rd act, when the villain plot, while very effective and complex when introduced, ultimately becomes a tad silly and seems very detached from what the film spent the first hour and a half focusing on. This most likely will not be a huge issue for most, the conclusion to the film is very action packed and entertaining, it was just a tad disappointing to me and I felt like it was lacking cohesion. But you can decide for yourself!All in all it's a very fun sequel with fantastic character work, humor, and exhilarating action sequences. Albeit a tad disappointing for me, it is a worthy sequel to the beloved first film. Go see it and have fun!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Predictable but enjoyable,"I saw the villain and the ending coming a mile away, so much so that it distracted me from the rest of the film. I kept begging them not to take the story down that road, that it's tired and unoriginal, and they did it.And worst of all, they completely blew it when the time came to giving the villain a captivating motivation. Like when Ozymandias of The Watchmen wanted to frame Manhattan for the destruction to avoid nuclear holocaust. He gave a final speech that made you question your morality. The Screenslaver is clearly meant to be the adult messaging in the movie, a critique on society's obsession with technology and the draining effect it has on our lives. But we never really have that reckoning, and the villain is silently vanquished.The denouement of Screenslaver was just lame. Very surface level villain stuff. Compare that to the outstanding never-meet-your-heroes betrayal plot of the first Incredibles, you see why this villain falls short.It was also unbelievable that Bob Parr is such a terrible dad. He's been parenting for like 14 years now? But thumbs his nose at changing a diaper? Dude has three kids.I'm so hard on this movie because the first Incredibles was one of the best Pixar movies ever and it should have lived up to its pedigree. Finding Dory was worthy, why not Incredibles 2?",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Pixar knows how to make a Sequel,"THE INCREDIBLES 2 REVIEW :'Pixar does it again'... Whenever i see Pixar films this sentence has always made it to appear in my review/mind. Long wait of 14 years, so much anticipation finally comes to end with a Worthy sequel to The Incredibles. The Incredibles does entertain you throughout and on a high note tells some family values lessons as well. Comedy, humour, thrills everything is just perfect and so does the film.Story is about Superheroes are not legal, they should not use their powers which causes the destruction so they gotta stay at home like common people. Then how they survive from a conspiracy in a heroic style which better be seen in theater. We know 4 superhero characters in previous films and the addition of new cute little superhero is surprisingly amazing. Background music for the same is very effective and accurate as far as that particular scene is concerned. Cinematography is Excellent, especially in action scenes those moving camera angles will blow your mind. Visual effects are eye pleasing. Director has done a mind blowing job by keeping this excellent written product entertaining and engaged from the first frame to the last.Overall, The Incredibles 2 a Must See for Pixar Lovers, at some moments it looks even better than it's prequel. On a funny note i say, Marvel should take lessons from Pixar on how to make a Terrific Superhero film barring regular money making stuff. I never thought The Incredibles will have a Sequel and after watching The Incredibles 2 i want more and more sequels in this franchise.

Best Pixar sequel - Worth the wait,"After attending the movie premier at an IMAX, we were awe-struck. The visuals, coloring, editing, music, animation and action sequences were all perfect. The family's chemistry is better than before with Jack-Jack also chipping in this time.Continuing where it left off last time was a nice move by the creative team that won't be affected by the aged voice actors. Edna's character is awesome though present for less time.While the critical reviews that mention the movie has weak villain, I can't agree with the argument completely as the movie's motive is more than showcasing a perfect villain; bringing the rich family drama together.Action scenes are top notch and make you glued to the screen; At times I forgot I was watching an animated movie. The lighting, sounds, camerawork around the scenes is perfect.The movie doesn't waste any time in focussing on unnecessary conversations or scenes and yet is the longest pixar movie of all time.

Didn't live up to my very high expectations.,"'INCREDIBLES 2': Four Stars (Out of Five)Pixar and Disney's long anticipated sequel to their 2004 animated superhero blockbuster 'THE INCREDIBLES'. The plot follows the Parr family once again, as they battle a new enemy, who wants to turn the public against all 'supers', while they also try to deal with normal family life as well. The film was once again written and directed by Brad Bird, and it features returning voice cast members including Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell and Samuel L. Jackson. Huck Milner, Catherine Keener, Bob Odenkirk, Sophia Bush and Bill Wise also join the cast this time. The movie has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics (like it's predecessor), and it's also expected to be a huge hit at the Box Office once again as well. I enjoyed it, but definitely not as much as the original.The Parr family is still acting as the superhero team known as 'The Incredibles' when the authorities become too concerned about the damage being done during their battles with supervillains, and the team is ordered to halt their actions. Then they're contacted by a superhero fan named Winston Deavor (Odenkirk), and invited to his house for a proposition, along with their friend Frozone (Jackson). There Winston and his sister Evelyn (Keener) offer Helen Parr (Hunter) a superhero job fighting crime, in order to win back the support of the public. Helen accepts the job offer, and Bob Parr stays home to watch the kids while she works. Helen has to battle a new supervillain in the process, and Hank finds parenting even harder than crime fighting, especially when he learns their baby Jack-Jack has even greater superhero powers than they all do.The movie is really well made once again, and always beautiful to watch. The action scenes are mostly exciting too, and the humor is clever and witty (all once again). It's also great how progressive these films are, especially this time having the wife superhero be the one fighting crime, while the husband stays home to watch the kids. Of course he also finds parenting to be even harder than crime fighting too. That's all great about this movie, but it still didn't live up to my very high expectations of matching the original (or even coming close to it). It doesn't capture the same magic, and after the original film was so refreshing and somewhat groundbreaking at the time of it's release, there wasn't much this sequel could do to live up to it of course. It's still really well made though, and entertaining enough.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Its alright, I guess...","There are a lot of things this film does right. It takes notes from the original and feels like a sequel, its action packed, and its family fun. However, to me the best part about the original film was in its subtlety and this film throws subtlety out of the window and just tells you everything, making it more childish in my opinion. For example in the original film Mr. Incredible works for an insurance company and while on the surface it just seems like a job, in the background he actually has this job because he wants to help and save people. So like if there was a robbery he wanted to be there to help that person in need like the old days. Things like that make that movie easy to revisit, and i have at least over 20 times. Bottom-line, while it takes some of the best things from the film, it leaves out the part that makes the first Incredibles film more than a normal pixar family movie, in fact more than a movie. And thats the subtext and the social commentary under the hood, rather than on top like this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A well-made follow-up to one of Pixar's best movies and a solid superhero film in its own right,"Incredibles 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the Disney Pixar classic The Incredibles. Written and directed by Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, Ratatouille), it is a well-made follow-up to one of Pixar's best movies and a solid superhero film in its own right.A short time after the events of the first film, the Parr family, Bob/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), Helen/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Huck Milner), and Jack-Jack, continue to protect their city from danger while also trying to live out their lives as normal citizens. One day, Helen is recruited by an organisation called DEVTECH, who are devoted to restoring the reputation of superheroes and regaining their popularity with the public. With his wife now away working for DEVTECH, Bob is tasked with looking after the kids and tending to their needs, which proves to be much easier said than done.The film is more action-packed than its predecessor and thanks to improved animation techniques, is far more exciting at times. All of the charm and familial love of the original film still remains in this sequel and once again there was a good balance of comedy and drama. Most of the original voice cast returns, including Craig T. Nelson as Mr. Incredible, Holly Hunter as Elastigirl, and of course Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone. In the previous film, it was the character of Edna who stole show in every scene, this time, it is the adorable baby Jack-Jack who gets the most laughs every time he is on screen. The only major issue is that the villain was highly predictable with generic motives and as a result was much less clever than Syndrome was in the original. Overall, this sequel was worth the 14 year wait and hopefully there will be a third installment in the not-too-distant future.I rate it 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Carbon Copy of the First, With Some Great Action Mixed In","It took 14 years for an Incredibles sequel, and for some, that was far too long. I spend a good chunk of my time online reading articles and watching videos related to movies and television. I can't think of a single movie that people clamored more for than another Incredibles adventure. I like the first movie, but it would fall very far down the list of Pixar movies for me. So when they finally announced a sequel a few years ago, my reaction was pretty much nothing. Really, I just needed reassurance that if you're going to make a sequel 14 years after the original, there better be a darn good reason to do it. Well, after seeing the end result, I can't really think of a good reason why Pixar pulled the trigger on this one (other than the obvious - money). Is there anything overtly refreshing about Incredibles 2? Nope. It's predictable, unorginal, and uninspired. What I will say is that there are some very impressive action sequences and it was nice to see Elastigirl take center stage. Watching Jack Jack do his superhero-y things is also a joy to watch. However, the first film had a sharp script with just as much laughs as it did heart, and an obscure villain that somehow worked. I can't necessarily say the same about Incredibles 2, which falls into the trap of a rehashed script and a horrendously botched villain. Is the film entertaining and worth a glance? Perhaps, but if you're looking for something that improves on its predecessor, you should look elsewhere.6.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Wait is Over!,"If you loved the first Incredibles then most of you were probably waiting patiently just like me. Now by no means is this sequel as good as the first but it is still well-done and very good for a sequel. I really enjoyed watching Bob take on the role of caring for the kids. The action sequences were very fast and entertaining beside the rapid flashing in the movie that might affect epileptic viewers. Anyway, this film is a lot of fun and it is also pretty humorous. There were a lot of times where a majority of the theater started chuckling and laughing so there was no absence of comedy. The villain arc was somewhat predictable but it still felt pretty satisfying and the story definitely had many interesting moments. The story flows well and should keep the whole family entertained.
Was this movie worth 14 years?
Yes, because if they did not take that much time it wouldn't have been as solid as this film is for a sequel. Just come into this film wanting to have fun watching it.

'Incredibles 2' Thoughts and Opinions.,"I see people criticizing The Incredibles 2 for it's apparent ""foul language"" and for how ""it's not suitable for smaller children."" In the first movie we literally see a man jump from a 10+ story, city building with the intent of taking his own life, for some reason that's better for your children than them hearing some characters using words like ""damn"" and ""hell"" in commonly used phrases; or the parents becoming so called ""zombies"" for a short time.
Are you kidding me? That is the most absurd criticism I ever heard and really goes to show how much people are sheltering their children nowadays.
I wouldn't even say this movie was ""darker"" than the first movie. If you go back and look at the fist films plot, it's about how superheros can't do what is morally right because of corporate heads who only care about money. This is dark in of itself.The start of this movie was almost the same as the first. Superheros who cant do their jobs get a random invitation to do superhero stuff again. This time, instead of Mr. Incredible doing all the superhero stuff Elastigirl gets the spotlight, while Mr. Incredible is at home babysitting the kids. The villain in this film is much weaker than Syndrome from the first movie. Syndrome had a pretty okay reason for wanting to do the bad stuff he did. Unlike the villain in this movie, who just came off very petty and pathetic.Even the new superheros who were introduced didn't not play a well enough role in the movie. We barely saw them, let alone saw their powers used in a well enough fashion for them to be considered cool superhero characters like they should be.I'd honestly say the best parts in this movie were when Mr. Incredible was trying to be the best dad he could be, by trying to fix his daughters relationship and taking care of Jack Jack.The animation, colours, and everything visually was far, far superior of course but, unfortunately that was the only thing better about this than the first. That being said, was this a bad movie? No. Was it entertaining? Yes. I'm simply comparing it to the crazy standards the first movie was able to set and I don't think this movie was original enough or innovative enough to exceed those standards.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Fun, creative, and engaging","The main thing (for me at least) that makes Incredibles 2 such a fun movie to watch is the dialogue between the characters, specifically Bob and Helen. I was a little concerned that the film was going to portray Bob as a stereotypical clumsy father who just can't help messing everything up due to incompetence, that simply isn't the case here. While Bob certainly makes mistakes, you can tell by his actions and his general attitude towards the kids that he is trying his best to make sure that they are happy and are getting the care that they need. When Bob struggled it isn't due to incompetence, but it's because he is dealing with something that any parent would have difficulty handling. Let's face it, any parent would be under a certain amount of pressure if they were dealing with a super powered baby. Helen's end of the story is also really fun to watch along with Bobs. While the villain is highly predictable and the motivations don't seem to make much sense (which is keeping me from giving this movie a perfect score), it was still really enjoyable to watch her deal with certain situations that were jeopardizing her and the Deavors goal of making supers legel again. Some people will call predictable sure, but predictable in my books does not equate to being bad, so long as your movie is enjoyable enough that it can be overlooked. That's something that I can certainly give this film credit for since it does a great job at utilizing each characters unique abilities to create FANTASTIC set pieces and action scenes. Combine that with the 10-10 dialogue, and you have one hell of a good time at the theater.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Pixar almost always seems to one-up themselves in that respect, but it still bears mentioning - Incredibles 2 is a real sensory spectacle.The primary story is a let-down, though, like something I'd expect to find in a filler issue between big events. After fourteen years away, I would've hoped for something with a bit more emotional punch, an adventure that feels more essential and complex. Instead, it loosely apes a few smaller subplots from the first film, swaps the headline roles, tosses in a few lazy, telegraphed twists and then wraps it all up on an empty happy note.Visually dazzling, with a good sense of humor, but generally quite hollow and, sadly, almost completely missing the warm, witty commentary on classic superhero stereotypes that made the original work on so many levels. This felt like a B-team's admirable, but failed, effort to step up to the big leagues.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining,A good follow up of the first movie. It has a busy storyline and full of action. A nice watch with the family.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Felt like Finding Dory,"As a kid I was a really big fan of the Incredibles, creating my own Incredibles 2, wondering how the story could progress and what went on with the Underminer. Since today I think the first entry is one of the best movies Pixar ever made. Equally excited was I, when the first trailer for the sequel dropped, but I promised myself to let the old fantasies about this movie go, to get a proper and less biased view on the film.
Incredibles 2 courageously starts, where the first movie ended, which slingshots you right back into the action, the characters and incredibly cool early 60s vibe. You feel directly connected to the first film and can look at everything like a continuation of events.
So, you can sense new traits, problems and topics about every character of the Parr family. Especially the turnaround of the parents' rolls is interesting to watch. While Helen is as Elastigirl part of a superhero image campaign and rescues the citizen of Metroville, Bob stays at home, failing to convert his incredibleness over to householding and family business. These funny and entertaining family sequences are connected with intense action scenes, which are better than ever. Still the movie can't manage to give the plot a similar weight and strong message as the first one did. The story never reaches any heights or surprises you with twists; almost everything is form the beginning on clear to everyone, who doesn't fall into the 8-year old target audience. At the end it sadly all falls with the antagonist, which has disappointing motives, without any relatable reasons as Snydrome in the original had.
And how do I connect Incredibles 2 with Finding Dory? To me both movies knew their predecessors' strengths and could continue them in their sequel. The known characters are still full of heart, the Art Direction and Soundtrack even exceed Incredibles, becoming to the best one, Pixar ever created. Unfortunately, both, Finding Dory and Incredibles 2, couldn't follow the established, extremely high cleverness of their predecessor.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Incredibly boring,The special effects and animation is very slick but it is expected from pixar. Apart from that there is nothing much to enjoy other than a few moments with Jack Jack. Storyline is very weak and everything is a stretch. Why the villian chooses to target superheroes and why only elastigirl is recruited is not established well at all. There are too many characters and scenes are forced. Voice of elastigirl is annoying and same with her husband. They should have used different actors to voice except Samuel Jackson. Skip this in theaters and wait for DVD release.,1.0,Anonymous,Animation
A guilty pleasure,"For the record, I like the first Incredibles; it's funny, has a interesting plot line, and has one of the best villains ever made, Syndrome. On the other hand, I am not a major fan of Pixar's films released prior to this one ( particularly Cars 2 and Finding Dory). So what do I think about this sequel? It is a flawed but interesting movie. Yes the movie takes plot points from the first film (to a noticeable degree), and the films villain character is entirely unmemorable. But the animation is impressive, the score is catchy, and it does build upon the first film is some good ways. Most certainly.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's not bad its fine not better than the 1st,It was a great sequel that's all I can say. But the first is alot better. I'm not saying it's bad.,9.0,Anonymous,Animation
As good as a sequel can be,"Firstly the action sequences. Right from the off we are treated to some fantastic scenes that were just as, if not more, exhilarating than the action sequences from most live action superhero films. There were sequences involving a vehicular drill, a train, a boat and a plane; all of which were extremely well directed and impressively animated. There were also a number of great fights; one involving a character called Void, who had an awesome superpower; and another involving baby Jack-Jack which was possibly my favourite scene in the movie.
One of the things that made that scene so good was how hilarious it was; which brings me on to the second reason why I loved this movie, the comedy. There were so many jokes, both physical and verbal, throughout this movie that were hilarious. Most of these came from the situation Bob found himself in while trying to control his three kids, one of which is developing a number of powers which are difficult to control. Watching Mr Incredible try to deal with domestic issues was as endearing as it was funny; and sometimes being a good parent can make you an altogether different kind of superhero. The main criticism I'd have relates to the villain, Screenslaver, who wreaks havoc with their mind controlling techniques. Although not entirely, I found the villain to be somewhat predictable. It wasn't a major issue, as it didn't affect how much I enjoyed the movie, but I think it would have been even better had the reveal was shocking. The ending is also kinda predicable. Overall, a solid entertaining sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Incredibles 2,"Incredibles 2, a perfectly fine Pixar adventure that feels like a sequel as much as anything. Swapping the roles and giving us more of the same, but for me, missing that spark that made the first one special.Visuals are great as always. And it's got some much more impressive scenes and somewhat darker themes too, especially the hacker part which was probably the highlight of the movie besides that Dad parts. But the whole story just didn't do it for me at all, predictable and a very tame and boring villain that just didn't have any type of impact in the story at all. It just felt very meh at the end.Writing and such, still some good jokes here and there though it falls off a bit later on. The movie starts much stronger than it leaves you sadly. The continuation of the family is why you're here and because the sequel leaves off at the end of the first movie there's not much development aside from jack jack which was great, aka the Dad scenes.Music, of course can't go wrong, and just as good as the first. Just wish it was combined with a better movie. I fear I won't remember this one as much as I do the first.Simple, fun, but lacking.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than the Original!,"I don't know about the others, but I personally found this sequel considerably better than the original. The story shrewdly incorporated some societal issues as well as eloquently showcased the rapport between the members of the family in a more elaborated fashion and therefore paving the way for some exciting character dynamics and development.Albeit, the lack of a compelling antagonist comes back to haunt them yet again. While the events that gradually unfold made for a ride full of intrigue and thrill, lesser emphasis on the overarching storyline influenced the outcome even to a certain extent.

The story was interesting but nothing cutting edge. The humor was mild, nothing knee slapping. The only real distinguishing characteristic was the addition of several new ""supers"". Adding the new ""supers"" added some flavor and diversity with the action.Incredibles 2 was a nice follow up considering that many sequels are completely worthless.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent!,"An excellent Pixar film, and a great sequel to the Incredibles. While it doesn't surpass the original, it is right beside it. Somehow after so many years this movie continues the same story-line and even small subplots from the original and manages to have the same tone and feeling. The animation improvement and higher budget is well utilized and noticeable. This film has heart thanks to Brad Bird's excellent writing and directing. The villain is standard but the best aspect of the film is when the family just behaves like a family. The voice actors are great as it does feel like a direct continuation of the original, Dash is the only character with a voice actor change, and you wouldn't even notice. The score is excellent by Michael Giacchino. This movie is great and I could not recommend it more.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Classic Pixar not without it's faults.,"As with other Pixar sequels this one is not as fresh and interesting as the original picture, yet it is still more entertaining that most of the recent ""assembly line"" Hollywood movies that if it wasn't because one has dinosaurs, another has lightsabers and another has transforming robots it would be almost impossible for viewers to differentiate from each other.Also it's nice to see that like any other Pixar movie the humour is good and is kept subtle unlike other superhero movies that aren't supposed to be comedies yet are infested with terrible jokes that just take the viewer out of the experience every 2 minutes.Something to keep in mind is that this picture was obviously made as a movie for the whole family, not particularly aimed at angsty adolescents or millennial men-children which is respectable in an era where every big (and small) commercial product should be tailored to be irresistible to consumers hooked on the anti-social media networks.On the down side the story is extremely predictable and while the start of the film is fun and well paced the climax seems a bit rushed or not well thought as the rest of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Enjoyable,"""Incredibles 2"" (2018) is a professionally animated action adventure comedy that carries the loveable fun from ""The Incredibles"" (2004). In this sequel, the family is charged with changing the concept of ""supers"" through recorded hero actions with Helen, Elastigirl,"" voiced by Holly Hunter, taking the lead. I loved the role reversal with Helen being the desired hero to take the lead, but I think the added screen time for Jack Jack, voiced by Eli Fucile, was the biggest family favorite. Everything Jack Jack did in this film produced hysterical laughter in my family. I am usually very skeptical of sequels, but this film is just as good as the first one with exception to some heavy foreshadowing.Brad Bird continues his reputation with character connections to the audience. Every character is identifiable in my own family and I just love that. The story is great, but anticipated, which makes the foreshadowing so difficult to avoid. To keep from spoiling the film, I would say the best way to have adjusted the undesired, would have been to make the bad guy a little less sketchy. This way it is a little less obvious that the bad guy is essentially broadcasted from the beginning. Overall, I really enjoyed this film and recommend a view if you enjoyed the first one, but once you have deciphered the ""evil one,"" keep it to yourself until the end and just enjoy the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fans will love it and you don't have to be a fan to enjoy it,"This movie was made just as much for the adult and teen fans as much as it was for kids. It was brilliant- but be warned that there are some intense images and scenes. Just like with the first movie, younger audiences might be bored or scared. I would suggest six and up. There was a wonderful segment at the very beginning of the movie where some of the voice actors and the director came out and essentially said- we know it's been a long time guys but we promise it will be worth it. And boy was it. Picking up where the first movie left off, superheros are still not in favor with society. The super heroes trying to change that leads them to learn more about family and winning together. A movie to watch with your kids!

Unoriginal!,"The original Incredibles is not only one of my favorite animated movies, but it's also one of my favorite superhero movies ever. So there's no doubt that this long-awaited sequel was one of my most anticipated movies of this year, especially before seeing the trailers! I didn't like the trailers, the first one in particular, because I predicted that this movie would lean heavily on a formula we got tired of. This formula includes two messages; the female empowerment, and ""taking care of your family is the true superheroic act"", and that's exactly what we got in this movie, especially the first message, it's a political issue, so .... why not?This formula didn't just make everything in the movie looks like I've seen million times before, but it also made this movie feels outdated. Actually, the problem isn't only related to the messages, but the plot itself is formulaic and outdated for a superhero movie. Almost everything happens, every event, every element, every part in this movie is archetypal.
The developments of the story are typical. 
The characters are slightly developed, but also in away that doesn't feel authentic or original by any means.
The villain, Screenslaver, is stereotypical and feels if he comes from an old cheesy superhero movie, or an animated movie from any animation studio except Pixar. This villain even acts like The Joker, so that's saying something. Even his motives are well-worn, and he revealed them in a single monologue. Yes, this very monologue that Syndrome mocked in the original movie. So don't expect a villain like Syndrome. So don't expect to see a villain like Syndrome. And of course, we have a plot twist in this movie but I saw it coming from far away, so it definitely didn't work. Also, what leads us to the ending is rushed and quite absurd. Nevertheless, there are some subtle plot details in the part when Elastigirl was fighting crime.They leaned so heavily on the humor in this sequel. The humor wasn't bad at first. In fact, almost every joke that is related to Jack-Jack worked, and I couldn't help but burst out in laughter almost every time he made a single noise. But the jokes became repetitive, so they lost all their sharpness. Also, the timing of the humor was very bad at the third act. What's worse, at least for me, is that they made Bob Parr a total moron so he can be the comic relief while making Elastigirl the real heroine of the movie.Now, Dash is my favorite Incredible! What a likable character he is! He is very cool, and all his actions are fit for his age. That gave this character a sense of reality. In fact, all the characters act if they were real. When they interact with each other, when they get tired, when they become happy, when they laugh, even when they breathe they feel if they were actual people, if they were humans, and that's really INCREDIBLE!All the cast is great, as usual. But Holly Hunter who shines in this sequel. She gave even more energy Helen Parr/Elastigirl.
I was worried because they replaced Spencer Fox, the original actor who voiced Dash, but I think Huck Milner is even better! 
Frozone had much more time in this sequel, and that made this character seems much more like Samuel L. Jackson, and of course this is a bonus! 
Jack Jack's new abilities are basically perfect, both in what his powers are and in how they are revealed.Michael Giacchino's score is gold, and well-used. The animation is top-notch and seamless. But it's the action in this movie that should have a fair share of praise. Incredibles 2 has some of the most thrilling and exhilarating action sequences ever in an animated movie, if not memorable enough. The movie full of flashing lights that aren't just annoying, but they really can be harmful to the eyes, especially if you watched the movie in 3D.I'm sorely disappointed, but I'll try as much as I can not to make my let-down affect my rating, especially because most of the issues I've with this movie are related to one thing, the triteness that I, as a Disney/Pixar fan, didn't get used to.(7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
As good as the original,"I gotta say, back in the day I wasn't a big fan of The Incredibles. Maybe I was just too young to care about anything that wasn't a funny one-liner or an epic action set piece, and now, it's really weird to think of a time I didn't like the first film, because seeing it as a grown-up makes me reflect about the things that happen in it. Just because Syndrome is the villain doesn't mean he is straight up evil, it's not all black or white, but rather shades of grey. I think that that's what it means to grow up, bacause as a kid you would think of your friends as goods and your enemies as bad, but as you grow up you start to think about the motivations behind those two, and that's what captivated me about the first film. I really love that movie, it's not Pixar's best effort but it really has a place in my heart next to Toy story, Toy story 3, Inside Out, Up and the sequel to The Incredibles, and the latter is the one I'm gonna talk about today.
Hitting theaters 14 years after the first film and getting huge praise by critics and audiences around the world and breaking tons of records at the box office, the sequel to The Incredibles is real fun, packed with laugh-out-loud moments as well as thrilling action scenes, Incredibles 2 has almost everything for everyone, but -as in most Pixar films- the heart of the film is at its core. Mainly because it's about a family, one that is not perfect but rather incredible, since all of this characters are fully fleshed out and you really care about them, and that is mainly thanks to the first film. There are some flaws in this film too, it's not perfect by any means, for example the villain in this movie is not in the same level as Syndrome, and though his motivation was a little less impactful as the villain in this film, the execution of the villain was better portrayed in the first installment. In this one right off the bat you can tell who he / she is, the motivation is there but the execution is kind of all over the place, a little bit nonsensical to tell the truth but it's something you can let pass and that's what I did, because the rest was so much fun and entertaining that just a little plothole here and there is nothing you can't overlook. But that's not my only problem with this film, the other one is the intelligence of this film, don't get me wrong, this film is terrifically written but the shades of grey that were presented to everything the heroes did were replaced with good and bad, and the truth is nobody is a 100% good or a 100% bad, people are mostly in the middle, just like grey, and even though the villain had the motivation to do this, it's mainly vengeance the thing he / she is looking to achieve.
But now with the good stuff, this film has some of the best action you'll see all tear long, maybe Mission Imposible Fallout tops it but whenever there's a fight scene you just look at the screen, marveled at what Brad Bird and the people at Pixar could achieve. The animation is stellar, too, some of the environments looked photorealistic, for example the ocean or the streets. I mean, someone would think that at some point Pixar will reach maximum level of detail in their works but every year they just get better and better. Another thing I'd lile to point out is that the relationship between the family members is just so real, the script is written in such a way that you stop and think for a minute if it's a real conversation or not. But the best things about the film are Jack Jack, Violet, Elastigirl and Edna Mode, I mean they steal every scene they are in. In the first film Violet just seemed like a bland character to me, but now she has way more things to do and more layers that make her into a fully fleshed out character. Another thing that is exceptional is the comedy, not only the jokes or the lines charcters have to say, but the slapstick that reminds us of Tom amd Jerry and other cartoons like that.
All in all, this film is so good that I might watch it again tomorrow. If you have kids and you wanna take them to the movies, scratch that, if you are an adult and wanna go to the movies, Incredibles 2 might be the best pick, between that and Mission: Impossible Fallout.

"In some ways a perfect sequel, in other ways disappointing - but a slick and solid adventure either way","The hesitancy to make a sequel to The Incredibles was understandable. While its on-the-nose cavalier suave wasn't for everyone, the first film was so well-paced and balanced between action and drama that planning out a worthy follow-up was almost impossible. The first film also did something incredible (pun intended) by balancing nostalgia for superheroes with a unique angle that made them very mortal beings and set it apart from other super movies.In some ways, Incredibles 2 did the best job possible of leading where the other left off. Rather than kidding anyone by trying to step over the Underminer ending of the first film, it picks up and shows us the epic action sequence that we expected to see. With animation that is updated yet extremely faithful to the original, the movie maintains the fast-paced mix of intense action, stylish moves, and funny family drama. At moments it even captures that dazzling feeling of seeing the inventions of the Incredibles universe for the first time. Instead of trying too hard to go in a new direction, it almost acts like a ""next installment"" by keeping many of the plot elements of the first movie but reversing many of the roles. This makes it a wholly enjoyable watch that isn't missing many things we were hoping for.At the same time, the by-the-numbers emulation of the first movie's greatness makes ever meeting or surpassing its greatness impossible. Incredibles 2 is, for all its efforts, essentially a repeat of the first story. Since it's not entering uncharted territory and stays in the comfy zone of predictability, the stakes feel much lower than they did in the first movie. What I found most disappointing, though, was that the maturity and subtlety levels went downward for this sequel, as most of the character development of the first movie was completely reset for the new movie. Bob and Helen Parr were almost acting like irritating caricatures of themselves rather than a couple who had gone through any major breakthough together, and the kids were back to bickering and whining for much of the movie before their maturity was allowed to return. While Jack Jack's antics were funny and inevitable, his prolonged presence on the screen felt like a band-aid for the unpredictability that was missing. I know it's not fair to hold Pixar up to a godly standard for each of its films, but some of the immaturity and the gimmicks of Incredibles 2 felt like the things that lesser-regarded studios would resort to rather than them.Incredibles 2 doesn't attempt nor come close to replacing its source movie, which is perhaps wise but also removes its capacity to be a great movie. We're still left with many of the great things that entertained and wowed us in the first movie - and the hopes that another installment isn't too far behind.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"An improvement over the first film, but it still lacks the originality.","This is the predictable sequel to ""Incredibles"", which practically guaranteed the right to one with the commercial and critical success it achieved. Personally, I face sequels with some precaution, but there is no doubt that, at times, they exceed the original. In this specific case, what we have at hand is a work that is perfectly up to the initial work.The biggest flaw in this film, for me, was the script, which is too similar to the initial film: the Parr family are, again, called by a millionaire determined to rehabilitate the superheroes but, this time, its Helen who is going on a quest for adventures, leaving her husband at home, looking after the house and children. Its a feminist film in its essence, which can be nothing more than a blink of an eye to politically correct and social movements that, in the past, accused Disney of being misogynist.The film is quite good, and you can even notice the correction of some problems seen in the first film. The voice cast continues to be excellent and doing a good job, and I would positively highlight the performance of Holly Hunter, Craig Nelson and Sarah Vowell. This time, I didn't feel the film dragging on as it did the first, perhaps thanks to a better balance between length and pace. The story told also seemed to me to have adult elements enough to please the older audience to the same extent that it will please the younger ones.Technically, it is a Disney film, and that says, practically, everything: a careful and appealing visual cinematography, excellent drawings and lines in a film that never goes in search of graphic realism. The use of excellent CGI and visual effects are essential to make the film visually pleasing and appealing. In addition to this, we have a good soundtrack, full of epic and heroic sense, which combines quite well with the theme of the film but is not heard.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun experience, totally worthwhile","Following the events of the first movie, the Incredibles try to stop a new villain, but in the meantime, they make a mess of work and get arrested for it. The story of the second film is quite an interesting one. Although it is predictable, the idea of using the father as the housekeeper and caretaker of the children has well paid off which leads to a lot of humorous moments between him and the kids. One of the main focuses of the writers is on Jack-Jack who is now showing his weird but funny powers.The cast is the same cast of the first movie with a few respectable additions like Bob Odenkirk as Winston Deavor. Therefore, with big names like Samuel L Jackson as the voice actors, you can have high expectations in that area.Animations are wonderful. Like every other Disney/Pixar movie out there, you cannot even find a minority of errors in the animations and graphics part of the movie especially based on their huge investments in the market of animations.Another enjoyable aspect of the movie is its Soundtrack. However, the main theme is still the same but the rhythm and the moments chosen to put a soundtrack on are perfect.Overall, Incredibles 2 is a really good animation. Although the story is straightforward and without great hints like inside out or Coco, but still it's fun to watch especially with your family.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Incredibles 2 (2018),"It took them 14 years to make it, but alas the sequel to the mega Pixar hit has arrived. I actually re-watched the original film the other day to refresh my memory. I have my favorite films from Pixar and while The Incredibles isn't one of them its still a very fun film with an interesting spin on the superhero genre. Brad Bird and most of the voice cast return and the sequel is already a massive box office hit for Disney. While the sequel isn't exactly necessary, its worthy enough and a fun time and is actually close in quality to the first.The film picks up exactly where the original left off. Superheros are still banned, but a new initiative attempts to get superheros widely accepted again. This means that Elastigirl is out fighting crime while Mr. Incredible has to take care of the family and attend to homely duties. However, troubles arise when a mysterious foe named Screenslaver attempts to control people to push a dangerous anti-superhero agenda. Its once again up to the family to save the day.Sequels that wait too long usually show age and don't work as well. Take Super Troopers 2 and Dumb and Dumber Too for example. There isn't really a discernible drop in quality with Incredibles 2. It hasn't missed a beat. Part of what makes this film fun is the MVP of it all, Baby Jack-Jack. His newly discovered range of powers are fun to watch and clearly provide the most laughs in the film. This was an excellent touch.Something that makes the Incredibles endearing is the focal family. They have individual quirks and personality which are fun to watch. We have superhero fatigue at times in Hollywood yet Brad Bird and Pixar makes it feel fresh. It took a while to make but there aren't too many complaints. The film brings fantastic visuals of action and a bunch of hero v. hero action. Its a worthy sequel from Pixar that does justice to its predecessor (something you can't really say about Cars). A fun time will be had for all.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A little better than the original.,"I was twelve when I saw the original, and I felt so old when I saw Incredibles 2 alone in the cinema. I saw it twice in one sitting because I've got nowhere to go and the film is so much fun and it brought back memories from a simpler time.You can't admire Pixar enough for what they bring, one example: some action sequences here surpassed most of the CGI-filled battles of live-action superhero movies. One scene in particular reminded me of a scene in X-Men: First Class, impressive.The original was smartly written for a family animated film, criticizing American society. This sequel continued and added smart thematics, wonderful voice cast, richly written characters, and entertaining action.Frozone is underrated and needs his own movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Incredibles 2 (D) - Mature, adult animation. 65%","This must be quite a belated sequel and I saw it because I remember really liking the first film, whenever it was released, even though I went into that not having any great expectations for it, seeing as I took it be a ""children's film"". Even though I remember very little of that first film, due to having only seen it during its original cinema release, I would say that I found it very entertaining and probably quite funny. If I had been scoring films here back then, I would guess that it might have gotten a score of around at least 80%, if not 90%.Perhaps due to the sequel seeming to be of a different nature to the original, my score might be quite harsh. I was planning on scoring it at a perhaps generous 60%, but have bumped up my score. If you're expecting a film pitched at a young audience, you might also be similarly harsh in your views on this film, but if you view it from the perspective of being like an animated Marvel or X-Men film, you might fare better. Humour isn't really this sequel's thing though, as I did find it quite ""serious"".Anyway, the plot concerns ""The Incredibles"" family, a family of superheroes, living in a world where superheroes are now criminalised. A technology tycoon gives the family an opportunity to try and overturn these laws through public relations. Some of the themes raised in this film include the notion of ""just"" and ""unjust"" laws, as well as what it is right to do in the case of the latter. The notion of pop culture as reducing the experience of humanity is also touched upon, briefly. Perhaps you could also interpret the film as dealing with post-11/09/2001 issues as well.As I say, the film doesn't seem pitched at a young audience and it probably isn't suited to children who aren't mature. There's scenes of destruction, not too far removed from visions of September 11, 2001, especially early on. Death is alluded to as well and in a sign of the film's ""mature"" orientation, Mr. and Mrs. Incredible have marital tensions to deal with, such as how gender roles define them, for better or for worse.I saw the film in 2D and I'm not sure how worthwhile it would be to see the film in 3D. It did occur to me watching the end credits that the film may have been released in 3D, and later end credits did confirm to me that that was indeed the case.Visually, the film does dabble in realism, as far as outdoor scenes go, with the human characters usually looking caricatured, although occasionally realistic.Even though I didn't find the film particularly funny, I'd say that it was funnier than ""Avengers: Infinity war"" (which isn't saying much...at all). Like I say, I see this film as more akin to an animated Avengers or X-Men film...but probably better than most of those. I'd be curious to see the first Incredibles film again, to see if it was quite funny and more entertaining (as opposed to ""serious"", like its sequel).Random observations:* Musically, there seems to be some nods and winks to the James Bond films and the film ""Shaft"".* Maybe the music and perhaps the end credits as well have a touch of 1960s and 1970s era films to them, including the visual style of the end credits.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

More of the same,"After fourteen years, Brad Bird returns to his spy/superhero mix. The film picks up immediately after the events of the original film, which is admittedly something you don't see every day, but at the same time I also feel that it constrains the film, forces it into a cubicle.The film looks and feels almost exactly like the original. Which is great. The colours are still phenomenal, the 60s spy thriller aesthetic is still superb and a refreshing change of pace, the characters feel familiar and the even though the special effects and animation quality have definitely gone up in fourteen years, the transition is pretty much seamless.What I don't appreciate as much is the fact that this is almost exactly the same movie as the original one. At least in terms of theme, plot, character arc and underlying message. Once again we have superheroes under scrutiny. Once again Mr. Incredible has to juggle family duties with his consuming need of being a hero. And so on and so on, ad nauseam.And certainly, a lot of sequels are very similar to their predecessors. But I think it's safe to say that we can expect more from Pixar. And more from Brad Bird. The man has reportedly said that he didn't want to make a sequel to The Incredibles unless he had something new to tell. Well... this isn't new. You can definitely watch it and appreciate it for its technical excellence, its great characters and its thrilling story. But you don't get anything from it. Nothing you haven't gotten from the original, that is. And I don't like that. This film universe has so much potential for great and meaningful stories that it's a great shame to see it wasted like this.Still, it's by no means a bad film. It is enjoyable to watch and as a standalone film I do like it a lot. As a sequel it leaves much to be desired.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A sequel that was well-worth the wait...,"I'll be quick and to-the-point. ""The Incredibles"" (2004) was simply the best and greatest animated film to come out in 2004. It was a love-labor to superhero lore, as well as a bold-faced SATIRE of superhero lore - done in animated form, by the one American animation studio to top them all off, Pixar. ""The Incredibles"" was a box office success and critical hit. So the question was, how could writer-director Brad Bird and his team of animators at Pixar follow it up?We got that answer with 2018's ""Incredibles 2."" While not as groundbreaking as its predecessor, it grips you from its opening moments and holds your attention for the entire duration of its 118-minute running time. This sequel is bigger, bolder, and more family-centered than the first one; but don't let that fool you, there are still plenty of thunderous action sequences and moments of laugh-out-loud comedy and genuinely heartfelt family times to keep you interested.Do yourself a favor, and watch one of the most ""Incredible"" sequels ever made.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I have nothing to complain about this perfect sequel,"Okay I admit, I am quite an easy-going consumer, but when it comes to ""Incredibles 2', it convincingly earns my 10 stars.The first thing that we have to talk about is the plot. The movie is nearly 2 hours long but it is so well written and skillfully paced that it barely feels like 30 minutes. I feel like though every scene is planned perfectly, nothing drags on for too long, nothing seems unnecessary, nothing is under-explained. Somehow ""Incredibles 2"" managed to be action packed but not shallow and quick paced but not rushed. Also regarding the plot twist, I like how it is predictable but it still leaves room for debate. I personally like movies where you feel like you know the answer, but then there'll be moments where you are not too sure, which in my opinion is more fun than movies that leaves you in the dark completely or those that are just too easy to guess. To sum up the point, if you like a movie that is exciting, lets you speculate a little and have some light humor thrown in here and there to make you smile, then the ""Incredibles 2""'s plot is just perfect for you.The thing that I must say I love most about this movie though is the portrayal of the characters. I did not re-watch ""The Incredibles"" before seeing this sequel in cinema, so I expected to have a hard time reconnecting with the characters, but somehow this movie has me fond of them within the first 15 minutes. The characters were all unique and in my opinion accurately presented. Violet did not follow the ""typical moody/angsty teenage girl"" cliche nor was she so mature that she couldn't possibly be a teenager. She was smart, cool, real and honestly very likable. Dash is crazy, no discussion. Bob is not perfect, a little too prideful sometimes but he tries his best for his family, like all good fathers. Helen honestly reminds me so much of my mom, and I like that because I think it is in a way more realistic. A lot of the time movies make us think that for a female to be ""strong"" she has to be emotionally detached and most ""strong female figures"" in popular movies don't seem to have any desire to start a family or contribute to one, and the ones that do are often the damsel in distress and never the star. I don't know about you, but most of the ladies that I know and love wants to become a mother and have their own family, and they are strong but also soft and caring at times. I like movies that show that ladies can be successful without having to lose certain traits that makes them compassionate human beings and ""Incredibles 2"" does a great job at this.All in all, I love this movie and I would recommend it to almost anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
14 Years Later: Incredibles Has Matured in Content with Impressive Results,"Things have changed greatly since the lighthearted 2004 Pixar hit The Incredibles. In this 2018 sequel, it feels more darker in content - like on the boundary line of PG to PG-13 - compared to its predecessor. See, unlike the original which played on the superhero genre of the early 2000s with sitcom-like humor, this feels like a blend of the current decade's juggernaut of ever-growing superhero movies with some maturity in these characters we've come to know those years ago.A few months have passed after Syndrome's defeat and the Parr Family have moved on with their lives as though nothing's happened. When a wealthy tycoon offers to bring Supers back into the spotlight, he asks Bob Parr's (aka Mr. Incredible) wife Helen (aka Elastigirl) to be the front in making it happen again, resulting in a new villain called the Screenslaver to wreak havoc.Compared to past Pixar films that spawned sequels (or a prequel) of their own, director Brad Bird did an impressive job by having these characters retain their sitcom-like quirks, but also including some character development that wasn't explored before. This is a sequel that was long overdue to be released years back and it was worth quite the wait (especially for the kids of 2004 who are now young adults in or out of college). The returning voice cast and the new cast members did splendidly well with their roles and the real scene-stealer has to go to both baby Jack-Jack and Edna. I wasn't bored in the least, it's a pretty good follow-up.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
14 Years in the Making,"A pretty good sequel that actually turned out pretty well. Perhaps it was a cash grab, but it was a good one at least.Voice acting was off-putting in some areas.

Nevertheless, feel free to enjoy this one with the kids (or yourself if you were a big fan of the first).3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Incredibles 2,"Brad Bird, John Lasseter, John Walker, Stephen Shaffer & Michael Giacchino came together again, after THIRTEEN AND A HALF YEARS to create the long-awaited, highly anticipated, Incredibles 2. I guess the long wait was necessary because this movie took home 1.24 billion dollars at the box office, almost double of what the first Incredibles made! Even though the story may have been pretty predictable, and a tad unoriginal, it was still a huge family friendly film, and picked up right where it left off.The screenplay by Brad Bird again was just as witty, and humorous, but I feel like this time around, he really targeted the adult viewers. I personally felt like Bird took a few shots at politics, and it kind of made the movie drag a little.The character developments in the Parr family was great fun, with halfway decent fill-in characters, but they didn't serve too much purpose.The cinematography and animations took quite the step up from the first. Beautiful light and darks, with some great shots of the eye catching action sequences, that really brought the movie to life.Overall, this sequel may not have been the breath of fresh air the first film was, but it was still pretty enjoyable nonetheless.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A more family driven plot line then a superhero and villain plot line.,"So this movie compared to the first deals with more with family issues then villain issues. The first movie you have a main villain you already know who it is, family teams up and bam, great super hero movie and ending. This movie is a bit different. You dont know who the villain is, so now it becomes a mystery super hero movie. The issue with it which EVERYONE talks about is not an issue at all. How can a movie have a predictable plot line if its meant for children. In every episode of any kids cartoon you always know the bad guy is because its predictable.Next, the movie focuses on the family more. The father is trying to help raise all 3 children why mommy is out for work. More family bonding time then the first for sure and thats what i like about the movie. It shows you what its like to be a super hero movie.One complaint i do have is that i do wish there was more comedy from Dash. The first one was a bit more entertaining with him because he was all hyped up and excited. Thats ok thouhg because i still did enjoy his lines.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's one of those movies I would love to watch again. Watch it! You'll love it. The animation looked so good. I've watched two sequels (Deadpool 2 and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom) prior to this film; both were disappointing and so to have a sequel that actually, to me, is better the first one, is really really refreshing.

The original was great (8/10 or 9/10), this was not. Even asking the kids all said they knew who the surprise 'villain' was early in the movie.
Many animated movies have a depth to the movie that both adults and kids enjoy. This did not. It was very simple humor. The main humor had to do with the super powers of the baby and how hard it is to be the Dad left alone with the baby. Just wasn't funny unless you really like simple humor.

Incredible Movie!!,"Ever since I saw the first Incredibles, I have been hoping and waiting for a sequel. The first Incredibles leaves a hint for a sequel, and it seemed like a good enough movie for a sequel. After almost 14-years they finally did a sequel. This sequel starts where the last one left off. Despite years having passed since the first movie came out, the cast hasn't aged. This movie also has good direction and writing, as I've seen sequels that seem off from their predecessors, however this movie seems to flow in the same direction as The Incredibles. It will feel like a good continuation of the story. It will be nice to see a Super Hero family we remember so well from 14-years ago, and a family that is like as iconic as The Simpsons, (also a family that doesn't age), on screen again in action. I'm sure you'll be very entertained by the action!!I ought to say that the baby Jack Jack has more of a role in this movie. What I think is probably the most memorable scene from the original movie, would probably be the bonus scene on the menu, ""Jack Jack Attack"" with Jack Jack and the babysitter, Kari. You'll remember that scene with Jack Jack in this movie.I felt like this movie had a better plot and better direction than the original Incredibles. You'll feel for the characters and The Incredibles do a great job in presenting a super hero family that also at times tries to be normal, and has certain normal things to work out which can seem like real life.If you liked the first Incredibles, definitely watch this one. I'm sure you'll be entertained by the action. You probably would agree with me that unlike a lot of other sequels this movie seems On Parr with the first one. Get it On Parr? The Incredibles last name is Parr.After seeing this movie, I'm hoping for an Incredibles 3!! Of all the Pixar characters, I feel like they are the most worthy characters for a sequel.

A very respectable Disney sequel,"A good sequel.'Incredibles 2' isn't too far away from the preceding film, which is always a big plus for a follow-up. This one is definitely the more funnier of the two, there are some very amusing moments; especially with Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile/Nick Bird).From a plot point of view, the antagonists are better though unfortunately they do go down the obvious direction with them. I felt a few pacing issues too, it's a slow burner. The animation is very solid, as are the voice cast.Speaking of the cast, all of the main lot return with the exception of Spencer Fox (Dash) - whose absence I didn't really notice in truth. Everyone's as good as they are in the original, while the additions of Winston (Bob Odenkirk) and Evelyn (Catherine Keener) are welcomed. There's also a small yet nice role for Odenkirk's 'Better Call Saul' co-star Jonathan Banks (Dicker).This does some things greater than 'The Incredibles', but other things less so.

"A good, but not great, sequel.","I love the original Incredibles, it's probably my favorite Pixar movie, or close to it.The Incredibles 2 hits many of the right notes, but suffers a little bit from sequelitis.The good: The characters are still lovable and are consistent with their previous movie. The action sequences are great, and there are more of them than in the first film. The animation and visuals are ""incredible,"" and somehow match the aesthetic of the first film while taking full advantage of the 14 years of computer graphics advancements. The comedy is also ""pretty good,"" although some of the best jokes are in the trailer. The graphic design of the film is also stunning- on par with the first film, if not even more polished.The bad: Feels like a ""monster of the week"" episode of a TV show more than a movie. The timelessness and gravitas of the first movie don't even come close here, and the philosophy feels a bit more forced and less digestible. The comedy, though generally enjoyable, also isn't quite as polished throughout. There's also a weird flavor to the writing here, like the movie knows it's being watched, and so it's treading a bit too carefully...nothing too detrimental, but I found it harder to relax with the film because of it. Things just didn't feel as natural.Another thing that might throw some people off, the balance of character use is very different here. It's almost inverted from the first film, so that's good in the sense that it's something new, but some people may be disappointed if their favorite character doesn't really ""do much.""Anyway, this is a good film, and a good sequel, but it definitely has flaws. I'm a little saddened that the film didn't match the first one in terms of timelessness and relatability, but to re-visit the Parr family one more time, it was worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not so much a sequel as a remix.,"For whatever reason, I haven't really revisited the first ""Incredibles"" film since the first time I saw it. I didn't dislike it, but I also haven't felt the need to watch it again since. Having seen ""Incredibles 2"", to be honest I largely feel the same way.In a plot that's overall pretty similar to the first one, this time Holly Hunter's Elastigirl goes back to work as a ""super"" leaving Craig T Nelson's Mr Incredible at home to look after their three kids. The return is inspired by brother and sister combination Winston and Evelyn Deavor (Bob Odenkirk and Catherine Keener) who are attempting to reverse the laws prohibiting superhero activity. Their plans are thrown into chaos though when a new villain ""Screenslaver"" makes their presence and their mind control abilities known.Predictability and repetition is what really does for ""Incredibles 2"" for me. The villain reveal at the end is pretty easy to see coming but it's the repeated plot points and scenes from the first film that lost me, the kids saving the day again, another visit to Edna Mode - it's pretty much the same film as the original. That's is not to say that it doesn't look great, it does - particularly in some amazing portal work when the character of Voyd.

It's really a good movie!,"No matter how the haters or trolls say, it is apparently a stunning and excellent film!! I know some of the audience may say the villain is weak and like a cliche. However, they should also figure out what the director tried to say. The villain Screenslaver is actually a metaphor about the contemporary, critical issue- Digital Media. When people use those devices, they act just like they are hypnotized! People don't even think about what the politicians or manipulators describe and take it as their own opinion.
Not all the villains have to be strong in strength or destructive. They may be a hypnotist just like Screenslaver. And, this animation is not about feminism. The director has made the stance in the interview which about changing the gender roles to let both sides see each other. Moms don't have to stay at home. Dads don't have to go outside to earn money. They can switch their characters and do the different things. But, what you choose has its consequences or results. Like elastic girl said at the last. (I won't be a spoiler just go to see the movie by yourself) You get what you choose. That's the thing that actually matter in the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Almost Worth The 14 Years Wait,"Another marvellous entry in Pixar's canon that's fresh, funny & fascinating in more ways than one, Incredibles 2 retains all the stuff that made the original an instant classic right away and though it falls a little short on expectations, it's still more balanced than your average superhero flick.

Should I care about the social justice nonsense?,"I'll start by saying I don't like movie reviews that can't speak to the substance of the art while perhaps disagreeing with the message. That being said, there is definite social justice garbage being pedaled in this movie (female empowerment over men who are all a bunch of idiots, gender role switches, ""illegal"" social classes, etc.), and those are a part of why I was bored with the movie. But the main reason I that I felt like this movie went nowhere. All of the subplots never played out (Helen upstaging her husband, the villain's absurd and elaborate motivation). The only funny moments involved the baby. The worst part was that the movie was just too long. Not as good as the original, but not a terrible movie. Pixar has done far better sequels.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Downgrade from near-perfection is still great,"Brad Bird has a knack for staging action that he gets to express even more so in animation, and if any argument is to be made for superhero films to move that medium, it's this. While a definite downgrade, especially in terms of plot, from THE INCREDIBLES, the supers didn't get to interact with their powers much until the final act in that first film (which was, of course, the point, and certainly no detriment) and that happens to be where this takes off, allowing many more showcases of dynamic action. Also helps that this looks fantastic, is frequently hilarious, and Giacchino's score never fails to excite. I know superhero fatigue is a thing right now, but I certainly wouldn't mind one of these every few years.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Don't fire the baby...,"Bob Parr, retired Superhero Mr. Incredible now Mr. Mom, voiced by Craig T. Nelson, discovers that his infant son Jack-Jack, goo goo-ed by Eli Fucile, shoots deadly green lasers from his eyes. He cautions his older daughter Violet, voiced by Sarah Vowell, and her younger brother Dash, voiced by Huck Milner, while playing with their brother, ""Don't fire the baby!"" Now, you won't hear that in movies. I'll even go out on a limb here.That's the signature humor and inventiveness of Writer and Director Brad Bird's ""Incredibles 2"". ""Incredibles 2"" is really incredible, too. ""2"" is the sequel 14 years in the making. The technological advance in state-of-the art animation since astounds. In the visual high speed chase Helen's Elastic Girl, voiced with down home charm and common sense by Holly Hunter, swerves her motorcycle as she rescues the out-of-control monorail train. In the stunning night skyline Elastic Girl hops between helicopters with her rubber-like arms to save the Ambassador.Still with Bird flexing his formidable CGI might, he touches when Bob confesses to daughter Violet, ""I just want to be a good Dad."" Nelson is humorous and vulnerable as the Dad. Bob was responsible for her possible boyfriend Tony's imposed memory loss to guard the family's identity. Violet is devastated when Tony forgets their movie date. Yeah, Dad and Mom using their super strength and elastic powers stopped the villainous Underminer, comical John Ratzenberger, and his hulking drilling machine. Bob messed up big time where it also counted, with family. Family and heart ultimately save the day in ""Incredibles 2"".""Incredibles 2"" is hysterical in its cool self-awareness and irreverence. ""2"" has the hip retro 60's vibe in its art deco design and music score by Michael Giacchino. You get the feel of a James Bond or ""In Like Flint"" movie. Well, just shows my age.""Supers"" or Superheroes are still outlawed in the world of ""Incredibles 2"". The movie literally opens where we left off 14 years ago as the Incredibles battle the Underminer determined to destroy the City. Emerging victorious the Family is forced back into seclusion.Brother and sister Winston and Evelyn of high-technology Dev Tech, voiced by slick Bob Odenkirk and sublime Catherine Keener, offer the Parr's their proposal. Winston and Evelyn seek to overturn the ban on Supers. Their late Father was the Supers greatest advocate. Both parents were tragically murdered when Supers were unable to save them from a home robbery.Marketing expert Winston wants to leverage Elastic Girl in the TV PR campaign to overturn the law. It's kind of like Reality TV for the good cause. Well, kind of. Swallowing his ego, because they opted out Mr. Incredible, Bob agrees that Helen should be the Star. Near half-way through the movie you get the telegraph that all is not what it seems. Perhaps, that's the only downside of Writer Bird's incredible narrative.Director Bird does provide the brilliant upside in the return of diminutive Supers costume designer extraordinaire Edna Mode or E. E graciously babysits and costumes Jack-Jack leashing and tracking some of his emergent powers. Bird is genuinely hysterical voicing E. And ""Incredibles 2"" is absolutely hysterical with endearing sweetness.At times action movie overload occurs, particularly near the end. The amazing CGI tends to overwhelm a bit. Yet, when Helen tells her children how proud she is of them that resonates home. Because when it comes down to it: Love makes you Super. I just hope Bird, Disney and Pixar don't wait another 14 years to tell another ""Incredibles"" story about love and family.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Another Pixar smash hit!,"I don't know if it is due to all of the years and time put into making an animated film, but Pixar is continually the most consistent film company. Coming off of their last hit in Coco, they headed back into the sequel conundrum, but a sequel that involves really their only action films of their company. Incredibles allows them to try out unique storytelling and a new take on a pixar movie, you know without killing a parent.
Incredibles 2 thrives off of new age mothers and the humor provided by a one year old. In the new day and age of woman empowerment and stay at home dads, this is the movie of the time. They highlighted the highs, the lows, and the quirks in between of parenting. That even for a child who doesn't have children, I could still relate to.
Now further into the plot, and it was really good, but I don't think that it really broke into the great of other pixar movies. They followed the usual plotline of the evil villain being the person you were working with all along. A little redundant, but they hid the similar plot beneath new super heros, personable characters, and lots of humor.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

there are no eye-popping new characters or spectacles to deaden the over-familiarity,"A 3D viewing of Pixar's 12th feature film, INCREDIBLES 2, an overdue sequel, 14 years after its 2004 blockbuster, a time even Bryan Singer's much maligned reboot SUPERMAN RETURNS (2006) had yet to reach the silver screen, a very different picture from today's glut of superhero consumption.INCREDIBLES 2's biggest challenge, save for treating its gaping generational shift with kid gloves (viz, drawing on the nostalgia of Generation Y and recruiting new kids who might have no inkling of its predecessor), comes to that daunting question, as an art-form, what animation could excel if its live-action counterpart can also achieve a similar if more captivating visual effects? especially when the storyboard is strictly human-based, on a general afterthought, nothing in this film seems to strictly require this treatment (the most demanding parts might be Elastigirl and baby Jack-Jack's psionic powers), and the answer to that question does not look rosy.With Brad Bird returning to preside over the project after his live-action sorties in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL (2011) and TOMORROWLAND (2015), INCREDIBLES 2 grandly carries Pixar's torch in concocting a sagacious and innovative story-line out of the genre's default family-friendly tenet, here, we have an appreciable role-swapping borne out of USA's current climate's gender study, Elastigirl becomes the breadwinner while Mr. Incredible takes a back seat in attending to their kids, indeed it is the latter part that registers most fun and laughter, a stay-at-home dad's quagmire is brimful of hilarity and commiseration, tonally chimes in with its preceding short Domee Shi's BAO, depicting a typical empty nest phenomenon from a mother's angle, vamped up with an oriental touch.What becomes problematic is the well-worn trope of saving the world from some evil intrigue, a very American cliché Bird has no intention of steering away, although through the message from and the designation of its ostensible antagonist Screenslaver, the film manages to alert viewers of today's pandemic inertia and non-action that partly can be chalked up to a pernicious passivity hugely influenced by notion of waiting for a superhero, and an attention span deformed by our screen-gazing mentation, but that sounds too adult-minded, hence, its lucid cogitation about superpowers expectedly and frustratingly gives way to a conventional, business-as-usual denouement, which overall, renders the picture a few notches below Pixar's more esteemed titles.Back to my initial question, the impact of its sleek strings of action set pieces ineluctably pales in comparison with the ones from its more visceral live-action cousins, as there are no eye-popping new characters or spectacles to deaden the over-familiarity, and admittedly, speaking from a personal perspective, the allure of animation and one's own age have been in inverse proportion ever since one reaches adolescence, if only that could be the sole legit excuse for one's mild disappointment of this case.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Sure, I like the first movie too, but it relied heavily on Mr. Incredible for a great chunk of the movie; it isn't until about halfway through that Mrs. Incredible, Violet and Dash actually get in on the action. Not to mention, Jack-Jack doesn't do a whole lot to add to the film (not until the very end or in the short).The Incredibles 2 uses all 5 members of the Parr family to create a movie that is funny, heart warming and super, from start to finish.

The animation is great and very detailed, as well as the movie being just entertaining and when it's with Elastigirl I really like the story (though brought back by a bad villain) and when it was with the family it was interesting to see (though similar to the first).

"Amazing, too","Made 14 years after and set 13 seconds later, this sees Supers still illegal. The rich Winston Deavor(Bob Odenkirk, great as the lifelong fanboy) and his sister Evelyn(Catherine Keener, spot on as always) offer the aid of their private company to reform the image and change the laws. Meanwhile, the sinister screenslaver has other plans.Some people are frustrated with how woke this is. And in their defense some of them do acknowledge that the first one did take steps in that direction already. I don't agree that it's a bad thing, but I will grant that it does make some choices that feel like they're worried people will think they don't go far enough. In general there are issues with this, due to the expectations of fans who have wanted something like this since childhood and now have kids of their own to take to it. Some things are recreated even though it doesn't make sense because of completed(here undone) character arcs, and while I wouldn't personally say that I felt there was too much ""funny baby"" stuff, it's true that it has nothing to do with the plot.There are at least a few too many themes going on, and I hate to say that because I agree with them. They should have killed their darlings. Some of them just get brought up briefly and aren't explored at all. They didn't expect to get to make another sequel so they had to put everything into this one. The action and visual storytelling are indeed incredible. It's significantly grander and from right away, which some say leads to it not being as impactful. I think they felt that they had to match the other superhero movies of 2018 - you know, like the long-awaited Infinity War. However, I do agree that it's overall more impactful in the original one. The use of powers is always logical and tactical. Great choreography.I recommend this to any fan of comic book inspired films. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Well worth the wait,"14 years was a long time to wait for a highly anticipated sequel, but it was so worth it. After reading the numerous negative reviews, I can't find a reason why this was so bad. It was funny and greatly animated. To say this film went too far with the feminism and made Mr. Incredible look weak is a terrible way to look at it. I loved that idea and the whole family dynamic. It really showed how much Mrs. Incredible really did for the family and let her husband get a little taste of the stay-at-home mom concept. Aside from that little tidbit, this movie did not disappoint on the animation and comedy (especially the much anticipated Jack-Jack). It really allowed for a better look into each character's personalities. The only disappointment for me was the lack of Edna's appearance - I had hoped that she would have been in it more since her character is so great!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Released no less than 14 years after the first film, The Incredibles 2 is one of those sequels that respect the original without feeling the obligation to repeat it","The film begins by inserting us again in that universe, where heroes are prohibited, and begins the story at the very moment when the first film ended. From now on, we can witness the appreciation of the visual of the work, which manages to capture what was already very good and make it even better. Without forgetting the somewhat caricature physical characteristics of each character, the focus was applied to improving, mainly, the textures of the objects. From the clothes, to the background, everything is very alive, making us immerse ourselves even more in history. Also noteworthy for Violet's force fields, both in terms of looks, as well as in the new skills that the young heroine developed (apparently out of nowhere).Although a passage of time was possible, similar to what happened behind the scenes, redefining all the relationships between the members of the family nucleus and, therefore, turning the dynamics existing in the sixteenth century scenario of the film, Brad Bird chooses to play in insurance, but does not make use of this facility by negligence, using it as a possibility to renew and embody the themes related to the item that really matters: the family. And this is where the work surprises us with the choice of the Elastic Woman to take on the task of returning to work, giving her the protagonist that in The Incredibles belonged to her husband - who, in turn, takes on the task of taking care of the house and children. In this sense, Bird's idea of using an endangered train as the heroine's debut mission is perfect, since a similar rescue had been part of Mr. Incredible presentation in the previous feature. At the same time, the script recognizes how women who preserve their careers after maternity end up being charged for it, having to go out of their way to avoid judgments - which results in a brief and perfect joke that brings the Elastic Woman to the phone having to help the son to find a pair of shoes while trying to save the lives of dozens of people. Yes, the film takes place in a fictional analogue from the 1960s and Brad Bird explores this, putting a pinch of the discussion of the roles of men and women in the society of the time, but nothing of the level of today.Role reversal proves to be very effective in bringing a new look to history. While Bob goes out of his way to take care of everything and prove that she is capable, Helen experiences, for the first time, what it is like to be in the center of the spotlight and escape from the family routine. This parallel is the highlight of the film, as it works very well the relationship between these duties - Edna herself questions what can be more heroic than being a father -, giving enough time for both to shine. While the Elastic Woman is stretching around the city in various action and chase scenes, saving the day, the most fun core brings Mr. Incredible needing to use all his flexibility when dealing with Violet, disillusioned after the memory of his crush been erased; with Dash, more agitated than ever; and Jack-Jack, who is increasingly developing his powers. In fact, all the scenes involving the baby Parr are very funny. As seen in The Incredibles, the super-baby has several powers (he is basically Franklin Richards, from the Fantastic Four; in fact, the parody with Marvel's first family is blatant, the Paar are as dysfunctional as), it controls none and causes numerous confusions, whether by fighting with a raccoon, giving Edna Mode a hard time, or trying to help the family save the day. The little one steals the film for himself every time he appears.And the most admirable thing is that, in addition to all these virtues and its competence as entertainment, The Incredibles 2 still finds space to include important discussions in its narrative, criticizing the way the media shapes public opinion to demonize or deify someone and refuting , almost nominally, any approach to Ayn Rand's sociopathic texts (something that, by the way, has become a point of honor for Brad Bird since some critics suggested that the writer / philosopher had influenced the original). Of course, at certain times the filmmaker only shoots certain topics in the film without worrying about expanding them, as in Violet's fleeting comment about how the rich are never really punished or even when bringing the villain Hypnotist talking about how we are prisoners of screens that surround us. In contrast, Bird is courageous in pointing out how civil disobedience is almost an obligation in the face of absurd laws and attitudes on the part of the powerful, and it is equally relevant to realize how the protagonist of female characters is instrumental in serving as proof and example of capacity and need for women to occupy more and more leadership spaces, since not only does the Elastic Woman manifest having been influenced by the Ambassador (Rossellini) but she also influences the young Voyd.Another noteworthy point in The Incredibles 2 is, of course, its production design, which uses the 1960s as a starting point for the overall look of the narrative and brushes it with futuristic elements - since the train opened by the mayor to the Woman-Elastic motorcycle. As if that were not enough, the animators add fascinating mannerisms to the design of the characters and that help to convey their feelings more efficiently: notice, for example, how Violet compresses her lips in defiance when throwing something at the shredder or the accomplice look that changes with the mother in the face of the immaturity of the men in the family. Similarly, notice how Dash's hair takes on a darker color when wet or how Mr. Incredible seems to burn when removing the waffle from the toaster and you'll see why Pixar remains the undisputed leader in its industry. The soundtrack, in charge of master Michael Giacchino again, is perfect, grand in the moments of action and subtle in the milder scenes. It is difficult to deny the energy given to the work by the composer's score, which once again creates themes with a clear influence of jazz to suggest the individuality of those characters and the charm of their world.Likewise, Bird and Pixar's team of animators devise dynamic action sequences that explore the limitless possibilities of digital when it comes to camera positions and movements, surprising the viewer both in grandiose passages (like the one that occupies most of the third act) and in others of a smaller scale (such as the fantastic confrontation between a character and a raccoon). In addition, the design of the occupants of that universe is a gift in its own right, illustrating Pixar's care for every detail - from Mr. Incredible dark circles and stubble to Winston's frowns and facial tics, which clearly refer to those of Bob Odenkirk, responsible for his voice (incidentally, one of the most entertaining details of the film resides in the character Voyd, who, despite having the voice of Sophia Bush, is wide-open a digital version of Kristen Stewart, reproducing his way of biting his lips, tilt your head, move your hair and move your eyes as you speak).Although it is not carried out so deeply in either film, the reflection is explicit that a relationship cannot be sustained if each one does only what he thinks is right or only what pleases him. So much so that - as expected - only the union of the whole family (and friends) is able to solve the problem they face. Perhaps there is the biggest problem of the sequence, because it bets on a predictable plot, both in the climax and in the outcome, but which is held in the charisma of the characters and in the efficient action scenes.However funny they may be, however, the scenes involving the Incredible Baby still sound like a narrative crutch to support the main uninspired premise, which displays several hasty resolutions, as well as the underutilization of beloved characters - the case of stylist Edna Mode, limited to a kind of special participation (fun, but short) - in addition to a very predictable turnaround, which moves the final act. And if in the technical sphere the years that separate The Incredibles 2 from its predecessor were beneficial, in terms of the market they may not have had the same effect, since the saturation of the superhero genre (including several examples based on the comic appeal) ends up taking away part of the freshness offered by the original. Taking into account the expectation created due to the waiting time, and Pixar's own history, this feeling of repetition of a formula, but lacking the ingredient of innovation, the studio's brand, is almost inevitable - as had already happened with Finding Dory (2016). Still, the combination of a visually elaborate animation, good jokes and, above all, the empathy previously established by the characters, guarantees pleasant escapist entertainment for audiences of all ages.Brad Bird knew how to measure perfectly how much to bring from the first film to reactivate the memories of fans of the work. Some speeches and gestures may even go unnoticed by the least attentive, but certainly the situations involving Edna and Lucius with his wife, will bring the nostalgic and fun feeling that was expected. Released no less than 14 years after the first film, The Incredibles 2 is one of those sequels that respect the original without feeling the obligation to basically repeat it - and, thus, I will be happy if the series comes to win new chapters, even if these take another many years. After all, one of the many advantages of animations is that your characters never need to grow old.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Entertaining, if inferior Pixar sequel","14 years after the release of The Incredibles, Pixar released its long-awaited sequel, picking up the story right where it left off with the superhero family tackling supervillain The Underminer in the middle of the city before the start of a brand new adventure.Pixar's track record in terms of sequels may have been a little hit-and-miss, though the misses were underwhelming at worst, but The Incredibles always did feel like the perfect franchise to expand upon. Indeed, having characters with numerous super-powers opens up endless possibilities in terms of villains and storylines. Speaking of which, the plot this time around involves Helen/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) being hired by an entrepreneur who wants to change people's perceptions of superheroes for the better.Elastigirl becomes the new face of this pro-superhero movement as she goes around saving lives with a video camera capturing her every move. Along the way, she encounters a mysterious foe who calls himself The Screenslaver and she starts to investigate him. Meanwhile, Bob/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) begrudgingly stays home to look after the kids, which proves to be more difficult than anticipated, especially when he discovers baby Jack-Jack's new, unpredictable powers.Like all good sequels, The Incredibles 2 keeps what worked so well in the original film and builds on that. The normal family/cool superhero team dynamic is just as charming and fun as it was back in 2004 and the characters are all just as likable. We get to see more of what Elastigirl can do solo, we see the family work as a team to defeat a significant threat plus deal with new issues back home, Edna Mode (Brad Bird) once again pops up for a scene-stealing cameo and the action sequences are, once again, exciting and ambitious.The whole thing is also reliably very funny: one scene sees Jack-Jack battle a raccoon in the garden using all his crazy powers and it is a treat worthy of classic Tex Avery cartoons. Samuel L. Jackson is given a lot more screen-time as Frozone, a new team of heroes is introduced and Bob Odenkirk is very good as Saul Goodman-esque entrepreneur Winston Deavor. Unfortunately, the film stumbles a little when it comes to its villain and their evil plan, which doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense when you know that superheroes were not celebrated to begin with. That said, there are some cool (if strobe light heavy) scenes involving said villain.Though it could have done with a stronger, less predictable twist, The Incredibles 2 ticks all the right boxes otherwise. This is an extremely entertaining Pixar film with stunning animation, colorful visuals, a lot of heart and some epic action scenes worthy of the original film.Worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Decent sequel,"The Incredibles was a fun superhero comedy with a clever twist. The Incredibles 2 is a fun superhero comedy with a ... familiar twist. I guessed what was going on early on but thought, no, they can't possibly be just repeating the first movie. But yeah, they are.While the movie is utterly predictable and not always entirely sensible (heroes near the end don't do a super-obvious thing because it would have ended the movie 20 minutes earlier), it still has some terrific moments, most of these involve the youngest Incredible. There's also some nice exploration of traditional gender roles.I loved the original the first time I saw it but only liked it when I recently re-watched it. This felt a lot like watching the same movie a third time, which may be why I was less entranced yet again.Not *great* Pixar, but still fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The greatest Superhero Family of all time return,"I remember being completely obsessed with 'The Incredibles' way back in 2004, watching it any chance I could get. It was unlike anything at the time, The protagonists were a family of superheroes, which was awesome. It was entertaining and a lot of fun.
The sequel has virtually the same plot, which is a bit of a letdown but the movie is just as entertaining, just as fun. Jack-Jack is the stand-out, he is an absolute delight and it is exciting to uncover all of his superpowers. There are plenty of superheroes with cool powers. The animation is spectacular. The theme-music made me feel like a child again. The makers take the nostalgia and add something to it. My only issue with it is the villain, Who is underwhelming. Which is a pity, considering Pixar has some of the best villains.

"Superfamily Sequel: 'Incredibles 2' Soars with Action, Laughter, and Heart","I mentioned that Pixar was apparently worried about the movie's ""Bergmanesque"" opening act, which showed a family of retired superheroes dealing with the issues of ordinary domesticity. The Incredibles fails to fulfill the mandate of a true family film, which is undoubtedly to induce in everyone a sense of wonderful childish astonishment. This is the incorrect conclusion I came to.The misunderstood ""Supers"" are now back in a follow-up, where Jack-Jack takes center stage, emulating the Minions who progressively took over in the Despicable Me films.Incredibles 2 has plenty of snappy charm thanks to its amazing future-retro designs (the architecture and furniture had me salivating). Michael Giacchino's Bond-inspired score completes the picture. As before, there are a lot of jokes targeted especially at older audiences. For example, the news channel burbles that ""people have more faith in a monkey blowing darts than in Congress when it comes to decision-making.""",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A classic superhero movie but a little different,"Most of the times you get typical superhero plots in these kind of films and some times they choose to go in an alternative way with their plots, finding obstacled to deliver something refereshing.

It was nice that the fate of everyone was in the hands of the kids for the change and they pulled their weight and saved the day.When you hear Odenkirk speak you are sure a con is coming your way because you can't think otherwise, since let's face it you can't blindly trust Saul but this time he is a legit good guy. The wife has a defining role in this part and the villain is what you expect him/her to be.

Way better than I was expecting,"I liked the original Incredibles, but didnt love it the way many did (and do). (Gasp, shocking I know). That being said, Incredibles 2 is an amazing and fun movie unless you're just trying to hate on sequels in general. Story is great; a bit darker than the original, while maintaining a classy balance between humor and seriousness. Yes there are some political and social undertones in the story, but it incorporates them neatly, without going full-on SJW like The Last Jedi. I felt like they actually had their place in the story, and that they strengthened rather than detracted from the movie. All the main characters were superb and the animation and voice-acting is flawless as you might expect, with cheeky Frozone, unpredictable Jack-Jack, and charismatic Elastigirl nearly stealing the show by themselves. Genuine character development and motivations all around. The action set-pieces are thrilling and are easily some of the best that I have ever seen in an animated film, or really just film, period. No really. I thought I was in a Mission Impossible film for a second. Not that that's a bad thing.Where it goes wrong: All the other 'supers' except for the main ones and one particularly self-conscious super, feel kind of random and unnecessary. And while the villain is perfect, the third act, while certainly passable, felt like a bit of a letdown. I felt like there could have been more, well, oomph, to it. They could easily have made it 10-25 minutes longer and nobody would have complained.Overall, 9/10, well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Solid, but not like the first","The first movie was amazing, the second (aka this one) was still pretty good, but not as good as the first.
Part of it had to do with the first being more of a groundbreaking movie. A more serious superhero animation movie without being out of the PG realm. Great art, great story, and for a Pixar movie I felt it introduces a new concept of realism to the superhero fitting into society.While this movie has the same elements, I felt there was 2 aspects different.
1. It didn't have the same hit as the first because it wasn't new, and therefore had big shoes to fill because the first was great, so our expectations were shifted higher.
2. while the first had the aspect of everything working out in the end, this movie had the same but with the added bonus of everything about superheros being legal again. While it made sense to have a movie resolving this issue in the narrative, I felt that it being illegal was part of what made the first movie great.There wasn't as much plot-wise in this movie, although that was a lot to do with discovering Jack Jack's powers and while it was adorable I think it took up much of the time that could have been spent delving into the unveiling and backstory development of the villain.Overall the movie was good, could have been better, but to be honest I still felt it was enjoyable to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Entertaining and Hilarious,"I loved this movie. It was super fun, light hearted and poignant. In particular the scene we discover about a special character's powers is so hilarious. I was watching it thinking, who wrote this epic scene?The movie touches on gender issues in a realistic way. I thought the passive aggression displayed in Mr Incredible was hilariously accurate and realistic of how challenging being a paternal home maker can be for a man's ego and can also take a physically toll.Making the villain to be a disorganized an unsuspecting person was also apt as it educates us that villains can be suspected from first blush though they often erase our gut instincts by making one comfortable.The special character Lucius was also a favorite - yes to representation that showcases black males in a good light on screen.Overall when watching the pic, I thought the film should have won an oscar for comedy! It was so hilarious and relatable. Glad to see it got nominated but perhaps we need more oscar recognition for comedies the family and adults can enjoy not just serious indie films . I watched the incredibles as a teen and seeing part 2 as an adult I can say it entertained me impressionably both times and each appropriate each time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not as good as the original, but fun","When this movie was announced after 14 years, everybody was crazy and excited about it, but even though I liked the first movie a lot, I wasn't looking forward to seeing a sequel. And I was right. It seems like everytime Pixar does a sequel, they don't want to really do it, they don't put a lot of effort as with the originals, and that's what happens here.
The story is practically the same as the first one, but with a change in the roles. The villain is so preddictable, and his, or her, motives didn't convinced me. Sometging that didn't liked me neither was the beginning. It's some kind of flash forward, and then it goes to a flashback 5 minutes earlier...and then it comes back to where it started.

I had a really hard time giving this a 9/10 on here, but my score barely rounds to it so I gave it the benefit of the doubt (just because I love the incredibles). No wonder this is Pixar's highest grossing film, this film had the most sequel buildup I think I've seen outside of Marvel and Star Wars. The trailer literally got like 150 million views, the second most on YouTube, second only to Avengers: Infinity War. We waited 14 years to see what happened to the underminer at the end of The Incredibles. My one and only major problem with this movie was that it was actually somewhat forgettable. Like I can't remember a lot of the scenes that happened. The first one felt perfectly executed and very memorable, literally every scene has something iconic about it. This one, however, has a lot of meaningless scenes that I have since forgotten.

"""Incredibles 2"" Review","""Incredibles 2"" is the long-awaited sequel to the acclaimed animated superhero film from Pixar, ""The Incredibles."" The film takes place immediately where the last one ended, as super villain, the Underminer, plows through the city. The Incredibles/Parr family (husband Mr. Incredible/Bob, wife Elastigirl/Helen, and kids Dash, Violet, and Jack-Jack) jump straight into action, but soon after saving the day, they still risk getting arrested, due to the government-mandated law of superheroes being illegal. However, Helen is soon hired by telecommunications siblings Winston and Evelyn Deavor as their new sponsor for restoring the public image and making superheroes legal again, but eventually, she ends up facing a new super villain, Screenslaver, infamous for his mind control. Meanwhile, the family baby, Jack-Jack, is shown to have superpowers, and far more than they even imagined, all of which Bob is trying to balance, along with taking care of the family at home, while Helen goes off on her missions. Frozone returns, and this time, he's got his super suit, and new superheroes are featured, consisting of Voyd, lava-barfing Reflux, the Hulk-like Brick, telekinetic Krushauer, the owl-like Screech, and the electric He-Lectrix.The appeal of the Incredibles movies and the Parr family has never really been just about them being superheroes, but rather maintaining their family dynamic while also fighting crime. In the wake of numerous superhero movies released since the first film, Brad Bird and his returning team spend their energy focusing on themes of technology being a prominent force in our lives and also, most importantly, subverting gender norms, with Bob now being depicted as the Mr. Mom of the Parr family. Returning to these characters feels especially welcome here, with snappy being the best word to describe the flow of the dialogue, and tributes to classic spy thrillers being peppered throughout the plot. Much like the first film, this sequel maintains a very lighthearted approach, in contrast to most superhero movies of recent years. Even in the action sequences, the film never takes itself too seriously, but things never devolve into camp, instead treating the superheroes with a great degree of reverence. Comic timing is especially effective (and in full force) during a fight scene between Jack-Jack and a ravenous raccoon. The powers of the new superheroes themselves in this sequel add a spice of variety to the superhero genre, with Voyd's eponymous ability standing out in teleporting anything anywhere and He-Lectrix zapping to new heights.All of the original voice cast return (save for Dash, with now-older Spencer Fox being replaced by newcomer Huck Milner), with Holly Hunter's Elastigirl taking the reins with style and Craig T. Nelson incredibly applying the light touch of subtlety in his performance as Mr. Incredible. Samuel L. Jackson elevates any movie he's in, and this is no different with his return appearance as Frozone. Even Bird himself returns to voice everyone's favorite superhero costume designer, Edna Mode, along with John Ratzenberger returning as the Underminer during the film's intro. Newcomers to the Incredibles franchise include Bob Odenkirk's enthusiastic Winston playing against Catherine Keener's more laconic Evelyn, and Jonathan Banks (replacing the late Bud Luckey) as superhero agent Rick Dicker, along with a special appearance by legendary actress Isabella Rossellini as an ambassador for superheroes.As always with Pixar's films, the CG animation is to the highest standard; in fact, just the first few minutes show how much they have improved technologically in the fourteen years since the original film's release. For example, faces and clothing are more detailed and better-defined while still retaining their geometric, cartoonish touch, hair locks flow more smoothly, lighting feels more realistic yet colorful at the same time, and the camera is able to move in more unique twists and turns throughout, particularly in the train sequence. The superpowers of Elastigirl, and especially Jack-Jack, offer a wealth of opportunities for Bird and the Pixar animators, lighting artists, effects artists, and modelers to push the boundaries of what they can do with these characters. Ralph Eggleston's production design and Nathan Fariss' sets are made to resemble 1960s modernist architecture and futuristic artwork, given its Art Deco-inspired setting of Municiberg, right down to the TVs being round and featuring clips of ""The Outer Limits"" and ""Jonny Quest."" The Parr family's new residence, in particular, features an architectural structure and design that would make Frank Lloyd Wright proud. Michael Giacchino's sequel score calls to mind the cavalier orchestrations of Henry Mancini and thrilling spy influences of John Barry's James Bond scores. The original theme songs created for Elastigirl, Mr. Incredible, and Frozone just add to the charm of it all.The film is preceded by a short film entitled ""Bao,"" centering on a Chinese woman who makes dumplings and suffers from empty nest syndrome. When one of her dumplings comes alive, she ends up raising it like her son, and soon enough, the dumpling becomes rebellious as it reaches its teen and adult years. As strange as the concept itself is, you can guarantee Pixar finds a way to make anything like this emotionally compelling, and director Domee Shi is able to give the mother and the dumpling so much personality and reaches out to anyone who has ever struggled to raise a rebellious young adult.After a fourteen year absence, ""Incredibles 2"" arrives to great anticipation, and the results are nothing short of, well, incredible.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's funny how this has a higher rating than Zootopia (2016) which is the best animated movie of 2016 in my mind (and for once I agree with the Academy Awards).I did like it slightly better than part 1 though, mainly because of the over-the-top baby.

Of course women have to take center stage. Which is ok but when its obviously a trend in society, it seems manufactured. The extra super heroes seemed kind of generic and one dimensional, they threw too many in there and their animation seemed sub par. Violet did some cool stuff with her force fields, but Dash seemed slower, Mr Incredible not as strong but Frozone seemed to have a little stronger ice. And the plot didn't really make sense.

It would have been so easy to make the second Incredibles an action-fest of family crime fighting, but this movie managed to remember what made the first film so great: fully realized characters and one of the most realistic family dynamics ever captured on screen. From the marital tensions to the sibling bickering, you know these people. And the writing is JUST as strong this time around. It means you care, and it means you recognize yourself, and it means you laugh. This film is not about new villains so much as it is about new angles on rich characters. Fifteen years after the first Incredibles, we are awash with super hero movies. Sometimes it seems like they are all Hollywood cares about. But few of them are this good. Pixar nailed it the first time around, and this sequel absolutely nailed it too.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The most anticipated animated sequel succeeds for the most part.,"Incredibles 2 had enormous expectations to meet and a does a pretty good job, but lacks the last bit to make it another masterpiece. The animation, though, is noticably more detailed and increases the rush of adrenaline we'll get whenever the action kicks in.No doubts about my enjoyment watching this long awaited sequel, because I know of Brad Birds expertise. It had a whole lot of heart and humour put into it, but became rather predictable in terms of who the villain was. But Jack-Jack's antics while being with Bob at home was hilarious and pretty much stole the show.The whole villain thing is actually the only really noticable problem with the movie, because of the lack of originality or surprise in the identity. Let's just say that you can figure it out pretty quickly. Syndrome is also a hard one to compete with in terms of memorability.The movie manages to expand the world in which they live in and add some more of the superheroes we only got few glimpses of in the original. It was a nice addition, and who knows, maybe we'll get to see more of them in the future?In conclusion, it's a worthy sequel, despite a weak villain.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"By now, the Incredibles are my second family.","It was initially strange to see my favorite characters in an other adventure. But then I realized that this film is as good as its predecessor in its own incredible way.

Incredible,"Incredibles 2 was a well anticipated film for children as much as it was for adults. Many people wanted to see this film because they saw the first one when they were younger. Looking at this film in a deeper way you can see that this film is much cleaner and all the visuals are perfect wen compared to the first film which was also really well done. This film starts right where the first one left off in a smooth transition to set the stage for the film. This film has comedy, action, love, and awesomeness. Being an animated film about superheros, nothing is out of the question when it comes to what you will see on screen. The soundtrack and sound design is perfect and helps control what the audience is experience as well as intensify the action on screen. This film follows a standard Hollywood narrative but has a couple tricks to make the plot interesting.

"Fourteen years later, and the Incredibles are as charming as ever.","Brad Birds The Incredibles (2004) is a film deeply embedded in my childhood. During a time in which my interest in superhero comics and cartoons was reaching its peak, it felt as though The Incredibles had arrived at the perfect time, resulting in becoming one of my very favourite Pixar films. It still is, in fact. With the original being held in such high regard by many, it was always going to be risky business releasing a long-awaited sequel fourteen years later. As far as Pixar sequels and prequels go (Finding Dory in 2016 and Monsters University in 2013), I'm not particularly a fan, except for the stellar Toy Story (1995-2010) trilogy. Brad Bird had promised that a sequel to his breakout hit would never be made unless the script was right. And now here we are, fourteen years later, hearing the campy, silver age style villain monologue ""Behold, the Underminer!"" once again. At last, the story continues, precisely where the original film left off.Opening with a fantastic confrontation between the Parr family and the Mole-Man inspired Underminer (a battle I never thought I'd see), Bird swiftly returns us to a cheap motel in which the Parr's currently reside due to Syndrome's burning ship destroying their home three months prior. As it stands, superheroes are still illegal, a law Mr. Incredible (Nelson) is adamant needs changing. Down on their luck and running out of options, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) drops them a tip that they may have a chance to amend the banishment of superheroes law forever. Keeping Violet and Dash in the dark about the opportunity on the horizon, Frozone leads Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl (Hunter) to DevTech, a telecommunications company led by brother-sister duo Winston and Evelyn Deavor. Working towards bringing superheroes back into the limelight, they propose Elastigirl be the face of their campaign, much to Mr. Incredibles bemusement. As Elastigirl is away uncovering the mystery of new supervillain Screenslaver, Mr. Incredible is left to watch over Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack, who's assortment of powers become increasingly hard to keep under control (displayed in a wonderful sequence in which Jack-Jack faces off with a raccoon).Just like the original film, Incredibles 2 is packed full of exciting action sequences, many of which even improve on those from the first film. They're breath-taking to watch, and the scope of the film, in general, feels much larger this time round. Whereas the first film belonged to Mr. Incredible, this film is most definitely owned by Elastigirl. Elastigirl's mission is more rooted in mystery (compared to Mr. Incredibles rock 'em sock 'em assignments from the original) as she quickly discovers an adversary in Screenslaver, who uses hypnotising technology to brainwash all those who are exposed to it. Whilst still an interesting villain with believable motivations, Screenslaver never quite measures up to the menace of Syndrome from the first film, and the reveal was particularly predictable. It's refreshing to see Elastigirl taking the lead here as she features in some of the most well-constructed action sequences in recent movies, be it animation or live action.Taking a break from the action, Mr. Incredible tries his best to navigate his way through his kid's problems as a stay at home father; Violet is struggling with boy problems whilst Dash can't quite figure out his Maths homework, and Jack-Jack gleefully causes mayhem by shooting lasers from his eyes and rapidly multiplying, with small bursts of mutating into a red monster baby (glimpsed first in the original films finale). It's a sweet subplot, and reinforces the fact that parenting is an act of heroism in its own right.In the one of the original films darker moments, it is revealed to us that Syndrome had murdered just about every superhero from the glory days of supers. With this film working towards bringing them back into the spotlight, we're introduced to several new heroes who unfortunately don't quite get the time to distinguish themselves as memorable characters and fail to make any real impact to Elastigirl and her mission, with the possible exception for Voyd, who can conjure voids reminiscent of those from the Portal video game. Nevertheless, they never truly come across as dead weight and don't drag the film down.Thankfully, Incredibles 2 is a sequel that feels like it was worth the wait. With stunning action, more humour and a great lead in Elastigirl, Brad Bird delivers a sequel that will please long-time fans of his original film. Nostalgia goggles are unavoidable here, and there are certainly glimpses of fan service throughout, but Incredibles 2 is strong enough to stand on its own. Although it doesn't quite measure up to the heights of the first film, it's certainly a fun time at the movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another subpar Pixar sequel,"While it tried to be too many things and was overlong I found the first 'Incredibles' entertaining enough to see this second film eventually.Unfortunately 'Toy Story' aside Pixar don't seem to have a great record with sequels, and for me this film can be filed in the 'Monster's Uni/Finding Dory' camp, because while it's good, it's just not great.There are some nice moments, but again, it's too long, with too much time dedicated to Jack Jack, who wasn't really that funny the first time around.It all ends up being a bit predictable.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Threading the line of for parents and their children,"The bar was set high.The Incredibles 2 does not disappoint. It remains true to the spirit of the first movie without a reliance on recycled material. Perhaps even exceeding its predecessor, which is seldom a small feat.It is a rare sequel that can stand on it's own without reliance upon the original, one that wasn't made purely as a cash grab, but for love of a story. There is no doubt that the writers, animators, and voice talent enjoyed every moment working with this film - and it was a joy for them to share their work once again with the audience.In fact, the cast goes so far as to thank the audience for sharing in their work rather than denigrating them.

Beautiful Design But Not Quite As Good As The First,"The Nutcracker: The Fourth Realm and Incredibles 2 are hands down the most beautiful films I've seen this year as far as production and design. Though, both were a bit lacking in the story department. Incredibles 2 has a story, and it's fine, it just doesn't hold up quite to the original, which was fairly flawless. I was fine with the feminist spin some are on here raving like lunatics that it's some political agenda. Ha. Animated films take 3 years to make. And, unlike live-action films, the script and voice-over work has to be done ahead of time so directors can't take liberties like they do in live-action. Basically, the structure is much more rigid and planned out than the Marvel live-action films where the storyboard artists come up with the action scenes then they hire a writer to write around them, or the latest Mission Impossible, where the director was writing the film as he was filming it. So, it would be literally impossible for Pixar/Disney to infuse the current MeToo movement into this film as it had to have been written at least 4 or 5+ years ago. And unlike live-action, it would be extremely time consuming and ludicrously expensive to add new scenes later and edit them into an animated film. Not to mention, I've never ever heard of them doing that. And since that's what I do for a living I think I have fairly accurate understanding of how big studio animation works.I love Brad Bird's work and having Elastigirl take the role of the superhero in this film seemed like an obvious transition. Mr. Incredible doing the same thing again would have been redundant, so, it was a good choice to have her take on that role. And I thought watching Mr. Incredible at home was funny watching a big clunky guy trying to maneuver home life and kids. Maybe seems cliche, but that is what animated physical humor is about and what the great Warner Bros. cartoons were built on. Like the whole scene with the Jack-Jack fighting the raccoon I could see they were going for that old school physical comedy that required no words. That was one of my favorite scenes. Great physical comedy. My favorite scenes involved the kids and I wish they would have showed more of Violet and Dash. I liked Violet's arc with Tony and it would have been nice to see that or her school life explored a little more.While I like the ScreenSlaver villain, which was clever and a great pun, and I liked the Winston character and his enthusiasm, I felt that storyline was a little clunky. It started out good, and the whole PR angle with Elastigirl was great, and played into the first film with destruction being why superheroes were outlawed in the first place. I can't say I know what was wrong with it. Usually it's pretty clear to me but...I think what it is is that they tried to tackle a more adult subject in a kid's movie and then tried to maintain the animation, kid angle, which made it like two films, struggling to take spotlight. Understandable, Brad Bird is getting older and has been doing kid's films for a while and may be interested in expanding into more adult subjects. Which, once you're pegged into one genre it can be hard to break out. Like, the scene where she goes to SreenSlaver's hideout reminded me of serial killer shows. That seemed a bit adult for children. It was pretty tame, but I shouldn't be in a kid's film and thinking of Dexter. Though, the first Incredibles is a cartoon version of James Bond which is very adult, so, where do you draw the line? I did agree with some reviewers that the adults shouldn't be drinking whiskey in an animated kid's film. I don't remember the swearing...it was in E.T., if I remember correctly, but I do agree that adults should feel safe to take their 5-yr olds to a Disney/Pixar film and not have to worry about that.As far as design I think it's the most beautiful post '70s animated film I've ever seen. Every visual department is on-point and should be proud of the work they've done. Not only was it visually more beautiful than the first Incredibles, but the best animated design I've seen since Sleeping Beauty. The backgrounds, props were amazing, layouts amazing, animation, flawless. The scene where it was darkly lit sitting around a beautiful blue pool, that was stunning. The story could have used more oomph to truly put it into one of my favorites. But it is definitely something I will look back to for design, as I think anyone in animation, visual effects, architecture, or design will, as it was truly inspiring.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Incredibles 2: Back in Action, Still Incredible","Remember the Parrs? The superpowered family with stretchy clothes and even more elastic problems? Well, they're back, baby! This time, Elastigirl takes center stage, leaving Mr. Incredible to hold down the fort (and maybe make some questionable parenting decisions). Buckle up for a review that's as action-packed as a Frozone ice slide!Let's face it, Pixar rarely disappoints, and Incredibles 2 is no exception. The animation is stunning, the action sequences are exhilarating, and the humor lands more often than Elastigirl after a high-speed stretch. Stepping into the spotlight, Helen Parr proves she's more than just Mrs. Incredible. Her missions are thrilling, her confidence is infectious, and watching her defy gravity is simply a joy.Remember Jack-Jack, the baby with the mysterious powers? He's no longer a mystery, and let me tell you, his chaotic cuteness is a scene-stealer. Prepare for laser eyes, teleporting tantrums, and enough ""awws"" to fill a rocket ship. Despite the superheroics, the heart of the film remains the Parr family. Their struggles to juggle powers, parenting, and societal expectations are relatable and often hilarious, reminding us that even superheroes have laundry to do (and supervillain babies to deal with).While Bob Parr's stay-at-home dad struggles are amusing, they sometimes feel underdeveloped compared to Elastigirl's adventures. It's a missed opportunity for deeper exploration, but hey, at least he gets some quality Edna Mode time. The villain, Screenslaver, is...well, a bit forgettable. He lacks the menacing presence of Syndrome from the first film, and his motivations feel somewhat generic. Still, he provides enough of a challenge to keep the action rolling.Incredibles 2 isn't quite as groundbreaking as its predecessor, but it's still a super-fun, action-packed ride with heart and humor. The animation is dazzling, the characters are endearing (especially Jack-Jack!), and the family dynamics are relatable even without superpowers. It might not be an adamantium-strong sequel, but it's definitely a vibranium-worthy addition to the Incredibles saga. So, grab your popcorn, put on your super-comfy pants (remember Mr. Incredible?), and get ready for a superhero adventure that's almost as elastic as Elastigirl herself!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Exciting but missed the mark,"The first Incredibles, besides being an exciting, fun movie, also had things to say about being special. Incredibles 2 came close to talking about people being accepted as they are, but then dropped the ball. One young Super talks about how relieved she is that ElastiGirl is no longer hiding, letting the audience know that she now feels less alone. I was hoping this message would be developed at least a bit. Being accepted exactly as you are is the most important lesson any child can learn. Related to this, and a huge problem in the plot, was the implication that just ""being Super"" was illegal! What kind of message is that for children? Your very existence is illegal? Wow, no wonder so many LBGT kids commit suicide and so many people hate minorities. Some nowadays even call them ""illegals"" as if their very existence is unacceptable. On the other hand, was it the Supers interfering with police business that was illegal? If so, yeah, I can kind of see the law's point. The movie did not clarify this at all, and seemed to leave one with the impression that simply being a human with super powers, that human has no right to exist. I couldn't help but wonder, where is the family getting all this money at the end, as they zoom away in their fancy car. Is someone now paying them to be Supers? It didn't make a whole lot of sense. Please talk with your children and tell them that you love them exactly as they are, no matter what. If you don't do this, most likely no one ever will.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good follow up to the 2004 film,The incredibles2 is the sequel to the 2004 animated film by Pixar and follows a superhero family who save the world. When Elasticgirl voiced by Holly Hunter has received an offer with Hunter Boyd(if I am correct) who wants all superheros to come together she leaves her husband Bob voiced by Craig T Nelson to look after the kids. But when a mysterious villain called screensaver starts hypnotising people in order to eliminate superheros all together can Elasticgirl save the world on her ownBottom line I enjoyed this film. I have seen the original a very long time ago and I have it forgotten. My mom thought it was okay and my brother liked it. The only issue I had was someone in the cinema a little girl spoilt it for me and the film itself focused more on Elasticgirl's popularity than the rest of the characters.

Worth the Wait,"(Really late) Incredibles 2 Review:We've waited 14 years since the last Incredibles movie and now we finally have it. The movie was pretty good, not as good as the first but still pretty good. The voice acting was great as usual. I thought Michael Giachino's score was even better in this one. The animation looked much better, which shouldn't be a surprise since technology has improved a lot since the first one. The villain in this one is the Screen Slaver. I thought they were a cool idea and not a descent villain, but Syndrome was much better in my opinion. The motive were clear for the villain but they just didn't seem to be that great. The reveal for the villain was super predictable. Literally everyone in the theater called it from the start. The movie overall was mostly predictable which I was expecting just a little bit more surprise and something new. Some new characters were introduced which I thought weren't needed. They also didn't have much depth. The movie was funny. Everybody was laughing and having a fun time. I think everybody who watches this movie will have a great time.

"An Immensely Solid Sequel that Shines on its Own, As well as being a Fateful continuation of its Predecessor,","Incredibles 2 is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar voice cast. As far as sequels go, it really does shine and is probably one of the best continuation to an animated film I have seen in a very long time. Though he may have been shying away from them for several years, it is clear Brad Bird did not stop thinking about these characters, the love, passion and intrigue in developing them further was felt in this screenplay throughout.My only issue with the film really is that the villain does not shine half as much as Syndrome, who was one of the highlights of the first Incredibles. While there are brilliant moments, particularly a very tense scene where Elastigirl tries to track their location, the motivations and scheming of the character is quite cliche in terms of superhero movies, and was not nearly as personal or hard hitting as it felt in the original.The voice cast is all around fantastic and as great as ever, and the new sides we see from the characters in this movie are fascinating, without feeling out of place or forced in any way. The star of the film, for me, is Violet, who is given a spectacular arc that I was always the most invested in, while Jack Jack was also a joy in every scene and a character with so much fun capabilities for writers.An immensely solid sequel. Despite the difficult challenge this film takes of being a sequel people waited 14 years for, it takes this challenge heads on and manages not to disappoint, The Incredibles 2 is a joy from beginning to end.Following directly after the events of the first movie, Elastigirl takes up work with an organisation striving to save the protection of superheroes, while Bob stays home with the kids and discovers Jack Jack's superpowers.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as GREAT as the critics have made out unfortunately.,"It was a good enough watch but as i was watching it i started to think that i would have preferred to have spent my cinema money and time on something else.It doesn't have that same all-encompassing magic and energy of other great Pixar films, it wasn't as fun, funny or wowing. The critics have overhyped this one, for me!It feels a bit lifeless at times cus it doesn't possess the originality of other Pixar greats in regards to story, character, dialog and scenery. There are a few action sequences which are cool but just not enough to rate it any higher.The family scenes are cliched, all too familiar, except for when the baby sporadically displays his powers like in the trailers.The reveal/twist at the end is predictable and lazy.It is no where near as good as most Marvel films and It's hard not to compare considering how they are equal in scale but this just isn't as fun, funny, engrossing or exciting as those.

But I liked the Incredibles 2 more.For me not since ""The Shawshank Redemption"" have I seen a movie this well made. Dialogue, characters, action, comedy, drama, realism (weird in an animated movie, but some parts felt really... real somehow). We see current themes being explored (like the dad staying at home with the kids while the wife makes the big bucks), we see a well made villain with actual motivation and good dialogue (not monologue).The use of everyone's powers was pretty good too (maybe Dash felt a bit underused in the movie). I loved it.And so did my wife (and she doesn't like superhero movies). We're going to go see it again (which I've never done no matter the movie).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A Solid, Worthy Sequel","It'd be an understatement to say I've been patiently waiting for this movie for over a decade. Incredibles 2 brings us back to the world set up by its amazing predecessor from 14 years ago. This one picks up right where the last left off and away it goes into a new adventure. The Parr's are just as fun as ever and we get to see them through an even closer lens this time.These characters are simply awesome. Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Violet, Dash, and Jack Jack are all back and better than ever. Seeing them again made me realize how much I've missed this lovely family in action and even inside the house. Jack Jack is just precious in this one. While the first film deepens the relationship between the mother and the kids, the sequel instead does so with the father, and it's just as satisfying. Frozone and Edna are back too!What Incredibles 2 does that is so praiseworthy is that it maintains who these characters are so well. Even after all these years, our heroes feel like themselves. The way they think, talk, and conduct themselves feels so natural. Also, the action is toned way up from the first and I loved it.Where the movie falters a bit for me is with the villain. The way the villain ultimately reveals him/herself and his/her plan is unfortunately just too predictable from the start. I thought the script could have gone in certain directions to make the antagonist more compelling but it did not. The villain, however, does end up being very formidable, just like Syndrome.Overall, Incredibles 2 proves to be a solid sequel and another blast to watch for all families. The characters don't seem to miss a beat and the action is simply great for an animated movie. No, it is not as good as The Incredibles from 2004 but it does have just as much heart, which is what is most important.Incredibles 2 gets an A-.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Like literally I just don't even know why this is literally so unrealistic.,"Like why is anyone literally watching this movie. It's literally so unrealistic how they have ""superpowers"" and can do run so fast. Like Dash literally is supposed to conceal his identity as a ""superhero"" which don't even exist, but he literally runs at super speed towards his school bus. Also, it literally says on the internet that Usain Bolt is the fastest person in the world but Dash obviously runs faster. This is a huge plot hole. Also, realistically speaking, Violet could literally just use her shields against Russia and just literally like destroy them. Like would you really rather be fighting the Underminer or Russia? Also, I don't understand why Elastagirl wouldn't just join the WNBA and use her fake powers to just win. So many plot holes in the movie literally but it's still a good movie so like literally it deserves a 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

An average movie with a duration above average,"Let's start by saying that I really loved the first movie.
It was funny, clever, with great character development, personal stories and last but not least it was technically impeccable for 2004.So... my expectations for the sequel were quite high but not unjustified... I think.The studio had nearly 14 years (!) to develop something that could have been really outstanding. Everything was at reach of hand:
Violet love story, Dash school adventures, Jack's power development, marriage crysis, etc. etc.So what we got:
REUSED IDEA - Helen and Bob just switched their involvement
NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT - all the characters had nothing to say
SAME VILLAIN REASONS - delusion
LESS INNOVATION - boring inventions
A FEW FUNNY MOMENTS
A 2 HOURS LONG MOVIE, that could be easily shrinked to 80 minutes.

The Family is the best part,"Having SOOOOOOOOOOO many superheroes movies every year, I was happily surprised with this movie. Yes, there are bad guys and superpowers and unrealistic action scenes, but the best part of all is always the family. 
For me they are INCREDIBLE because what they love the most is their family and the experiences they live together. They love each other, protect each other, learn together and laugh together. It is definitely one of my favorite movies because we live in a world where everything makes you believe that other things are more important or ""cooler"": your friends, jobs, money, adventures, etc. But what matter the most is your family and having principles that nothing can break or bend. This movie is a great example of both things.I recommend it! you laugh, you will enjoy it and you will remember how incredible your family is.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Tons of fun.,"I get why many people complain that this movie fell victim of the times that we live in, that it tries to be politically correct, being one of the aspects that make this movie bad. I disagree wholeheartedly, this movie could have been done ten years ago and still would have made a positive impact. Helen being given the spotlight makes it different, more dynamic. Sure, it is predictable, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad. How it all flows to get to the climax is really entertaining. Plus, we see Jack Jack in action, talk about a highlight.If Mr. Incredible is bad at domestic situations, it's because he never bothered dealing with them in the first place, it's the nature of the character not to worry about stuff like that, and just leave it to Helen. Sexist? Yes, but that's how the characters were built in the first movie, and that's how they were constructed as a family core, to be as traditional as it comes.This film fell victim of the times we live in, because most folks feel that Helen being the main character in this movie is ""feminist propaganda"", just because
feminism is growing stronger by the day, so anything that involves a strong woman in the lead is ""feminist propaganda"". It's absolutely absurd, and I feel sorry for those people. This is a great movie, fun, entertaining, with a different dynamic. Watch it and see it for yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"I Liked the film, but THE STROBING IS SEIZURE DANGEROUS!","I'm so glad they finally made a sequel to the original. It just starts at the end of the previous film, and continues the issues the same story line with the issue of being a superhero family where superheroes are banned. The plot is fairly straightforward and I was able to spot who the villain is about a quarter the way into the film. But for me, that was less important than the way in which the situation's resolved. I look forward to #3 which I hope isn't in 14 years time.However, I had a major issue with certain scenes in the film that have STROBING. I have a history of EPILEPSY when I was young, and the strobe filled sequences induced a huge amount of anxiety in me as I felt like a seizure was coming on! The only way I could look at it was looking half away from the screen, and with my spectacles off. No warning about that at all. Did they not consider epilepsy?!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"14 Years Later, Pixar Delivers","This was a long time coming. It was 14 years between the original Incredibles and the long-anticipated sequel. Who would have thought back then that Finding Nemo would have a sequel before the Incredibles? Heck, the Chicago Cubs would win the World Series before Incredibles 2 came out. What makes the wait especially bad is that Incredibles ends with a cliffhanger. For 14 years, we were anticipating this movie. Pixar's standards are as high as they can be for one studio. To that extent, Incredibles 2 is a good movie, but it's far from Pixar's best. It's not as good as the first movie. It's not as good as Coco or Inside Out either. But it's still a very good movie.Most of the new characters from the first movie returned. Here, Elastigirl goes out to save the world while Mr. Incredible stays home with the kids. It's pretty much the first movie, but with the roles reversed. And because of that, it often leads into territory where characters feel more like stereotypes than anything else. This is most evident with Violet and Dash, who fall into middle/high school stereotypes, whether it be bad grades or an upcoming first date. However, Elastigirl makes up for it by being a solid protagonist. She finds herself at crossroads, torn between parental duty and the superhero life. It's also interesting because she does begin to enjoy being a superhero again, which she actively spoke against in the first movie. Perhaps the most notable character is Jack Jack, who has dozens of powers, which he gained at the beginning of the first movie. However, he's still a baby. That being said, his few action scenes evoke classic cartoons, which is welcome in a modern movie. For instance, the Jack Jack/Racoon scene is very reminiscent of the Snoopy/chair scene from A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. Edna Mode returns, and she remains the fan favorite she was before. I'm not even sure what makes her such a good character. She's just Edna Mode. We also see the return of Frozone, played by Samuel L. Jackson, who's just as hilariously lovable as before. There are a whole host of new superheroes, most of which aren't particularly memorable, aside from their powers. The most notable is Void, who's essentially Syndrome, only not evil.Speaking of villains, Screenslaver was a bad villain. Disney/Pixar really needs to stop with the whole ""surprise villain"" trend. It worked in Frozen because no one saw it coming. However, by my count, they've done it 3 additional times (Big Hero 6, Zootopia, Coco) between Frozen and now, so we've come to expect it. It happens more often than it doesn't now, and it's more of a game of figuring it out first. I figured out Screenslaver's identity almost immediately. Disney villains aren't as good as they used to be. Old Disney villains like Hades, Frollo, and Maleficent, to name a few, worked because they were fully developed characters. We don't really have those in Disney movies anymore. Speaking of villains, what happens to the Underminer? He just vanishes.As you would expect from Pixar, the animation is immaculate. Obviously, the best looking parts are the action scenes, with the variety of characters and their abilities. Since its animated, the action scenes can be much more fast paced than a live action superhero movie. The film's climax worked so well because of the way individual superheroes teamed up and used their powers cooperatively. But even still, the animation has even noticeably improved from the first movie. Pixar, in terms of animation, is the industry standard, and they've earned that title for a reason.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Honest Review,"Ok, I didn't actually see or even really hear about the first one, and this is despite Sam Jackson's involvement. And I will sit through some horrible movies because he was in them.So there were a few moments where I was a little lost, particularly at the start. Still they were few and far between enough where, like me, you can walk in fresh and it's not really a concern.There is a LOT that is praise worthy here, but what wowed me the most was how well a cartoon movie could be a period piece of pop art.It really fit the era right down to the faces and hair, not to mention all the other tiny little details.Yeah, yeah, yeah, there was a lot more to it, but in my eyes the era stood out the most and in a pop art way. It made it fun for an old historian like me.And for the MCU fans....This is what Captain America Civil War should have been about, and likely was until the plot got twisted",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Many incredible parts, but not so incredible put together","There were a few parts of the movie I enjoyed, but they all felt like disconnected shorts and not part of any hour long movie. Jack Jack's powers, violet's visit to her crush's restaurant, and the frozone fight scene were all highlights and spectacularly animated.But at the end of the day, the audience showed up to watch an amazing storyline followed with meaningful redemption just like the first movie. Yes, the humor and action is great, but I can't in good conscience vote this higher than a 6 when it ruined my favorite childhood memory of watching the first incredibles. In my mind, this movie does not exist. The movie feels like its writers just went on their social media pages and checked off things that people were nostalgic about, instead of focusing on delivering an entertaining, gripping story like the first one.You can tell that not one coherent thought process was involved in making this storyline when you take a look at its main villain. Her actions don't fit her agenda and none of her plans fit her motives. The worst is that they portray the villain as smarter than her sibling, smarter than the supers, and smarter than syndrome. Syndrome and Screenslaver both had harebrained schemes but at least syndrome's plan and motives actually made sense. It was also a really bad move by the writers to resolve everything so quickly. Syndrome was introduced as the villain in the first half of the first movie; this is not the case with the villain here.I know I am preaching to the choir on this, but what's a guy gotta do to get a villain in an incredibles movie with actual superpowers? Not only does this seem like a no brainer step up from the first movie, but it would've been a thousand times more entertaining than what we got here; especially if it's a suprise reveal that the villain has superpowers at a crucial moment.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not deserving of an 8,"The writing/story quality falls off quite noticeably in the 2nd half of the movie. 
The first half of the movie with Elsti-girl in the spotlight was amazing, with some of the best action sequences and a strong premise. And the writing was on par with the first film.
However, nearing the climax and final confrontation, all the events just got willy-nilly and lost the tight and cleverness the the first half, or the first movie.
One of the remarkable trait of the first movie was its tight writing and story through and through. This movie obviously doesn't have that, which is a real shame, and felt like they got lazy half way with story-boarding. 
The ending was also both stereotypical and cartoony, which really hurts the realistic societal backdrop this story usually offers.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't let some negative reviews fool you,"It's a good movie. Not as good as the first one, of course, but it's still a good movie. I think that we all knew that there is no way that the sequel is gonna live up to the original, which only few movies accomplished. But that fact doesn't mean that the movie is bad or disappointing. I went to the theaters with my 8 year old cousin and we had a good time. There was a lot of good action and good humor. True, it didn't have as much character moments as the original one, but ones it had was more than enough.Negative reviews say that ""Disney turns everything into comedy"". Most of the comedy in this movie comes from the baby, which was supposed to be comic relief, so i don't see what's the problem with it. All other main characters also had their funny moments, but not enough to turn them into blatant comic reliefs.Plot isn't too complicated and it was easy to guess who was the villain. But still, even though not as good as Syndrome, it proved to be entertaining and dangerous foe.Overall, if you don't expect this movie to be as good as the first one, you'll probably have a good time. Watch it for what it is: a sequel to one of the best animated movies ever.I won't recommend this movie to those with epileptic problems, since there are few very flash scenes that might trigger attack.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not bad.,"Here's my review of Incredibles 2. So the super family shows up 14 years after it's release and is directed by Brad bird ( I know it sounds like a superhero name ) the genius behind Ratatouille, Toy story and other Pixar classics. I liked how they continued right where the first movie left off and also continued using analog tech from then without switching to smartphones for the new movie. Before calling it a Pixar movie it's first a superhero movie and that calls for a good villain . Was there a good villain ? .... Kind of ...ish. when you're playing masked identity with the villain then you should make sure that there are many suspects like a Scooby Doo epsiode. So yeah , you find out who the big baddie is within the first few minutes and the reveal didn't come out as a surprise . And Jack jack , my God. This baby and his superpower experimenting is so cool and adorable to watch at the same time. No sooner will jack jack plushie dolls start hitting the market. I also liked how this movie was big in size as a sequel but also had a light hearted story than the first one. The action in this movie is amazing. and it shows how much difference cgi can make to a franchise 14 years later. In the end Incredibles 2 was what I expected , it's the most fun I've had with animated movies in recent years after zootopia. With great characters , an iconic soundtrack , family bonding , jack jack , and one exclusive clothing line from Edna mode which can give Gucci a run for it's money. ( With no capes of course .)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
