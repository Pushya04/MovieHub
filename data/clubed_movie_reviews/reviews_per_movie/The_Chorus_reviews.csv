A wonderfully uplifting film.,"The locale for this French sub-titled film is a locked fortress-like school for poor boys from broken homes, WWII orphans and juvenile delinquents, very Dickensian in feel. The principal of the school,is a detestable man who abuses students and teachers equally. You've seen the plot before, of course, and some of the characters are ""stock"" sorts. But the acting of the lead, the teacher who ""saves"" the students by luring them into singing, is portrayed charmingly by Gerard Jugnot. Mostly bald, a bit stocky and no beauty, he is nonetheless disarming. The boy soprano, Jean-Baptiste Maunier, has a wonderful voice, and the chorus is splendid. Particularly fine was the score, almost entirely original, by Bruno Colais. I was looking for something inspiring on this bitter cold inaugural day in the U.S. Les Choristes made my spirit soar and reaffirmed that kindness, generosity of self and the gift of music still have the power to change people's lives.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A delicious movie It's just beautiful..,"A delicious movie. Something wonderful is going to happen and I am not talking just about the characters of the movie but the spectators. It's so moving and at the same time it is not a sentimental one. The freedom, the excitement, the amazing charm of discovering the life through the music... I don't know French and I can say that the soundtrack is so international that you don't need to understand the words to feel its power, to receive the message...Very often people agree or disagree with their opinions about a film...

Perfect,"200 people were attending this movie in the theater, when the light went back after the movie was finished, nobody had moved, all the eyes were red. When Jean-Baptiste sings, it just takes you by your guts. The story is fantastic, the music is magic, Jugnot is expectedly grandiose... The picture itself is made ""à la"" 50s, it's very special but truly desserves the highest awards. I cannot give anything below 10 here.

Share this film,"As a public school choir director I was thrilled to see a movie that celebrated the joy of singing. At the end of the semester I ran ""The Chorus"" for all of my students and the response was astounding. A French film with subtitles that kept the rehearsal room totally silent for two days of classes. Fantastic.I sincerely hope this fine film is given an honest opportunity to succeed in the U.S. We don't need a Disney remake in English with updated pop songs. This charming import is the real deal.As a teacher I always trust the sometimes brutal honesty that high school students express about films and music.

Magical,"SpoilersTaking France by storm this summer, Les choristes purportedly led to a surge in applications to join choirs all over the country. The magic is unquestionably in the music, but I'll come to that later.The success of Les choristes as a film (with or without the divine music) lies in its not trying to be anything more than what it is, a simple tale that opens up to you instead of manipulating you. You'll find neither heart-breaking poignancy nor rousing heroism. Within the short duration of a school term or two he spent with the somewhat notorious boarding school, teacher and musician Clement Mathieu had his modest ambition fulfilled, of having a choir sing the music he wrote, then moved along to a continuously modest life of teaching and music. Talented protégé Pierre Morhange did achieve fame and success, but we have essentially been spared laboured scenes of Titanic struggles or exuberant jubilation. To ensure that I'm not misleading towards the other extreme, let me hasten to add that Les choristes does touch our hearts. It does this gently, sensibly.But in the end, it's the music. Purely the celestial beauty of the music alone will brings tears to the appreciative audiences' eyes. The story is touching. The character are likable. But the ultimate magic is the choir and boy soprano Jean-Baptiste Maunier chosen from two thousand auditions. Such a magical choice.",,Anonymous,Music
Music of the heart,"The excellent film ""The Choir"" takes us back to a France of the past where the director Christophe Barratier and Philippe Lopes-Curval place their story about a school for problem children.In a way, we have seen similar situations where a good teacher is the catalyst for turning around a group of unruly students into good and productive young men and women. Mathieu Clement, is such a man. His kindness toward the children is returned to him by the students, as they respond to the way he teaches music to motivate and interest them. M. Clement has a keen sense of how to deal with the students; instead of the hard line approach the principal, Rachin, insists in dealing with them, he has other ways to make them change.The music created by the film director, M. Barratier, and Bruno Coulais, gives the film the right tone. We also hear a song by Rameau, ""La Nuit"", which is sung with such sweetness that it disarms us and get us into the right mood for enjoying ""The Choir"" even more.The film owes a great deal to Gerard Jugnot, who plays the kind teacher who sees possibilities among all these kids. His take on Mathiew Clement is the right one, because the children see in him someone that is the opposite of the other teachers and the mean principal. As the director of the school, Francois Berleand does a good job in portraying this egotistical man who can't see what his own cruelty is doing to the young people in his charge.The children are as sweet as one expects them to be. Especially Jean Baptiste Maunier, who plays the young Pierre Morhange. Also an angelic Maxence Perrin enchants the viewer as the young orphan Pepinot. Marie Bunel plays Pierre's mother well.This film is music to the ears of viewers, young and old.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Moving Film of Great Improtance,"Boys as a group are perhaps the least understood human beings among us. Les Choristes invites our understanding of their sensibility, sensitivity, and the ease with which they are treated badly -- in fact, have always been treated badly by institutions, educators and parents. The importance of fathers in their lives and their great need for a surrogate if the natural fathers are missing are beautifully explored in this film. The screenplay and its realization on screen are very effective in showing how the difficult combination of giving boys strong direction and tenderness and finding a way to their hearts can be accomplished. This film helps us understand how the same human creature can be hard and sullen one moment and sweetly spiritual the next, inaccessible one minute and needy the next. It is also an inspiring film for young men preparing to be teachers.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The best movie of 2004,"This is funny how people get from one extreme to another about this movie. When I saw the movie it was in a Citadelle in an open air cinema by the French Riviera (Villefranche sur Mer, very very nice). The friend I went to see it with said to me: ""I give you the tissues now because I predict you will cry like a baby"". And I cried like a baby. The story made me think about Sister Act ONLY IN THE STORY!!! A failed musician converting a group of difficult children into a choir... But this version of the story is way above the American one. Gérard Jugnot is really great. I like him very much since he has abandoned his comic roles. I loved him in Le meilleur Espoir Feminin and Monsieur Batignole. I think he's an great actor as he can convey a lot of emotions, from laughter to sincere emotion. At last, the fact that all the children are not professional actors adds to the sincerity of the film which should won at least an Academy Award this year if the Americans still can be sensitive about sincerity...",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Gerard Jugnot is extraordinary as a failed musician who  arrives at a boarding school and  transforms the rebel children,"This is a marvelous ode to classic music , to childhood plenty of innocence , friendship , cooperation , curiosity and comradeship . Being inspired by the film La Cage Aux Rossignols (1945). It revolves around the widely successful orchestra conductor Pierre Morhange (Jacques Perrin) , who reminisces about his childhood inspirations when he and his former classmate Pépinot (Didier Flamand) read the diary of their old music teacher Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot , thanks to this box-office film he earned the title of the highest-paid French player in 2004, overtaking Jean Reno , Jean Dujardin , Vincent Perez and Gérard Depardieu). Set in 1948, in the post-war season at rural ¨Fond De L'Etang Internat¨ , there arrives a watcher as well as professor of music , Clement Mathieu , as he becomes the supervisor at a boarding school for the rehabilitation for minors . What he discovers disconcerts him , as the current situation is repressive with a stiff-upper-lip Principal (Francois Berland) who ruthlessly punishes some rebel kiddies . This troubled ragbag of lop-sided children is unwittingly awaiting an empathetic patron who believes in transformation through the conductor's baton rather than the cane executed by the headmaster . As Clement becomes into an enlightened Samaritan pedagogue with hopes for their hearts . While , a young Morhange is the badly behaved son of single mother Violette (Marie Bunel) and Clement brightens up the school and assembles a choir , leading to the discovery of Morhange's musical and physical talents and a transformation in the children . Through the power of song , Clement tries to turn the students . And Clement's ditzy fancy for one boy's mother stretches the plot .French cinema has a great ability in dealing with films about childhood , with interesting and thought-provoking messages that are a clear example of an allegory of notorious values , such as friendship , honor , philanthropy , collaboration and mistreating denounce . This is an splendid ode to childhood , a nostalgic trip to the past in which we become children along half and hour , where everything was discovered , in which the songs and chorus were serious things . Sincere in its sentimentality , it is cutely optimist that believes in the redemption as metaphor of the golden heart . It's a kid's movie but its strength lies in its universal character , not a story just for kids , it's for everyone . This entertaining film displays a colorful as well as evocative cinematography as well as a wonderful musical score . Boarding school movies hit a peak with ¨Jean Vigo's Zero De Conduite¨, ¨Lindsay Anderson's If¨ and ¨Truffaut's 400's blows¨ , but this French box office takes its enjoyable inspiration from a different tradition , the motivational piety , goodness and mirth of ¨Goodbye Mr Chips¨ and its wake . Awesome acting by Gerard Jugnot -also co-producer- as a decorous , self-minded chorus conductor , not instantly set for the unabashed hostility his students show him . Support cast is frankly magnificent with the acting more self-contained than the constantly swelling soundtrack , as the following actors shine : Kad Merad , Jacques Perrin , Francois Berland , Didier Flamand , and the child angel face Jean-Baptiste Maunier who was the soloist of Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc , and other actual boys choir soloists .Principal photography by Jean-Jacques Bouhon , Dominique Gentil , Carlo Varini took place on location at the Château De Ravel in Puy-De-Dôme . Using foam and salt as artificial snow and green leaves were removed from the grounds , since the beginning of the movie was filmed in the summer, but set in the Winter . As it was filmed in the middle of summer which was hard for the actors to wear winter clothes . A model of the boarding school featured in the film at a miniature railway museum in Châtillon-sur-Chalaronne and fog machines were also used around the castle . It features a sensitive soundtrack , which was composed by Bruno Coulais and performed by the Bulgarian Symphony Orchestra , conducted by Deyan Pavlov and the choir Les Petits Chanteurs De Saint-Marc , as the producers chose to hire real boys choir soloist . It displays heartwarming , sentimental choral performances in general , the Chorus translates into a strong , albeit repetitive album.The motion picture was well directed by Christophe Barratier (L'outsider , París, París , War of the buttons) who gives an approach exquisite and original ; in fact , this was the #1 movie at the French box office , with more than 8.6 million admissions . It is a great portrait about unfortunate post-war orphans , appointed to children as well as adults .",7.0,Anonymous,Music
La Petite Bon-Bon,"This award winning French film is a frothy little confection. Short on plot (what plot?)or indeed on just about everything else too, it nevertheless took me on a wonderful trip with its music. Gerard Jugnot(and does anybody else out there think he's a dead ringer for Bob Hoskins?)shines as the inspired music teacher, a beautiful performance. There's little to the script or the other characters who are all drawn in the black and white mode so beloved of Hollywood,i.e. the headmaster: bad, the injured old caretaker: a saint. A few throwaway lines about the headmaster's daughters goes nowhere, ***minor spoiler***as does the taking of Papinot (aren't there, like, laws about such things?)from the school.***end of spoiler***. We have seen all of this in other movies, often done better but the music transports as does the cinematography which is highly evocative of the era. So a 7 out of 10 for those.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A lark ascending...,"This is a film to make the soul sing.A new warden, Clément Mattieu, (Gérard Jugnot) arrives at an ""internat"", what is to all extent and purposes a borstal, to find boys out of control and a sadistic head (jean-Paul Bonnaire).

"So charming, but what's new?","The film is uplifting. A physically unimpressive teacher in a boarding school for poor, vagabond kids spots singing talent and transforms the lives of scores of children through what he knows best--conducting choral music.How much does this film differ from Peter Weir's brilliant ""Dead poet's society"" or even the Sidney Poitier film ""To sir, with Love?"" Precious little. The director Christophe Barratier likes music and therefore makes a film with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 a rarity among French films unless they want to go very commercial. He even casts his own uncle Jacques Perrin.. The film was showcased at the on-going Dubai International Film Festival.The film has made an indelible impact on those who like music and those who have not been exposed to a wide range of cinema.

By the numbers,"A middle-aged musician, Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot), arrives at a boarding school for delinquent boys, Fond de l'Etang (Rock Bottom), with fear about his ability to handle the job of teacher and supervisor. His fears become even more real when he meets the overbearing headmaster Rachin (Francois Berleand), a man who takes out his frustrations by dolling out excessive punishments to the children. This is the premise of The Chorus (Les Choristes), a skillfully acted but by-the-numbers effort that fails to deliver any real emotional substance.Mathieu discovers that some of the boys can sing very well, especially troublemaker Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier) whose boy soprano voice has a purity that is almost angelic. The teacher pursues a relationship with Pierre's mother Violette (Marie Bunel) and encourages her to visit the school more often, but she falls in love with an engineer without considering Mathieu as a potential father for her son.The teacher molds the delinquent boys into a heavenly choir (without a great deal of trial and error) and develops a positive relationship with most of them that demonstrates the redemptive power of music and further frustrates the surly headmaster. Although I did find The Chorus entertaining and truly enjoyed some gorgeous music, most of the characters are well-worn stereotypes and the film does not explore any possibilities beyond its tried and true formula.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Caged birds sing,"There's an air of romance surrounding wayward boys, particularly in the French tradition, where they tend to be poetic as well as mischievous. In ""The Chorus,"" Christophe Barratier draws on this tradition and adds some lovely vocal sounds. ""The Chorus"" is about an ""internat"" or reform school where a new principal who writes music tames his young charges, some naughty, some just abandoned, by teaching them to sing in a boys' chorus. The school director, Rachin (sounds like Nurse Ratched), François Berléand (of Jacquot's ""The School of Flesh""), is a prissy sadist who preaches a philosophy of instant punishment for all real or imagined wrongdoing (""action-reaction""); but when the new principal, Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot) shows up with a soft approach to his classes and his supervisory duties, he finds allies among the faculty and staff.""The Chorus"" advances the frequently screened theory that delinquent kids are better charmed than chastened; that if you can find a positive activity they excel in, the misbehavior will die out.Barratier has had good success with his young actors. The most important boy is the ""tête d'ange"" (head of an angel), tall, fair-haired Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier), who's often in trouble and refuses to join the choir, till Mathieu catches him singing by himself and discovers his star soloist. Morhange's voice possesses not only a rich natural musicality but the haunting purity only boy sopranos have. Morhange has the most attractive mother, and Mathieu's success in encouraging the boy's singing makes the pudgy, bald man fantasize romance with her -- thus incidentally clearing himself of the suspicion of pedophilia that tends to haunt any all-boys school setting. Mathieu's romantic dream is futile, and he humbly fades away at the story's end, like some Gallic pied piper of boy soprano-dom.""The Chorus"" takes place in post-war France and its topic and look establish immediate links with a bevy of seminal French films. Wayward French boys turn up in boarding schools that are places of both repression and refuge, as you can see in Jean Vigo's school revolution in ""Zero for Conduct"" (1933). The beloved textbook of the French bad-boy tradition is Alain-Fournier's ""Le Grand Meaulnes"" (The Wanderer), which was notably filmed by Jean-Pierre Albicocco in 1967. The tradition becomes more autobiographical in Truffaut's 1959 400 Blows, which introduced the director's alter ego, Jean-Pierre Léaud; and in Malle's moving and long-contemplated memoir of a boarding school in wartime, ""Au Revoir les Enfants"" (1987). Jean Cocteau mythologized a bad-boy idol who haunted him all his life in the Dargélos of ""Les Enfants Terribles"" (1950), made into yet another classic film by Jean-Pierre Melville. This whole idea has remaining traces in the feral youth Gaspard Ulliel plays in André Téchiné's recent ""Strayed."" ""The Chorus,"" it is true, is a relatively conventional entry; except for adding music, it rides upon, rather than transcends, the tradition. But it's a warm story with much charm and little pretension.Barratier himself is a talented musician who, like Mathieu, has drifted into other things. A trained classical guitarist, he won several international competitions after studying at the prestigious École Normale de Musique in Paris, and played professionally for several years. But in 1991 he joined Galatée films to train under his uncle, the renowned actor, producer and writer Jacques Perrin -- who bookends ""The Chorus"" as a Morhange who has grown up into a famous classical conductor. For the next decade Barratier was an associate producer and collaborated with Perrin on ""Children of Lumière,"" ""Microcosmos,"" ""Himalaya"" and ""Winged Migration."" Now he has turned his hand to fiction and directed his own film, with success. There is a risk of preciosity and sweetness, mostly avoided by the dryness of both Mathieu and Rachin as characters, as well as the surviving wickedness of the boys, especially an arch bad-boy, Mondain (Grégory Gatignol). The point of view is Mathieu's and the mature Morhange's, so the film doesn't go as deep into the boys' psyches as it goes into their voice boxes.The director is well connected. He's the son of film actress Eva Simonet and besides his uncle his grandparents were also theater people. The Chorus was top box office in France after its release in March 2004. The French critical reception was pretty mixed, and the film's been reviled by some in the United States as (in one writer's words) ""unbelievably inane, saccharine, and derivative""; ""all smooth, nutrient-free clichés."" Even thumbs-up king Roger Ebert didn't like it: ""this feels more like a Hollywood wannabe than a French film,"" he wrote. ""Where's the quirkiness, the nuance, the deeper levels?"" But it's really a cleanly made, simple, humanistic, and satisfying little film with far less pandering than its critics claim, and whether we like it or not, it's the French Best Foreign Oscar entry, and the little chorus is likely to perform "" Vois sur ton chemin"" on Awards night (if their voices haven't changed). The relatively minimal mise-en-scène and the period setting link it more with its classic film antecedents than with the overproduced ""Very Long Engagement"" (Jeunet's film's Oscar nominations are for décor and photography). Derivative and conventionally themed? Yes. Barratier has acknowledged ""The Chorus's"" inspiration in an earlier film, ""La Cage aux Rossignols"" (The Nightingales' Cage, 1945), which has the same premise -- and anyone can name a long list of movies about teachers who charm their wayward flock. None of them feels -- or sounds -- quite like this movie, though. And the boys do their own singing: the ""tête d'ange"" really has the ""voix d'ange."" American reviewers, missing the nuances, plug Les Choristes into ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" or ""Dead Poets Society"" and find it stereotypically schmaltzy. The gentler French critics don't see those crude comparisons and are able to call it ""un beau film"" and find in it a satisfying example of ""cinéma populaire."" We can too if we open up to it.",,Anonymous,Music

A Simple and Uncomplicated Masterpiece,What a beautiful little film that is engaging and enchanting from the very first scene. Even the harshness of life in a correctional boarding school is treated with simplicity without resorting to gratuitous violence.Gerard Jugnot delivers an excellent portrait of a school prefect who has no great talent other than a humanity and devotion to the students under his care. History shows that this ordinary individual has a talent for spotting genius in others and by the conclusion of the film we are exuberant at the rounding off of each theme and character.I defy anyone not to have a tear running down their cheek at some stage of this film. It tugs at the heart strings and is uplifting at the same time. In particular the two final scenes warrant special attention and acclaim. The view of tiny little hands all saying their own farewell is one of the most moving scenes I have seen in any movie.Les Choristes truly deserves wide acclaim and the sacrifice made by Gerard Jugnot in helping finance the film is a credit to his belief in this script and a reward for delivering such a wonderful family film.This film restores a balance to humanity and highlights the dignity of ordinary human beings and the hope we all have for happiness and to leave our mark on the world.,10.0,Anonymous,Music

However, I felt this was a fairly dull and unengaging effort which never really touched me at all.The main actor was very good in his role, the children performed admirably and the other actors were also good. In addition the camerwork and overall style was proficient. However, it just seemed all a bit too smoothly done, feeling a lot more like a typical Hollywood film than your average French Film.

Awesome movie!,"By getting nominated for Academy Awards in both the Foreign Language Film and Best Song categories, Les Choristes (The Chorus) made a rare (for a European film) double impression at the 2004 Oscars. This sentimental tale follows the arrival of a new teacher at a remote boys school in 1949 France (the war is a largely unspoken but ghostly presence). With disciplinary problems rampant, and the policies of the old-fashioned headmaster not helping, Monsieur Mathieu decides to introduce choral singing as a way to bridge the gap with his students. You don't need a crystal ball to figure out where this will go, although the movie uses its atmospheric location and lush vocal arrangements well. Bald, dumpy Gerard Jugnot provides a refreshingly offbeat hero (though securely in the traditions of the My Most Memorable Teacher movie); he's sort of a younger Philippe Noiret. Director Christophe Barratier works in the winsome-cute mode that makes a certain kind of French movie into an overly sweet Bone Bone, although at least this Bone Bone sings.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Sugary, unbelievable, but the script is deft enough to keep us interested all the way through. Touches of 'Amelie', the French are learning how to make American style confectionery-cinema. This is box-office fodder - nothing wrong with that - just that we have always expected something more of French cinema. But commercial hits can also pave the way for art by providing the necessary cash flow, and we can only hope that French cinema will not entirely disown its great cultural heritage.

"An improvement on ""la cage aux rossignols""?","""La cage aux rossignols"" ,released in 1945,was one of the last movies of the occupation days .""Les choristes"" ,although they have transposed the action to the fifties,hints at it when a young brat breaks into ""maréchal ,nous voilà!"" ,anthem of those dark years.The question is:was it necessary to redo?Yes the songs are splendid and are likely to become part of the repertoire of all the French schools .Yes the boy who plays Morange mesmerizes the audience ,and like Brigitte Fossey (""jeux interdits"" ) or Benoit Magimel (""la vie est un long fleuve tranquille"" ) he may become an actor when he grows up.The original screenplay has undergone some changes:it has become a long flashback ,with an ending which focuses one more time on success and fame ,borrowing more from ""Professor Holland's opus"" than from Dreville's old flick.The rebel pupil's sister has become an unmarried mother,which was unthinkable in the Petain years.Producer Jacques Perrin -who has seen better days,artistically speaking- appears as the umpteenth version of the ugly duckling turned into a swan.And finally the Jugnot vehicle has the same drawbacks as its model:the kids become quickly much too quickly a heavenly choir ,andwe do know that, in both movies ,the young actors are choristers in real life.The characters remain cardboard and Gérard Jugnot is neither better nor worse than Noël-Noël .What's amazing is that generally ""la cage aux rossignols"" is dismissed as cheesy and maudlin (its rating is average) whereas its remake is praised to the skies.It's the same old song though.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A rest house for busy minds,"Two Continental European films with campus setting are on show right now in town: Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar's ""La mala educación"" and French director Christophe Barratier's ""Les choristes"". However, the former deals with the devil which is pretty disturbing while the latter the angels that touches the viewers' heart and soul. It blows in new fresh air into the cinema world.People may associate the film with the 1945 production ""La cage aux rossignols"". Yet, ""Au revoir les enfants"", ""La gloire de mon père"", ""Le château de ma mere"", ""Nuovo cinema Paradiso"" and the literature namely ""Le Petit Chose"" by Alphonse Daudet and the hugely popular series of René Goscinny's ""Le Petit Nicolas"" were rushing into my head when the film rolled on. They all share a number of common features: younger carefree days, reminiscence, scenic countryside, pastoral living etc, they are all ingredients of French fresh (salad) movie, warm, humane and unforgettable. The genre is perpetually popular and it is ever-lasting. Strangely the subject matter though is related to ""To Sir, with Love"", ""Mr. Holland's Opus"", they didn't come up to my mind immediately.French people are capable of producing movies or books with nostalgic ideas, the power again captures the world's heart. A country with long history or brilliant history provides much space for artists, France is one of them. Perhaps the French have no incentive to push forward like the Brits or Americans or they are pessimistic about the future or they lack funds, many the French artists (of various art form) keep looking into history for inspiration. Many French global blockbusters are filmed in nostalgic background setting, ""Amélie"" is the one in the 50s or early 60s. Cruelly truthful is if we compare the development (in most areas) of the developed nations on the west and east Atlantic coasts, the UK and the USA are exactly more advanced.Pierre, Pépinot, Le Querrec, spectacled Boniface and all the other children form not only a choir but an angelic choir. The boys' angelic voices has resounded inside my head for pretty long time. The angels rekindle Clément Mathieu's abandoned hope on music and hope again falls onto these young souls. On top of it, he is the unsung hero on the making of the world famous conductor Pierre Morhange. Mondain, apparently sexually harassed, is not a incurable boy but a boy in his quest for love. Mathieu wants to carry out his ""experiment"" on him. And the young boy knows the class tutor is a kind and reasonable teacher. His smile to Mathieu before he is pulled away by the police tells it all.Mathieu believes in moral education (or educating children in love) which is entirely different from iron-handed Rachin's hard-line pedagogical conviction and administration. Should time be given, Mondain would find his way out from the excruciating self-destruction. Just a side thought: Hong Kong educators should have more thought on dealing with ""problem students"", from time to time what these young people need is a tender light guiding them onto a path which they can have satisfaction and security. Well, we are somehow regressing now.",,Anonymous,Music
Emotional power at it's best.,"Not since American Beauty has a film hit myself with such emotional power.

Portrayed is a wonderful image of rural France, and it is a must see for anyone remotely linked with classical choral backgrounds, or France itself.

Les Choristes is an easy-to-watch movie, even without subtitles. The movie involves action and a sad but eventually happy story. It is a moving story which deserves these 10 stars. It's a professional picture and an excellent movie! Watch it ASAP! You won't regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Fine French Film,"A moving and heartwarming story following a musician supporting a class of poorly behaved boys. The period fits well with the plot and allows for at least a little background development for all of the key choir members. The story is compelling and the audience is able to make connections, whether they be positive or negative, with all the characters in order to enjoy and be engrossed all the way to the finale. The setting, wardrobe and colour incorporated throughout the film draw you in to enjoy this piece of French cinema, it is easy and enjoyable.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
An optimistic film...,"A new teacher comes to a boarding school for orphans and difficult children. He'll try to endear himself to them by creating a choir.As you can see the argument is in broad terms the same you've watched in dozens of movies, the characters are a little bit stereotyped (a good teacher, an evil director, a bad guy that eventually turns into the teacher's best friend...). Anyway, is there anything left to talk about in cinema or in literature? No, there's not. I think almost everything's been told by now.So ""Les choristes"" is not the most original film ever , but the film-making is pretty nice and is full of tender, sense of humor, optimism and good values. It was one of the most successful European movies of the last year, the film everybody's been talking about round here. Those who like chorale music will be specially thrilled, and the rest of you will have a nice time with a good and kind movie, with such remarkable actors.*My rate: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Too sentimental even for a movie about a boys' school,"To Sir, With Love would look like stark British realism if placed next to this French treacle. All the clichés are in place: the troubled but decent boys; the overworked and cynical teachers; the harsh, almost sadistic, school administrator; the idealistic new staff member who wants to make a difference. You know the rest. The plot is not very carefully worked out and the whole enterprise has a slap-dash quality. Some subplots are begun and then just allowed to trail off. The acting is adequate throughout and the boys choir is nice to listen to, even as you doubt that a school of ordinary boys could possibly sound like that. This movie has gotten quite a bit of attention. It doesn't deserve any of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Francois Berléand as the tyrannic headmaster gives a rather good performance and so does Gérard Jugnot as the music teacher, but it mostly just surface anyway.

Sentimental Treacle for the Eye and the Ear,"""The Chorus (Les Choristes)"" demonstrates that France is just as able to put out sentimental treacle as Hollywood, for those who thought the Gallic sensibility was inherently cynical, philosophical and intellectual or even romantic.There is a long cinematic history of similar movies. The brutal reform school lorded over by sadists genre of the British and Irish movies, such as ""If"" and ""Borstal Boy,"" usually are from the point of view of the rebellious working class inmates, while the American version usually focuses on the inspirational teacher, not necessarily of the downtrodden unless race is also a factor, such as in ""Dangerous Minds."" There's ""To Sir With Love"" which brings in all these elements. And there have been several that use music as the key, from ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" to ""School of Rock"" and ""Music of the Heart,"" some even based on true stories.The marginal originality here is that the focus is on a boys' chorus performing classical music, but I always find those angelic pre-puberty voices more creepily pure than appealing, as they are just so fleeting until their voices change. It is annoying how quickly the sympathetic chorus master molds the kids into perform-ability - there aren't even any rough rehearsals after the amusing scene where the kids reveal the little exposure they've had to any sort of songs.We're even robbed of the impact of the chorus on a key boy because the film is one long flashback. We only get a frisson of an implication of what else may have gone on in such schools as revealed in ""Bad Education (La Mala educación)."" This film is pretty to look at and listen to and saccharinely predictable.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Music is the answer,"One of the most touching movies ever made. It shows the importance of music in children's education, and in life as well.

A Real Choir MASTER,"To the best of my knowledge Gerard Jugnot is completely unknown in England despite having acted in some 76 films, written 14 and directed 9. He was part of a group named Splendid who began in the cafe-theatres of Paris in the eighties and a fair percentage - Thierry Thermitte, Josiane Blasko are two names that will be familiar to both English and American audiences - have gone on to carve out successful movie and/or theater careers. Ironically, the second lead in The Choristes, Francois Berleand has appeared in several films that were seen outside France but the irony is that he could get a job tomorrow as a Richard Dreyfus look-alike and it was, of course, Dreyfus who starred in Mr.Holland's Opus, the film to which the Choristes is destined to be compared if not measured against. Currently this entry is making a lot of noise at the French Box Office and deservedly so if anybody asks you. Jugnot strikes just the right note (not really sorry about that) as the new teacher on the block in a school for hard cases but unlike Richard Dadier (or, Glenn Ford, whichever is the greater) his attempts to reach the kids via music is NOT abortive. For those who can't resist footnotes to other movies this one also has a touch of the Cinema Paradisos inasmuch as it begins with the death of a mentor and a now Internationally successful artist (for movie director read conductor) reminisces about his childhood and the influence upon it of said mentor. In a perfect world this movie WILL be shown in England and/or America and a great many more mavens will know what the cognoscenti have known for years, that Jugnot can make it even without the Paycock. 9/10",,Anonymous,Music
The Chorus,"I selected to see this movie by default. It was high on rating, and I just gave it a chance, without knowing what to expect.The story is about a middle aged musician Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot) who arrives at a boarding school for delinquent boys, held captive in fear by dictatorial head master Rachin (Francois Berleand). Gerard with his sensitive and mild ways changes the heart and mind of boys and teachers in the boarding school with simple inculcation of musical chorus among boys. He also tries pursues a relationship with a gifted singer boy Pierre's (Jean  Baptiste Maunier) mother Violette (Marie Brunel), who falls in love with an engineer instead.This is the first full fetch movie of the musician convert to Director Chritophe Barratier, who has won tremendous applause and credibility across the world, through this movie. The direction is good, the cinematography is excellent, and music heavenly. Yes at times the scripting, characters and events are clichéd. Gerard has given an outstanding performance as warm Clement Mathieu, with subtle expressions and emotions hidden behind his chubby self that is remarkable.It is a French movie and I loved it.

an excellent family film,"This film is, at times, a bit predictable. However, considering how wonderful the journey is and how well executed everything is, the occasional predictability is NOT a detriment--in fact, it's nice that the film works out the way you hope.The film is about a teacher at a residential school for troubled boys in 1949. The kids are angry and the atmosphere of the school oppressive. The new guy doesn't have all the answers, but he is decent and the kids slowly respond to this. In addition, he adores music and decides to channel the kids' energy into a chorus. Unfortunately, throughout his stay at the school, the headmaster does a lot to try to undo the good that is done and he seems to genuinely hate the children. Despite this, the teacher and the kids seem to overcome this atmosphere of tension through their music. The music, by the way, is exquisite. Even if you don't understand French, it is marvelous to hear and greatly adds to the overall feeling of the film. Wonderful and heart-felt throughout--but somehow manages not to be sickeningly sweet or contrived.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Not Bad but Not Great Either,"Even though movie pleases its target family-educator demographic, it doesn't add anything new or exciting to the genre or the art. Editing doesn't tire the audience but has no originality either.Movies with child and young actors usually get associated with bad acting but this movie has surprisingly good acting both from adults and children.In the other hand, boring and unsuccessful plot pulls the movie down. Unsuccessful and boring plot has been the fate of French cinema for many years now, and they try to spice it up with heartwarming moments on screen but it doesn't really work. The movie has tons of potential to deepen the characters but instead, it uses a half worked romantic failure between a teacher and a parent. Which only works as a time filling section to beat the clock.The movie's bonding between past and present is so vaguely represented that it looks like an another effort time to play time.The music can be light on those thinking they'll see a musical/chorus movie but it is very competent for a family-comedy movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

We're back to Europe;France: Music,"I had some kind of a movie lesson after watching ""Les Choristes"". One person was telling me what I should always know when I'm going to write about a movie, what I should care about, what I should investigate and other things. She was right, in mostly everything she said, but she was harsh on me. Of the people I know, I'm the only one I know who stays watching film credits; but I don't write all of the credits in a piece of paper instantly, you see?""Les Choristes"" is a film with great spirit, carefully written, directed, composed and edited, that only fails to be great itself because of its trashed argument and its predictable plot line. Taken from the story of an old film written by various screenwriters, director Christophe Barratier and partner Philippe Lopes-Curval adapted the story about a teacher who arrives at a school and somehow changes the students' lives.Professor Clément Mathieu must be a very well known character in France. It has been the main element of some movies and it is a peculiar person. He is portrayed here by Gérard Jugnot, probably as respectable now as any other actor who played the character before. Jugnot directed ""Monsieur Batignole"", a movie I never saw but many people talk about.I have explained my little culture about European cinema before, but I'm reading and writer Lopes-Curval has worked in a lot of the films Jugnot has directed. So I figure that the latter one knows the words and the way of writing of the first one by heart, and he speaks with the right tone and look that translate that to the viewer.Jugnot and his professor are the film's attraction; so was Robin Williams in ""Dead Poets Society"" and more recently Kevin Kline in ""The Emperor's Club"" or Julia Roberts in the very feminine ""Mona Lisa Smile"". ButOf the movies mentioned, two were about learning poetry and human qualities, the other one about learning art; ""Les Choristes"" is about learning music.It's just a matter of time before the students who don't like the principal Rachin (a flawless François Berléand), become fond of Mathieu, the new teacher. And it's also a matter of time before Mathieu discovers that his kids can sing and decides to train them to form a choir (I was watching ""Sister Act 2"" the other day and I recalled the situation).Mathieu used to be a songwriter, so the choir becomes good and they make a presentation in the school, and although the director doesn't approve it, they achieve their goal. However, they don't go to a competition where they can win or loose, because this is a more personal story, and its resolution is personal.The environment is practically one and Barratier makes it beautiful and ugly when he wants to. It's a remarkable fact that Barratier himself also wrote the music and lyrics of the beautiful songs, and that the child actors are members of an existent and, as I heard, very respected choir (probably the best). It's a must see, because of the music mainly, and the rest is up to each individual.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

However, I think this plot is effective and conveys the vast amount of love the music teacher has for the children. He does not love anyone less because of the way they behave. He continues to use his music to positively influence the people around him, so that the world can become a better place.The songs are amazing, so serene and touching.

Troubled youths find inspiration in music--familiar turf but beautifully rendered,"The Chorus (2004)How many French movies will there be that are about boyhood and innocence lost? (Including great films, like Truffaut's ""Pocket Change"" and ""400 Blows"" and Louis Malle's ""Au Revoir Les Enfants."") Out of this national necessity (and the admission of the first-time director) comes this rather nice if not quite great movie, building on the same foundations.A teacher is newly assigned to a country private school for troubled boys. He is secretly a composer, and finds a way to write choral music for the boys, who learn to sing extremely well. And so in the barest most touching way we see the vulnerability and possibility of the boys and the teacher, too. And of course the meanness of the schoolmaster. It's classic great stuff so well done you don't mind the familiar ways it works on you.Well, I have to now say that this movie is a kind of remake of a 1945 French original, ""La cage aux rossignols."" Even the title (The Cage of Nightengales) shows a poetic brilliance that is somehow just lacking here, but in the 2004 version the production values are higher, and the slightly deadpan quality of the lead (Gerard Jugnot) is compelling. Either way the story, and the simple truth of it, is worth seeing. (By the way, ""The Chorus"" is easily found streaming and on Youtube whereas the 1945 version is hard to find.)Beyond the charming idea of delinquents becoming choirboys (and one of them later a famous conductor, which you learn in the first scene), the movie has a kind of warm confirmation that people can be good, and that appreciation of love, and love itself, always abounds. The last scenes will prove this, if you give this a go.What finally holds this film down to earth is not the acting or the music or the wonderful setting in post-war provincial France. It's the story, which we've seen before, and which oddly takes no new turn at all here. It doesn't mean it's not a good story or a well made movie, not one bit. But you'll know when it starts pretty who the good guys are and the bad, and how it will more or less turn out. In that one way, the original at least is, well original.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The French and Musical Version of Dead Poets Society,"""The enchanting calm of your mystery...Is there anything more beautiful than a dream? Is there any truth sweeter than hope? "" Les Choristes, known by American audiences as The Chorus, is an exceptional French film directed by Christophe Barratier. It was nominated for the 2005 Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film, but ended up losing to Spanish film Mar Adentro. The beautiful song, ¨Look to Your Path, ¨ was also nominated. Les Choristes may have went home empty handed, but the film did garnish a lot of critical appraisal, and rightfully so. It is a well told story, with interesting characters, and an inspirational message. I'm not very big on comparisons, but I just couldn't help finding several similarities between this film and 1989's Dead Poets Society. The storyline is pretty similar although this film is much more lighthearted and uplifting. I was a huge fan of that movie and it is one of my all time favorites so the comparison is a good one. Gerard Jugnot might not be Robin Williams, but his performance was still remarkable, and his character is worthy of being imitated by every professor or person who works with children around the world. We must never forget the influence or words our teaching can have in young minds and it is our duty to bring out the best in them in order to make this place a better world. Les Choristes is a wonderful small film with a powerful message, strong performances, and a great musical score. The screenplay was adapted by Barratier himself from the 1945 French film La Cage aux rossignols. The story does move along at an excellent pace and you are hooked from the very beginning with this interesting film. I loved every second of it.The movie centers around a teacher named Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot) who arrives at a boarding school named Fond de l'Etang in a small French town during the late 1940's. This is no regular school, the students here are known for being troublemakers, and the headmaster Rachin (Francois Berleand) runs the place with a very steady hand. Rachin believes in the law of ¨action-reaction, ¨ which means that for every rebellious action by a student, he will receive an equal reaction (some sort of severe punishment). He believes that nothing good can come out of these kids and that they can only be controlled by fear. Rachin's other assistants seem to go along at first with this method of teaching, but Clement has a different view. As soon as Clement arrives at the school he begins trying to teach the kids with a different method and opposes this ¨action-reaction¨ rule. Clement sees the good in these kids and understands it is only a matter of polishing their talents and believing in them. Clement himself is in the middle of searching for meaning in his life, a failed musician, he finds himself teaching these kids, and in doing so he discovers his true calling. He begins writing his own music and discovers that the kids can interpret it for him by forming a school chorus. One of his students, Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier) is very talented, and despite being rebellious Clement finds a way to get him involved in music and makes him passionate about it.Of course there is more to the story than just this. It is told in one flashback as one of the student's reads Clement's journal in voice over so the narration is from the professor's point of view, but we also have a love story and other smaller plots unfolding before us. The story is very powerful, inspirational, and emotional. The characters are all very interesting and well developed. The performances are all very great, despite the fact that Jean-Baptiste wasn't actually an actor but a choir boy. I think this was a plus for the movie because he had a great voice and the music was just touching. Gerard Jugnot was great in the lead role and Francois Berleand was the sort of villain this movie needed. We should always see the good in people and not expect the worst from them, especially from kids who are just discovering the world and realizing their own talents. I loved the musical score in this film as well, the songs were all beautiful. The movie moves at a very fast paced and it is less than 100 minutes long. You won't regret this great film and I absolutely recommend it. Without a doubt it was one of the best films of 2004.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the french greats,"I remember watching this movie with my family when i was 7 years old and having a strong emotional reaction to it. However each time i have the chance of re-viewing the movie wether it maybe at school or a rainy day the same feeling when i was 7 comes back.This for me is due, first through the portrayal of these children treated harshly by the school's director with strict rules ""Action...Reaction..."". However one relationship in the movie that always hits me is the unforced love between the student Pépino and the teacher Monsieur Mathieu. This is probably as a young age i attached myself to the youngest child of the group. When growing up I began to notice the subtle hints of their growing relationship throughout the film and never forcing it to the viewer, was done perfectly
The second success of the movie is the soundtrack. When making a film which portrays the beauty and benefits of singing and music it has to be impeccable, Christophe Barratier did not disappoint.

So Miramax,"This is the kind of stereotypically bland foreign film that the Academy loves to nominate in the Foreign Film category (I think they've gotten a bit better about it in the past several years). It's also a pretty stereotypical inspirational teacher story in the vein of Goodbye Mr. Chips. Gerard Jugnot stars as a kindly teacher who comes along to a boarding school for troubled boys. These kids are downright violent, so one would think this fat, balding, middle-aged man would have a lot of difficulty with them. He has a little, but they turn good pretty quick because he's nicer than the average teacher. Plus, he teaches them to sing, which is, you know, what the film is about. Jugnot is fine, and the children aren't bad actors. The music is really the saving grace. This is one of a small handful of foreign films that was also Oscar nominated outside of the Foreign Film category, this one in the Song category, Bruno Calais (who wrote one of my all-time favorite scores for the film Coraline) and director Christophe Barratier for the song ""Vois Sur Ton Chemin.""",6.0,Anonymous,Music

And some nice acting, mainly from the children actually (strange).But this is the same old song, ""Teacher as Messiah"" movie. Been there, seen that. The Dead Poets Society and the recent equally mushy one with Julia Roberts (don't remember the name) were enough for me. I' don't want this kind of stuff anymore, it gets annoying. And this is so manipulative. The screenplay gets rather awkward in many places, too.And as usual with many french movies (before you call me names, I AM french so gimme a break), there is no cohesion at the acting level, each (adult) actor plays in a different movie. The school's manager is very poorly portrayed. Too many conventions, too many formulas. When will these french wannabe directors learn how to work with their actors?! Jeunet, Blier, Chatiliez, Leconte do understand this aspect of movie making. Marshall is promising. Nothing like that here. The director and the actors have a different partition in their hands. Except for the children.Further, there are so many elements coming directly from ""Amelie"" (the music for example is VERY derivative) that it feels like being quite exploitative....Oh, well, anyway, what was I expecting?

The most charming--and least believable--of the delinquent kid movies,"On a scale of charming, with 0 being ""Platoon"" and 10 being ""E.T."" I'd say this ranks around an 8.On a scale of believable, with 0 being ""E.T."" and 10 being ""Platoon"" I'd say this ranks around a 5.So there you have it, ""The Chorus"" is squarely in the realm of ""E.T."" not ""Platoon"". And if you have 2 brain cells to rub together, you probably knew this long before you read this far. The only reason I'm making this point is in case you were expecting something a little more gritty like the excellent ""Dead Poets Society"" (which, if you haven't yet seen, you must immediately flog yourself with a wet baton before seeing, pronto).""The Chorus"" dives boldly into disturbing territory right at the outset with a scene containing some blood and another reference to suicide. My criticism is, instead of maintaining this malevolent air of drama (which would seem fitting of a corrupt 1940s reform school, every bit as formidable as the asylum in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""), the story instead flips into Disney territory. The dangerous juveniles who initially terrified us are instantly transformed into eager songbirds, reducing the initial drama to little more than a comedic gimmick. The story unfolds to reveal that the conflict of the story rests entirely upon the cartoonish villain, the headmaster.I felt that was the film's only letdown because the story seemed ripe to explore the complex transformation of criminals to chorusboys through the magic of music. While this did occur, it happened so suddenly that I felt like half the movie had been chopped. But if you can take this shift in stride, you'll have a great time. The kids are cute, and the music is uplifting. The presentation focuses more on comedy than hard hitting drama, so you can sit back, breathe easy and enjoy the ride.Personally I would've liked to see a bit more of a challenge in converting these juvenile delinquents, like maybe Antonio Banderas converting a bunch of NYC street thugs to twinkle toes dancers in ""Take the Lead"", or Robin Williams in the aforementioned ""Dead Poets Society"" struggling to draw the ultra conservative schoolboys out of their shells. To me, that is the draw of a story like this, but here the drama was more focused on the headmaster's antagonism. It might have worked better if the evil headmaster weren't shown to be such a bumbling fool who secretly throws paper airplanes around his room whilst standing on his desk. For that role, NOBODY comes close to Mr. Warfield in Jerry Lewis' ""Nutty Professor"".But enough with the comparisons, you're saying. Is this a good movie or a bad one? It's good, very good. So don't hesitate to watch it if you're in the mood for a nostalgic retrospective to bygone days of questionable education systems. ""The Chorus"" is a nice film for anyone who isn't subconsciously comparing it to every troubled youth flick since ""The 400 Blows"". Dammit there I go again.",,Anonymous,Music
Jacques Perrin- again!,"I just saw this movie last night. It is not great, but you can see it with a big box of popcorn or with your girlfriend. Definitely it is the same story again and again. Good acting, touching kids, good soundtrack, but the same plots. Even Jacques Perrin is in the same role as Cinema Paradiso: the successful adult remembering his childhood. In other hand, just wondering why we never saw exteriors during night. I think visually is really bad, maybe they didn't have enough resources for lamps, filters, or a good post-production treatment of the film. Good movie if you don't have nothing better to do or it is raining and wanna rent a DVD. Is anyone agree? Cheers!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"An ""InspiringTeacher"" fantasy You MAY Enjoy... Or Not","The three intelligent, well-educated women I saw this film with were, to varying degrees, moved by this story about an under-appreciated teacher who handles troubled teens by believing in and challenging them instead of controlling and punishing them. I obviously wasn't so crazy about it. Let's put it this way: if you can focus on inspiring core values and overlook obvious flaws, you may enjoy this film VERY much, and might also like ""Dead Poets Society"" and ""Mr Holland's Opus."" If you're looking for a study of three-dimensional characters facing challenging problems in a complex reality, however, skip this and try ""Stand and Deliver"" or even ""The Blackboard Jungle!""

Watch this movie!,"This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. Gerard Jugnot, as Clement Mathieu, the chorus director, is outstanding on every level and just makes me smile as I watch, which I have done 4 times now. Jean-Baptiste Maunier, as Morhange, has a hauntingly beautiful voice that has stayed in my head for days. All of the choral music is breathtakingly beautiful. Jean-Paul Bonnaire, as old Maxence, brings a humanity to the film that is quite touching. And Maxence Perrin, as Pepinot, simply stole my heart.I loved this movie and will buy it for my private collection to watch over and over.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Inspiring,"Barratier does very well in balancing the comedic parts with the more serious tone in the film. The antics of the boys and their overall attitude towards any figure of authority seems to be quite characteristic of a boy's boarding school.The story is simplistic while also containing some surprising elements. It has a somewhat predictable story progression but not the ending I was expecting. Also, I did not expect how dark some of the children could be. Mondain, comes (I think) from a psychiatric or juvenile ward, and so his behaviour is wildly different. In contrast, Pépinot is a quiet and introverted young boy who is known as the cute one. Also, the chemistry between each of the actors is great, and the boys do a great job at playing boys.Though I am not used to the type of songs they sing, it is undeniably beautiful. I'm not sure about the other children, but Maunier can actually sing (and has pursued a music career since then) and so that was his real voice in the film. It is amazing how well he can sing from such a young age, and Jugnot is excellent at portraying his character's pride and amazement at discovering this hidden gem. His eyes are full of emotion when watching Maunier sing, and it transcends the scene, making the audience feel it too.Overall, an inspiring film about the hardships of boarding schools, and the prefect who brought music into the boys' lives.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
'Music that soothes the savage beast...',"LES CHORISTES (THE CHORUS) is director Christophe Berratier's first foray into the realm of full-length films and his adaptation of the 1945 film LA CAGE AUX ROSSINGNOLS written by Georges Chaperot and René Wheeler serves to introduce his talents as a master storyteller well. This tale of how music can alter the lives of even most renegade of boys is warm, sensitive, and satisfying on every level.The story opens with the reunion of two men who were classmates at Fond de l'Etang, a boarding school for troubled boys in France in 1949. Pepinot (Didier Flammand) arrives at the door of consummate symphony conductor Pierre Morhange (Jacques Perrin) with a journal written by their beloved teacher Clement Mathieu, now dead, and the two read the journal, recalling their shared childhood experiences at Fond de l'Etang.1949 and the Fond de l'Etang is a dreary jail-like, rundown place run by the cruel disciplinarian headmaster Rachin (François Berléand). Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot) is an older, bald, failed musician who seeks employment as a prefect in the school and immediately is forced to confront the rigors of the school's harsh discipline with the still flagrantly wild boys. Mathieu slowly wins the confidence of his boys by standing up to the cruel Rachin and when he is near his wits' end as to how to transform his class, he hears a boy sing and decides to use his musical talent to change these boys' lives. Two of the chief problem children are the angry but vocally gifted Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier) and Leclerc (Théodul Carré-Cassaigne) and Mathieu coaxes them into the inner circle of his newly developing chorus. The other child who is without talent but for whom Mathieu empathizes when the child waits every Saturday for someone to claim him at the gates is Pepinot (Maxence Perrin) who Mathieu assigns as his assistant chorus master! Through a series of incidents including the cruelty of Rachin, the appearance of Violette Morhange (Pierre's poor working mother who cannot afford to feed him), the success of the chorus in the eyes of the Countess (Carol Weiss) who acts as benefactor to the school, and some evil doings of the more difficult children, Mathieu's Chorus becomes a symbol for how problem children can bond in mutual need to the enrichment music provides. Rachin cannot tolerate Mathieu's success and fires him without allowing him to say a farewell to his beloved choristers. The manner in which this is portrayed is most touching and spiritually enriching and serves to resolve the mystery of Mathieu's departure to the adult Morhange and Pepinot as they finish the journal.Simple story, told before, but superbly acted and performed. The music is by Jean-Philippe Rameau with original songs by director Barratier and Bruno Coulais, all beautifully sung by Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc with young actor Jean-Baptiste Maunier singing his own solos. The cinematography is in the capable hands of Jean-Jacques Bouhon, Dominique Gentil, and Carlo Varini. In French with English subtitles. Highly recommended little jewel of a film!

A variation on the theme of inspiring teacher,"Not as common as underdog sports teams overcoming obstacles to achieve success, stories of teachers bucking the odds to great positive effect seem to be perennial favorites. This film about a recently-hired school supervisor, Clément Mathieu, at a French reform school for boys in 1949 is one more entry in the exceptional teacher genre. For many of us the appeal of these films is that we have had such a teacher in our lives.The school, named Fond de l'Etang (literally ""bottom of the pond""), houses an impressive collection of rowdy boys, some orphaned or otherwise scarred by the war. The headmaster is a harsh disciplinarian whereas Clémeant is more gentle and reasoned in his approach. About all you need to know about the story is that, in this particular case, the inspiring teacher accomplishes his noteworthy achievements by way of forming a choir.Not all is sweetness as there is one rather incorrigible boy, Mondain (Grégory Gatignol, who establishes a truly scary presence) introduced into the mix. It is interesting to compare this movie with ""Blackboard Jungle"" where Glenn Ford faces a somewhat similar situation. The gritty realism of ""Blackboard Jungle"" is in stark contrast to what we see in ""Les Choristes,"" leaving one to puzzle about how a Hollywood film from 1955 has more depth than a French film from 2004.Jacques Perrin adds some nice touches in his brief appearances - he does a particularly fine job as an orchestra conductor in an early scene. After Clément whips the choir into shape they perform some stunningly beautiful pieces. Maybe they are unbelievably good, but that does not detract from being able to enjoy their performances. I replayed the last ten minutes of the movie several times just to listen to the chorus.This is a sentimental and predictable film, but nicely done.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
I was wonderfully surprised by Les choristes,"When I saw this among the movie choices that was optioned on Scandanavian Airlines, I waited until my return flight on that before watching it. It's an inspirational story of a music teacher who ends up at a boarding school for unruly boys as he teaches them the enjoyment of singing to their hearts' content. There's also a somewhat sadistic principal this teacher has to deal with as well as the single mom of one of the boys. I'll stop there and just say this was quite touching and a bit funny at times (some of the crude language on the part of the kids did partly put me off but I know from experience how cruel they can be). And it's wrapped around a present-day sequence of two of those boys reminiscing about this teacher who inspired them. So that's a high recommendation for Les choristes.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"One-note performances, familiar refrain","It seems ""The Choir"" (Les Choristes) is a sensation in its native France, doing big box-office as a film and selling like hotcakes as a soundtrack. One imagines that France will hasten to enter it in the race for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars this year (2004).""The Choir"" is undeniably a well-made film. But it is not a great film, nor is it even a memorable film. And it certainly doesn't deserve the golden statuette.""The Choir"" is a nice film, a wistful bit of misty-eyed, rose-colored sentimentality. But it is farm from original, creative or imaginative.It is, instead, a rehash and a mishmash of images and ideas cribbed from other films. The conflict between a kindly new teacher and a crusty old headmaster has been done to death. There have been other, more hard-hitting films about the cruelty of life in reform schools for wayward or abandoned boys. And there have even been other films about a motley crew whipped into shape and ennobled by art, music or theater.""The Choir"" simply follows a recipe, blends all these elements, and serves up a tepid broth that is more comfort food than cuisine.The screenplay and characterization make few demands on the cast. This is the sort of thing French actors can do in their sleep. (Perhaps they do.)Even Jacques Perrin's character, Pierre Morhange, is a throwback to an earlier role in his career. In ""Cinema Paradiso"", Perrin played a middle-aged filmmaker mourning the death of a childhood mentor, and celebrating his legacy -- a collection of film clips spliced together. In ""The Choir"", Perrin is a middle-aged symphony conductor who learns that a father figure has passed away, leaving him a legacy of memories set down in writing.Good grief, couldn't the producers of ""The Choir"" show even a little imagination, and at least cast somebody else as the elder Pierre?",,Anonymous,Music
A Nice REMAKE,"This is a nice remake of the Hindi (Indian) movie called Mohabbatein (2000). The characters and the story come so close to each other that you wonder the director of the latter one has done this deliberately. But, I liked both the movies. The Hindi movie is a musical drama. In fact, there is a lot of drama in the movie. The Chorus has made it look like a mature presentation. The effect is really appreciable. You can sit and watch The Chorus and you will remember it for some time if you have not watched the Hindi version. However, for me, watching Mohabbatein earlier did not really help. It was all predictable. The English film is realistic and filled with events that will move you though the Hindi movie is equally moving, it is far from being realistic.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Uplifting! Puts a smile on your face! A wondrous breath of fresh air,"THE CHORUS (Les Choristes) (Christophe Barratier, France/Switzerland/Germany, 2004, 96 min.). Brilliantly crafted, absorbing tale of the transformative power of choral music and a resourceful teacher to achieve civility within the confines of a dreadful state lockup school for deviant and unwanted boys.The story is told in a long flashback, when a reunion occurs between two men who were in the school together a half century earlier. As their story is recounted, we first meet Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot), a short, balding, failed musician who in middle age has no other prospects than to take a job as supervisor in the prison-like school, run by a sadistic martinet, Rachin (Francois Berleand), who treats his faculty as viciously as the students.The ensuing plot conceit is a familiar one: the steadfast Mathieu gradually wins over the insolent, anarchical kids through music and kindness, as he introduces a choir program to brighten the otherwise dull, steady diet of the three ""R's"" and the punishments meted out by Rachin.This little gem has been a surprise hit, wildly popular both in France and internationally. The choral numbers are sublime, performed by an established French boys' choir, whose soprano soloist, Jean-Baptiste Maunier, sings flawlessly and acts the role of young Pierre Morhange, a central figure among the youths here.The film is a remake of a 1945 movie, ""La Cage aux rossignols""  ""A Cage of Nightingales."" First time writer-director Christophe Barratier was himself a musician: beginning musical studies at age 7, he also sang in a boys' choir, and later studied at the Paris Conservatory. He is the nephew of Jacques Perrin, the well-known actor and film producer (""Microcosmos,"" ""Himalaya,"" ""Winged Migration""), who here plays the adult Pierre Morhange, now an internationally known conductor, one of the two men who meet at the start of this film to reflect on their experiences long ago.The story is not far fetched. I have personally known of situations in which participation in choral music turned around the lives of troubled teenagers. Amid so many films reflecting indifference, destitution and violence in our world, this one comes to us like a wondrous breath of fresh air. (In French). My rating: 8.5/10 (A-) (Seen on 04/16/05).

An unlikely but charming transition of bad boys into angelic choir,"Les Choristes is a triumph of wish-fulfilment, and director/writer Christophe Barratier wastes little time on the process that should be at the heart of the film: how to turn a class of very difficult boys into a trained choir with no support at all from the principal's office. It's a heart-warming, feel-good yarn with great performances from everyone, but anyone with experience in education is going to have to suspend their disbelief from the ceiling, as newbie teacher M. Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot) effortlessly transitions from getting the tykes to chirp out snippets of naughty ditties to faultlessly harmonising Rameau before the school governors. Somewhere in the middle there, about half an hour of exposition is missing, in which Mathieu has to chuck out recalcitrant brats, knock heads together, and dish out lines. However, as I say, this is wish-fulfilment; we're in an imaginary past that should not be mistaken for today's reality. As fairy-tales go, this is wonderfully put together, and was a sure-fire box-office hit in France, where French womanhood could not fail to fall for all the lads and sing along with their divine music. Everybody wants to believe this kind of educational miracle is possible, and I am not going to disillusion them on this board. Seven for pure escapism.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Exploitive,"This movie was carefully crafted to suck in the gullible viewer who does not discriminate between the possible and the pretentious. Other reviewers have decried the formula of the heavy-handed headmaster, the easily led teachers, and the newcomer who comes with the fresh ideas to usurp the methods of the school. I went to a boarding school in England in 1949 so I remember what it was like. I know for sure that there was no way a motley group of boys, especially all from one class (and how different ages were assigned to one class escapes me) would be able to sing as was shown. From my childhood I remember the interminable time it took to achieve such a standard, and still we could not quite get there. Nice singing our course but so exploitive!",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Marvellous - Please do not remake in English!!,"I recorded this on my Sky Plus box out of curiosity, because I had heard good things about it. Those good things were more than justified. I have never really enjoyed subtitled movies and I am sure I miss a lot of good stuff because of my prejudice against them. However I started watching this and was totally enthralled within minutes. Jugnot's performance was superb and the whole thing was wonderfully uplifting and, dare I say it, I was blubbing like a baby at certain points (usually musical) during the movie. While the story has parallels in other films (Mr Hollands Opus, Dead Poets Society - to name a couple)it still resonated as an original treatment. The main character is not a charismatic, handsome type but he carries the story and he should have got an Oscar as should the score. Cannot finish without mentioning the young actor who played Morhange-he has a haunting, beautiful face (the face of an angel they say in the film) and a terrific voice. All round great performances, script, direction and music. I do not give it 10 out of 10 only for the fact that it has subtitles-how shallow of me!!

A great movie and even more so if you love choral music,"I found this a really touching movie. The beginning shows Gerard Jugnot as the new teacher who tries a new method with the difficult kids instead of the ""Action - Reaction"" motto of the board director Rachin. Not surprisingly this earns him some trust from the kids paving the way for his musical experiment. It's when the choral music starts when this movie really hit me. The music and the singing in this movie are absolutely wonderful with Jean-Baptiste Mauniers singing as a great enhancement to the already beautiful choir.

All I can say is that if they bother you that much, switch them off and listen to the wonderful French dialogue, I guarantee you will still be able to follow most of story. Jugnot is fantastic as the hapless music teacher and the children well deserve the Oscar nominations for their touching portrayal of misunderstood bad boys.

A Wonderful Warm Life Affirming Film That Only The French Can Make,"England used to make good films, still copied today but not as well (THE LADYKILLERS), but now all it makes is two types of shows: those with shotguns, seedy tattoo parlours, graffiti inner city streets, junkies and fighting and the second about toffs in period costume. Alas there is nothing in between. Only 25 miles away, is England's neighbour, France, which makes regular masterpieces, of which this is a prime example. It is set in the recent past, the late 40's, and concerns the redemption of a failed musician posted to a rural boy's school for rough kids and orphans. Gradually, and you know he will, he forms a choir from these no-hopers, transforming their lives and his own. It is full of charm, warmth, in the best classical way of film-making. A splendid effort, and rightly belongs in your DVD library. Excellent acting,art direction, confident and intelligent direction (surely big projects will now come his way). The music CD is on the best seller charts throughout Europe and understandably so. The music is different by juxtaposition: you see these poorly dressed scruffy boys, living under a repressive regime, yet singing ditties by Rameau like angels about dreams, oceans, and zephyrs. A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, released at the same time, is a big slick version of quirky Gallic charm, and also excellent, full of crane moves, great cameraman's set ups, and a big-scale version of personal versus macro scale ( a fiancée searching for her missing soldier who did not return from the WW1 trenches ) yet between the two, THE CHORUS lingers in the mind with a fondness and a smile.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Nicely crafted commercial movie.,"Music is the best this fable has to offer.The plot is full of commonplaces, its characters are so cartoonish one can hardly feel anything for anybody, and I felt manipulated all the time. We've seen this story too many times. Better told, by Dickens, and even worse, like in ""Devil's backbone/ El espinazo del diablo"" and Mr Holland's Opus.I liked the way it shows the harsh life of this forgotten ""layer"" of society, good for those who idealize ""all things European"" like I do. Yes, the scenery is beautiful. So is Marie Brunel (Violette, Pierre's mum), in a pivotal secondary role. The sexual tension is greatly resolved! Gerard Jugnot IS great as the self-effacing but brilliant school teacher. Rachin, the principal/ headmaster, is quite overdone and erratic, but I'm sure it's the story that sucks. He does very well with a stupid character. His final attack on Clement is well done, I guess it's the only moment I felt I wasn't watching a film for children.The boys are VERY well cast, all of them. From the soloist soprano (what a voice!) to the criminal ""Mondain"" (name! *like Dickens :) ), the curly one, the ""pedestal"", and ""Pepinot"", the cute dreamy one who longs for his parents. The countess is fine too.It has a lot to say about educators in harsh conditions. Things must be much worse now that then, but Clement would make a great child psychologist if he really were an unemployed teacher! This ""action/ reaction"" if of course a caricature of behaviourism. As such, it warns its most fervent practitioners I guess.It's a pity, this film could have been great, the topic is important for it to be treated like a (bad) Disney story. It even deals about child abuse in a great small dialogue in the beginning ""I expect everything bad about people HERE"" is the simple way the prefect/ guard Chabert sums it up. Who also ends up being charmed by Clement, who seems to have a way with everybody.Kim Anehall in Amazon writes greatly about how sometimes education receives the ""rejects"" from other professions, makes an intelligent analogy of Clement's ""rebellion"" to the way the French resistance worked, and describes very well the process it entails for him to win them over. Jeffrey E Ellis' Twain quote in Amazon is great, but could well be called ""spoilers"" too.Din't like this whole ""racconto"" and the fact the adult Pierre is a superstar musician. Found that particularly cheap, ""winners only"", very American in their worse sense. In he beginning Clement doesn't know how to ""stand"" in this fiery military-like regime, his body tells it all. Some jokes demand some knowledge of French history, like his reactions to a Vichy song when he ""auditions"" the boys, or the answer of one kid about Napoleon's death :). The best one belongs to him, of course, when speaking on hell left behind to Rachin. Also towards the same target ""I don't think you love many things"". Overall, forgettable fable.

"Bittersweet Tale of Hope, Teaching, and Bucking the System","Too many people are afraid to see foreign language films - and it's a pity more people didn't get a chance to see this in the theatre. It's a great movie for anyone who has ever been changed by a teacher's efforts, or frustrated by an unjust system.Set in post-World War II France it's about a teacher who finds himself posted at a school for troubled boys. Although the corporal punishment is harsh, the boys don't seem to have any respect for the severe headmaster...nor anyone else. It is in this environment that the gentle Clement Mathieu arrives and struggles to find a way to break through to the boys and bring humanity back to the wild gaggle of youth.The film is well made and feels old fashioned and more leisurely paced from a far less ""sped-up"" time.

La Cage Aux Rossignols .......... in colour !!!!,"I caught up with this one recently on DVD in Paris as I missed it when it came out and I was pleasantly surprised ! Of course it should be stated that it is just a remake of a 1940's film starring a very famous French actor called Noël-Noël, and called ""La Cage Aux Rossignols"". The principal actor in that film even had the same name as in Jugnot's film, Clément Mathieu. The DVD issued here has neither French subtitles for Deaf/Hard of hearing French nor foreign language subtitles to attract viewers from other countries .... it's indeed a very strange way to promote a film !!The subject matter has been dealt with before in other films so there is nothing new under the sun ..... that said, the film is very pleasant to watch and we become attached to each of the characters in their own way. Using the ""flashback"" technique, such as in Goodbye Mr Chips, Cinema Paradiso, The BRidges of Madison County and other such films plays on the viewer's heartstrings because at the beginning of the film, all we are about to see is over, finished, part of the (distant) past and we have the nostalgic privilege to re-live that past thanks to the magic of cinema .........The film was made in the Château de Ravel, situated in the Auvergne region of Central France, between Clermont Ferrand and Riom in the Puy-de-Dôme department. The Château de Ravel now has its own internet site which makes ample reference of cours to Les Choristes.I was glad to have this film on DVD and will be sure to watch it several times more. My only qualms were with the choice of musical numbers - indeed I didn't know any of them - and they may indeed have been composed just for the film. As to the name of the school ""Le Fond de l'Etang"" or the Depths of The Pond, I assume it was chosen to represente ""an out of the way"" or ""lowest of the low"" type school !!Sordid types of schools like these have been seen in other French films, in addition to La Cage aux Rossignols, there is ""Les Diaboliques"", ""Le Diable Au Corps"", and last but not least ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"" by Louis Malle.I am not really sure whether the film will have success on a world basis - there is nothing typically French about it - but it does make for good watching and many spectators will be able to relate to it. On the other hand, it doesn't really have the extra little something which makes it stand out above other films ..... we shall have to let ""nature"" take its course and see the end result.",,Anonymous,Music
Well worth watching,"I'm not a huge fan of subtitled films if I'm honest, but I heard good things about this one so gave it a go.I wasn't left feeling like I'd wasted my time by the end in any respect. The Chorus is a deeply thought provoking and moving film, that manages to appear quite simple on paper but profound in other ways.Not many subtitled films go on to have a wider appeal, but this one does because the central character manages to tap into our thoughts and in my case, remind me of teachers I had who were similar.It's not a popcorn movie, there are no explosions, not big iconic moments, but for a well constructed piece of film this is a good way to spend an evening.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A great family movie with a musical and elegant soul.,"This film takes place in the mid-twentieth century, in a French reformatory for children who are orphans or who have had legal problems. The story is quite cliché, but it's extremely effective for the film, and it works wonderfully: it's a teacher's flashback passage through that reformatory. He immediately sensed the climate of repression and anger experienced in the institution, and fueled by the brutal methods of the leadership. Disagreeing with this, he began to educate the children in his own way, eventually forming a small choir that helped at least some of the young people escape delinquency.The film is very good and one of those excellent French films that is lost due to the lack of millionaire publicity and greater interest in European cinema. It's a familiar and friendly film, with uplifting moral messages and great music. Music works not only as a language to express feelings and communicate, but also as a therapy for the accumulated anger and frustrations of that group of children.The film's cast is headed by Gérard Jugnot, an actor I didn't know yet, even though the face is familiar to me, and I really enjoyed seeing here. François Berléand gave life to the villain, the unfriendly and rude director of the institution, but he does a very good job and steals our attention whenever he shows up. The character lived at school with his wife and kids, but I felt this was a hook for a sub-plot that never came to anything concrete. Kad Merad and Jean-Paul Bonnaire also proved to be good additions to the cast.Technically, the film is a gem of quality at a low price. Without the spectacularity and resources of the American film industry, this film offers us exquisite cinematography, with excellent colors and good camera work, an intelligent use of light and shadow, and magnificent and well-chosen sets. But it is in the soundtrack and in the use of children's voices that the film really acquires magic, especially for classical music lovers, as is my case. A note of praise also for the use of period props and costumes, which help the film to fit in well with the period portrayed.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Greatly stirring foreign film,"Its really interesting watching film that were foreign. You don't have to understand their language at all, provided by subtitles. However what you would truly appreciate with most of them is their earthly brilliant stories you would never expect to see. Les Choristes, simply ""The Choir"" brought me interest and joy in seeing another wonderful film of all times. Truthfully the film didn't get too tight in improving the mood of the story. The atmosphere, the characters, the background musics, effects and the rest of the film were carefully made presentable and good. The characters are also justly comprehensible. Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot) had incredibly brought into stage a character the situation deems impossible to materialize. He became the teacher he had to be in the story and his character is firm enough to portray it till the end. Rachin (Francois Berleand), the principal (His face is really familiar) also had the character, which I describe as swift, sharp and annoying but you would consider interesting as well. I got the moment when I find his character shifting, but got failed to expect he would change because it is in his nature of being so stone-hearted. You would hate or despise him but nevertheless that's what got you into hating his character, his capability to capture our attention is one truly appreciable aspect he had. There were also other characters you deem fit with their roles, good and reasonable such as Chabert (Kad Merad), Monsieur Langlois (Philip Du Janerand), La Pere Maxence (Jean-Paul Bonnaire), Violette Morhange (Marie Bunel), and of course the rest of the children. I didn't solely love the story, the beauty of the atmosphere and the background music also made chills and goosebumps for me. Wonderfully this foreign film is truly worth cherishing. I worth of a deal watching more than once or twice.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Nice little gem of a movie,"Somber but entertaining ""Les Choristes"" is the perfect European product for the American market, and I hope it will be distributed here in the US as well. It is just straightforward enough, the Good and the Bad wearing their correct color-coded hats. But even if not an art movie, Les Choristes' uplifting story of a teacher arriving at a remote reform school in Auvergne is moving and engaging.The new teacher, taken aback by the rigid disciplinary measures implemented by the director, finds a different way to engage the kids and keep them out of trouble. As it is easy to imagine from the title, the device is the creation of a successful chorale to harvest the undiscovered musical qualities of the troubled youths. Gerard Junot, usually confined to comedy roles is surprisingly very effective in the role of Clément Mathieu, and the Lyon chorale does an excellent job with the soundtrack.",,Anonymous,Music
A moving film that puts a smile on your face.,"""The Chorus"" takes place in post-war France as boys were placed in boarding schools that were places of both repression and refuge. What I liked most about this film was Clement Mathieu, a failed musician who takes a job as supervisor in the prison-like school, and his attitude towards a group of unfortunate and misunderstood young boys. He treated them with the utmost respect and believed that each one possessed a special gift or talent they could show the world. Two ideas I found interesting were the importance of the children's needs of fathers in their lives is explored in this film. This idea can be easily accepted because of how quickly the children began to have respect for their instructor. His kindness toward the children is returned to him by the students, as they respond to the way he teaches music to motivate and interest them. The children's affection was demonstrated after their instructor was fired by tossing goodbye letters out of the window as he walked away from the school. Another interesting idea was how the colors in the film set the mood for the audience. For example, to allow the feeling of transformation within the school, the color goes from grays, to bold and bright colors towards the end. Not only does this type of detail help set the mood, but also allows the audience to feel as if they were one of students in the film.A couple of things that were particularly French were the food that the children were served, and the principle's (Rachin) attitude of sincerity and outspokenness. The music, which was created by the film director, gives the film the right tone. It has such a sweetness to it that it disarms us and gets us into the right mood for enjoying it even more. The acting was very outstanding, simple, and comical at times, especially from Clement. The children were very sweet, especially the very little Pepinot.The director, Christophe Barratier, began his career as a classical guitarist, winning several international competitions. In 1991 he joined Galatee Films, where he was an associate producer on several movies, including ""Winged Migration (2001). He then directed his first short, Les Tombales (2002). He next wrote, directed and composed the music for his first film ""The Chorus"" (2005). This movie won the Crystal Heart Award at the Heartland Film Festival and has been nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Foreign Language Film at the BAFTA Awards.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Wonderful and very watchable film about a teacher attempting to bring his own ideas and methods to a worn out establishment.,"From France comes a Christophe Barratier film named Les Choristes; or 'The Choir' as well as 'The Chorus' as it has been transcribed for British and American audiences, it would seem. The film is an uplifting tale, a realistic look at several pretty desperate situations for all parties involved, in a French boarding school a few years after The Second World War. The film looks at the struggles in life for several people of varying ages and roles, be they headmaster attempting to run the school; a male teacher whom arrives and is thus unacquainted and initially nervous before he attempts to bring his own ideas to the curriculum as well as several children themselves, all of whom are varying in their temperament and attitudes The Choir manages to spread its focus around these parties but uses the character of Clément Mathieu (Jugnot) as a central focus or viewpoint as the events and world around him unfolds. The film is, theoretically, one long flashback induced by an elderly man in the present day named Pépinot who went to said school with Pierre Morhange, someone who has since become a conductor of quite some considerable note. The story is unfolded through Mathieu's journal, something Pépinot has come into possession with.It would seem a lot of people complain about the giving away of Morhange being this world famous conductor, quite literally, in the very first few minutes. The idea is, following on from where Mathieu brings musical classes to everyone at the school's attention, we know that he must've done enough to inspire a very young boy to go on and become the conductor he is. I don't think it acts as too much of a bad thing and I think that, once the entering of the man's journal and the flashback proceeds, a different lead has taken the mantle and the film is, essentially, more of a study of one man and his quest to get this choir class set up and how he will overcome diversity as well as the problems he encounters. I will point at Carlito's Way (or most any other neo-noir in which the anti-hero should or would usually 'get' his comeuppance for living the life he did) which shows the lead of that film shot at point blank range in the first thirty seconds or so. What follows is a flashback; a tale about the tribulations and actual journey of how one gets to that point.On this basis, The Choir worked for me. I found Mathieu's story riveting and never overly sentimental or melodramatic as he just tried to inspire, educate and generally do what he wanted to do in the hope others may find it equally as fascinating and/or enjoyable. I am not a teacher myself but is this not what every teacher of any subject at any level just generally tries to do? When Mathieu initially arrives, the film balances its tone of light comedy and effective drama while establishing the sort of character Mathieu is and what lies ahead. There is a scene where a child is guilty of whatever offence and since no one knows who did it, Mathieu must pick a boy at random to be punished as he does not know any of them. He is reluctant but must go through with the situation; regretful when he sees the seemingly harmless boy he's selected for punishment and later apologetic. The school means business, the children can sometimes step out of line but Mathieu will not be moved or change his ways for either.Initially, the children are something to fear. Their shouts and running echoes eerily through the corridors and the nasty results of a practical joke still remain on one member of staff thus preparing our lead for what awaits him but little do any of them know at the time of what changes will occur once initial contact is made. As a character, Mathieu is in a natural position of control as a teacher over the children but is more understanding as a super-egotistical element of the school, offering to introduce his own classes complete with content against the wishes of other staff. He himself answers to the headmaster named Rachin (Berléand), an individual who believes, and consequently has everyone else believe, that 'action, reaction' is the best form of education; a sort of 'solve violence with violence' ideation so that if they step out of line, you give them a good smack and hope they don't do it again.But what Mathieu sees is that they need something to exercise their minds; a common interest he can perhaps implant within them that brings them all together and, somehow, enables everyone to just have something in common with everyone else  that thing is singing. It breeds a common ground between teacher and pupil, something everyone can do in tandem and at once. Despite some snotty reactions, The Choir is worth the time for anyone searching out an engaging film that looks at triumph over incorrect beliefs as an individual tries to bring their own ideas to the plate and construct interests set at a time in which the very nation of France was in a state of disorientation and rebuilding themselves.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the Most Powerful Films on the Importance of Music.,"'Les Chorsites' - though the theme or the concept is not completely fresh, the character depth, incredible acting and a heart-wrenchingly beautiful score makes it one of the most powerful films on the importance of music. Like critic Richard Roeper says, ""This film really isn't about surprising us. It's about hitting all the right notes with grace and warmth."" Music and Sports are the backbone of a society. Music not only teaches discipline, teamwork and timing, but it can actually affect and mould people's lives.I'm the kind of person who, upon hearing a brilliant piece of music, gets so overwhelmed that my eyes well up. And this film manages to do it on more than one occasion.People, and especially kids, need music in their lives; the world is a much beautiful place with music around.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Simple Appeal To The Heart: Kindness Can Be A Good Thing,"So many professional reviews of this film grudgingly admit they were moved by it, as if it's a sin to dislike a well-made movie that moves one emotionally, as if it is always a bad thing to appeal to the better emotions, to the heart instead of the head. ""The real index of civilization,"" said novelist De Berniere,""is when people are kinder than they need to be."" In an age of abrasive political commentators who have forgotten about compromise and genuine understanding, it's a joy to encounter a film about kindness and concern, a film where a firm but concerned teacher makes a selfless difference in many lives. That's what this charming and occasionally upsetting film is about, as French legend Gerard Jugnot portrays a man who brings music and discipline to a group of underprivileged students. Yes, it's an old story, and yes, it still works.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

However, all of the boys respond to music, and their lives are changed because of the efforts of the new teacher.

What it's really about,"This movie isn't really about the love the teacher has for his students. This movie is really about society, but mostly about abuse of authority. Technically a teacher or principal should love kids to be able to do their job. In the movie the results of this abuse are apparent specially when the school burns down, the name of the orphanage is also a dead give away for the theme of this movie. It is quite obvious that the principal is getting his revenge on society by channeling his anger through the kids. The teacher I think is trying to break the vicious circle of this abuse by giving the students confidence, trust, hope and dreams saving them on numerous occasions from the abuse and allowing them to open up.I found it was an excellent movie that had some very profound impact on me having lived something similar in college.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

learn the best way possible,"Over the last few years I've been making an effort to see a number of movies from the 21st century that I hadn't managed to see earlier.

One might see this as simply another teacher-helps-troubled-youths movie, but Barratier knows how to create a more complex story than that. He makes sure to establish character development with both the boys and the teacher. I'd go so far as to call this one of the deepest movies about education that I've ever seen.

"A light, simple but a very intelligent and emotional film","When you look back at typically American films, with big budgets and heavy action scenes to stun and maximise viewing pleasure...they so very often fail. Recently i have been getting into foreign language films from France(Amelie), Italy(Cinema Paradiso) and Korea(Oldboy)and all of them have a lower budget and are less successful financially than your average Bruce Willis shoot'em'up. All the films i have encountered have had higher ratings and in some cases cult followings! What I'm saying is, these films obviously entertain (one of the soul purposes for films) so what is the purpose of the big budget pop corn movie is people are giving these independent and foreign language films a chance and are ....actually enjoying them!'The Chorus' is a perfect example of this. It may not be the best film for depth and getting your teeth into and analysing but it does deeply entertain, it's an emotional experience for any audience. The acting is superb, very simple, almost slapstick comedy at times, comical timing is excellent by the supervisor (Gérard Jugnot), the performances of the children are brilliant but the only one who let them was the main boy at times. Well filmed with very appetising visual colours when you go on this journey of transformation of the school, the colour goes from depressing greys, to lively bold colours. The music is light but effective, a bit like the film. A little on the short side also! And all in all it is a brilliant little chapter in French cinema, which I have only just touched the surface of.Highly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
One of 2004's Very Best,"This, potentially sad, French import, turned out to be one of the most joyous celebrations of life to hit cinema in a while. Set in Fond de l'Etang, a dreary boarding school for troubled boys in 1949 France a sense of hopeless claustrophobia pervades the air. Enter Clement Mathieu, (an absolutely remarkable performance by Gérard Jugnot that had me literally cheering) the school's new Prefect, a lonely, middle aged failed musician who narrates the story through his journal, and life will never be the same. An unlikely Mary Poppins, his effect on the students is life changing as he fights for less punishments and more socially rehabilitative activities for the ruffians in his charge. Eventually, he forms these troubled kids into ""The Chorus"" and the sound of beautiful music brightens the dank halls of Fond de l'Etang, changing the place forever.Inspired by his students, Mathieu's own rehabilitation - a restoration to the world of music, an occurrence of which he never dreamt - is as inspirational as any other aspect of this beautiful tale. He reaches into his soul and begins composing new music. In his journal he writes of how the boys may not understand the depth of what's occurring, but ""inspired by them, I compose, each day, for them."" There is a sense of realism to ""The Chorus"" which shows not all of these misfits can be saved, and deception, hostility and disrespect, though seemingly diminished, never completely disappear. A potentially down beat ending reinforces that reality, but does not diminish one once of the sense of amazing joy this movie leaves you with. My highest and heartiest recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Boys who motivate the emotions and pluck the heartstrings of sympathy and empathy,"I have seen the film in three distinctly different ways. The first two times were in Germany, where I first viewed it in French, which I do not understand very well, and then in German, which I understand a little bit better. The DVD I purchased did not feature subtitles, so all I could avail myself of was choice of language. This gave me an unusual opportunity to see what the film is able to convey without its dialog. I have since obtained an American copy, and watched the film in French with English subtitles. I was deeply moved. The music alone makes the film precious. The contrasting character of kindly adults (Clément Mathieu), unkind and uncaring adults (Rachin), good-intentioned adults (La Comtesse) and adults as victims (the older man who is injured by Le Querrec's prank), is well thought out and well brought out. Then there are the children, whose lifestyle and hopes and dreams are well conveyed in the music which Monsieur Mathieu teaches them to sing. It seems that all of the music was written by a 20th century French composer, with the exception of the Baroque composition, La Nuit, of Jean Philippe Rameau. I've read criticism that the boys seem to learn to sing overnight, but would people really like to see twenty minutes worth of really bad singing so that we can hear them going from bad to good? Each time I see the film it brings up a wellspring of emotion in me, with intense feelings of joy and sadness. I feel sorry for anyone who does not feel great emotion from viewing this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

I recommend every teacher to watch this story, and I know music, especially choral music, changes the singer, and changes the audience. It is a sad movie, to see no change in the heart of Mondain, of Rachin, and a failed hope of marrying Violette. It was not meant to be. I watched it three times already, and although I do not know French (my German wife does)I listened intently as I read the captioning and see many similarities with English which is really an amalgam of French, Anglo-Saxon, Latin, Celtic/Gaelic, and a little of all the languages of the world. This movie is purely cultural, that is, builds appreciation for the highest form of human development. From this movie, Pepinot finally meets his father on Saturday on the bus.

"Beautiful, heartwarming","This film is a rarity on several counts. First, a French film that doesn't leave one depressed, that is rare enough. Second, a sentimental and touching film that doesn't descend into mawkishness or maudlin territory. And third, a simple and predictable plot that still holds your attention because of the charm of the characters.The story is set in post-WW 2 France, with destitute and/or orphaned boys in a harshly run boarding school. There's the usual sadistic headmaster, but the other teachers are far more human. (I wish we had seen more of these teachers, they would have added a great other dimension, and the movie is short enough.) The new ""prefect"" (teaches the kids but also chaperones them in their sleeping quarters) earns the trust and respect of these otherwise troublesome urchins by showing kindness. A musician himself, he finds that he can give them a positive outlet for their energies by forming a choir, at the same time finding an avenue for performing his own compositions.While simple and not very original, the pleasure of this movie is in the execution. The prefect and the various other characters are quite real and multi-dimensional; the bad ones have good qualities, and vice-versa as well. You really sense the despair of being imprisoned in that school for months and years, and the sense of futility which overcomes the staff. The music is haunting and beautiful, including the score and also the choral pieces practiced/performed by the boys.The ending is mostly satisfying, though not all the threads are tied up in the way one expects. The retrospective way of telling the story also adds some interest and poignancy, when you realize who those people were in the first opening scenes.Very strongly recommended and, except for a few vulgarities (which are probably a little less hard-edged in the English subtitles), an excellent family film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Best film ever made !,I didn't really know what to expect from this type of film. This film invites you into a world of a European treasure of vocal art and compassion. Besides living with the chorus in the old word European style of beauty. The voices of angles are in this! You will feel all of what hearts are for and what love really does. Pulling you into the mix of choir fun and foibles. The scenery so actual you will feel as if you can smell the fruit of the trees. Feel the earth and the woolly sweaters of the boys racing past you. I wanted to take them all home with that teacher as well! The miracles that come forth; are lived with you in it! A rare invitation to have! It is the most incredible ever! Tis by far and away not to be a missed invite!,10.0,Anonymous,Music
a movie for people who love sweet warm movies!,"A teacher who, through firmness, kindness, and understanding mostly kindness and understandingtames the savage hearts of his or her pupils.In addition to compassion brings music into the lives of his students. a teacher who transforms the lives of his students. Well at face value it sounds like a schmaltzy usual movie doesn't it? Well believe me I don't like predictable movies but this one makes you feel different and it is a really sweet movie.Gérard Jugnot's performance is really fine. His role as a teacher who has a message like ""LOVELESSNESS IS THE DISEASE, SINGING IS THE CURE"" is a finely-crafted one! And don't forget the soundtracks! After ""Garden State"" those songs were the best I have listened! I am pretty surprised that not so many people voted for the movie though it got an Oscar nomination. It is a movie for people who love sweet warm movies!",,Anonymous,Music
Good film,"The film clarifies good discipline of education system. No rude! No beat! It is only tolerant and good intention so, I like this film. Actually, I watched this film by chance because I wanted to watch Genesis. However, Genesis stopped the play when I was going to the cinema so, I didn't watch it. I think generally the European films are better than American films because European film have more feelings also, artists and actors don't consider the money. The new generation American films have more visual effect but their purpose of money so, their films are became bad. However, this film's aim is making art. In order words, this film is typical European film. I think everybody should go to this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"A ""man behind the man"" tribute to those quiet souls who push others to greatness","I saw this film at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Les Choristes is an unabashedly sentimental film that reminded me very much of Italian films Ciao Professore! and especially Cinema Paradiso. It tells the story of a failed musician named Clement Mathieu who finds himself taking a job in desperation as the supervisor of a reform school in 1949. The school is run by an authoritarian tyrant and the students are a bunch of delinquents who taunt him immediately with shouts of ""Baldie!"" and ""Bullet Head!"". Mathieu decides to begin a choir as a sort of project to help with discipline and soon has the respect of the students. He also discovers a boy with a remarkable voice and does his best to encourage this gift while harbouring a crush on the boy's mother. This is not totally original stuff, but the story is told well and the performances are strong, most especially by Gérard Jugnot as the rumpled and lonely Mathieu. The resemblances to Cinema Paradiso are quite strong. Both films use a flashback structure. In Cinema Paradiso, a famous film director is called home to his village to attend the funeral of his old mentor, the projectionist at the local cinema. In Les Choristes, it's a famous orchestra conductor, called home to bury his mother, but the event triggers a visit from an old school chum who unfolds the tale of their music teacher Mathieu. The film is a ""man behind the man"" tribute to those quiet souls who push others to greatness while often not feeling very successful in their own lives. As someone who studied to be a teacher, I love this kind of story, even if it is not always fashionable in ""serious"" cinema circles. The emotions are real and are helped tremendously by a fabulous musical score and beautiful choral pieces.The director was proud to be presenting the film in Toronto after its huge success in France, where it sold eight million tickets and a million copies of its soundtrack CD. We were also treated to a performance after the screening of two of the songs from the film by another boy's choir, and the standing ovation was almost inevitable.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Gérard Jugnot has really grown into a first-rate actor,"After wonderful movies and documentaries such as Himalaya, Microcosmos, and Winged Migration, Jacques Perrin scores again with a movie that will be appealing to a wide audience. I saw it in France, but I think that it will be pleasing to the U.S. public too. As Neal commented earlier, the storyline is reminiscent of Mr Holland's Opus, but I think it is closer in sensibility to another movie where Gérard Jugnot held the starring role, Monsieur Batignole. Indeed, Jugnot, who played supporting roles earlier in his career, mainly in slapstick comedies, has now joined the ranks of actors, the likes of Lino Ventura, Jean Gabin, Jean-Louis Trintignant, etc.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The museum was closed for renovations...thankfully,"I had seen advertising for this movie, but as cinema-going is expensive here in France (my opinion), I had put it off.  Today, after a failed attempt to visit a museum, I stumbled upon it at Pathé on my way home.Right from the start, I was hoping for a great movie.  Having really appreciated Richard Dreyfuss in ""Mr. Holland's Opus"", I had had a standard already.  With a similar storyline, that of enriching the lives of children through the wonders of music, ""Les Choristes"" did not fall short of my expectations.  Gérard Jugnot's performance is top notch.  Anyone who liked ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" will find parallels in this movie.  A real treasure for anyone who sings in a choir already, and also for those who enjoy choral music in general.  I give it an 8/10, having brightened up an otherwise dreadful day.Neal",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Terrrific,"Even more terrific that I was so reluctant to watch this film. I thought it was made for sissies, but I was so wrong, I am so ashamed to have felt this about that movie. It is a real poignant, gripping movie, some kind of LES HAUT MURS atmosphere in a less gritty mode, less tough, but the overall spirit is here. I was so surprised by this amazing little drama, so refreshing, so engrossing. The characters symphony is absolutely stunning, it squeezes your heart, your guts. The director never gave us better since this genius piece of work, piece of art. And Gerard Jugnot has never been better too.",,Anonymous,Music
"Great picture, that shows that there must be some humanistic topics that always deliver valuable story lines .","Great picture , that shows that there must be some humanistic topics that always deliver valuable story-lines .The cast is marvelous and the touching performance of all the kids seems to proof the validity of those topics .The camera-work is excellent as well as costumes , make-up and the overall design and brings you back to a decade that in other films would have been spoiled with the usual cliché.The music itself gives us a slight hint to what it is like when there are no electronic instruments around us , a hint to the hidden abilities of human voices Hopefully the film will make its way to its audience .",,Anonymous,Music
I saw this in our lady of sion,"Personally I think that it was prett good, but however I did not like the fact that I had to redo my test. So that was a big pain in the ass. Overall for a french film and I am half South Africa it was pretty good.",,Anonymous,Music
