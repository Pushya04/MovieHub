"Save the Last Dirty Dancing, but overall a treat","While several portions of this movie were textbook cliché, I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. Usually I don't bother with mainstream, commercial movies that are so obviously and unabashedly manufactured to sell to a teenage audience, but I had seen Channing Tatum in She's the Man (another movie that I was hesitant to see, but didn't regret it afterward), and thought he was absolutely gorgeous! Step Up would not have been as good as it was without him. He made even some of the more awkward lines of the script sound original and I really enjoyed watching him bust a move. Several parts were genuinely amusing and heart-warming despite the well-worn story of a bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks who falls in love with the uptight rich dancer. Overall, it was pure fluffy entertainment, like Save the Last Dirty Dancing. Just don't go in expecting much or analyze it too deeply and you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Tatum's charisma carries the film and lets us forgive its many flaws,"""I'm fighting, for something that's real for the first time in my life!""When Anne Fletcher made her directorial debut way back in 2006 no one imagined that this small budget film with a relatively unknown cast would end up grossing over 100 million in the US and inspiring a franchise that currently stands at five movies. It wasn't received warmly by the critics due to its cliché storyline and corny dialogues, but audiences dug it. I never was interested in the franchise and this was my first time actually sitting down and watching one. The main reason was because I knew this was Channing Tatum's break out role. He had done a couple of movies before with smaller roles, but this was the first time he was given a lead role. Tatum has delivered some strong roles recently (Foxcatcher being his most impressive) so I wanted to go back and revisit some of his earlier work. I was surprised I actually ended up enjoying this film as much as I did and I think it is largely due to Tatum's charisma. He didn't deliver a great performance, but he definitely carried the film with his charm making it enjoyable. The dancing was also pretty solid although I am not much of an expert in that area. The main problems with Step Up revolve around the clichéd screenplay and dull subplots that almost derailed the film completely, but the charisma from Tatum and his excellent chemistry with Jenna Dewan make this an entertaining viewing experience. It's been 9 years since Tatum and Dewan met on set for this movie and they are still together in real life. The chemistry was really there.Step Up is one of those films that you know is formulaic, unoriginal, and without any great technical achievements, but you still find it enjoyable due to the charismatic lead performances. You could file Step Up under the romance/dance genre along with other films as Bring it On, Save the Last Dance, and Honey. The screenplays are perhaps the weakest thing about these films, but you still can find them enjoyable when the lead characters deliver charismatic performances and know how to dance. That is the case with Channing Tatum who plays a troubled young teen who lives with his foster parents and spends a lot of time in the streets. One night out with his friends he ends up vandalizing an arts school and gets caught. He is ordered to do 200 hours of community service as payment for the damages he caused. At the school he meets a young student from a wealthy family played by Jenna Dewan who dreams of becoming a dancer. When her dancing partner gets injured, he offers to help, and the plot evolves from there.The story works best when it focuses on the two lead characters rehearsing and dancing together, but when the film shifts its focus on other subplots revolving around their friends the story losses some of its appeal. There is unnecessary conflict introduced in the film that is resolved rather easily and in a predictable way. There is also a tragic scene that takes place near the end of the film that felt out of place (the melodrama is poorly handled by the screenwriters). However, the final dance scene is one of the best in the movie so it does end in a positive note. Despite its predictable storyline and formulaic premise, Step Up is still an enjoyable film. Not good enough however to get me interested in the sequels.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Love the dance (and music), forget the story","You've seen it all  feel-good story of deprived, delinquent kid finding the meaning of life, dedicated effort culminating in an upbeat dance finale, rich-girl-poor-guy routine, and a whole bunch of familiar situations. But, if the dance and music are good, you'll tend to forget the improbable, unlikely, illogical, contrived story and plot. Given the lame script, top choreographer Anne Fletcher's first crack at directing didn't come off too badly, partly because of the wise use of very short scenes. As to the dance routines, with her credentials, you wouldn't expect anything less than good, and the movie does deliver in that department. The stimulating fusion of hip hop and ballet is well synchronized with fusion in the music. While the attention would obviously be on the showcase number that the protagonists are developing, I also like one particular scene at a gig, when the two sidekicks sing on stage while the two leads do their thing on the dance floor. This scene has the beauty of exciting spontaneity not seen elsewhere in the movie.",,Anonymous,Music
"Definitely not a step down, but not a huge step up either","The movie has the cliché's all over it. It is a tried and true formula of a down and out urban kid meeting up with the privileged kid and each learning something from the other. There is awkwardness in the beginning and the story hurdles are conveniently resolved quickly. But, you know, this still is one fun movie. The music is infectious and the leads are both good looking, likable and relate able.The store is one that we have seen before, but there is no real harm done here. It is a movie that can actually be shown to church youth groups without fear of having to edit out swear words or nude scenes. In fact, the film for the most part is free of all that and yet still remains entertaining! Imagine that.As my summary states; this is hardly a step down, it definitely isn't a ""step up"", but you know, it does a great side step that will entertain you enough not to mind the cost of a matinée ticket. It isn't an after 6pm movie by no means, but still, worth at least one glance in the theater.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Good to see when you're bored,"The story of Step Up is simple and predictable. I just like one particular scene when the leading actor and actress dance over the harbor. Their dancing with the beautiful sunset and the sultry music, is truly impressive. If you like this movie, you may like Center Stage: Turn it Up too. There are resemblances between them. Overall, they are the kind of movies that are good to see when you're bored on a lazy day.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Eminem Meets Fame,"In looking over the reviews of Step Up I saw comparisons to Flashdance, Save the Last Dance for Me, and a few others. The pithy review that Step Up got in my hometown free paper Art Voice remarked that the film had some nerve to advertise it had an original screenplay. Personally I like to think of it as Eminem meets Fame. The only thing missing was Debbie Allen doing the choreography.Lead Channing Tatum in this film is a kind of an Eminem light. He's a kid being raised in a foster home in Baltimore and he's been busted for breaking in and trashing the Maryland School of Arts. As punishment he gets to do janitorial service at that same school.Channing's got some moves though and he hooks up with a girl from the right side of the tracks, Jenna Dewan, who needs a rehearsal partner.If you've seen all the films mentioned above you've got a pretty good idea what follows. If the film is hardly original, it doesn't mean that it's bad. Both the leads have some real moves on the dance floor and as Tatum regrettably remarked, he found out that dancing can indeed be like rocket science.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Review,"Funny jokes. Handsome actors. Pretty actresses. A good soundtrack. Add dancing, and voilà, another hit teen movie full of romance, tragedy, and drama. Although predictable, Sep Up is a beautifully choreographed movie with an upbeat soundtrack that brings even more fun to the theater.Tyler (Channing Tatum) is not a bad kid. No, he just lives in a foster home in the poor, tough section of the city of Baltimore. Tyler becomes caught up in a bad situation and must complete 200 hours of community service at the scene of the crime, The Maryland School of the Arts. During his time washing windows and cleaning clarinets, Tyler notices Nora. Nora Clark (Jenna Diwam), an accomplished dance from the school, is practicing for her senior showcase. A problem arises when her dance partner breaks his leg and cannot practice with her anymore. Tyler, eyeing up his chance to talk with Nora and not wanting to see his opportunity go out the window he is washing, puts on his shining armor and mounts his white horse. When Nora rejects his proposal to help her at practice, Tyler is hurt (who wouldn't want to leap blindly into the arms of the kid who trashed you school's stage, your temple?). Finally, after realizing that her situation called for desperate measures, and after spying on Tyler and seeing him dance hip-hop outside the school with his friends, Nora decides to employ his help. The romance that sparks between Tyler and Nora during the long hours of practice after school is predictable and stale. However, the amazing dancing and upbeat music makes a predictable ending acceptable.When I sat down to watch this movie, I was prepared for another boring plot and was surprised by the creativeness and genius in the opening scene. The scene alternates between a hip-hop/rap beat and a slower, more classical piece. Both shots include dancers performing at their best. The hip-hop dancers attend a crowded, dark party. They wear sharp, high-heels. In contrast to this picture, ballerinas dance in an open, bright studio with ballet slippers on their feet. This could symbolize the double life Tyler leads. During the day he is a disciplined ballet dancer, but morphs into a car-stealing Mr. Hyde at night. The director's (Anne Flethcer) alternating shots show how living in the city can be sharp like the woman's heel, and how Tyler and his best friend Mac (Damaine Radcliff) think that the rich kids who attend the school (actually most attend on grants or scholarships) lead a softer, easier life, like that of a ballet slipper. Cultural differences may seem to separate these people, but as we learn, forgiveness and love know no boundaries.We root for Tyler and Nora throughout the entire movie. The scenes in which Tyler and Nora dance together are vibrant and fun, inviting the audience to jump out of their seats and join in; there aren't any rules.Although the plot was predictable and the acting regular, Step Up achieved its main propose: to entertain me for an hour and a half. If you are a dancer, musician, underdog, or someone who wants to hear a good story about ""stepping up"" to the world, Step Up is a film made for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
step up was GOOD.,"people keep talking about how awful ""step up"" was, or how it was such a waste of money. but now here are my two cents. it was, in fact, a good movie. the dancing was FABULOUS, and even though the acting could have improved, this movie was nothing short of amazing. the music was catchy and hot, and there was just enough romance in it to make it cute but not gross or sleazy. it had literally EVERYTHING you could ask for in a movie: romance, drama, comedy, and it was even slightly scary at some parts, too. Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan did a great job. their dancing, along with everyone else's, was phenomenal. when i left the movie, i was actually inspired to be a dancer (even though i never will be.) the main reason people are turning down this movie is because of the acting. sure, the acting could have been better, but this movie was focusing on the DANCING. obviously you have to be a good actor to be in a movie, but the dancing was the main focus of this film. and i personally think the dancing was great. i couldn't ask for it to be better. this movie is definitely worth seeing, whether you're into hip-hop or not.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good Dancing, ignore the plot","Going into the movie with the right expectations, I somewhat liked this movie. Like most reviewers who have seen this movie, I fully agree that the plot was razor thin, clichéd, and I could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie. But, the dancing sequences were VERY well done, and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both which I enjoy watching). The music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the ""drama"" scenes more bearable. The leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were OK as actors, but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing.All in all, a movie worth watching if you like to watch good dance sequences, and this movie is MUCH MUCH MUCH better than ""You Got Served"" in terms of the plot and drama. Then again, that doesn't say much, does it? =P",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Step Up does justice to its genre by not pulling any stops in delivering a truly enjoyable movie,"Choreographer and now director Anne Fletcher hits the mother lode with this gem of a dance flick! Having painfully seen similar dance-themed teen movies in the past (Take the Lead, Save the Last Dance, etc.), Step Up does justice to its genre by not pulling any stops in delivering a truly enjoyable movie. Hindi nagtipid sa pasikat.Unlike similar movies where the audience agonizingly waits through scene after scene of boredom for a grand dance finale (which usually fails to enthrall anyway), Step Up treats the audience to several impressive, memorable sequences thoughtfully scattered throughout the movie. Finally, we are entertained by a dance flick where the leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) are both beautiful to watch, have good chemistry (enough to sustain the kilig factor) and can really deliver the moves.Dewan is a superb dancer; she has a fabulously fit body, not the anorexic ballerina type, and she dons her outfits exceptionally well for someone who's only 5'3"". It was also amazing to watch such a tall, gorgeous man like Tatum move the way he does (it must help that the boy knows his Kung Fu!). His deadpan facial expression makes his line deliveries unexpectedly funny. The supporting cast also amply sustains the rest of the story. Step Up churns out enough high points that you pardon its hiccuppy subplots and scene-stealing extras.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
i've seen better dancing movies,"The movie itself wasn't too bad it was just boring. There was no action, nothing big happens.I went to this movie for the break dancing because i thought i looked cool, but if you want to see a movie about dancing, You Got Served is better. Most of the same stuff happens, but You Got Served is more exciting.Personally, i think Step Up is more of a movie to rent for a night than to see in the theater.step up = chick flickbad things- 1. no action/boring 2. more of a chick flick 3. not that great dancinggood things- 1. good portrayal of modern life (lowerclass, upperclass 2. good story line",6.0,Anonymous,Music

"A product that does what the packaging says it does but doesn't innovate, excite or appear to have had much creative input into it apart from the final packaging","Tyler Gage is a white kid from the wrong side of the tracks. Helping his friends escape, Tyler is caught red handed smashing up a school of the arts and is sentenced to community service there. While doing janitorial work he sees the ballet students doing their routines and he himself is later observed by one of the students (Nora) doing his street moves with his friends. When Nora's partner goes out with an injury she turns to Tyler to help her, since he has basic skills. Both have their struggles with this working relationship but while Nora opens up Tyler to the possibilities through dance, he brings an unique urban feel to her routine – but as romance blossoms things become harder.I never bothered with this film when it came out but the rising star of Tatum made me step back and take a look at this. What I found was a film that struck me as being a mass produced product rather than being a film that someone created or that the makers really wanted to make. What I mean is that didn't seem to be much in the way of passion or inspiration behind it. The story is a predictable mishmash of other films and you can see so many things from Breakin' through to Save the Last Dance all in the mix here. It is definitely something that knows what it needs to do, does it and doesn't worry too much about making it special, different or anything like that. And so it treads the path you know it will from the first minute and as a story it never rings true so much as just meeting it with a shrug.In fairness though the dance routines are reasonably good and the soundtrack does give it an energy that helps it but both of these things are the type of things that will fade with time as other films supersede it. The cast do the basics as well. Tatum is good in so much as he manages to carry off a white urban caricature without looking ridiculous. In the normal terms he is not ""good"" but on these terms he does the job. Dewan is attractive but you never feel the heat between them and their relationship (working or romantic) never seems real. The rest of the cast are pretty much doing what one expects as well – and when even Six Feet Under's Griffiths or The Wire's Lovejoy is calling it in, it hardly seems fair to expect Mario to be doing much.Overall this is a product more than it is a film and as such it is one of those things that does what the packaging says it does but doesn't innovate, doesn't excite and doesn't appear to have had much creative input into it apart from the final packaging. It is a solid genre film for the viewers it was made for but it is unlikely to stand the test of time well at all or indeed have much appeal to those that want it to do more than tick boxes.",,Anonymous,Music
Step Up Was Good,"I am not a teenager but I love dance and dance music which is why I went to see this movie. I didn't expect it to be a really deep movie but I love to see dance like Take the Lead. Those who rated it bad must have been expecting either more or something different. This isn't Lord of the Rings or anything that requires analytic skills. It is a dance movie which has some plot to it. The actors aren't academy award winners but they're not bad either. The male start doesn't show a lot of emotion but guys like that (my son is that way too) don't show a lot of outward emotion. He shows compassion for his siblings and his friend. It was a typical story but it's a dance movie. They can't just put a bunch of dancing with no story line. That would be a musical or stage production, not a movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
great harmonization of two different worlds,"Music and choreography in 'Step Up' are one of the best in quality and in entertainment perspective. Not only the senior showcase piece at the ending, but choreography throughout the movie is also well coordinated such as 'Till the Dawn' in the club and 'Show Me the Money' in opening credits.What impresses me the most is that two genres come together to create synergy, so much better than when one stands alone. This perfect coexistence is not only in story but also in music and choreography. Rich girl and poor boy; classic and hip-hop; and ballet/jazz dance and street/freestyle dance. Great harmonization in music and choreography is significant because they resemble, symbolize, and signify the relationship between protagonists.I also want to compliment the chemistry between two actors while I also want to point out the story's resemblance with 'Save the Last Dance' and too many coincidences.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Wonderful and Delightful Surprise,"In Baltimore, the troublemaker and street dancer Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) lives with his foster parents in an Afro-American lower class neighborhood. His best friends are Mac Carter (Damaine Radcliff) and his little brother Skinny Carter (De'Shawn Washington) and they use to hang around together, going to parties and stealing cars. After being expelled of a party, the trio breaks in the Maryland School of Arts and commits vandalism, destroying the stage. Tyler is arrested and sentenced to 200 hours of community service in the school and Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths) assigns him to help the janitor cleaning the place. One afternoon, the ballet dancer Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan) sees Tyler dancing in the parking area and when her partner Andrew (Tim Lacatena) has a strain and Tyler offers to help her in the choreography, she accepts the offer; they rehearsal and become close to each other while Tyler becomes friend of the students Miles Darby (Mario) and Lucy Avila (Drew Sidora). When Andrew returns, Tyler that is known for quitting everything he starts gives up dancing and leaves Nora alone. After an incident, Tyler has to decide to follow his dream or return to his life of rebel loser.""Step Up"" was a wonderful and delightful surprise for me. The heartwarming romantic story shows a perfect chemistry between Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, supported by a magnificent cast and awesome songs and choreographies of dance. There are also drama and tragedy, funny moments and I recalled Alan Parker's ""Fame"" and ""Center Stage"" with the students following their dreams in an art school. The characters are nice, the actors and actresses are excellent and I have really loved this movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Ela Dança, Eu Danço"" (""She Dances, I Dance"")",8.0,Anonymous,Music

He gets caught and is sentenced to 200 hours of community service at the arts school. Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths) runs the school. Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan) loses his dance partner with a sprain ankle and she pairs up with Tyler to practice for her big dance.The story is cheesy and simplistic but it has some hokey charm to it. The acting is all about Channing Tatum. He's got the arrogant charm of the lead character. Jeanna Dewan has a bit of vulnerability but not quite as compelling.

"OK, that was silly","I wasn't really interested in seeing Step Up, but my friend just kept bugging and bugging me to see this film, especially since she is so in love with Channing Tatum, I tease her constantly about it saying how that's the only reason why she loved the movie. But she somehow convinced me that it was a movie worth seeing, that if I loved movies like Dirty Dancing, Take the Lead, and Save the Last Dance, that I should love Step Up, eh, what the heck? I guess every movie in some way has it's right to a view.Well, you know those movies I just mentioned up top? Dirty Dancing, Take the Lead, and Save the Last Dance? Well, put them in a blender with some gangsta love in it and that's what you have. Not to mention if you've seen those movies, well, frankly, you have seen Step Up. Because Channing is lower class with street smarts who just naturally feels the music while that snobby up class girl must follow step by step, how will they ever fall in love if they are so different? After all, this is their chance to ""step up"" to the passion, the mystery, and the lust of the dance!OK, that was a silly plot explanation, but like I said, as long as you've seen those movies I mentioned, or even if you just saw the plot, you get the movie. I don't understand how it actually has a 5.5 rating, I bet it's those Channing lovers! LOL! I'm kidding with you guys, but it's all good, I guess I just didn't get what others did with the passion, the mystery that is the dance!

following in others footsteps,"Step Up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break. The film is average in every way with little more for the viewer. A jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special. The acting was fine, but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story. None the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard. This is a class B+ film with moderate continuity errors and dialog mishaps. The scenery was good and the characters held true to life. It is worth the watch if you like that kind of film.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Great dancing & soundtrack... fun teen dance movie.,"Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan are hot hot hot. Absurdly pretty, and they can both dance. While a teen dance movie was not my #1 choice, it was a pretty enjoyable film. No big surprises, but it fulfilled what it set out to do with admirable skill and pace. The 'white-boy hood' character threads were well executed by the extremely handsome Tatum- as the 'White Hood Kid' can be a character that is very hard to swallow and easy to play terribly. While there is lots of dancing, there is not so much that the whole film feels like a support structure to display dancing, which would bore me to tears. Mario is interesting to watch and has good arcs. I have a crush on Rachel Griffiths so I'm biased there, but one of the few faults in the movie is her character evolves unrealistically... she develops into a place of compassion from one of hate without much to make that change. All and all, a surprisingly fun movie.",,Anonymous,Music
"unoriginal story, good dancing","This movie was OK. The music and dancing were pretty good. But the story was nothing new. I did like the 2 lead actors. They helped to make the film entertaining enough to watch. Both were hot. And I think Channing Tatum should be the next break out hot star. The final dance routine that combined ballot and hip hop was one of the better dances I've seen in a film. Tyler's friends were a little annoying since they kept trying to get him in trouble and acted like he was putting them off by trying to learn a dance routine. It took Mac's little brother dying for him to see living a life of a delinquent was no way to be. Very predictable. Also, the school's principle had to be about the most predictable character I've ever seen in a film.FINAL VERDICT: If you like hip hop and dancing, then you will find this entertaining enough to watch. Otherwise, skip it.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Regular fare, competently delivered","Step Up (three stars)Director Anne Fletcher Writers Duane Adler and Melissa Rosenberg Stars Jenna Dewan, Channing Tatum Certificate PG Running time 103 minutes Country USA Year 2006Nora is training to be a dancer at the fairly exclusive Maryland School of the Arts. Tyler is a rebel from the wrong side of the tracks doing community service at the school after getting caught breaking in and vandalising it for kicks. She is classically trained in ballet and contemporary dance. He can breakdance like there's no tomorrow and throw in body-popping and cool good looks (Tyler is played by ex-model Channing Tatum). She needs a dance partner and there's the usual storyline footsie of boy-gets-girl, breaks up with girl, aspires, is gonna dance, is not gonna dance, they make each other feel good in public together then kiss-kiss finale.This is the same formula used in every modern dance movie and Step Up has no surprises, but for an enjoyable slice of this type of cake it is no worse than average. It doesn't have the glossy editing/directing and punchy acting to make it stand out like a Fame, Dirty Dancing, or Flashdance, but it's fine on its own level, competent, and has some good dance sequences.From a dance point of view, classical ballet is very upright, geometrical, relatively emotionally unexpressive and danced in a precise manner. Breakdance, using different heights, opening and closing in fluid motion to express feeling, and working off the beat more like jazz, is a natural opposite. Mixing the two together gives an interesting and explosive combination. Nora finds that her dance routine is greatly enhanced by Tyler's style and gives him a crash course in ballet (which would be needed for posture and control).A good hip-hop soundtrack boosts these joining of opposites, adding violin to the funkier beats. A forgettable movie, but worth seeing by dance fans or teenagers after easy-viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

But one thing that i loved about the movie was the soundrack it featured some artists that not a lot of people know. Channings dancing was great. But I don't think his co-star fit with him I mean he was to gorgeous for her.

"STEP UP to a magical film of dance, diversity, rhythm and blues","What a wonderful surprise to find such a terrific film of dance and music in STEP UP and the actors/dancers were out of this world.

Step Up is not a good film,"Step Up was quite honestly painful to watch. The movie perhaps one of the most cliché and predictable and boring story lines i have ever seen (some awkward cross between Fame, Save the Last Dance, with an extra helping of teen angst and of course more cliché). Even some plot sequences seemed not to be plausible or were completely inconsequential to the story line. In addition, the performances by the actors were by all means not their best performances (aided by a particularly terse screenplay). To round out the picture, the directing and cinematography was at times quite distracting from film. Sure it was a dance movie, but if you want to see good dancing it would be well worth your time to watch for something else watch something else.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Precise,"Something funny about movies. Different genres carry different expectations. Dance movies for me prompt the lowest. I don't care how trite the story or incompetent the writing and acting.

AFter ""Tango"" and ""Red Shoes,"" I don't need more elaborate folding of the show within the show. But the dancing had better be good.And by that I mean it not only has to be good as dance, but it has to be cinematic. There are only three ways to accomplish that that I know. Oddly, though the director is a well known film choreographer, she seems to know none of them.The way you expect in a ghetto-meets-whitebread story is in the raw energy, the sheer power of unpracticed but expert physical expression. Not here. The whole thing is not only validated by a slick production number at the end, but we see all the practice of that same.No energy. No impulse. No life.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Music
"Good dance movie, but nothing fabulous","I was skeptical about seeing this movie, and thought it would be exactly like ""Save the Last Dance."" However, the plot is more original, and dance is a much more central part of it than in ""Save the Last Dance."" Channing Tatum (Tyler)'s performance is very good despite how hokey the movie got at some points, but Jenna Dewan (Nora) was slightly disappointing and even a little annoying at times. The dance scenes in the movie are phenomenal and very impressive, and I loved the chemistry between the two main characters, but the movie is incredibly corny in scripting and plot action. It's not worth a $9 ticket, but I saw ""Step Up"" for $6.50 and felt I got my money's worth.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"fantastic film, good acting, good music","i think this film was very good, i liked the music, the dancing, the different characters. people who say Channing Tatum cannot act, i think are wrong because he always plays parts in films where his character is like that. for example in shes the man, he was meant to be shy around girls and i thought he played this part well. i liked step up because, although it was predictable it was good. what dancing film isn't predictable? a lad and a lass end up dancing together, the lads usually a bad boy and the girl helps him 2 become good and everything, there all the same; save the last dance, take the lead, dirty dancing. i thought it was a great film, i never get sick of them at all!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Lots of energy, lots of spirit","Three young punks, one of them played by Channing Tatum, break into an art school and proceed to trash the place in the rebelliousness. Like these movie punks always do. Tatum's character gets caught and has to do community service at the school in order to pay for what he's done. But, while serving his time, he finds out that these rich artist kids might have something in common with him. Namely, the passion for dance.The plot is about as basic as they come, with Tatum's character having to help a young female student (Jenna Dewan), who has just lost a dancing partner to an ankle injury, and enlists Tatum's character to replace him. But the film has a lot of energy and good attitude that keep it going even when the plot should bore you to tears. Tatum and Dewan have great chemistry together, and tellingly married a couple of years later. The school is also a fun setting, with an atmosphere of its own and all the side characters show the passion they have for creating things, be it music or dancing or paintings.The film is also shot rather well. The sets look great, it has fantastic colours and all the various dance numbers are shot in a way that allow you to really feel the movement.Nothing much more to say, really. It's exactly what you'd expect from hearing the description, and for some people that can be a problem. Personally, I do like it after a fashion. It's not something I'd regret not having seen, but neither do I regret seeing it. It was a pleasant diversion.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
descent i wouldn't rave about it,this movie was quite good and entertaining but i was quite disappointed.this movies plot was kinda weak. I didn't like the idea and i thought that some parts of the movie were not needed. Channing tatum and jenna were good as there characters but they annoyed me. especially jenna she just kinda made me annoyed and channing was like to much of a wannabe street boy and you could tell he was acting that part and trying very hard. The dancing was very good though and that part i enjoyed.i wouldn't rave about this movie but i could watch it again and again just a bit disappointed weather is was over hyped or it just didn't meet my standards.,6.0,Anonymous,Music
Good movie for teens,"I enjoyed watching this movie with my four teens. I showed how teens can turn their life around no matter what type of situation that they are in. It also showed how different classes in society can come together and help one another. The inner city kids tend to get a bad wrap a lot of the time, and it was good to see some of them come out on top. It was also AWESOME to see how the music and art program in the middle of a busy town can help redirect a youth's focus. We need more schools of the arts in our cities. I wish that congress would grab a hold of this concept and stop cutting our education budget for our children. Because the children of our generation and the ones to come are the future, and by the looks of it we are going to be in trouble.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Step up,"I like to watch all the films related to singing and dancing, and this one is no exception. Let alone comment on the plot and the characterization. I like a few pieces of simple dance.

My thoughts..,"I think that Step Up was a really good movie, even though most of the things were predictable. Maybe i am a bit bias but, i think all dance movies are really good and entertaining to watch. For example, Honey, Take The Lead, Save The Last Dance.. they were really good, the concepts for all dance movies are practically all the same, with only a few adjustments to each one. Those people who rate it too low aren't just being fair enough, I'm pretty sure they have seen many dance movies, but if Step Up was their first dance movie they watched, then i'm pretty sure that they would give it a much higher rating than what it is getting now.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Hi I have seen the movie 3 times and like it,I like the movie and hope when it comes out on DVD that it has a thing in the DVD that teaches the dance steps in the last part of the movie I would like to learn the dancing that is in the movie I also think there should be a sequel showing the spring thing and graduation and if Tyler and Nora are lovers and still a couple have i said i like to learn the stuff that Tyler was doing. I would also like to have a house that they had a party in. i feel that they need to make movies about the different kinds of dancing. I also like the save the last dance movie but this movie was a bit different. I would also like to meet the people in person that played Tyler and Nora and Myles.,7.0,Anonymous,Music
So little dancing in this film!,"This film is about a man who has to serve community service in a dancing school, because of the misbehaviour of his foster brothers.I was expecting ""Step Up"" to be similar to other dance movies, such as ""StreetDance 3D"" and ""Honey"". However, ""Step Up"" does not concentrate on the vibrant energy of young dancers. Instead, ""Step Up"" concentrates on the lives of the characters. There are little scenes of them dancing, and even if they are dancing they are just isolated practice scenes. For a dancing movie, the number of dancing scenes is quite pitiful. The story is not so engaging either, so I was left feeling bored and disappointed by ""Step Up"".",,Anonymous,Music
A troubled youth is sentenced to community service at a school for the performing arts.,"My expectations for ""Step Up"" were low, but I wanted to see the dancing. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it as a movie as well as a dance vehicle.I anticipated a""Rocky"" formula, but the movie turned out to be about learning to make mature choices.The dismal circumstances of our protagonist's life are unfortunately not uncommon these days, and he was just as pouty, inconsiderate, short-sighted, and self-destructive as teenagers in these situations frequently are. The emotional growth of our main character was expected, but a surprising bonus was the emotional growth of his best friend. And the music and dancing were a joy. ""Step Up"" is not ""Fame"", but it's not bad, either.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
It wasn't entertaining,"I didn't enjoy this movie, due to several reasons.1. The plot is nothing new.Very, very predictable and not interesting.2. The script and the building of characters are very poor. The characters change from bad to good without any believable reasons. It was like one night he wants to be a bad boy then then the next night he wants to be a good guy. People can change that easily? In reality does it take some more motivation? And how did the two leads fall in love? Why did they fall in love? When did she feel there is something desirable in him? I don't see anything that leads to their romance. It was like, OK, let's fall in love, because the director tells us to.3. The acting was fine. I think the supporting cast were OK. They did a passing job. And I especially Rachel Griffiths in her role of dance school director. She looks so graceful. I also think Jenna Dewan is believable and natural as Nora. However, I wish I could see more expression on Tyler's face. He has such a dead look even in the scene when he was about to kiss Nora for the first time. There should be a spark in that moment, but there was none. (I don't have anything against him, though, his body was beautiful and his dance skill was fine. He just needs a little improvement on the acting.)4. The dance scenes were good. I enjoyed them. I can see that they have worked hard to make those scenes look good. BUT there were too few dance scenes in this movie!! This is disappointing for me because I was expecting that at least, if the script is bad, I should be able to enjoy a lot of dance in this film. But why did they make a dance film with so few dances? I just don't understand. Some movies are very boring, such as 'The Company', but the ballet scenes are so incredibly beautiful and there were a lot of them in the film and that was enough to keep me entertained. But this one lacks good story and lacks dance scenes.Conclusion: I don't know what to enjoy in this film, and I don't really blame the cast.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Exciting, Charming, and Insightful","Perhaps all that can be said against Anne Flecther's Step Up, is that it left you wishing you could watch it more- and as we all know, that is what a movie sets out to do. From it's exciting beginning to it's edge-of-your-seat anxious ending, this movie ruled. It provided a deeper sort of story than Hollywood generally is brave enough to do, yet still made it easy for teens to watch and enjoy. The dancing was beautiful and exciting, the drama felt real, and the side stories were insightful and charming. I adored all of the side stories. The little tales of the main girls best friends getting together, to the Principal and Tyler's fight to accept one another, to the tragic story of his young friend's tragedy- all these things only made the movie better and more interesting. The only thing that really could have been done better were those side stories- they could have gone into a bit more detail. That would have made all the difference. They chose to stick more to the main story, though, and the movie was still entertaining and certainly enjoyable. See it. It's a lot of fun! 7/10 stars!Jay Addison",7.0,Anonymous,Music
I liked this movie better when it was called Save the Last Dance,"I've been dancing for as long as I can remember and I always enjoy a good dance movie, and especially one with Channing Tatum. But this movie was basically a mix of every dance movie I've ever seen. It was so predictable, I knew everything that was about to happen after watching like 20 minutes of the movie. Those of you who have seen the movie must agree that the plot was taken from Center Stage, You Got Served, Save the Last Dance, and Dirty Dancing. The characters and the plot are not very developed and you don't feel like you're part of their struggle as you do in Center Stage or Save the Last Dance. Channing looks better in She's the Man anyway. But I love soundtrack. I think Mario's character Miles is my favorite in the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"May be somewhat typical, but I liked it...",A lot of people have said that Step Up is just like a lot of other dance movies that are out there. So what if it was a little like Save the Last Dance? I liked Step Up better anyways. It has a really great soundtrack and I felt really involved in the story...more than I did in Save the Last Dance. I think this movie has a really great overall meaning...overcoming fears and obstacles to get to your dream. It made me want to learn to dance like that so bad too! In the end after the showcase scene...part of me wanted to clap out loud lol. There were actually a few people in the theater who did! Also a lot of people might say it's another typical teen movie. Again so what? If it gets a message out there and people can connect to it that's all that matters. What can I say? I just really loved this movie...plus Channing Tatum is a hottie ;),10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Despite the endless string of sequels, this movie is pretty entertaining.","(Plot) Tyler is a troubled young man with untapped dancing skills. He has moved from Foster home to Foster home throughout his life, vandalizes a very posh arts school, takes the fall for it, and does community services for his unwise decision. He meets and falls for a beautiful, talented dancer named Nora (Jenna Dewan-Tatum) who helps turn his life around, and capitalize on his dancing skills.I actually enjoyed the second sequel to a certain extent, but this series is starting to get a little old now. Before they decided to get every last dime they could from this franchise, they made a fairly moving film like this one, which started it all. I'm not much of a dancing fan, but some of the stuff Channing, Jenna, the rest of the guys did made my jaw drop. It was truly impressive. Tyler's (Channing Tatum) story of reformation is a rather uncomplicated one, but effective all the same. It's not going to dazzle you with the plot or anything like that, but it sets out to entertain the masses, and it does that quite well. Channing Tatum gets a bad rap from some. (I'd venture a guess, that it's resentful husbands or guys with a girl that has a crush on Channing) I'm a guy, and I actually like him! He comes across as a little green at times, but he manages to overcome that with presence, charisma, and believability. His chemistry with Jenna Dewan is quite transparent, and it's easy to see why they fell in love for real, in real life. Channing worked hard and I commend him. Jenna Dewan is stunning. It also helps that I could relate to her character with ease.Final Thoughts: I admit to being sick and tired of this series, but this movie manages to entertain me. It's not rocket science, just a very nice story about redemption and defying the obstacles in front of you. It's a good movie, at least I think so7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
2 hours of your life you'll never get back,"I honestly don't know what I was thinking going to this movie on opening night. Oh yeah... because the trailers were incredibly misleading. It was like an entirely different film. My motivation was pretty much based on that fine white boy from Coach Carter... who now has a new name ; Spaz McNoact. That boy should just not open his pretty mouth.Let me sum up the entirety of the film. Take the acting from you got served, add the dancing from the rejects on So You Think You Can Dance, and add the plot holes from... lets say... The Jacket. If you don't commit to a role, then you come off as a phony. That doesn't even begin to describe the cast of this Jem. It was uninspired, extremely forced to a point where I became uncomfortable, and topped off with lazy, lazy acting. The filmmaker tried to squeeze every possible storyline into the film without making any sort of believable or understandable connection. Conflict and drama were produced out of thin air leading to a rushed and calculated ending.I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but i honestly feel cheated. I sat there wondering if I was hallucinating this entire film and was thinking up ways to get my money back. People aren't that thick. Filmmakers should give them a little more credit than this.

Bring A Brown Paper Bag,"hello folks. i saw this movie. yeah, i can't believe it either. i REALLY didn't want to see it but i had to fulfill a promise (i said i'd go with my friend, who had a part as an extra in it), so there I was at the theater on a Friday morning, waiting for ""Step Up"" to begin. i gotta say i should have bought eight tickets, and reserved all seats in a 360 degree radius of myself, that way no one would have been affected by the splash damage of my vomit. this movie was audacious. granted, my opinion of the movie was low from the start, but i can assure you if you DID NOT like what you saw in the advertisements, you need to ESPECIALLY stay far away. the story is bad enough (this has all been done before, especially in ""save the last dance""), and it's made even worse by the terrible actors. What's with all the hype for Channing Tatum? He wasn't very good in ""coach carter"", and he's downright terrible in this (i'm looking for a deleted scene where he cuts his arm and you can see his robotic circuitry underneath). Jenna Dewam is not a good leading lady, she makes no strides to prove she has any acting chops at all. I've seen scarface do better lines than her. A large portion of my problems rest with the cast, they must've picked these guys up from the trash bin outside the set of Dawson's Creek or something, because everything they say oozes of coy, bipolar emotive, over-the-top yet completely nonsensical dialogue. seriously this movie is like a soundboard, where random phrases are strewn together to make a somewhat coherent, but awkward dialogue. the actors don't deliver but a lot of the blame also goes to the writers, who wrote this crap? if someone tells me ""you don't know what you're getting yourself into..."" i think of more serious things associated with that phrase, like joining the yakuza or Scientology, but not a warning to the tribulations of learning how to friggin' dance! and speaking of dancing, for those people who are solely seeing this movie for that very aspect, you can find more exciting stuff elsewhere. the footwork is very mundane, and not as thrilling as the ads play it out to be. i'd stick with MTV. All in all, this movie was just plain bad. Not ""uwe boll so bad it's good"" kinda bad, but ""tricking the teens/pre-teens/dates into paying for a big steaming turd"" bad. I don't know if Hollywood is doing some kind of science experiment to see if they can get people to see their terrible movies by baiting it with popular music, cool slang, and ""fresh young talent"", but I implore you guys to not see this waste of celluloid. Things like this and John Tucker Must Die aren't even of the same pedigree of the ""stupid but semi-fun"" teen movies that were trouncing around 5 or 6 years ago... this movie needs to STEP DOWN.and to top it off, my friend's scene didn't even make the cut.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

entertaining movie,"The movie is cliché and predictable. But most musicals are. That actually is part of their charm. Would you really want a musical that ends like a Shakespeare tragedy? Except for West Side Story that is. This movie has the dance worlds of Hip Hop and ballet colliding. Channing Tyler dancing was great, ever bit as good as Jenna Dewan's. More could have been done with this movie. The characters of Skinny and Camille were very well written, well played, and left me wanting to see more of them. The movie could have focused on more interesting parts of this collision of cultures. However, when looking at a song and dance movie, you must look at the songs and dances. Personally, I do not like Rap, but the music was rhythmically rich with great texture. The dancing and choreography was excellent. I enjoyed it very much. The group dance scene at the club reminded me of the group dance scene at the hop in West Side Story. It is not a classic. For the dancing and music, though, I recommend it.One more thing.

Fairly entertaining,"The general storyline is a bit trite, but the music and dancing were quite good. This movie would be better if there were less minor characters and the main characters had more depth. Some of the characters and subplots were completely reduced to stereotypes and just shouldn't have been there in the first place.On the up side, the movie has some interesting moments and lines that capture the reality of living the less-than-privileged life, especially the dynamics between Channing's character and his friends/family.The acting wasn't anything special. Jenna Dewan's character wasn't developed enough to require acting chops, she just had to look pretty and pout here and there. Channing's good with the shy/awkward/sensitive boy thing, but he should expand beyond that in future roles in order to establish himself as a quality actor. Both leads were VERY skilled dancers though, whether they are good actors or not.The movie did deliver its share of good dancing and hip hop music.

What's not to like?  let me count the ways,"Insipid script full of clichés and totally predictable; poorly acted either showing off or stumbling through the motions -- there was nothing believable in any of the characters; poorly directed except for some mildly interesting dance sequences, but other than that, what's not to like? It just felt like one is always aware of the falseness of it all and my expectations were low, just hoping for some pleasant entertainment, but there was little that was either pleasing or entertaining and sitting through the rest was too much to get to the energy of some of the dances. The director appears to know about staging and filming a dance but little else about the art of film. Maybe the actors will be better being directed by someone who knows how to focus them and certainly all would be better with a script that wasn't so trite.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
The movie was great!,"Regarding to the comment above I don't agree. It is not full of clichés, and there acting was perfect. They were stumbling through things because that is what their character was supposed to be doing. And when showing off that is also what their character was supposed to be doing. I am very good at predicting movies, and this one was hardly as predictable as others; like the death of one character was very unpredictable until about five minutes before it happened, and even then the film maker wanted it to happen like that. I very much enjoyed the movie along with the dancing, the acting, and the story; I recommend guy or girl to see this movie.",,Anonymous,Music
Enjoyable,"'Step Up' is primarily a dance film with some great dance sequences included. A lot of people therefore criticise the acting in this film because it is pretty poor from most of the performers.With Channing Tatum it's difficult; sometimes his acting can be terrible, his face hardly shows any expression at all in some scenes and his dialogue is wooden. However, in other scenes - particularly with his adopted little sister - he acts fantastically and gives a real-life performance that seems so natural. He acts best in long discussions with people. Jenna Dewan (now Jenna Dewan-Tatum) is good, not great. She's a professional dancer so you cannot expect her to be outstanding at acting because it simply is not her profession. She isn't bad though, I certainly would not say her acting performance was bad, just not great. Her dancing is of course the best in the film, Tatum is really good too.The story is not that great, it's too clichéd as is the case with a lot of films about dancing. There are some moments where you think the story could have been a lot better if they had worked on key points. They bring in important themes to the film such as living a life of crime, youth tragedies, crime taking over neighbourhoods but they don't explain or spread these themes out enough for them to take a hold on the film meaning the themes are half-explained and you're given a 'happy' ending whilst you have all of these questions unanswered.Overall, the film is enjoyable. I would recommend it if you like this sort of film, it's a decent film to watch if you just want to eat popcorn but don't expect anything outstanding.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Dance fusion brought to a new level,"Wearing the hat of a dance enthusiast, I find the fusion of freestyle street dance and traditional ballet moves spectacular and refreshing. I'm inspired already to get out there and jiggle! Fresh-faced Channing Tatum was fantastic in his dance routines though I feel he's not quite ready to play a bad boy.Story wise, it's rather predictable and stereotyped. Downtown bad boy meets uptown good girl, both fall in love, and both have the dance of their life in the finale. Jenna Dewan was unconvincing in her role. She was saved by Channing who stole the show. The sidekicks failed to shine either. At times, they were redundant and annoying.Still, go and watch it just for dance sake!",7.0,Anonymous,Music

I really like the dancing, it made me wish I could dance! Channing not only can dance but made his character very real, some of the actors were great whereas others didn't make their character so believable. Another thing is that it didn't have hardly any language and there was no sex, so that's good. It was a lot about following your dream and making something out of your life, which I think most of us can relate to, we all want to become something or somebody, don't we?

Magic Mike (2012) Lite,"Channing Tatum is one of those actors who came from out of the blue from the alternate career he once had.

However, that same year he would star in this film too where Tatum would return to his original career path but in movie form. All the crazier is how he would return to a much more significant film under the name Magic Mike (2012) which would gain him critical success. If anything, this could be seen as his starting point to that of what he would later be best known for. The thing is for this movie, it's a little bit standard in the execution.The story's setting takes place in the urban city where Tatum plays Tyler Gage, a foster child who grew up among others in the streets with no real role model. One day after being caught trespassing in an arts school, he is sentenced to community service cleaning up the school. Little did he know that he would not only find Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan) as a possible partner but also as a dance partner after her main partner injures himself. The narrative was written by Duane Adler and Melissa Rosenberg who would later write for the Twilight (2008) franchise. Directing the feature was Anne Fletcher in her directorial debut and as her first outing it is fine. There are various parts to the film that needed fine tuning but overall the handling of it was okay.The weak points in the story are mainly just how the story plays out. For those who have seen a lot of films may see all the twists and turns to come because of how formulaic it is. For example, being that the genre this film is in is mainly drama and music, audiences will obviously know that there will be sexual tension between Tyler and Nora and the ups and downs that come from that. It's just bound to happen. Tyler also has two friends from the hood Mac (Damaine Radcliff) and Skinny Carter (De'Shawn Washington), whom of which he hung out with and got into trouble with. At the beginning of the film, they scuffle with a gang leader...well, at some point that'll come back to bite them. These kinds of setups are painfully transparent in how they're set up and how it'll finish.There's even Nora's friend Lucy (Drew Sidora) and Miles (Mario) who Tyler befriends. At some point these two characters make a connection and it's apparent what'll happen between those two characters too. From an acting perspective, all thespians do their jobs correctly. While the playout of the story is very familiar the actors do what they can to make their characters convincing and it works. Channing Tatum easily plays Tyler as the thug bad boy with no direction despite having a skill he doesn't take advantage of. Jenna Dewan as Nora clearly can play an upper class person who has no understanding of what Tyler is going through. Coincidentally Jenna Dewan would get married to Channing Tatum shortly after and be with him until 2018. While that's just trivia, that's not all the good parts.Visually, what's on screen is good too. Michael Seresin is credited as the cinematographer to this movie and he captures all the right things. All the dance scenes are well shot too. Started with movies like Rambo III (1988) and two years before ended up helping with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004). The dancing itself is also well choreographed where it looks like no one had issues following how to perform in that respect. Lastly for music, the score to this feature is not that prevalent. Since it is a dance genre film, the majority of the music belongs to soundtrack artists. Even with that though Aaron Zigman supposedly scored the film. The same composer behind The Notebook (2004), which is surprising considering how popular that love story movie turned out to be. There's no score available that can be found for this movie though, which isn't surprising.The story is very generic and music belongs mainly to the soundtrack, which makes sense for the genre. It's just not as entertaining as it could be, although it still holds up. The acting is good as are the dance sequences and the camerawork.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"I wanted it to be good so bad, but it faltered and disappointed.","I wanted this movie to be good, in fact, before I went to even see it I prayed that it would be good. Why? Because, in my heart I knew that the actors would be pathetic and that the hype, was only hype,but I wanted it to be good for the actor's sake. It was very disappointing. I almost felt bad for Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan. Jenna is an undeniably talented dancer, she has skills, and I will give that to her. However, maybe she should just stick to dancing because, as this movie exemplifies, she has no acting skills. Channing Tatum falters completely. His dancing is okay, but I am so tired of the whole white boy wanting to be black complex, its over played. Although he is extremely handsome, maybe he should stick to modeling, he can do that. The movie had huge potential but with terrible plot lines, clichés, and overall bad acting, this movie fails completely. I give it two stars because I feel bad for these kids, they need better agents.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Step Up,"honestly this movie is B-A-N-A-N-A-S!!! i loved it so much that i went to go see it again. Tyler And Nora look good in the movie, it just seems like they have a lot of chemistry together. And obviously the ladies would agree with me on this one... CHANNING TATUM is just one hot guy... DAMN thats all i have to say...And Mario in this movie its good too. I think that everyone loves a movie where there is lots of entertainment in it. It has dancing and singing. It just shows that there is a lot of talent out there. But one thing i didn't like is that, it was just so typical you know... I honestly knew what was going to happened right after they got to like each other. But i still give it 10 stars. And would really recommend all those music lovers, Channing lovers to go watch this movie because it truly is a good movie to go see.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Horrible Movie! Avoid At All Costs!,"When I saw the previews for this movie, it looked amazing, and I couldn't wait to go see it. I bought tickets to the matinée, and couldn't wait to see it. It took a little while to get started up, but then it just bored me to death. I almost couldn't wait to get out of the theater. It was just a boring dance movie. I don't even think that it was really the guy dancing! They probably either hired a stunt double or just payed a ton of cash to get these people dance lessons, for a movie that wasn't even that good. Don't be fooled by the advertisements! It's really not that good. It is also very confusing. Take The Lead was a better movie, by far. The actors and actresses actually knew what they were doing!

What's more important to you if you go to see a dance movie - acting or dancing,"This is directed at younger film goers...producers have the challenge of finding dancers who can act. I'm loving your thoughts on this movie as a person of the 30's-40's generation who needs to hear the truth if we're gonna produce better movies that don't insult your intelligence.So my question is; what's more important, an actor who can move a little, be dance-doubled and deliver a great performance like Catherine Zeta Jones or Richard Gere in Chicago] An OK actor who gives it a try like Julia Stiles in Save the Last Dance, or Jessica Alba in Honey] or a kick ass dancer who may be a little shaky acting-wise, like Cheyenne in Shall We Dance? I'm not saying either is better I just want to know what you think. Dante Basco and Banderas from Take the Lead could do both, but they are few and far between.",,Anonymous,Music
Step up (in the right direction),"There were musicals and then there are Dance movies. Which I guess could be considered the new musicals. Bollywood seems to be doing OK with them. And while in movies like Step up, there is a reason for dancing (other than walking down the street), the idea seems to always find a crowd of people wanting to watch. Why? Maybe because they either would love to be able to do the stuff they see on screen, maybe because of the love story, maybe because of the songs.The answer lies within the viewers of said movies. But if you have to kick-start a franchise (other than getting money online for your idea that is), than there could've been worse ways than this. Channing Tatum in his breakout role, dancing yet not stripping on film. The romance and the basic story is simple and predictable, but the two leads (who have ever since been married) really sell it ... guess the chemistry was real there ...",6.0,Anonymous,Music
An Overall Great Movie!,"I went to go see Step Up the day it came out. The previews intrigued me so much that I had to go see it as soon as possible! As an inspiring actor, I was moved by the story's message of never giving up on your dreams. The dancing was awesome as the music (I bought the soundtrack) it just made you want to get up out of your seat and dance! Channing Tatum's performance was good, although I think Jenna Dewan could of done a little better. Overall, it was one of the best dance movies ever, and one of my favorite movies! I have heard some negative criticism about the movie, I'm not saying it was the best movie ever! But what I am saying is that it is an all around good movie that should be watched. Trust me, it's worth seeing!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Could be better.,"This movie was OK, not great but not Dirty Dancing by any stretch. The storyline was very simple and almost predictable - Tyler Gage lives life the bad way and is usually caught up in drugs, violence and crime. It is not until he and his gang vandalise Maryland's School of Arts that he is finally caught and is sentenced to 200 hours of community service. It is here that he meets Nora, a professional dancer who is in need of a partner and when she sees Tyler expressing his moves in the parking lot, he seems an ideal choice. As the two begin to work together, they predictably fall in love and Tyler must choose between his brotherhood or his dream. The storyline, I admit, is good but what let's it down is the fact that we all know where he is going to end up and what is going to happen. There is simply no element of surprise whatsoever in this film and for me, that lets it down.The acting is good, particularly from the two main characters. Their characters are believable and I won't deny, they pulled it off nicely. The film had it's fair share of action, humour, good dance moves and romance. If you like films that are pretty predictable, cheesy, have irritating songs and lots of cheesy romance, then this is the film for you. However, if not, I recommend you look elsewhere, perhaps at Grease or Dirty Dancing. This film is good but no where near great. Half of the time, I just wanted to forward the songs on and let me tell you there, there's a lot of them!! 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
I loved it!,"So I went with a friend to see ""Step Up"", and we both thought it was FANTASTIC. I mean sure it has the same story line as all the others, but what movie doesn't? And of course it had some twists and turns along the way, but it still had a good meaning to it. The dance moves were out of my mind, and the music was perfectly matched to the scenes, it kept me so into the story. Plus the actors were all great, especially Mario, who was pretty good, which i didn't expect. And of course you can't keep your eyes of the lead male in this one. I will probably go see this one again, and buy it the first day it comes out on DVD. It is a great movie and I recommend it to all.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Dance Scenes!,"""Step Up"" is not really a movie you watch for the story. It's totally predictable and definitely you've seen all these scenes and situations in many other movies before. It is not even about the actors (I did not know any names of the leads, nor do I recall them right now). It is something you watch because of the great dance sequences. I especially enjoyed watching 2 scenes: the romantically shot dance sequence on the rooftop, bathed in afternoon sunlight; and that climactic dance sequence in the ""showdown"", very well choreographed and executed. There was a scene with the male lead danced with his foster siblings, which I found charming. The hiphop soundtrack is also very good. That song in the final credits ""Get Up"" by Ciara is very infectious, I'm having last song syndrome up to now.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A poor remake of save the last dance,"Though i have to admit Jenna dewan is drop dead gorgeous, this movie is just a case of Emen enima, meets save the last dance, meets scary movie 3.

This girl has at least some future ahead of her.If you're in the mood for a really good romantic dance movie, go back to the original dirty dancing, this movie started the whole craze on a shoe string budget, and is still the top runner.

And there are so many great dancers out there,cause that's what we do when we're young,we dance for fun.

"Not brilliant, but cute","I liked it. Yes, if you were looking for a thought-provoking film this would not be the right choice, but I still found it entertaining. I enjoyed the fresh feel to it. I did find the subject matter similar to 'Center Stage' and the plot line of 'Save the Last Dance'. Personally, I preferred 'Step Up' to 'Save the Last Dance'. I found the latter offensive and downright annoying at times. Anyway, I agree that the acting was not the most impressive part. Yet, I found I was able to overlook that lacking aspect of the film. Over all, I found it very cute. Finally, I really enjoyed watching Channing Tatum as well because he is very, very HOT.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Schematic but enjoyable feel-good movie,"Step up, plays it entirely by the book which may seem safe for a film maker, but ironically can be equally risky, in the worst case scenario your film could look recycled.This dance concerns about a break dancing street kid (Tyler) who is forced to do a couple hundred community service hours for an art school which he was caught breaking into. The first thing that gets his attention when he starts doing his time, is a girl in the dance hall, whose dance partner has just broken his foot. Tyler volunteers to replace him, Nora is not surprisingly doubtful, but to her surprise Tyler is quite good, but how committed will he be to this, when it means leaving his old life/friends behind?Step Up does it better than most, but not as good as the best. It does it's best to treat the characters as human beings, not just bodies to dance. Jenna Dewan and Channting Tutum are a decent screen couple not so much because the are cute but because they feel like real people. It These are two kids who were NOT meant for each other, they don't look it and they don't act it, but when they dance they appear flawless.Step Up's problems are screenplay related. It is never unpredictable, and for that matter, it's not super believable either. This is not a film for an intelligent audience, it is a feel good movie, no more no less, but it's catchy, never too shallow, and It's enjoyable",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A cute dance film,"Step up 1 is a romantic comedy about the meeting of classical and street dance. When Tayler, street dancer and troublemaker, is arrested and sentenced to community service, he doesn't know it's actually a once in a life time opportunity. Indeed, he will meet the ballet dancer Norah, a student of the school and become her dance Partner.I had read a lot of negative reviews about this movie, and I can confirm some of the bad comments. It is true that the story is a little girlish, and you mustn't expect a huge brain activity while watching it ! Tayler gives his help to Nora, then take it back and give it again... You can find out the end since the beginning ! But on the other hand, if your goal for the night is to stay on your couch with some (girl) friends and enjoy a sweet comedy together, Step Up is for you ! If you are easy to please, you might even forget that you've already guess the end, and hope, cry and laugh with the characters.Moreover, you will certainly enjoy the dance scenes, which are more and more delightful throughout the film, and as you reach the end, the last scene is a real gift to the eyes and ears.In conclusion, I'd recommend it if you had a rough day and want to go to sleep with a cute smile on your face !",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Pleasantly Surprised,"Pleasantly surprised. Dancers who can really act or actors who can really dance. I'm shocked at the negative reviews over here. I'm a big fan of the movie and the 2 leads. Wow. I liked how the concentration wasn't mainly on the love life of the characters but their ambitions and their need to do something that they love as a profession or to just better their lives. Being an artist, composer and a dancer at heart I could relate to all the characters. I did not read the reviews nor did I for Superman Returns, The Devil Wears Prada and this movie, but I have to say this is one of the best summers ever. The only down side was Pirates of the Caribbean 2. I slept every time Johnny Depp wasn't on screen. Excellent. Who is Channing Tatum? His dancing is spectacular. Jenna Dewan was amazing as well. I related to the DJ carrying around his keyboards and demos and laptop, the singer. Everything was so real.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Channing Tatum's dancing makes the whole movie,"I was drawn to this movie by the short and impressive scene of dancing between Tatum and Sandra Bullock in the 2023 movie, ""The Lost City"". But here, Tatum is even better and I was convinced he is an actor-turned-dancer, which I later found it is not the case. SO how can he move so good without a dancing personal history behind?! An immense talent for dancing, which I assume is not easy to embody with such a tall and built up figure as his :)For everyone as enchanted by the dance world as me, I highly recommend this film. Also knowing the behind the scene story of the main characters adds authenticity.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Step down,"Rubbish. A plot that was as predictable as it was banal. A script that was both embarrassing and clichéd. Acting that almost defied belief in it's badness.Yes - it's a dance movie. But no - that isn't a licence to forgive it's drawbacks. Was there anyone who watched this who after 10 mins wasn't certain of the plot and final outcome? Boy from wrong side of the sticks meets middle-class girl. One is an untrained but talented street dancer, the other a formally trained ballerina. They get together - and end up assisting each other to make the 'step up'. And it all culminates in a big show that blends together the two styles and catapults both up the greasy dance pole (so to speak). Now how long did that story take to work out? I was made to see this on a very uncomfortable flight from Frankfurt to Osaka. At the time - I didn't imagine the flight could get any worse - I was so very very wrong.....It made me want to step 'out' - not up.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
if you enjoyed Dirty Dancing you'll love Step Up,"An enjoyable dancing movie that made me want to stand up and cheer. It had great music and great dancing. This movie begins with Tyler Gage, an 18 year old whose life never seem too easy, but Tyler is an amazing dancer. One night while out with friends he ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time, he soon gets arrested and he is told by the court that he must be a janitor at a music school for his committee service. During that time he notices the beautiful dancer Nora Clark. One day Nora notices what a great dancer Tyler is. Something happens to Nora's dance partner, and she really needs a partner before opening night. After so many tri-outs with no luck, Tyler ask for a try, she lets him try out. When he does it very well, they soon become dance partners, but will they last. My favorite next to Dirty Dancing. The two leads were great. This movie will be enjoyable for a life time to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Decent and Expected,"This movie is not a terrible movie, quite a contrary statement to many reviews bestowed upon the film. The movie's premise is simple enough: a young man has been charged with a misdemeanor and must complete 200 hours community service at the scene of the crime.The scene, which sets the setting for most of the film, is the Maryland School of Arts, a prestigious school in which only the most gifted students may attend. It is during the community service that our protagonist, Tyler Gage (Tatum), meets the obligatory cute dance student, Nora Clark (Dewan), who is from a different world entirely.The film has many honest, touching moments. The first meeting, the flirts, the dancing scenes in the clubs and the studio. The Director of Photography did a great job of showing the immense contrast of the two worlds, and the striking similarity of the inhabitants. The plot advances rather well, with it's conflict along the way. The score was excellently chosen, and used very well in the many dancing and emotional scenes.The film is not without its gross negatives however. Acting is the first problem. Both Tatum and Dewan, while giving decent performances, have almost zero chemistry on screen, and this is noticeable throughout the film. The two leads' friends are a little stronger on the acting side, with Damaine Radcliff (Mac) possibly being the strongest. There were many moments that were mere plastic and filler, moments where any simpleton can tell the actors are bored, or frustrated, with the inept writing they've been given. The script, half the time, seems like a re-written ""Save The Last Dance"", which on that note brings me to my last complaint: many, many shots in this movie almost seem to photocopy other teen-angst dramas. The basketball court, the housing, the attitude, all is not unlike the mentioned dance movie.The ending is predictable, as is most of the movie, but not so much that it's disappointing or frustrating. It deserves a giggle and a little pat on the back for recognizing trends, but nothing more.The film is presented as a ""defining film of this generation"". A little much for weak acting and scripts, but this film will suffice for a dry week at the video store. It's decent in every way, and expected in every way, being the movie we all know it's going to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
I love this movie,"This movie was really good, I really enjoying it!.The dancing sequences were very well done, and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance.The dancing in the film switches between either hip-hop or some combination of hip-hop ballet.They have very good dancing skills. It is decent in every way, and expected in every way,I would recommend it to anyone who likes to dance.This is my favorite movie ever and i give 10 out of 10.This is decent entertainment if you love dance, but at the bottom of my personal list of dance movies.Watch Step Up, ..........I watched it like a million times and I really recommend it to you.I loved the movie and I loved the actors.",,Anonymous,Music
"""GOTTA DANCE!!!""","Step Up (2006) -This film could be considered as a more focussed look at the journey of Leroy from 'Fame' (1980), except it's not set in New York and the 'Leroy' character is my spirit animal Channing Tatum, who looks amazing in those grey joggers.Sadly he plays an obnoxious @rse, who really doesn't grow that much throughout, although you want him to. I hate that whole 'Boyz 'N' The Hood' (1991) attitude that is shown and the crime element is frustrating, but he's certainly got the moves!I suppose that it would be a complete remake of 'Fame' if he had just been a normal person that didn't have a rough upbringing, but I'd like to see an everyday guy getting ahead every once in a while. Someone who isn't struggling with adversity, isn't rich or poor, but they've just ended up on a path that isn't what they really want.It's a very predictable story, I could see Skinny's journey from the beginning and the issues that Channing's character was going to face with his friends and the other ""Kids"" at the school right from the get go, but to be fair, sometimes predictable is good. It made it easy to watch.I love watching good dances, so that element of the film was really enjoyable and the finale was superb, but this could have been something to rival those other films out there, with a bit more belief in what they were making and a tweak to the script. Although with a bigger budget, they may not have found Channing and brought him in to our lives and that would be very bad.Also, I'm not sure if it's clear, but I love Channing Tatum and want him to be my man. If you know him, put him in touch please?599.76/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Rebel With A Tune.,"This is a sort of BIG BILLY ELLIOTT movie. Very familiar and yet very entertaining dance school pic has the awesomely charismatic Channing Tatum there to anchor it to the screen. Looking like the love child of James Dean and Josh Hartnett if that was possible, he has looks of both and solid acting skills... enough to overcome the hilarious Eminem 8 MILE nonsense first half complete with hugely over-sized toddler pants and silly hat scenes. Similar to any two reels of TAKE THE LEAD or CENTRE STAGE or HONEY and SAVED and STRICTLY BALLROOM and even Saturday NIGHT FEVER this is a FAME /Ballet school drama that is predictable in every scene, but because of Tatum stays watchable. The tiny-tot ballet scenes are hilarious. Can Tatum dance? Yes, and even seems to manage hip hop dance athletics. He was a standout in the lite teeny SHE'S THE MAN at another school and survived the dire drivel of GUIDE TO RECOGNISING YOUR SAINTS... and I welcome any new pic I see his name. Hopefully the 'action producers' can keep guns from his hands and let him develop into a major male star in romantic and music dramas. He is better than being shunted into cop pix and awful BLACKHAWK DOWN imitation pix. The dance numbers are energetic.. especially the blue shirt one in the middle of the film... the goofy romantic thing he is capable of is very appealing. The camera loves him and he has a solid male image excellent for new young adult films like this. Rachel Griffiths plays the thankless role of the headmistress of the school and she sleepwalks thru her role as if she filmed her scenes on a Monday after a day on the SIX FEET UNDER set. It's a Tatum pic this one and it works completely because of him. Terrific photography too. I really like this film and those above like it. It is a genre I enjoy and each time offers teen audiences values above explosions, arguments and squalor so prevalent in many new films.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A familiar story but a welcome one just the same,"Nora (Jenna Dewan) is an aspiring dancer at the Maryland School for the Arts. She is dismayed when her partner is injured, as it comes just weeks before a recital that is a stepping stone to an offer from a dance company. She needs a new partner to help her rehearse and she starts looking. Tyler, on the other hand, is a teenage foster child in a rough section of Baltimore. Although his foster mother tries hard, his foster father is a no-good loafer who doesn't give the children under his roof the time of day. He just wants a paycheck. One day, Ty and a couple of friends go inside the MSA to retrieve a ball and end up trashing the place. Tyler is sentenced to serve as a janitor at the art school for his community service. Oh, and by the way, Tyler is a talented hip hop dancer. You can probably guess what's coming. Tyler observes beautiful Nora and becomes aware of her dilemma. His solution? Choose me as your dance partner, dear Nora. It happens and it changes both of their lives. This sweet movie, with a rougher undertone, has that ages old story of unlikely and star-crossed lovers. Nora is from a world of privilege and Tyler is from the world of the have-nots. Yet, given a bit of time and effort, they find they need each other and can benefit greatly from the contact. Dewan is very lovely and a terrific dancer while the actor playing Tyler is talented and attractive. The script is a winner and so are the costumes and settings. It would be wonderful if inner city children everywhere could be given a showing of the movie. Tyler's life is truly changed by his exposure to the world outside his neighborhood. Nora, too, gains respect for those less fortunate than herself. Don't hesitate to let teens, or anyone who wants to see the film, get their chance. It is a great character building movie with a special sparkle and beauty.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

The dancing in the movie is amazing! Channing Tatum is an unbelievable dancer and also a heartthrob!! Along with Jenna Dewan. The two make a gorgeous duo and they work together so well.

This movie would probably be great if you were 9 years old...but for anyone with a decent IQ it will be just horrible.I gave it a 2 because it is almost ironically predictable...a feeble attempt for another ""save the last dance"" movie. When it was done my friends and I just looked at each other with blank expressions. BLAH! Not a good movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the best dance movies ever....,"Now I must be honest and say that I am a huge fan of dance movies such as Honey, Save the last Dance and Dirty Dancing. I really enjoyed every moment of it. I mean it isn't Oscar material but its nice to find a movie that makes you feel good and leaves you smiling.The chemistry between the leads is fantastic, and I loved watching them together. The choreography is brilliant and the main plot is actually pretty good.I can't wait for it's DVD release and hope to see more of the actors in this movie.So give this movie a chance, I'll doubt you will be disappointed...",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Fletchers ""Step Up"" will have you wanting to dance!","Step Up is one dance movie that delivers the goods!.""Step Up"" is about a white boy who lived in a hood, Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum), who has a unique street dance talent. After vandalizing a bunch of props on a Performing Art schools stage, he is sentenced to 200 hours of community service to the Maryland School of the Arts. During his service time, a girl named Nora (Jenna Darwin) dance partner has an accident and can no longer dance, she seeks to find a replacement to practice for her senior showcase till her partner recovers. Many boys audition, but none make the cut. Tyler offers to do it, and is quickly accepted. Tyler, who has spent most of his life not pursuing anything, starts to see what he has gotten himself into is something that he loves to do and he needs to step up and fight for it.I was completely surprised on how much I enjoyed this movie. I have never really been a big fan of dance movies even though I am a dancer. The acting is good, but not great. But boy can these actors dance. My hats off to Anne Fletcher for her fantastic choreographing job on the dance sequences and her debut as a director. This film is very entertaining. The story can be slow at parts, but for being a dance film it's pretty good, plus there is tons of humor. I also like the fact there is not a bunch of that gangster talk, very little swearing, and very little, if any, sexual references. However, there is some gang related talk, activity, and also a drive-by shooting. The music in the film is also very unique in it's own right. For the genre that it is (dancing), I give it a 8/10 rating. I loved this show and can' t wait to see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Step up... or down,"I saw this movie tonight at a prime in Switzerland. Some Friends of mine did like it pretty much although there is nothing new in this type of scenario. I think that I do need to feel something new, to hear something untold or retold in such a better way than it surpasses the original to like a movie. But here, we don't get anything new, it stays a very simple movie overall with no incredible developments in the scenario. This predictable type of movie is the one I don't really like to see at the theater, it's nothing special. But I must admit that the actors deliver a very good performance in dancing, especially the main characters. So if you are crazy about dancing, you might like this one...",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Tyler distracts him to let his buddies run free. Now Tyler must do work for the school, where he helps out a lovely girl (De'Shawn Washington) who dances ballet.Choreographer Anne Fletcher does a horrible job in her directorial debut and even fans of this movie will agree that the dancing is not that good at all.Duane Adler basically remakes his great movie Save the Last Dance. However, just like all remakes, it's way worse than the original.Channing's character is very irritating and his awful acting doesn't help much.The Drama isn't very dramatic, the romance isn't very romantic, and the comedy isn't very funny.

Excellent Movie!!,"I agree that the acting may not be the best, but look at their history. None of the actors/ actresses have years of experience, so based on that I think they all did an awesome job. My husbands first look was that it was not his type of movie, but once it got started he didn't want to miss any part of it. He really enjoyed! For me, the dancing was out of this world. I really enjoyed the entertainment and the way the movie shows the magnitude of love dancing can bring to people. It also shows that dancing is not for wimps... ITS HARD WORK!

Insipring and worth while watching !!!!!,Wow this movie is the best movie i have seen since the movie save the last dance came out. it is suitable for all age groups and genders. I love the techniques that they use in their dancing i love the way they show the contrast between ballet and hip hop. it also shows that people can change if they really want something. this the first film in a while that hasn't got over the top love scenes because its more about determination and fighting for what you want and love. the acting can have little bit more work but it still is great and the dancing over rides the acting so thats OK. most dancers will love this movie more than people who don't dance. But this movie will get people who don't dance to want to give it a try. when you are watching it just want to get out of your seats and join in. The soundtrack also it awesome it works well mixing ballet and hip hop together so the contrast isn't just through dancing its through the music and the attitude between both the main characters. So i fully recommend this movie to anyone to watch it.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
the movie didn't blow me away,"this movie wasn't such a good movie. Before i watched this movie i didn't have high expectations for this movie because the last dance movie i watched was Honey and it was such a crappy movie. So i was right, step up wasn't such a good movie. That female main character can't act, it's so fake. Channing was unbelievably hot in the movie but his role wasn't all that good. The dancing in the movie was hot. The storyline isn't that good neither. There were a few parts of the movie that is confusing...and the setting of this movie is of a high school...its stupid, the actors CLEARLY look like they're in their 20's. In 1 scene Channing is sitting in a classroom, and the whole time i thought he was some drop out or something. i give this movie a 4/10. there were only 2 things that were good about the movie...Channing, and the dancing.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
this movie is great,"I think Step up is a great movie because it's about a dance school, and I love dance so that account for why. The main characters name is Tyler and he is really nice. The movie is laid in USA, and I like USA a lot so that's good. Tyler is a boy and he is poor, he lives in a block with much crime. So Tyler is like everybody else in the block. And one day the police take Tyler because he was stolen a car. And after that he had to work on the dance school as punishment. Then he met Nora, she was a student on the dance school. They started to meet, then Tyler and Nora become in love. I recommend Step up, its one of my favourite movies.

This could possibly be the worst movie of all time.,"Cheese levels were through the roof throughout the entire move. The entire plot was predictable and it lasted almost two hours. Honestly, the first hour is completely unwatchable and I'm not quite sure how I managed to not walk out. I thought maybe I was missing the point, but the person i was with was a dancer and despised the movie equally. People throw around that saying about ""the worst movie ever"" but in all honesty, this movie is on Gigli status. It is THAT bad.

Step Up and View this ***1/2,"With a cast of relative unknowns, with the exception of former Oscar nominee Rachel Griffiths, this film, dealing with youngsters at a school for dramatic arts, is absolutely marvelous.It's basically the story of changing one's environment so as to get the best out of what life offers.When our hero is involved in school vandalism, he is sentenced to 200 community hours of service at the school where he did the damage. There, he falls in with a different crowd of youngsters. Our protagonist comes from a dysfunctional foster home where the father drinks beer all day. His two African American friends are two guys into prank making. Unfortunately, the younger brother, is afraid of nothing and he will meet a tragic ending. Again, he could not get out of his environment.At the school, Tyler, who can dance up a storm, naturally falls for her a girl who needs a dance partner when her partner is hurt.

"Skip this and just rent ""Save the Last Dance""","Please do not think for a moment that I feel ""Save the Last Dance"" is some cinematic epitome of greatness, because it isn't. What is it, however, is a film that was pretty useless all around, but had enough good ""stuff"" in it to make it very entertaining.""Step Up"" not only lacked all that ""stuff,"" but the dancing was horrible too! Last time I checked, if a movie is going to be about dance, the dancing part SHOULD be impressive, no? I am not one to diss films for being formulaic or overly contrived, as I love many movies which are just that, but if you are not going to add anything NEW to a medium, it should at least be done well.This film is almost like a terrible remake of ""Save the Last Dance"" gone wrong. The story was completely ridiculous, if not totally implausible. The dance sequences were boring and uninspired, like a bad week on ""So You Think You Can Dance."" Even the music was predominantly made up of really horrible, generic RnB. They hit on way too many clichés (including black man with gun, non-understanding parent, overworked-absent mom) and not once in this film would anyone begin to care about these stupid people so when there is the obligatory dramatic death of a young one, all it does is make you roll your eyes at how mundane every aspect of this movie is. Even the editing was terrible with so many bad cuts and continuity problems, I wondered if the director was even awake sometimes.Channing Tatum stars and I was hoping to see him show some acting chops, but all he did was prove he can play a white boy wannabe reallybadly. And he's not that great of a dancer. There is no doubt that the ex-Abercrombie model is gorgeous, but even that wasn't enough to really make this movie worth sitting through. If he is going to have any future, he's going to have to stop appearing in crap films like this and ""She's the Man,"" learn to act and not think that his perfectly sculpted face is going to get him anything more than a few more fluffy film roles until he fades away and regrets giving up modeling.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

"Clichéd, but still kind of fun","Saw this movie in a sneak preview last night. It was so full of dance movie clichés that I thought for a moment it was made by the same guys that do the Scary Movie series. I ran a mental checklist in my mind and it hit nearly every single one I could think of. But, in the end, it was cute and actually had a few laugh out loud lines or moments. The dancing was fun. One particular dance scene when all the Performing Arts students let loose at a party was exhilarating. I wanted to be in that group having a good time. At any time when there's no dancing going on, the movie slides into mediocrity and sub-par acting. Watch the extras in the background. Man, do they overdo it!

Touching and inspirational; the best dance display you'll ever see,"To begin with, I wasn't expecting much from Step Up. But as it happened, from the minute I started watching it till the credits, I was immersed in the movie.Never have I seen such a fine display of dance in a feature film. Channing Tatum displays his dancing prowess as Tyler and Jenna Dewan casted opposite him plays a complimenting role as Nora.Jenna Dewan's acting was as fine as her dancing skills while Channing doesn't disappoint as a dude makin some really tight moves!All in all, it deserves a 9 and not 10 cause I feel the 2 minute drama towards the end was unnecessary. It's a movie that will leave you inspired and keep you gripped till the last minute.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good for a Friday night at home with friends, don't see it in theaters.","Okay, so when I first saw the trailer to this movie, I knew it would be cheesy, but I was at least hoping for a decent storyline. This script seemed like it had been thrown together in ten minutes. There were too many conflicts with each of the characters and none of them were ever given enough depth to make an emotional connection with the viewers. Channing Tatum has potential as an actor, but it wasn't displayed in this movie. He gave a much more vibrant performance in She's The Man, whereas he was almost emotionless in this flick. The acting as a whole was disappointing; Jenna Dewan was a decent dancer, but she lacked the emotion and the drive to create a memorable performance as an actress. The whole cast seemed forced throughout the movie; their acting was mediocre at best. However, the dancing was good and I really liked the music. It was also refreshing to see a movie that was free of nude scenes, heavy swearing, and sexual activity.

"Step Up - funny, emotional, exciting!","I think the movie Step Up is a great film, the story is funny but it has its moving parts as well and the balance between them is very good. The whole story is entertaining and sometimes it is also quite exciting.I think the actors are both extraordinarily good dancers and they act really good as well. The story isn't that new, but it's a good, interesting story. Anyway, in this film the dancing is more important than the story and the dancing is very beautiful and really impressive.I think we can make the best comparison with the sequel of Step Up, Step Up to the Streets. I like the second one too, but I prefer the first one. In Step Up to the Streets the story is a bit more interesting and more inventive, but the dancing isn't as good as in Step Up.In conclusion I would say if you are a fan of dancing, then it is really worth seeing Step Up.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A piece of junk - don't waste your money to see this movie.,"My friends & I went to the movie theater to watch this movie. The previews made the movie look like it was going to be good, and I was also interested in it since I take dance classes at a studio. I thought this film was okay, but more on the bad side. I thought Jenna Dewan's acting was fairly good, however I really did not not like Channing Tatum. Sure, Channing is hot, but he seriously should improve his acting skills. I also found his character quite annoying for some reason x_X. The storyline & plot was poor, as well as some of the acting. The only thing I actually liked about this movie was the dancing/routines.Truthfully, in the middle of the movie my friends & I started talking about random things, (like school, guys, other movies, etc.) and we weren't really watching it.

horrid horrid,"This has to be one of the worst films I've ever watched. A huge dance amateur I was expecting good dance routines and great music. Needless to say both are very mediocre. The plot is ridiculous and so cliché you know how the film will end before it begins, the same goes for endless boring scenes. Acting is on the level of a porn clip. Channing has basically one single (!!) expression the whole film through and even that one is fake. He looks utterly stupid and the fact that he really cannot move to music does not help his pathetic excuse for acting. Bottom like he looks like a Shrek or a jarhead that wants to dance. The rest of the cast is, alas, not much better. Jena Dewan does not convince us that she's a rich girl trying to follow her dancing dreams. One of the reason for that failure is that the lady cannot dance to save her life. One of the most disturbing flaws in the script are the things with obvious homophobia and the notion that jazz and ballet are boring and stuck up and that one needs a thug from the slums to bring some life into the dancing. The scenes are too long and too boring, there's NO chemistry between the protagonists and the film as a whole is just simply flat (even the murder scene leaves us uninvolved to say the least).

Misses the Plate...,"Only notable for the chemistry between its two leads...

"An OK movie, but fails to deliver the dancing","I've been looking forward to this movie for the whole summer. Being a hip-hop dancer, I am the first in line to see any dance related movie. I never go in expecting Oscar worthy performances and the only realistic thing I expect is hot dancing. ""Step Up"" was no exception. I expected an average performance at best with a good mix of hip hop dance and music. However, for those with the same expectations as mine, beware. Although there is dancing in the movie, and it is decent, there isn't much of it. There is only one real scene of hip-hop showmanship. The others last about 10-15 seconds at most. I'm guessing the director wanted to put the story and the characters at the forefront and use dancing to enhance the chemistry, similar to Save the Last Dance. Sadly, as expected, the story and the characters are delivered in a typical substandard form and fail to achieve the said ""save the last dance"" chemistry. The dancing, which should have been the focus as in other dance movies, is instead left lagging behind in screen time. Overall, the movie is decent and it may still be worth seeing it for the little dancing that there is because it's still hot. Do not expect non-stop dancing action with filler story. Since this movie failed to impress even me, and I usually have low standards when it comes to dance movies, I give it a 6. ""Take the lead"" blows this out of the water.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Well it ain't a terrible dance flick,"This is probably the first dance flick that revolves around romance. And it was pretty much sort of dull and boring throughout the whole movie, with a few good dancing in it. The plot is basically this, a hip hop street dancer gets in trouble and has to serve some community service hours at the school he trashed with his friends. If it had more hip hop dancing in it, it would have been a better moving. Not trying to bash on ballet, but it was just plain boring in this. The emotional and dramatic parts in this was just plain dull and lame. Overall it's a pretty boring dance flick, mainly cause it doesn't have enough cool dancing in it, and tries too hard to focus on the romance aspects of it, but it's not done really well and seems really weak. It's also a pretty narrow and predictable story, with nothing really interesting going on. It's passable film and has a few moments that is decent, where guys can tolerate it and girls will probably like it.5.1/10",5.0,Anonymous,Music

The one thing that I did not like was the combination of so many plots.

"Bereft of plot, authentic emotion, or acting chops from its two leads, this romance serves as the franchise's high point.","This movie lacks a complex cause-and-effect structure typical of good films and a plausible, well-constructed plot. It also fails to provide logical reasons for what little conflict there is as well as keeping the interest of the viewer. The acting is mediocre at best; however, the dancing and choreography are the movie's highlights. It cannot be emphasized enough, however, that there needs to be more dancing, specifically in the practice sessions, to make the film seem faintly realistic. In regarding to the quality of acting, Jenna Dewan is more dancer than actress while Channing Tatum once again fulfills his typecast character of ""that cute guy from the ghettos."" Besides their eventual marriage, the two actors show little chemistry on the big screen. The two protagonist's character traits are easy to find decent but hard to deem sympathetic. Look no further than James Thurber's ""The Princess and the Tin Box"" for irony regarding the stereotypical ""rich girl likes poor boy"" cliché portrayed in this movie.

below par dance movie,"Whilst not expecting this film to be as good as Save the Last Dance, I was expecting a lot more than what was served. The acting, plot and character development was all sorely lacking, to the point where the motivation for character's actions were at many times missing. An example of the poor character development, is that we are shown how these boys kill time in their underprivileged situation by getting involved with illegal activities, but we are not shown why and how they got involved (eg at least try and show they are trying to fill something they feel is missing in their life) - but all we see is them acting and being stupid. so we don't feel any sympathy or empathy for the main male characters. Also lots of cheesy and corny lines, doesn't help the script either. and unfortunately even the strongest area of the film - the dancing - was only OK, as it really lacked the WOW factor one should expect in this day.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Cliché ridden movie is made OK by Tatum,"Some of ""Step Up"" is so ludicrous I wondered whether it was originally conceived as a spoof comedy. As every cliché in the book is hit!

Boyfriend is revealed as douche. Check. Bad boys friends are mad at him for spending time with other people. Check. Bad boy and good girl fall for each other, fall out, and make up before the end. Check. I can't complain too much about this movie. Snore through it, maybe, but not complain. It was an OK way to spend time watching with a date.Channing Tatum was likable and the female lead however she was, was attractive too.

Step Up was entirely predictable and the acting was mediocre. I got somewhat bored throughout its entirety, and although the end sequence was decently done it was nothing spectacular. The romantic storyline isn't very compelling, and I never felt that any of the characters were particularly deep. The plot in and of itself is stereotypical, played out by individuals who's dancing definitely beats out their acting. This movie feels like a cheesy version of Save the Last Dance to me, and if that isn't your cup of tea, I wouldn't even bother watching Step Up. If you're still curious, it isn't entirely painful to watch, but I personally wouldn't say its worth the money of renting.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A Real Step Up,"""Step Up"" is derivative, predictable, and formulaic. That being said, Director Anne Fletcher's hybrid classical hip-hop dance romance is completely arresting and thoroughly enjoyable. I was surprised how engaging the movie is. Within the first 20 minutes, you can predict the outcome. And ultimately, it does not matternot in the least. What ""Step Up"" has going for it is a breakthrough star performance by Channing Tatum. Tatum plays delinquent high school student Tyler Gage, who happens to be a gifted street dancer. Tyler rolls with Mac Carter (Damaine Radcliff) and his little brother Skinny (De'Shawn Washington). After Tyler is caught vandalizing the Maryland School of the Arts, he must serve his community work sentence at the school. Tyler catches the eye of star ballerina Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan). She spies Tyler's dance display outside the school. Nora is in a lurch. She is preparing her senior dance piece, but her dance partner is injured. Dance company reps attend the Senior Show. Nora promises her Mom (Deirdre Lovejoy) that if she does not land with a dance company she will apply to Cornell University. For Nora dance is her lifewhat she lives for. Eventually, Nora strikes a deal with School Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths) and Tyler. Gordon reluctantly agrees.Tatum and Dewan have amazing chemistry as Tyler and Nora. Of course Nora has a self absorbed jerk boyfriend Brett (Josh Henderson), who is on the verge of signing a record deal with the collaboration of brilliant classical/ hip-hop composer Miles (recording star Mario). For the first time Tyler is able to see the greatness in himself. But like Mac reminds him, ""You quit everything you start."" So it is truly time for Tyler to be responsible for his life and risk being extraordinary. The ""90210"" and ""Fame"" trite melodrama aside, ""Step Up"" is inspiring and you cheer for Tyler and Nora. Even with the corn ball predictable story, ""Step Up"" is really about taking responsibility for one's own greatnesswhich is everyone's birth right.""Step Up"" has spectacular dancing be it ballet, hip-hop or hybrid. Jenna Dewan is a classically trained dancer. Channing Tatum is an awesome street dancer on screen. I checked on-line that Tatum is not a trained dancerhe a gifted athlete and martial artist. Tatum possesses a star quality and natural charisma. Tall and handsome he has great screen presence. Tatum plays basically a lug, but he is so charming and has great range. Whether he is playfully trading dance moves with his sister Camille (so cute Alyson Stoner) or fighting with a gang banger in a club he always comes across real. There is a truth about Tatum's performance. Though somewhat overshadowed, Jenna Dewan is winning and beguiling as Nora. Dewan captures Nora's passion and heart. She and Tatum have magical chemistry. That leverages against all the predictability inherent in ""Step Up"".Anne Fletcher as both director and choreographer is amazing. The final dance number is killer. However, I found more compelling the training and creative sequences with Tyler and Nora. Dance is a great discipline and an art. Training and talent get you in the door. Art is all about the feel, passion, and creation. ""Step Up"" possesses these qualities and there is such joy in this movie. The music is equally stunning and captivating with its blend of urban beats and classical orchestration.The supporting cast is solid. Rachel Griffiths brings the right compassion and gravity as Director Gordon. Mario is natural and strong as composer Miles. Damaine Radcliff gives a street edge and authenticity to Mac. Lucy Avila is charming as Nora's friend Lucy.""Step Up"" is great fun at the movies. Channing Tatum is a going to be a big star. ""Step Up"" is a real step up.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie lived up to its hype!,"This movie was really good! It tops all the dance movies I have ever seen, like Honey, Save the Last Dance, and Take the lead! This movie lived up to its hype.

How many versions have I seen of this?,"And everything, just about everything is predictable. I volunteered to watch this, so we could all take a breath between riveting episodes of ""The Wire"" and I must admit to having loads of fun with it, much to the annoyance of the child in my life who had given it a whole 6 on her 10 gauge. At the end of the watching, I had given it a 1. So we split the rating here. Some of the dance sequences are fun and skilled. But the awful awful awful script with the characters as thin as tissue paper and the death of one main character was signalled from two miles away. And on.This review said it best:'Non-story' ... Step UpAnother West Side Non-Story, scoring low on the raunch-o-meter. Jenna Dewan is the Wasp dance student at a Fame-style school who gets the hots, or rather the certificate-PG family-friendly tepids, for a tough guy with dancing skills from the wrong side of the tracks, played by Channing Tatum. These supposedly physical young people are evidently content with kissing and contain themselves as chastely as Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson.

Makes you feel good.,"Alright, many people will begin to classify this movie with ""bad acting"" and ""teens only drool over the lead actor"". Is it really necessary to automatically label a movie terrible because the lead actor is gorgeous beyond belief? Not only was this movie entertaining, it was romantic, humorous, and sad. The acting was good, the dance scenes were amazing. I got so into this movie. I thought Tatum did an excellent job with his dance moves, he really seemed to flow into the part of being a white guy in the ghetto. His acting skills were a bit off. Dewan did a pretty good job acting, but I will say it was not the best. Her dance moves were amazing though. Her flexibility and being able to adapt to both styles of dance were incredible.This movie was made for teens. So why are older people criticizing it when teens are loving it? Yes, we get to stare at a gorgeous boy for an hour and half. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THAT. This movie really makes you want to get into dancing. I kept thinking about it all night.Go see this movie. It is by far one of my favourites of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Step Up,"Some people say they're tired of dancing movies, but not me. If you ignore the fact that there's other dance movies you'll enjoy this one. I guess you can say some of the dance movies are the same but what does that have to do with enjoying the flow of the movie? The story is.....well I guess you can decide on that. A girl needs to have a dance routine to impress spokespeople for dance companies, so she needs to have a good routine to impress the people so she can get a job with one of them instead of going out to college. But her main dance partner hurts himself so who will take her spot? Some punk from another school who got caught vandalizing her school so he has community service at her school. So it ends up that he becomes her new partner and they fall in love but she has a boyfriend so there's conflicts.The acting in this movie was good and bad. First off all each of the cast acted well. They each pulled their own weight. But but them together and they fall apart. The main two people didn't have chemistry, and you didn't believe that a guy like that could get with a girl like that in that type of scenario.Now where the movie gets good. The dancing and music. First of all the soundtrack is amazing. I loved every song they had in this movie especially how they took 2 songs and mixed it to make it sound a lot better. Even though other movies have done this before I really enjoyed the music in this movie especially. Now about the dancing. The choreography is really great. The directing of all of it was amazing. You have to give the people who played the kids in this movie kudos for being able to do that. It's amazing what some people can do.Overall I loved this movie. Yes I am a guy who loved a dancing movie, just to show you how this movie can appeal to everyone. I would really recommend seeing this.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Same old dance moves,"You really can't fault ""Step Up"" with at least having its heart in the right place even if its trite dramatic elements overbear it as a whole. Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) is serving a 200-hour community service for the Maryland School of Arts after getting caught trashing some of the school's props during a late-night vandalism. Soon, in a twist of events, he finds himself teamed up with Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan), a ballet dancer in her senior year, for the school's showcase wherein lie their futures.Directed by choreographer Anne Fletcher and written by Duane Adler and Melissa Rosenberg, ""Step Up"" is weaved to the formula of cookie-cutter dance movies that's a dime a dozen nowadays. Overstuffed with too many plot lines and directed without much fluidity, the film doesn't break new grounds or usher anything that hasn't been shown in, say, ""Take the Lead."" The actors can only do so much but they can't step up from a movie full of stock characters and typical subplots. Troubled guy who's capable of doing something great. Girl unbelievably dating a guy who doesn't deserve her. Black Americans who sulk at social prejudice. Mother who ""wants the best"" for her child but can't see that what her child does is what's the best for her.The chemistry between Tatum and Dewan is as active as that of a helium with a neon. Tatum is so stoic in mumbling his lines. As for Dewan, while she is no high-caliber actress, she has a rather effervescent presence that translate prettily on the celluloid.Perhaps what would have made ""Step Up"" a much more compelling film was if it paid more attention to the area it's tackling and making it more innovative. There's nary a persuasive composition (or at least none that I can remember) as most of the choreography consists of body shakes, lifts, turns and pirouettes. A standing ovation has never felt more conspicuously staged.As it is, ""Step Up"" ends up as just another familiar piece that stocks on its shallow characters, their clichéd episodes, and the diaphanous ending Hollywood constantly obligates.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A stylish drama that ends with a great dance routine,"I love musicals. And I love modern dance. This film isn't really a musical so much as a drama about the emotional world of young passion and conflict, and reaching for your dreams. In the final segment, there's a great dance routine. I would have like some of those wow moments that showcase the actor/dancer's abilities in between instead of waiting through the whole film. No doubt this is why Step Up 2 became one of those rare sequels that outshined the original film I'm reviewing here - it has a lot more dancing drizzled in to the main story.As a not so young person who has always loved dancing and can appreciate young people, I found this film entertaining with a great cast. At the time Step Up was filmed, the crossover trend of street and fine arts was new and, with that in mind, this film was really a huge success when it came out. A lot of people compare this to Flash Dance or Save The Last Dance. Yes and no. Step Up has elements of the poor-meets-upper class in Flash Dance and Save with the inexhaustible guy-gets-girl scenario. But I feel it borrows from films like Greece and West Side Story, as well. One reviewer mentioned Step Forward but I wasn't able to find any dance films with that title, although it is a common cha-cha move: Step Forward; 2 steps back. But let's face it, the goal of any film with dancers is to get to the finale.There's one very sad scene that I felt took the film a lot further in a different direction. But, obviously, the producers felt it was a necessary lens on the very worst of the inner-city problems as well as a catalyst to some decisions the characters make for themselves. Overall, the film isn't too deep, otherwise, and just insinuates the highs and lows of the different characters with a focus on the main characters.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
movie review for step up,"It is so ironic how this movie reviews is supposed to be like a small English class project for me but, hey it's worth it after all. I love the movie. At first, I was a bit skeptical about spending my hard-earned money at the theater to go watch some two folks dancing like little kids. To make things worse I was there on a date so I prayed the movie better be good or I'll get a refund, if my date sleeps out on me at the movie room. Tell me you knew that was a joke.The movie is definitely entertaining. The feel of romance it had to it was great. Things got a little bit emotional when a young boy died in that movie and I didn't even realize that I was getting attached to the movie characters already. It's a must watch everybody. You will love it. If you don't, then I'll give you the refund. That's another joke again guys.",,Anonymous,Music

"if we extremely want something,  we can get it..","it's a really good and educational movie.. it shows that if we want something really, really much, we need to chase our dreams.. sometimes it's hard, but without effort, we can't manage anything.. Tyler (Channing Tatum) is guy who doesn't get through with all started things.. so he gets 200 hours community service in Maryland school of the Art, which changes his opinions bout the lift.. it's not only school's sway, it's also pretty dance partner Nora (Jenna Dewan) which helps Tyler to understand what he wants to get of his life.. and now he's fighting for something for the first time in his life.. moreover, he starts appreciate the values of this life.. it's not another teen movie with some stupid jokes, all time parties and drinking.. in my view, it's more serious than we imagine, because there a lot of people in whole world who don't have patience to get from their lives all that they want.. in general, it doesn't depend on your family's incoming.. if you want to realize your dreams, you go ahead and make them real..",10.0,Anonymous,Music
What I think,"Everyones thrashing this movie, but i l-o-v-e-d it! The characters all had great personality and were realistic. It reasonably showed the difference between a high life and lower life. It did have a couple plot lines going at once but they all fit in at the end. Being a dancer myself i enjoyed every choreographed part of this movie and the finale at the end was amazing. This movie was awesome and it even has inspired me to go further into my dancing career. This movie was serious but it also had humor in it which everyone loves. Hahaha i never knew that Channing could dance but him and Jenna were both amazing at dance and at acting. This movie had also had a couple love stories in it which everyone always loves. And of course it had a happy ending. The one thing that i didn't like was how there was to much hes in, wait no hes not in, hes in,nooo he quit again with ""tyler"".

Every second chance begins with a first step.,"The film follows the tale of the disadvantaged Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) and the privileged modern dancer Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan), who find themselves paired up in a showcase that determines both of their futures. Realizing that they only have one chance, they finally work together.So, this is one of fifty million other dance movies released a few years ago. But this movie has a twist: there's a new dancing style! If you wonder why people keep making dance movies, there are always new dancing moves from each new dancing movies. People really go to see dancing films to see the dance sequences and not the plot, and I won't blame them for that.Obviously, the highlight of this film, along with several other dance films, are the dancing sequences. I must say, they're really above average. I would say the score is also very good. Now for the plot, you are right if you think it's predictable and clichéd.Other than that, there's no reason to see or not to see this film. If you want to, go. If not, don't go.

I don't need people givin' me crap for liking a chick flick b/c this is NO chick flick. The stuff that goes on in Tyler's life outside of school does not qualify as 'chick flicky'. The basketball playing, the underground parties, the downtown life, the carjacking. None of this stuff can be present in a true chick flick. This movie is hardcore and I don't want an opinion until you see it. I had people giving me crap as soon as I walked out of the theater and they hadn't even seen it yet.

A recommended movie if you want to unwind.,"Wow, if you want to unwind, I recommend this movie! Though some scenes are somewhat of a cliché, but there are so many good morale you can pick from it. The soundtracks are good, matched up with really groovy dance moves.Tyler is both hot and cool! He's a darling, with the fed up aura and an eager spirit. He's a typical juvenile delinquent who's willing to dance ballet to prove his worth. Ain't that sweet?Nora is a really good dancer. Two thumbs up!Miles and Lucy make a good pair, too. They portray humility and real talent here.I hated Mac at some point and I wanted him out of the picture (for being such a bad influence) but I guess that makes this movie a good drama,too. Skinny, his li'l brother, is an innocent but trying hard little boy and he really played it well.I don't normally make a review after seeing the movie once or twice and it takes quite a long time for me to figure out whether or not a movie is good (there are several factors to consider), but I tell you, I've seen this movie more than 10 times and my impression is still unshakable...

wasn't that great but not bad,"I watched this movie but wasn't really expecting to watch it at all. this movie wasn't such a good movie. Before i watched this movie i didn't have high expectations for this movie because many dance movies seem not to be great. So i was right, step up wasn't such a good movie, it was alright and enjoyable at times but wasn't really entertaining. That female main character can't act, it's so fake. The dancing in the movie was nice. The storyline isn't that good neither, it seemed rushed and really weird. There were a few parts of the movie that is confusing...and the setting of this movie is of a high school...its stupid, the actors CLEARLY look like they're in their 20's. They should have switched that and just make them college/university students. There was also some funny parts that I enjoyed like when Channing (Tyler) was goofing with his friends, and how he acted towards the female. I was a little surprised that there were some serious drama scenes that should not have been included (ex. Tyler's friend's little brother murder scene- really bad to show, made no sense) Overall, I think this movie is pretty decent for people that enjoy dance movies and are fans of Channing Tatum..so Id recommend it",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Step Up... gets my Thumbs Up.,"This was a very refreshing movie to view. I think the director took good care in exposing each character's strength's and weakness. I found myself cheering for everyone to ""get it right"". The ending made it all worth the ride. Beautifully done. We need more movies like this not just in the theater's but on television also. It's good to see the arts being portrayed as a blend. The way the cultures blend in a large city, broadening their base to reach out and touch everyone, insuring the survival of its being. Through out the movie you keep wanting to shout to the main characters to step up, don't stop, keep going, meanwhile you feel their pain and understand that this just maybe, all there is for them. Then they show that they have more to offer, you scream with them... yeah! That's what I am talking about! If the movie doesn't move you, the music will.

A daily comment from Midget Emma: Step Up (2006),This is one of the better dance films. This time a hip hop dancer gets pushed into the world of ballet and a rich kid dance school.I am not a fan of dance movies but the Step Up movies seem to be the best ones out there.There is bad acting and no chemistry between the dancers. The dances were well done but the movie felt rushed. It did have its funny scenes.This should satisfy any person who likes the dance genre. The dances were good so i would see it.

I got very excited with the dance sequences, as the leads are very talented dancers.I'm 32, so I grew up with brilliant 80's teen dance movies, such as Girls Just Want to Have Fun and Dirty Dancing.

Definitely a feel good movie!,"As with anything of the arts, it's personal taste. While the plot was simple and somewhat predictable, it was brought off beautifully by spot-on casting. If someone is expecting the acting prowess of Harrison Ford or Meryl Streep, they're watching the wrong movie. That's not what Step Up is about. But if you want casting that befits the roles in the movie to a tee, this is your show. I'm definitely not into chick flicks and wouldn't categorize this as one.

Step up was surprising!,"The title of the film is 'Step up'. The first time I went to see this movie was in the cinema. I saw the movie three years ago with the Chiro. But I saw the movie several times. The film is directed by Anne Fletcher. The main characters are Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan. The genre is drama, music and romance. Step up won in 2007 the ' Teen Choice Award' and was nominated for the ' Young Artist Award'. The movie was filmed in the USA in 2006.The story is about Tyler and his friends going into an art school and destroying the stuff there. When he gets caught he needs to do a community service, cleaning up the school. Everybody thinks he is a failure until Nora discovers his dancing talents. Nora is busy with putting her showcase together when here dance partner gets injured. She takes the risk dancing with Tyler, who has a total different style of dancing. He even makes some improvements to her choreography. Nora found the new choreography so good that she decided to do her showcase with Tyler.I tought it was a good film because there's a strong storyline in it and because there are several genres mixed in the film. The Music that is used in the film is also very good, I like kind of music. But it's great that the film ends in an other way than you should think, I liked that a lot!

Great dancing talent for all ages to watch,"Although I'm way, way past a teenager, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The dancing is great and really attention grabbing. If I see it on the schedule, I try to catch, at least, the finale which is, to me, fantastically choreographed. The acting may not be Oscar worthy but I don't have anything bad to say about it except for Rachel Griffiths. She seemed to be holding way back and was very, very flat. I find that strange because I really enjoy her on Brothers & Sisters.It was nice to see a a location of Baltimore - not NY or LA. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie that I just happened to come upon one weekend on cable. Not too sappy or too violent or unbelievable. If you like to watch dancing, you'll like this movie. If you are open to all kinds of music, I think you'll like it.The social statement to me is that with hard work and the luck of an opportunity to participate in the arts can drastically change a young life.

"I totally liked the movie, it wasn't what I thought it would be.","I thought this was a pretty good movie. I had no idea that someone would end up being killed in this movie. All I expected from this movie was just a guy with a past and now he is trying to change for the better. This is where the dancing comes in. But I found that it was not just about the dancing. You can actually learn a lot from this film. It tells you to go for your dreams, whether it be dancing, singing, or what not. It teaches you to do what you love to do, and not just what your parents would like you to do. It teaches you to be work hard for what you want. It also teaches you to know when to enough is enough, meaning, do not keep making the same mistakes. To know when it is time to change and move on to good and better things. I thought this movie was also very entertaining. The dancing was awesome. I, myself love to dance, especially if it is a choreographed dance or not. It was actually the dancing of this movie that caught my attention. But, like I said, it is more than just dancing. So watch it and you can find out for yourself. =)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie really Stepped Up,"So what did you guys think? I thought well her read my comment then maybe that will pursue you and just maybe I hope cause it's a gr8 movie you will watch it and those you have comment!This movie was above all the movies that I have ever watched. It is a movie not only directed at kids,teenagers or adults that like to dance but a movie for all. Step Up shows that two different people from totally different backgrounds aren't that different from one another!Channing Tatum played the role as Tyler Gage he really busted some tight dances moves. Nora Clark was played by Jenna Dewan she moved across that floor like an eagle in the sky. Step Up has a great moral behind it, all you have to do is listen and think about things on a completely different way, be 3 Dimensional.My friends and I thought that this movie and the choreography was taken to a completely different level!It's amazing how directors and producers script writers and all that Jazz, know exactly what to put into the movie. Watch Step Up I watched it like a million times. A movie worth crying for! WOW!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

sexy Channing,"this movie was so good. it was so good that i had to see it twice. Channing Tatum is so sexy in this movie.my favorite part of this movie was when Channing was lying on the bed and his little sister comes in and his but just lifts up because Channing Tatum has a very sexy butt. I also liked the ed when he was at the showcase and he told the girl that he was fighting for something real for the first time those word sounded so real. then when she let him dance... there are no words to describe how he looked dancing except for amazing. he is really good at it, almost as if it were natural and like he'd been doing it for years. Keep it up Chaning you look amazing. Keep doing what your doing are amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Again, a must see for anyone who likes movies like this you will not be disappointed and those two make a sexy couple in it too damn he is hot that is for sure Channing Tatum damn hot for sure and a great actor too.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A well made movie..,"This movie was worth watching. I really enjoyed this movie because they all had good roles and they made the movie really good which I enjoyed,the dancing wasn't as good as I thought it would be but still it was really good,the songs were really good,Thye had good beats and it made you feel like dancing,The message in these movie is really about doing better.After skinny died his brother and his friend realize that what they are doing for a living is really not gonna help them get anywhere in the future and that they know that they can do better than what there doing,so they both change their life's around.Overall I enjoyed it because is not every day that they make a good movie like these one.If you are thinking on buying a good movie BUY THIS ONE because it got a message and is for everyone",10.0,Anonymous,Music
a girl and a boy love dancing,I think that this was a movie that never fails to bore you. i was always on the edge of my seat waiting for the next thing to happen. Jenna has extreme talent. i was impressed w/ Channing too. i found myself crying at the sad parts and laughing at the funny parts. when the music came on my friend was like why are you moving around so much. i just couldn't keep still. and the girl who played Lucy in it was such a good singer. and Mario was awesome in it too. i thought altogether that they had a great cast. i love all the relaxed but in style dance costumes Nora had. that was awesome. she had a different outfit on every scene basically. i was awesome. this movie was very well directed and Channing Tatum was totally hot. i loved this movie GO SEE STEP UP!!!!!!,10.0,Anonymous,Music
good movie SEE STEP UP,"oh my gosh! best movie ever made!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm a dancer and I'm absolutely in love with Channing Tatum!!! Seriously see this movie, i've seen it 3 times now..in the past week! u could never get tired of it awesome soundtrack amazing actors inspiring dances o man! i think I'm in love with a movie. this movie almost made me cry, and it made me laugh and made realize how much i love to dance and express my self in different ways. who ever invented this movie is a genius, i wouldn't even be mad if there was a sequel like an epilogue (nudge nudge wink wink) see it! see it! u wont regret it! the reason why i loved this movie, well i told u already I'm a dancer, so i can kind of relate to what Nora was going through. There was a whole bunch of amazing moves that i want to try and learn. Also the dance where the best i've ever seen in a movie! and the music that goes for it is amazing as well! (Good Job Sean Paul!) if you really love the dance movies another really good one is dirty dancing with Patrick Swazi, but it's nothing compared to step up! and believe i've loved dirty dancing since i was like 8! these movies have got to be the Best ever created!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
awesome sh*t,"OMG!!! This movie was so good. R u people on crack? i couldn't stop talking about this movie for weeks. I recommend this movie to all young girls and boys and women 18-48, especially if u like to dance. The guy is so hot, and Jenna is one of the most beautiful younger actresses i've seen in awhile. The talent portrayed was simply extraordinary. My mom usually doesn't like these kind of ""teen movies"", but even she agreed it was worth it. It's uplifting, funny, sexy, and the characters had great chemistry. The acting wasn't so good, but this movie is pure entertainment. LOVED IT!!! 10 stars, totally worth 10 bucks.

It really is the next generation dance movie,"I saw this movie this afternoon with 3 other girls and 3 guys and I wouldn't say it was bad. It wasn't perfect **he should have been shirtless more** but besides that it was a good movie. It brings 2 types of unique dances in one combined routine that was so good I wanted to literally get up in the cinema and dance, sing and clap.Channing Tatum is brilliant in this movie, although his character is much of a thug (which personally is a turn down for me) his role is really good and so is the script. It tells the lives of 2 different people with different taste, different homes, different families...but the one thing they share in common is their love for dancing.I'd really tell people to go see it because it shows the present generation of kids and teens. IT depicts to lives of them and it really shows you giving up is not the answer",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Saw it twice..,"i liked this movie. i thought that the trailer was kind of crap, but i went to see it because my friends were interested so i went along. I love the soundtrack, it is amazing and the dancing skill is awesome. i loved the actress who played Nora. The plot was interesting and not the arc type dancer movie i expected. overall a great movie, but the Ciara in the end kind of lessened the excellence. Channing was decent, he can act pretty well, but he didn't act much in this role. i feel like he could have been a bit more emotional. Jenna Dewan was amazing. the dancing overall in this movie was impeccable. the routines were amazing and kept you watching especially in the scene when Drew Sidora sang 'Til the Dawn. The soundtrack is mamzing, i couldn't wait to buy it, and i love every one of the songs. the actors were a bit old for their roles, but thats what you see in show business. I loved how Channing wasn't lovey dovey with his siblings, it made the movie more realistic. Some say that there were too many conflict, but he conflictsof the two separate lives made both of their lives seem to blend and i think that they show reality, where there usually is a lot going on in both of their lives. overall, i loved the movie. the dancing is amazing and i love Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
This year's Dirty Dancing,"You'll feel great and full of energy after you walk out after seeing this movie, Probably the same way you felt after seeing Dirty Dancing(1987). The movie begins with Tyler(Channing Tatum), a rough and tumble kind of guy, who is a great dancer, but seems to be having it rough. One night he and his friends break in a performing school, and pretty much wreak some of it. But Tyler gets caught, and his friends get away. His community service is that he has be a janitor to the school he wreaked. Tyler soon notices the beautiful dancer named Nora Clark(Jenna Dewan) who's partner gets injured. But Nora sees what an incredible dancer Tyler is, decides to give him a try. Lets hope they do well together. This was a great movie all over, great acting, great dancing, and great music. Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan have such beautiful chemistry together, I hope they will work together again someday.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
You Get What You Pay For,"So I went to see this last night and I don't think I've ever been in a room with so many other girls... Of course as the previews show this movie is somewhere between Center Stage / Save the Last Dance and it does its job well. They did an amazing job of getting people who could really dance from the first scene to the credits you could tell that those people could really move.When you go to see this movie I wouldn't expect the unexpected, there are no unbelievable plot twists but it is not predictable enough to be boring by any means. The main characters are perfect for each other and play off each other really well, and both are completely believable as the characters they playI hope you go see this you'll enjoy it, and even for the lack of testosterone in the theatre I can't see guys hating the movie for the girl is hot and its well put together and got a great soundtrack.My only complaint is that they didn't have his little sister dance more.. we all know she can move",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Critiques thus far unfair,"I'm not going to try and maintain that this is the best movie ever because while I think it's a great movie, it does lack the sort of depth of plot exhibited by something like Memento. But let's be honest here it's not that type of movie, and it's not intended to be that type of movie. It's intended to be a feel good movie with a ton of great dancing and it entirely delivers on that aspect.One, the dancing was amazing. I'm a ballroom dancer and like most people I enjoy my share of hip hop dancing though I'm certainly not trained in it. Irrespective of my credential or lack there of, I thought this movie exhibited some really awesome dancing. While it's easily compared to Save the Last Dance, this movie goes far beyond Save the Last Dance both in believability and in dance showcasing. I happen to still like Save the Last Dance, but this movie exceeds it in every way. Unlike many dance movies this movie shows an excellent and imaginative final performance as well as the training scenes throughout. It mixes ballet and hip hop in a seamless and unique way and the soundtrack is amazing.Furthermore, the acting in this movie was excellent. I know many people have been complaining about Channing's performance, but as someone who works for the Public Defender's Office specifically in juvenile court, I found his acting to be amazing. His acting was so true to life that I thought I was looking at one of my juvenile clients. People might complain that he was robotic or didn't show enough emotion, but you've got to realize the type of person he was attempting to be. He's not some upper-middle class expressive kid. He's an indigent kid who's had no childhood and is living in an environment where emotion is not exactly a quality you want to show. I walked out of the theater thinking I'd never seen someone express so much realism in a character, so I find it hard to believe that people are claiming that his acting was bad. I think instead that these people making those remarks have no idea of what the character he was trying to portray would actually think or feel or how they would act.All in all I think this was a great and enjoyable movie and while you shouldn't expect Lord of the Rings quality, you should also give it a chance before lumping it into the category of juvenile chic flicks most everyone else seems to have hastily decided it belongs to.And one final note - as to the person who said there were many better films that exhibited dancing - I'd really like to know what films he's referring to. Because it definitely wasn't Save the Last Dance and it definitely wasn't Center Stage and I'm just left wondering what else s/he's referring to.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
gong show,come on we all go to the movies to be entertained and this is one show i can honestly say did that for me. The main actors were gorgeous and funny its more of a girls-night-out show brilliant absolutely better than save the last dance. So for all you haters out there just stop hating i think we all need to give Hollywood a break here. There doin a fine job as it is i mean the dancing was mind blowing i wonder if channing knew how to dance somewhat before this movie or if he went through extensive training.Don't WORRY I've SEEN LORD OF THE RINGS. I'm NOT GOING TO END THIS 17 TIMES !!!!!,10.0,Anonymous,Music
My thoughts of the film compared to past dance films,"I keep it real in my critique!! This how I felt..1) Overall- Step Up was cool. It had likable characters. The character ""Mac"", Tatum's best friend in the film was the realest to me. It's like I've met him before. The dancing was hot. In the very beginning the ballet mixed with street was so hot! I loved how they showed both styles. Some dance moves were even similar. It's funny how both dance styles went with the music too. The last dance piece at the end of the film was an interesting mix of dance. I loved it.2. The main characters.Clearly ""Nora"" Jenna Dewan's character is a professional trained dancer unlike Julia Styles who trained for that role. I like both main characters in this case. But dancer wise, I HAVE TO GIVE UP TO JENNA SHE WAS GREAT!! Channing Tatum's personality came alive on film. He was funny with good sense of humor.As for dancing..he's not that great of a dancer, he's JUST OKAY. Every time I thought he was going to do something really amazing, he let me down. His back handspring in the middle of the dance floor was sloppy and no form to it. That particular scene in the club was cool except Tanning really didn't grasp charisma as I expected.I've seen ton of b-boys that would knock Tatum out in the first round of the battle. He was okay though.But Step up was more enjoyable. Save the Last Dance comes in second. The death of the character ""Skinny"" in Step up was NO surprise! The moment he started getting in trouble in the beginning of the film, I thought ""He's going to die, if not NOW then later on."" Some character in the hood ALWAYS have to die. The way Skinny died made no sense, he looked really stupid. At least back in the day in the film, Boyz N' the Hood Morris Chestnut's character died without it being his fault it was more tragic. Skinny's silly actions got him killed.If you're going to kill of a likable funny character at least let him go with some sense.FOR THE RECORD SAVE THE LAST DANCE WAS NOT THE FIRST INTERRACIAL FILM WHERE TWO DANCERS MEET FROM 2 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORLDS OF DANCE..IT WAS BREAKIN' 1984. Ozone the b-boy meets contemporary dancer Kelly.It was street life meets privileged life. Done way before Save the Last Dance and Step up!! Classic films like Beat Street and Breakin' are too good to be categorized with modern movies today like Save the Last dance, Step Up and especially Honey.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The critics are idiots,"I've read quite a few reviews on this movie and I really don't understand why Step Up is getting such bad reviews. First of all, you don't go to a dance movie to see Oscar-worthy acting. Chances are, you want to see some dancing and Step Up blows away most dance movies out there. What Miss Fletcher did, contrary to other dance movies out there, was take dancers and make them act - not the other way around. I would rather see poor acting in a dance movie than poor dancing. The chemistry between the characters was believable, the cinematography was brilliant; there was some humor, some drama and most importantly, a good overall message for younger viewers. You can tell by watching that the actors had fun making this movie and because of that, it was fun to watch. Having said that, I would bring my son to see this movie in a heartbeat. I wouldn't have to cover his ears or his eyes - and nowadays - that's saying a lot. Its a good, wholesome movie and you'll be groovin' in your chair during the dance scenes. Its a shame that today's society gives Oscars to movies that have gay sex scenes and proclaim it a ""must-see movie"" but rip apart the decent ones and tell you not to waste your money on a movie like Step Up. I don't get it. Go see Step Up - I believe you and your family will enjoy it. Miss Fletcher is a class act and I can't wait to see her future movies. Hey Joel Siegel - I don't know what you're smokin' buddy - this movie gets 2 thumbs way up, baby.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) and Nora  Clark (Jenna Dewan) are two individuals that meet at an arts school and work together to make their dreams come true.,"I saw this movie with my best friend and I just wanted to say that it was one of my favorite movies of all time. At the end of the movie, all you feel like doing is dancing in the aisles. It was sort of a Save the Last Dance meets Dirty Dancing meets The Cutting Edge. Channing Tatum was so good, the dancing was excellent, and the story line wasn't stupid like most movies. It actually had a meaning that showed people that you have to chase after your dreams in order to make them come true. It did contain some scenes that would be unsuitable to young viewers, however. I thought this movie was great and I would definitely recommend anyone and everyone to go see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Step Up Inspiration to all-- have a dream--and go for it!,"I will agree with some of the complaints I've seen about the acting in the movie. But, although the acting wasn't top notch I will say that the movie had an incredible moral lesson/theme if you will--about different 'worlds' coming together and how the view issues in life so differently. It also spends a lot of time on understanding differences in daily life and issues between both 'worlds.' In addition this movie dealt with our need to be true to those we love around us as well as the importance of being true to ourselves. It teaches about choices and accountability for your action. I highly recommend seeing it! Oh, and the dancing was phenomenal. I myself tend to be inspired by the dedication and determination of those who put themselves out on display-- and the dancers performing in the movie were so inspiring and the story line so moving that I have seen it twice in the theaters already.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Love love loveee this movie and Channing Tatum (:,"I absolutely loved this movie and I got super pumped when I found out they were coming out with a 2 and now a 3! The dancing amazes me and every time I watched them do a dance routine it made me wish that I would've stuck with dance when I was little so I could do some of the moves they did. Channing Tatum being one of the main actors in this movie made it all the more better of course (: I think this movie did a good job of showing that anybody can do anything they put their mind to. For example, in the movie Tyler (Channing Tatum) lived in a foster home just causing trouble all the time and after he started working so hard on the dance numbers, it paid off in the end!I can't think of much I didn't like about this movie, it was awesome all around! I could've done without the shooting in one scene because that made me sad and I always have to turn my head when that part comes on. They also should've been clearer about the whole foster home thing because I couldn't figure that part out for a long time, I always thought he lived with his family. Other than that, the movie was great!!I would compare this movie to Dirty Dancing because I recognized a lot of the same dance moves in both movies. The dancing is pretty dirty in both movies but that's what attracted my attention, no one wants to watch ballroom dancing on the big screen. I would say I enjoyed the drama and plot to Step Up more though!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Nutshell Review: Step Up,"I think I'm fast becoming a fan of the dance genre. The moves and the music just gets to me, be it Mad Hot Ballroom styled documentaries, or street hip hop, or a fusion of both, like in the recent Take The Lead. Step Up is one such movie, full of youthful energy that makes you want to stand up and do a jig or two.The storyline though is nothing to shout about. It stuck to formula with leads that don't get along, and yet fitting like a glove as they heat up both the dance floor as well as one another's hearts. It's your usual bad-boy-good-girl pairing, with inspiration rubbing off each other, and the usual white-trash and upper strata of society mix and exploration of differences, or maybe perhaps, some similarities. Like its dance moves, the story's a fusion of improvisation and structure, so despite the tinge of familiarity, you'll probably forgive it as it allows you to do a quantum leap to get headlong into the scheme of things.But what struck me is how similar this movie's structure and lead character are to Eminem's 8 Mile, with the same mould of a ""white rabbit"" boy, from the underclass, trying to triumph against odds that he faces in his quest to do something worthwhile with his life. Replace 8 Mile's freestyle rapping with street hip hop dance, and you get Channing Tatum's Tyler Gage, the dude from the hood with hardcore dance attitude yo!This bro I can tell is gonna heat up the screens for the ladies in da house. You can hear silent female sighs each time he comes on to do his thing. If you find him familiar, yep, he was playing opposite Amanda Byrnes in She's The Man as the captain of the football team. Step Up's other lead is Jenna Dewan as the rich girl Nora Clark pursuing a dance career, and has to come up with some slick choreographed moves for her final year project to gain the attention of scouts from the industry. No prizes if you think you know who she has to turn to for help. There are various supporting characters, but I'd like to highlight R&B singer Mario's stint as a music producer-student who has this knack of rocking da house from tunes spun from his macbook (yep, product placement).But before you dismiss this as yet another run of the mill dance movie, it's actually both adequately entertaining, and fused with a right amount of drama, for character development purposes. Pursuing of dreams, of living up to promises made, of being there for friends, these are but some of the tired but tested sub plots that make its usual rounds in the movie.As always, you never really get to see the entire dance sequence during rehearsals, until the finale where it's full-dress-show-off time. And director Anne Fletcher, who choreographed moves for plenty of movies, pulls this one off brilliantly. It was well worth the wait, even if it all ended in a saccharine sweet manner.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Step up is a combination of dance and ghetto drama,"I went to this movie in the sneak preview. This means (for the people who doesn't know) that you go to movie without knowing which one. When the movie started I almost wanted to leave because I thought it was just another girl movie. I decided to stay because it would be weird to leave my date watch the movie alone. That just doesn't make a good first impression! :d Afterwards I didn't regret my choice to stay because I seriously liked the movie. Maybe it was a bit predictable, but the story was good. Two different people with two different backgrounds sharing the same passion, dancing. A combination of a romantic movie combined with life on the street is nicely combined.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Dance movie of the year!,"Tjis year I saw 2 dance movies: ""Take the Lead"" and ""Step Up"". ""Take the lead"" was boring. Plot was very outstretched. But ""Step Up"" was full of action and romantic. Dance and Hip-Hop rhythm makes this movie idiosyncratic.Channing Tatum shows us he's acting in ""She's the Man"" and I was exited to see that movie. In this movie Channing Tatum act not that good as in ""She's the Man"", but he has some good dance moves. Jenna Dewan had horrible character in ""Tamara"" movie. This movie makes her to back in good way of acting. The both are great actors and they will be better in the future...Soundtrack was stylish. Even Ciara with her ""Get Up"" song had perfect return to music business.Anne Fletcher had a good debut like Director.

It seems to me that the era of modern dance films began with the films ""Step Forward"" at one time, thanks to this film I had an incredible motivation for dancing and self-belief, I am insanely grateful to the creators of this film, I think without it, I would not be a professional in my favorite business.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Step Up Steps It Up More Than A Notch,"As with any dance movie, there is a little bit of the dream element happening. The story inevitably involves some sort of rags-to-riches aspect, hopefully at least one spicy character, and the music and moves to back the threat. Step Up has it all, and also showcases enormously palpable chemistry between the two lead characters. The movie not only oozes sex appeal, but sends the viewer to a universe where the music is funky and edgy, the characters all represent in some way and rescue each other, and one can truly step up to a level of self-actualization. It's the kind of place this viewer would like to escape to every once in a while, and tear up the dance floor the way the characters in the movie do, with the same style, passion and aplomb. If dance movies are your thing, you won't want to miss this one. And if they're not, you might just feel a spark through your veins this time around.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The most significant and amazing dance movie. Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan are anchors of this movie,"There is this young man who has a second chance to build up his life after vandalizing a performing arts school.

They work together to secure their futuresStep Up is not just about dancing. It's about how you live your life by embracing the parts of who you really are. Like this young man, he's offered a second chance to build up his life after leaving his delinquent life.Without Channing Tatum, which was his breakout movie, and Jenna Dewan, it would not be enjoyable. Their charismas carried the entire movie and its storyline. Plus, the storyline was also enjoyableNot to mention, the choreography and music was amazing and great.

This movie was damn good.For an extra fun time, turn the movie into a drinking game:A shot for every time there is a reference to him not making it in the dance world.A shot for every time there is inter-racial tension.A shot every time the lead girl is wearing an awful outfit.A shot every time there is an awkward almost-kiss.A shot every time there is a reference to the main character's slummy life.A shot every time you predict some outcome and then it comes true.I gotta say, I loved the movie!10/10!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Just incredible...I will surely go see it again and buy the DVD lata!!You got to conclude your summer vacation with this incredible movie. Will make the girls cry and the boys shout!!!

I went with my family and everyone liked it! anyway I am just saying that it an unforgettable movie ( a bit like titanic... without the deadly part) XD,10.0,Anonymous,Music
Awesome movie!,"I thought this was such a good movie!!! I have seen it twice, but both times I thoroughly enjoyed it. Although it didn't have a super-deep plot, I liked the dancing and the leads. It was obviously better the first time, but I just had such a great time going to see it. I think adults and kids alike would enjoy this movie, so I am realllly glad that I saw it! I also like it because I dance, so seeing it up on the screen really got me into the movie. It was very entertaining and the acting was awesome. The only thing is that Channing Tatum has the tendency to not show emotion. But everything else was pretty good, so I would definitely recommend this movie to someone. Also, Channing Tatum was HOT!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Great movie!,"I absolutely LOVE this movie!! Maybe cos I love to dance but yeah. Channing Tatum is so hot! I just love him! Jenna Dewan was awesome in the movie too! 2 completely different people in different worlds! And different interests(except for dancing) find each other! aw how cute! anyway i LOVE this movie! I'm buying it on DVD and I would TOTALLY recommend it! The actors and actresses are great! And it is so sad when skinny dies! It's sad, romantic, and you never know what's going to happen next! It's a fun movie! If you haven't seen it, I suggest you do! You have no clue what you're missing out! It's my all time favourite movie! I can watch it over and over and never get tired of it!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Easily one of the Best movies of the summer,"Step up has my vote for best movie of the summer. While being a big fan of dance, this movie has it all. Drama, romance, action, murder, comedy and of course, stellar dancing. More of a chick flick, this movie may be entertaining for male dancers as well. This is a definite summer must-see. The storyline is simple yet effective and two young, budding actors, Jenna Dewan and of course, Channing Tatum, do an excellent job stepping into their roles as the main characters higher-class Nora and troublemaker Tyler. You can feel the chemistry and the talent these actors have make the movie THAT much more enjoyable. The music is very suitable for the story and a very good family movie. No nudity or foul language, with only a couple kisses thrown in. This is for sure summer 2006's theatre must see. Two thumbs up.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I'm a grandma and loved 'Step Up',"This was a very entertaining movie. Even though it portrays hip-hop music it did not have foul language blaring so loudly that you could not think past the music, as many of the dancing movies have. The dancing was terrific and I couldn't be still in my chair and wanted to jump up and dance with them. At first I didn't care for the Tyler character but after getting into the movie I loved him. This movie still gives me a good feeling about life in general and hope that those who have a less enchanting life would recognize as Tyler did that if you want something badly enough, you only have to work for it. Channing Tatum will swoon you if you let him.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
loved it,yeah i pretty much loved this movie... don't no why everyone hates it. i thought the dancing was pretty good and channing tatum definitely made it even better. wow he is hot! and i'd never heard of jenna dewan until i saw this... she is a great actress! now one of my favorites! she hasn't done many movies but i hope she continues to do more. i thought the whole plot in this movie was really good and the acting was great. comparing it to you got served.. well the acting in that movie i thought sucked. it was alright though. but this one... ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. i went to see it twice and i can't wait until it comes out on DVD. and i definitely encourage people to go see it cause everyone i know loved it!,10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Best !,"I loved the movie step up ! I dance and I guarantee if you dance you will like it to. In some parts I was tapping me foot along to the beat and in others I wanted to get up and join in dancing. It was a great movie ! I suggest that if you have not seen this movie and are looking for a good movie to see that you see this. I also suggest you will enjoy this if you dance, or like movies that people dance in, like I do that you should see this. It was the best movie I have seen this year. so I enjoyed this movie and I am almost positive that everyone else who has seen it or is going to see it also had enjoyed it or will enjoy it and have a great time. I'm not going to spoil you by saying anything, you will have to see it for yourself...ha ha",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Movie,I have seen this movie 4 times with different members of my family from ages 13 - 43. Everyone of them loved the movie. It is good to be able to see a movie with a message that doesn't contain sex and drugs. Even though there was some violence it wasn't overkill. The theater was relatively full on two of the four occasions. I will definitely buy this movie to watch at home. It feels good to be able to see a movie with a teenage grandchild and feel completely comfortable and not embarrassed.I have never heard of any of the actors but thought they did a good job.,9.0,Anonymous,Music
A regular chick flick!,"This movie made me smile! I really like the young energy in Step Up. There are conflicts that are pretty lame, but the end of the movie ties everything together. This movie is very predictable, but most movies are these days. Personally the energy and the romance is what brings this movie to my favorite! I feel that this movie is kind of the same as Take The Lead. Save The Last Dance. Honey. But at the same time, it is original in its own way because of the other conflicts that come up throughout the movie. Even though some people may think it is a lame movie and totally set up, I still find it original and something easy to watch. It's not only a chick movie, thats for sure. Anyone can watch it, even teen guys. So if you haven't seen this movie, I definitely recommend watching it because it is a way of escaping and getting interested in the characters and what goes on in the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
An inspiration,"Step Up was an AMAZING movie. It starred Channing Tarum- need I say more? This movie was so inspirational, I am a dancer, and I encourage all dancers to see this movie, it really helps you follow your dreams! The dancing in this movie is incredible, it also contains very catchy and entertaining music! This was seriously the best movie I have ever seen. There was a lot of drama in this movie, with just the right amount of comedy, entertainment, sympathy and fascination! It was such a catchy movie, I found myself wiggling around in my seat, it really makes you want to get up and dance! I also loved how it's not too little girl in pink ballerina tights, it had some gangsters in it which made it all the better. This was a FABULOUS movie, go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Amazing!,"I totally love this movie! I watched it with all my friends and then we went and watched it 4 more times. Channing is amazing in this movie! I love it better than She's The Man! I normally don't watch movies that are like this but when I saw it was about dance I just knew I had to watch it. Especially since it has Channing in it I knew I would love it. Also with Jenna Dewan in it I knew it was a major must see! Plus with the fact that Mario is in it is a good thing. I have liked Mario since Destination Fame in 2004. He is an amazing actor and singer. Also since Glory Road I knew I had to see every movie with Damaine Radcliff in it. He is also an amazing actor but he isn't better than Channing. Over all, I loved the movie and I loved the actors.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Agree w/Trippin Zig, fun film & her wardrobe's sick","Agree totally w/Trippin Ziggy, great movie if you love dance and can get past the cheese factor. The obligatory final dance is well choreographed, efforts to conceal male lead's dance double aren't too obvious (ie having her look out window at him dancing...v. clever), and T-Zig is right, her outfits are adorably quirky. Wish I had her wardrobe and her pirouette...enjoy this movie every time they make it!Seriously, it would be nice if someone made a realistic movie about small-company/gypsy dancers...something neither as self-consciously arty as The Company nor as formulaic as Step Up, Save the Last Dance, etc. etc. Maybe I'm looking for a documentary or something close to it. Would also nice to understand better the life-after-dance of those who have done it successfully...the teachers, coaches, and so on. There's an entire cable channel called Classic Sports...other than replays, it's interviews with ex-players. Where is Classic Arts?",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A promise kept,"this movie was maybe not promising much but it kept every single thing. it had some great music in it which accompanied some pretty good dancing. it had good looking and talented people in it. singers, dancers, actors. it had a simple story but it was told very well. it was full of clichés but most of the time I just didn't mind. it was funny. the best was definitely the annoyed little ballerina girl. and tights. and it had this really steamy love story. Channing and Jenna look great together whether they are dancing, kissing or simply pretending they don't care. and the rest of cast was really good too. the movie was visually great and as entertainment A+",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Dance Movie!,"Oh my god! I'm a dancer myself, and this is such an awesome movie, whether you're a dancer or not. There's some awesome choreography in here, that's enough to make any dance-freak run for their I-Pod afterward. Not only that, but the acting was much better than some new movies. Plus, the fact that the actors really could dance was an added bonus. With all of the new talent movies that require stunt doubles and voice-overs, it's such a huge relief to see actors and actresses truly performing the dances.Step Up has backbone, a moral, a storyline....and Channing Tatum of course...which really should be enough reason for anyone to go see it. I've already gone to see it in theaters twice and plan to see it again if I can, if you haven't seen this movie yet, you don't know what your missing!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
An excellent movie that isn't getting enough attention,"I think Step Up isn't getting enough attention. I thought it was an excellent movie. I am a dancer, so of course I loved it!! But that's not the only reason why I loved it. It was filled with just the right amount of drama, comedy, & romance. There was a little bit of scary in there, but overall I thought it was great. People say the acting wasn't very good, but what do you expect from people who are dancers?? I mean they're used to acting without words, & I'd rather have people that can dance and not act very well, than have people who act awesome & can't dance. But even I thought the acting was good. I didn't notice anything that could've been changed. I don't know what people were thinking when they posted these horrible comments. The movie isn't just for dancers or teenage girls, I saw 3 elderly woman who came together to watch it, & a grown male adult who came by himself. The dancing was absolutely amazing!!! I loved it! And it wasn't too much hip hop, it was just perfect! Everything tied together perfectly & overall the movie was great. It flowed very nicely!! So I loved it & I encourage people to go see it!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A really cool dance movie!,"I just saw Step up and i though it was a great movie. The music was fabulous and fitted the mood well. The two main characters were inspirational and very talented dancers. I really enjoyed the dancing although the acting was patchy at times. there are certainly a lot of clichés in this movie but Step Up does combine likable character, cool dance moves and an infectious rhythm. Channing Tatum (Tyler) also stared in She's the Man, but this movie really showed he had some talent in dancing. He stars alongside Jenna Dewan (Nora) and they definitely work well together. I recommend this to people over 13 yrs old and its the sort of movie that makes you want to start dance classes!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
I love a good Dance movie!!,"I really enjoyed the movie Step up. The previews did remind me of ""save the last dance"" and maybe ""flash dance"". I found the movie much better then those old movies. It was a feel good movie about doing what you Love. Also about having a Passion in life for something. I know a lot of adults that do not have a drive and motivation almost like the character at the beginning of the movie, but at the end He had found his motivation and was moving forward in his life. Channing Tatum has a tough upbringing in comparison to Jenna nice school and nice family home. They come together to embrace each other and show one another about life. Someone with no goals shows another how important it is to have goals and dreams. That is important for kids and teens growing up today. I was once a kid and I knew how to have dreams and aspirations. I love a good dance movie maybe because it involves doing what you love and Feeling Awesome about it.. I love the choreography in the movie. The ballet and street dancing was amazing. Great story. It may seem like all the others but it was original with itself. Yes, i am a dancer too :)",9.0,Anonymous,Music
I get it now -Enjoyed this way more than I expected to,"Okay, so now I get what all the fuss is over Channing Tatum. Holy yum! He is perfect for this role, in a predictable, fairly dumb, yet also utterly addictive movie.Channing plays Tyler Gage, a troublemaker and street dancer living with his foster parents, who after vandalizing an elite performing arts school gets the opportunity of a lifetime in the form of community service (janitorial duties) at the school. He then gets ""discovered"" dancing in the parking lot by ballet dancer Nora Clark who just happens to need a new partner and some fresh choreography. In turn this could gain Tyler the chance to earn a scholarship.The story here isn't super original but the dance sequences (and music) is really good, and watching Channing move in those loose fitting jeans is all kinds of good. The romance and side stories also sucked me right in. Ultimately I enjoyed this way more than I expected to. 03.13",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A movie with a theme that flows - certainly extraordinary,"Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) is a normal street teen who enjoys crashing cars, breaking stuff and causing disruption in general, along with his pal Mac (Damaine Radcliff) and Mac's little brother Skinny(De'Shawn Washington). One night the trio breaks in to Maryland Arts School's Theatre landing Tyler a $200 fine plus Community Service at the School.Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan), an aspiring dancer at Maryland School of Arts, is a senior with an upcoming showcase where important dignitaries of various Dance Companies will determine her future. Nora holds an audition for a dance partner after her original parter Andrew backs out due to a sprained ankle. She discovers Tyler's dancing talent and the two team up for her showcase.Tyler begins to take his passion for dancing seriously - the one thing he has ever taken seriously in his life. This leads him to Director Gordon's (Rachel Griffiths) office to inquire about transferring to Maryland School of Art. She demands he show her that he's worth the spot.A tale of achieving your ambitions, of change that one person can go through with the help of another, of trust, romance and above all: Dance! Its what the movie is about. It has a theme, something we don't see much of in teen movies nowadays. Its theme is Dancing and its very well followed throughout the movie.A feeble 5.5 rating on IMDb discouraged me from watching this movie at first. However, some of my friends urged me to watch it with them. I must admit I had quite a negative paradigm about ""Step Up"" and recently watching Channing Tatum's stiff acting in ""She's the Man"" didn't exactly have me too enthusiastic about it! After the hour and a half that I sat through it, my view did a 180 and all I could say was ""Bravo!"" The dancing routines are superb, the direction is pretty good, so is the choreography not to mention the unbelievably believable chemistry between Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum. I see people criticizing the acting in this movie, but I think its much better than most, maybe not the best they could come up with, but its pretty good. Channing Tatum does a much better job in ""Step Up"" than he ever did in any of his scenes in ""She's The Man"" He brought the role of Tyler Gage to life and boy, can that guy dance! The soundtrack, too, was splendid and sets the mood for the movie. Overall a job well done! I recommend this to those who have the tiniest bit of dancing genes in them.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"i loved it, Channing is hot!","I liked this movie, it was good to see Channing play a role where he had to dance. I didn't realize how talented he is. He can play sports but he can boogie as well. I went to see this movie because he's so hot and I'm totally satisfied that I did. There were some corny and cheesy parts but Channing made it worth my $9.00. It was kind of a mix of ""honey"" meets something else i cant think of right now. but it was a totally cute movie, it inspired me to start dancing again, the soundtrack is a hit, i've already bought it on itunes...i hope to see Channing in more movies where I can just drool and wish he was my man...in all honesty, he's not the best actor i mean i've seen better, but his looks and poise and style and fun personality make up for all that. great future i hope he stays around for a long time!!",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Channing and Jenna have such good chemistry and the dancing was INCREDIBLE! And I just loved the music! I don't think I've stopped listening to the soundtrack since I've seen the movie. Now that I've discovered I can watch movie clips, at school instead of doing schoolwork, I watch movie clips! If lusting after Channing is a sin...I'm not sure I want to be right! He is so handsome!

Best movie by far...,"This movie has to be the best i have ever seen! It has awesome acting, awesome music and just the best story line ever. It keeps you guessing to the end of what will happen next. It is an inspirational movie for all ages and it tells you fight for what you want no what. It teaches you that no matter what background you come from, Poor, Average of Rich if you fight for what you want or believe you will come out on top, and that you just quit things when It gets tough. It has an awesome start an awesome middle and the best ever ending. Even tho the ending is a bit predictable you will still love it. It has everything a movie needs, sadness, suspensions, happiness and some (but only a little bit) of down right predictable moments!

perfect,"This movie is not at all as it may seem. This is not a Dirty Dancing 5, nor is it a Save the Last Dance 2. It is very well balanced, Not too cheesy, not too cliché, and the dancing is very inspiring. The movie could also be seen as a good eye-opener. It dismisses clichés about today's society through its plot; not all students at fancy art-schools are rich brats, less fortunate young men are not a lost cause, dancing is a form of art, not just having fun, etc. Both lead characters are great actors as well as dancers; I'm sure we'll be seeing much more of Channing in the future.

Step Up: The perfect Chick Flick Dance Movie,"OK, so, I thought this movie was awesome. It was worth it just for the fantastic dance scene at the beginning, and the one at the end. Themusic was great, too.The plot was the perfect lame plot, the one that is so bad it's good. It was ridiculously predictable, like the writers went up to someone on the street with the premise, asked them what they thought would happen, then wrote that.But the lines are delivered perfectly for that kind of movie - if this was the first chick flick you ever saw, and you'd never read a romantic book, you would think this was a really awesome movie. And it's only boring to people who have ADHD or something, because something is always going on: it's a movie. There are a few longer-than-they-should-be montages, but I wouldn't call them boring, just annoying. And realistic? No, way, way no. Past unrealistic.

Dancing with romance,Step up narrates the love story of street dancer Tyler and ballet dancer Nora. Loved the chemistry of Jenna dawan and Channing Tatum. Jenna dawan is very charming and great dancer. Tatum was good in hip hop but looked uncomfortable in ballet. Step up also gives us a message that crime never pays. Only drawback I felt its predictable. On the whole step up is decent dance film.,9.0,Anonymous,Music
come on now...,"alright so everyone is talking about how this movie has the same plot as a bunch of other movies...and even if it does....so what? i mean do y'all really go into this movie with the expectation that it will be some truly amazing new movie and just completely redefine teen movies? I thought it was great considering what it was going for...and yeah its like Center Stage and Save the Last dance BUT mixing hip-hop with ballet I think makes the movie more interesting because, let's be honest, there is more of it in this movie than there is in Save the Last Dance...i'm not saying the movie should win awards or anything but if you go into it expecting it to be exactly what it looks like on the preview, it shouldn't disappoint you...i think people are trying too hard to read into it which is just really unnecessary in a movie like this...overall i say it was a great movie and definitely worth seeing if you like fun movies =D",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Step up,I thought this was a great movie because I love to dance and I love the cool moves they did. The actors were great and the plot was terrific. I saw it with one of my friends and we both liked it so much that we dressed up ghetto and acted out some of the scenes. I thought that Alyson stoner needed some more lines because she's pretty good at both acting and dancing. I liked it when Camille and Tyler get a little closer as a family. I'm a big lover of sad movies and there are some sad parts in the film. There is a shocking loss towards the middle of the film. He was my favorite character.This movie tells you to follow your dreams and never give up. I loved it. Channing Tatum(Tyler gage) was SO HOT!,,Anonymous,Music

I think that the director of this film casted the members well and they did a wonderful job acting. I enjoy dance and I always have; watching two different worlds of dance come together and collaborate the love for dance and the passion and love for one another.

Step up was worth watching,"This film was inspiring, exciting and even educational. I got around to watching this film with my friend one night, and as unexcited as I may have been, the film got better and better. This film inspired me to start dancing lessons because the dancing was amazing and beautifully choreographed. When I was watching it I couldn't help but try some of the dance moves. It also took me into the view of what teenagers living in those types of lifestyles (where music is their closest friend) grew up with, from and into. It may be a film about one boy and girl and that they meet each other through their dancing skills, but you get to watch them dance professionally and grow into a stronger relationship just by showing their strongest passion: to dance. If you have a slight thought of watching this film, I'd recommend it. Good music, too! Bring your dancing clothes, popcorn and a friend for this film!",,Anonymous,Music
