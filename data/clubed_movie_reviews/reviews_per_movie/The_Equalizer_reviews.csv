May the Blood Flow,"Denzel Washington is just great and The Equalizer belongs like the John Wick (Keanu Reeves) and Taken (Liam Neeson) movies to the new masterclass of revenge/vigilante movies. The Equalizer is a true to the heart successor of our former (or still) heroes of long gone times like Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Bronson: the king is dead, long live the king, so to say.The Equalizer is great stuff - if you like your action spiced up with a good shot of violence.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel nails it,"An intense and towering performance from Denzel Washington as one of cinema's best-acted action heroes is what makes THE EQUALIZER stand out from the crowd, although as a film it's also a very decent thriller. It's supposedly a big screen version of the '80s TV series with Edward Woodward, although think of it as your usual vigilante movie and you'll be closer.Let's be honest here: the plotting in THE EQUALIZER is nothing special, and the Russian mob make for clichéd villains. It's the execution where this film excels. It's not an action filled movie, but when the action hits it's hard and heavy, not shying away from crowd-pleasing violence meted out to the villains. The extended set-piece ending might be described as 'DIE HARD in B&Q' and loses the realism a little but, but until that point this is tough and gritty film-making.Aside from the excellent Washington, we get a fine bad guy performance from Martin Csokas, equally intense and the finest I've seen from him, and Chloe Grace Moretz is wisely kept off-screen for most of the running time, which I was fine with. The final shout-out goes to director Antoine Fuqua, whose effortless style makes this a graceful and thoroughly entertaining viewing experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel Washington made this film better than it was,"So I just finished watching Equalizer (EQ1) again, so I can watch Equalizer 2 (EQ2) for the comparison.It's too bad both films had the same director and writers, as they have a bad habit of dragging out the writing and the scenes. Both films at just over 2 hours is just way too long, especially in the simplistic singular plot or EQ1. However, that plot still worked, and mainly because of the entire casts especially Denzel Washington's performance(s). EQ2 certainly had better pacing and a more suspenseful plot - albeit predictable, however it had many plot issues and holes as well as some scenes that needed to be edited down. The new supporting cast was not as strong either.Which did I enjoy better? Probably EQ1 by a small margin, but they both got an 8/10 from me, as they each had their merits and issues. Nevertheless still enjoyable. I hope if they come out with a EQ3, they speed up the pacing within the writing and directing.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Stylish And Daring Action Thriller,"Antoine Fuqua's and Denzel Washington's paths collide once more as they come together to create a stylish and daring action thriller about a man with a mysterious past, whose quiet life suddenly turns into a rip- roaring adventure of guns and thrills. Both Denzel Washington and Chloe Grace Moretz give stellar performances and display perfect chemistry as two friends stuck in a world of crime and violence. Arguably Fuqua's best film since 'Training Day', 'The Equalizer' is a brutal and merciless tale that explores the Russian underworld on the East Coast and the corruption ties within the law enforcement of Boston's police department.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Gruesome at times, The Equalizer is a rewarding action film for every single Denzel Washington fan out there.","Rooting for a badass hero with a kickass attitude has never been as satisfying as watching Denzel Washington dish out some brutal punishment. This is exactly what you get in The Equalizer, an action thriller based on the late 80's TV series of the same name, but amped up with ultra-violent realism.Reunited after their collaboration in Training Day, Washington (received his first Academy Award in a leading role) and director Antoine Fuqua are back in this simple yet deadly effective action film. Using a Mark Twain quote about people who find their true purpose late in life, Washington plays Robert McCall, a loner and tragic widower with a mysterious past. On the surface, he is an amiable home depot worker who keeps to himself, indulging in conversations only when spoken too, and slave to some sort of OCD while remaining invisible to people around him. After befriending a Russian teen escort called Alina, (Chloe Grace Moretz all grownup), and discovering she is the victim of sexual abuse, McCall's nice-guy demeanor melts away to expose an aura reverberating layers of darkening complexity. There's a tightly restrained compassion in McCall's eyes, fighting a father-figure compulsion to do what he must, while Alina's is a muted plea for deliverance. This scene takes place in a diner they frequent in Boston, and it's the first of two powerful moments in the film. What follows is the film's first action sequence in a Tarantino-styled dialogue first, and blood splatter later, McCall dispatches Alina's Russian pimp and his goons. When news reaches Moscow, mob kingpin Pushkin sends Teddy (Marton Csokas), to clean up the mess. Covered with satanic tattoos, Teddy is anything but the moniker he goes by and with half the Boston PD on his payroll, it's just a matter of when and where McCall is eliminated. Or so they think.Having previously scripted The Expendables 2, Richard Wenk's story here is nothing new when considering McCall's proverbial 'set of skills', a comparison if you must, to certain characters Liam Neeson has played. On the other hand, there is a mechanism in place, partly due to the aforementioned OCD, allowing McCall a brief study of the situation before striking with lethal accuracy. While that sounds like a knock-off version of combat tactics employed by Guy Ritchie's titular hero in Sherlock Homes (2009), the payoff is watching McCall take out bad guys with improvised weaponry. It gets a bit hokey towards the end, with McCall using all manner of booby traps to slice, dice and blow up Teddy's dumber-by-the-minute henchmen. Having said that, it is still rewarding to watch Washington demolish enemy after enemy and this is largely due to Csokas' terrific portrayal of Teddy's loathsome nature. To that effect, the best scenes in the film are when Teddy and McCall are face-to-face and denting each other's armour with nothing but well written dialogues. One such scene is a powerful dinner table battering-of-wits, a taut reimagining of that iconic scene in Heat (1995).While humour and drama throw some light on Boston's mob controlled dirty cops, McCall's relationships with his colleagues, and even a short segment that suggests his origins as a trained killer, The Equalizer really shines with Fuqua's deft handling of action scenes. But topping it off is Washington in a vigilante role that is the best we've seen in years. Fans of Man on Fire (Washington opposite Dakota Fanning) and Léon: The Professional (Jean Reno opposite Natalie Portman), both films about male heroism influenced by female protégés, are in for a visual treat. Heck, who needs improbable superheroes when you have an average Joe with extraordinary capabilities and all without hiding behind a mask or costume? Although compelled to use the N-word, I'll just say – Ma man Denzel. . .doesn't disappoint and neither does The Equalizer.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Home Depot EQUALS a bad place to be while on Robert McCall's bad side,"In terms of an action movie I gave the equalizer a 7 but soon after felt the need to watch it again and then upped it to an 8. Why? We'll it's an action movie but yet there's no crazy car chases, there's no bombs or heavy big explosions every where. Really the only action scenes are the fight scenes and even they don't come that often. But when they do come they deliver. Denzel is as awesome as ever in these scenes and the creativity in these scenes are what sets it apart from every other action movie. The main character Robert McCall in an ex specialist of some sort, you don't know what at first but know that he's highly trained in something and is now working as an ordinary man working at Home Depot or home Mart as it is in the movie. He looks like just your every day man but can kill you with just about any everyday weapon. And he does this so calmly that big crazy car scenes and explosions would rake away from his character. A man that takes the bus to come kill a whole gang is pretty bad ass by any standard.As always I don't want to give spoilers but I do recommend this as a good wholesome action movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Really enjoyable movie,"For years now I've had people tell me I have to watch this and for whatever reason I've kept putting it off. Today I apologise, because this is a fantastic film and I really enjoyed it.What struck me straight away was that first 20 mins or so. I'm sold. It tells us the characters you can see where it's heading and it fished me in quickly. From then on it was just an insane and tense ride. What was great was that every scene had a purpose, there was no messing about, no filler scenes with no point. Everything meant something and that's a rarity in this day and age. The suspense by the way, wow. Had me on strings the entire time, never knew which was it was heading.I really enjoyed the characters as well. Denzel wasn't just this stereotypical action guy that went round shooting people. There was so more more to him, more complexity if you will and with that there was more to delve into. You definitely get a John Wick vibe to this movie and with the main character, so if you like that. You'll like this.Just a quick mention, I would have liked to have seen Elena/Teri more, I felt she had a lot of depth that could have been explored. I think my only I guess negative was that the villains ""evilness"" wasn't explained. Or explained well. Not sure if I missed it, but I didn't truly get why he was so ""evil"".But yeah, overall I really enjoyed my time watching this and I'll be jumping on the Equaliser 2 asap. Definitely recommend if you like an action. A very strong 8/10 from me today.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"If you love Denzel, and you loved Training Day, and your only wish was that that bad-ass could have been a good guy, then this is the movie for you!!!!!","The Equalizer is NOT Man on Fire. The Equalizer is NOT your typical action flick. Washington's Robert McCall is not self-destructive or addicted. Though there are great choreographed fights, special effects and fantastic explosions, The Equalizer is more Bourne than Bond. Denzel Washington portrays this ex-CIA operative, who is content to live a meticulously simple life. Quietly contained, but with ever-building intensity, Washington turns in another stellar performance.Chloe Grace Moretz, as the teenage prostitute, is a force...Antoine Fuqua, the directer who brought us Training Day, which earned Denzel his Best Actor Oscar, helms this movie with a steady hand. His direction of the drama and the action blend seamlessly, drawing us into the complexity of this character-driven piece.Robert McCall keeps to himself, content to live his ordinary life; he is every man's man. But, his steady moral compass, and strong sense of justice lead him back into the fray. This character is not infallible, and he is not looking for trouble. He just wants what's right.This film is a superbly acted, exciting and violent ride! In the pursuit of justice, there will be blood.

Above average action flick saved by Denzel Washington's great performance,"What holds this film back the most is it doesn't really do much to separate from all the other action flicks of a man taking the law in his own hands. The films plot isn't to bad its pretty simple and doesn't go anyway you wouldn't expect. The action scenes are solid bloody, gorey, and enjoyable to watch.But what I would usually critique as being slightly above average goes above average thanks to Denzel Washington's great performance. It's no Man on Fire but it's satisfactory nonetheless.It's a little to long considering the content of the film but it remains an enjoyable film, not great but not terrible.IMDb: 7/10

"McCall...NOT McClane!! Dark, edgy violence, as well as fantastic performances separate this action movie from the pack!!","Some reviews have characterized this movie as your typical, run-of-the-mill, action movie, nothing you haven't seen before....nothing could be farther from the truth!!This movie is based off the television series called ""The Equalizer"". It is about an ex-CIA operative who uses his special skills to help ordinary people who have no other recourse. This movie version of The Equalizer is more reminiscent of Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, and it is this that sets this movie above your typical action flick. In fact, in Mr. Damon's own words, The Equalizer ""...reminded me of the Bourne Identity, in that both are sophisticated adult, thriller franchises where the protagonists are capable of high-action exploits, but aren't running around in spandex."" Directed by the great Antoine Fuqua, the man who brought us Training Day, The Equalizer is a gritty and violent, suspenseful and superb action film. This movie is very character-driven, and Denzel Washington, who plays protagonist Robert McCall, gives another stellar performance. His character lives alone, keeps to himself, and seems to suffer from some form of OCD. Most importantly, McCall is not McClane! He is not a wise-cracking cop in the wrong place at the wrong time, but rather a quiet and complex character, whose sense of justice is awakened when a young girl is brutally beaten.This movie gives you everything you would want from an action film: guns, explosions and great effects. However, the violence and bloodshed in this movie are deserving of it's R- rating, and create this film's authentic feel. The excellent performances by the cast are also what raise this movie well above your ordinary action movie. Team Washington/Fuqua gives us a darker hero for darker times, and one you will cheer on every step of the way!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Colder Opportunities,"The Equalizer is loosely based on an 80s television series with the same name. This reinvention in comparison aims to be darker and much violent, but the film's ambition is basically turning its star, Denzel Washington, into a grittier action hero. It somehow pays off when he starts killing bad guys in cold blood, and it's amazing how he could still carry the character's humanity along the way. The film troubles when it gets out of hand to its glorious vigilantism despite it takes place in a world seems apart from that context. If you tend to ignore the sentiments and shade of reality, you can still tell that it's a pretty entertaining piece of action, but in general it's just difficult to not notice its mess of tones, even with that amount of fun.There is one side in the film when it's totally gripping, that is when we just see the protagonist as a person living in an ordinary life, often being with people and often encountering them getting in trouble by crime. This grounded world just keeps most of its darkness in their presence, sometimes feeling like a doomed, helpless world. But once the hero reveals what he truly is capable of, it doesn't actually sucks out its entertainment quality, but it does betrays that intriguing context, nearly turning itself into a superhero movie, except of course, it's less silly and much violent. McCall, in shorthand, is too competent for any criminal he fights and often leaves with a perfect swagger. It may not be big deal to many viewers, especially the action fans who are already enjoying the blood, but the film sets up an existing theme that seems to be a lot interesting to consider instead of indulging itself with its own way of justice.The cool slow-mos and stylish special effects might have also rob the sense of realistic tension, but put that aside, each action scene is watchable enough, we don't usually see a wider blockbuster today that has the guts to fearlessly show brutal movie violence like this. This is probably the only mundane element existing in those set pieces. Denzel Washington shifts his character to two personalities: one is the likable ordinary man himself and the anti-hero with a hidden cosmic hate through its world. The performance does sum up the overall movie, from gravitas to smugness, and what's great is they're both effective anyway. However, the villains (and their tattoos) have blatantly shown that they're evil: the main antagonist seems like he's written to be over-the-top, almost like a cartoon villain than a believable human mafioso, but Marton Csokas gives a little grimness as he have fun with it.The Equalizer would have been nicer if it was a little shorter and much consistent, but I could guarantee that it still entertains, it does have the appeal through its action and acting. Though, there are more serious things that could have made it a lot compelling thriller. The film does have the knack of embracing either of its elements, but it just keeps shifting back and forth, like we're not getting to the actual big picture. Well, if you can accept that the hero is this superior then it might work better for the experience. For now, it can be endlessly watchable, but you will only find few things that are remarkable about it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Welcome To The Black Rambo,"Fairly solid action scenes, characters and overall execution. Somehow the filmmakers and actors make this very hard to believe film enjoyable. This is definitely a sensationalistic film(The most sensationalistic of Washington's career without a doubt.), and it's mostly a regurgitated cookie cutter crowd pleaser of violent vengeance as well, but it does manage to remain quite an entertaining action film at the same time. Even though it has a running time of over two hours, the film does feel overall as though it is missing a few key scenes, but nonetheless it's still worth a look if you're into these kinds of films. The movie didn't remind me much at all of the old T.V. series of the same name. The film is much more reminiscent of some of the old brutally violent morality tales that Charles Broson use to do. All that said, this basically chalks up as a good film to watch when you don't want to think much, and you just want to watch a lot of kick ass entertaining violence. It's that kind of guilty pleasure. 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Washington nails it,"Antoine Fuqua's big screen adaptation of the 80′s TV series The Equalizer opens with an impressive tracking shot through an open window, and into the orderly and near empty apartment, belonging to Robert McCall (Denzel Washington). McCall lives a Spartan existence; for the first twenty minutes of the picture, he hardly says a word. Fuqua (Training Day) gives a lengthy shot as you watch McCall fold something delicately into a napkin. When you see him unfold the napkin at his regular diner, and place the teabag into a cup of hot water, you understand immediately that this man is a creature of habit, firmly set in his ways. Every night he's there, reading a book. He's such a regular, that he strikes up a familiar acquaintance in a young teenage prostitute, Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz)), which eventually grows into something of a friendship. There is something undeniably hidden within him, however. When he realizes the danger Teri is in thanks to her nefarious Russian pimps, he forgoes his cautious life, and willingly brings on the pain.Director Fuqua accordingly really brings on the style for these sequences. His relative quiet touches give way to mayhem. Before every murder McCall commits, the camera slows down, taking on a golden hue, and you literally see McCall breaking down every element of his victims: tattoos, facial expressions. And then he lets loose: even timing himself to see if he can voice dispatch Mafiosi in 30 seconds or less.And The Equalizer is undeniably fun. It's one of those thrillers that begins moody and atmospheric, and then decides it would be more fun to see how many people can be dispatched with nail guns or corkscrew openers; and it is similarly unconcerned with logic in the idea that McCall decides to take down the entire East Coast hub of the Russian mafia, simply over one teenage prostitute. But with Fuqua this stylistically assured, and Washington equally game, does it really matter?As Teri, Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick Ass, Carrie) forgoes the sarcastic strategy Jodie Foster used as a teenage hooker in Scorsese's Taxi Driver. Teri is arguably much more frightened of her violent handlers, and is less given to false bravado as result. And even though her character really amounts to little more than a glorified supporting part after she is sent away, she is a great deal of fun to watch, and she holds her own more than capably against Denzel Washington (The Book Of Eli). The habit of extended cameos in The Equalizer is even more extreme in the case of Melissa Leo as Robert's former CIA contact, who pops up to give a vital piece of information on the evil mobster, and to tentatively tiptoe around the subject of his wife, while offering a small measure of comfort. The bit part parade reaches ""blink-and-you-miss him"" cameo status, by casting a reputable star like Bill Pullman as Leo's husband, and giving him no more than four lines (though of course it's possible that this may be a larger part that met with cuts in the editing room).If anything, a weakness of The Equalizer is that McCall's troubled personal life is left as somewhat ambiguous. Who can blame it really? The opening aims for a quiet kind of profundity, and it succeeds, but isn't really interested in following through. For all its thin characterization, there is something just as nice in watching Denzel Washington coldly and calculatingly firing a nail gun in righteous vengeance.See more at: www.mediumraretv.org",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"An action packed two hours, it's worth seeing.","Robert McCall appears on the surface to be a mild mannered employee at a hardware store, but underneath his cool and calm exterior, he operates as a one man vigilante, fighting to defend those who can't defend themselves.I'll admit I was one of those that ground when this was first announced, as I've forever been a fan of the original TV series, Woodward made the role his own, but I have to say, I have always enjoyed watching this reimagining.With the third installment now in the cinema, it felt like the right time to dig this one out. It's an action packed, well paced, bloodthirsty two hour thrill ride.Denzel Washington nails it as McCall, it doesn't take long for him to establish as a character, we learn a lot about him very quickly. We know what he stands for, I was keen to learn why he does what he does, what motivates him.I really did rate Marton Csokas as Teddy, he is the stereotypical, cliché ridden villain, but he really did rise to the occasion, he's a bad guy you instantly dislike.Much better than the first, it holds up well, hard to believe it was released nine years ago, and whilst it is pretty violent in parts, the story is actually a very good one.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
good start but fight in Home Depot disappoints,"Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) has a mysterious past and is trying to live the quiet life working at a Boston home improvement box store. He helps his co-worker Ralphie lose weight to get the security guard job. He's friendly with street walker Teri/Alina (Chloë Grace Moretz) whom he often meets as he reads at a local diner. She ends up in the hospital after getting severely beaten up by her pimp Slavi. He tries to buy her freedom but ends up killing everybody. Violent Russian gangsters come looking for payback.This starts well even with the cliché-filled script. Denzel can pull it off. Chloe is the innocent and he's the knight in shining armor. The problem starts when Chloe disappears after the first act. I expected her to be the second star and she deserves to be. She's good in this movie but it is strictly a solo act. The great brutal violence in Slavi's office is the highlight. The action slowly turns more and more cartoonish. Director Antoine Fuqua has made some great gritty action. I wish he brought a bit more 'Training Day'. Unfortunately, the last battle in the Home Mart reminds me too much of 'Home Alone'. There is something compelling about not showing what happened with the hammer. That's a great scene. It's a little more silly to see all the improvised traps in the store.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

There is drama in this too and it's still weird seeing Chloe Moritz in an adult role, but she's doing a good job with a small but important role.Denzels characters might channel a bit of Charles Bronson, but he's making it with his own unique charisma and flavor. One thing is for sure, if you have a Death Wish, just get on the bad side of him and you are on. The action is more than decent, the flow of the movie is good (with time to take a breath or to, before the action/violence starts up again).

Slow Paced Action Movie,"6.5/10+The acting in the movie was spot-on.-Beware, If part of your reason for seeing this movie is because you are a fan of Chloe Grace Moretz, she is only in the film for what seems a total of 15 minutes. 13 minutes at the beginning, 2 minutes at the end. She has an important role and plays it well, there just isn't much of her.-The pacing is slow, and, while the action is good, there isn't as much action in this movie as you might think. Be prepared for that.-The bad guys are pretty inept. That was my number one disappointment with the film. For a one man army who is trying to take down one of the most powerful crime lords in the world it was WAY too easy to navigate through the bad guys.-There is nothing that evokes any type of emotional reaction during the film (at least for me). It was a pretty run of the mill drama/action film.+If you like slower paced, character driven stories, where the bad guys don't put up much of a fight and you enjoy the good guy dismantling the enemy one by one, then you will enjoy this film.-Other people are comparing this somewhat to Bourne; don't expect bourne, you will be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel Washington is dope,"Action, drama, humor, Denzel can due it all. Based on the TV show, Denzel Washington is yet another old man, similar to Pierce Bronson in the November Man, trying to prove he's still got it by playing a mysterious dude who works at a Megamart who decides to help a young hooker who got beat up pretty badly and ends up taking down some major hitters in the Russian Mafia, then becomes a target for the main boss.The movie had a quiet tone similar to Denzel and Director Antoine Fuqua's last flick, Training Day, but Denzel's performance in this is far more Oscar worthy. Denzel still brings passion to movies in an age were other actors like him are phoning it in just for the pay check, and basically that's what makes the movie. Watching Denzel on screen.In all fairness, The Equalizer's main antagonist, A man the mob sends to take care of their problems, was no slouch either. It was so entertaining watching these two hunt each other down.Possibly the worse part of the movie was there was not enough Chloë Grace Moretz whose role in the movie is no more than a gloried cameo.Overall Mr. Fuqua directed the great Denzel in another amazing role.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Don't Go To War With Him. What do you see when you look at me?This first outing in The Equalizer series contains suspense , noisy action-packed , gun-play and lots of violence . Denzel Washington with his usual stoic acting plays Robert McCall , a former special service commando who faked his own death in hopes of living out a quiet life , and finds his desire for justice reawakened after coming face-to-face with members of a ruthless Russian gang , as he displays amount of weapons in different locations , as he uses expeditive means meted out to the brutal enemies by killing cruelly nasties . This begins pretty well with interesting script by
Richard Wenk based on the television series created by Michael Sloan and Richard Lindheim, in spite of the cliché-filled storyline , but Denzel delivers the goods and he can pull it off. The plotting in The Equalizer is nothing special , it's a competent flick , though not an action filled movie, but when the action and thriller hitting at whatever cost , it's strong and heavy , not shying away from crowd-pleasing violence . It's a revival/prequel to the TV show from the 1980s, in which Edward Woodward would help simple people fight back against the big nasties in the world . It was a pleasantly attractive premise, and Washington, as always , convinces me as a two-fisted man who sets out for delivering retributive justice and relentless vengeance . Director Antoine Fuqua has made some great gritty , action-packed movies and in The Equalizer shows his portentous skills . Antoine Fuqua shoots with his usual love of violence , well-paced set pieces and intimate scenes as well . It's adequate and thrilling here, although his director of photography, Mauro Fiore chooses a rare color palette that suggests uses natural light , at times , adding some atmospheric rain scenes . Aside from the excellent Denzel Washington, we get fine good guys and bad guys performances from Marton Csokas , Chloë Grace Moretz , David Harbour , Haley Bennett , Bill Pullman , Vladimir Kulich , Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo . Followed by The Equalizer 2 (2018) with Denzel Washington, Pedro Pascal, Melissa Leo , Sakina Jaffrey, Kazy Tauginas , Jonathan Scarfe, among others.It displays an exciting and suspenseful musical score by composer Harry Gregson-Williams . Dark and mostly night photography by cameraman Mauro Fiore reflecting splendidly interiors and exteriors. Director Antoine Fuqua who frequently deals familiar conflicts set in N. Y , keeps the film slick and stokes up the race some , but this only accelerates the flick's deafening rush toward the top and ever over. Fuqua handles the explosive action and the psychological undercurrents with equal assurance . Antoine Fuqua has made a lot of succesful movies , such as : The Magnificent Seven , Olympus Has Fallen, The Equalizer , Equalizer 2 , Southpaw , King Arthur , Training Day , Shooter , Tears of the Sun , Bait , among others. Rating : 7/10 . The yarn will appeal to Denzel Washington fans. Well worth watching .",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Divine justice by a stranger,"The movie is hookie from the beginning to the end.It hooks you completely making you agree more and more with what you are watching.Avenging justice is always dangerous and discutable but sometimes it's a necessary evil.The Bob that doesn't have a face like Bob but Robert is an enigmatic character that helps his folks around.

Home Depot Alone,"I guess this was exactly the kind of movie that it wanted to be: retired nice guy with amazing violence skills gets upset and starts killing people to satisfy his own sense of justice and self importance. Few people remember the Equalizer series, from 1985, starring Edward Woodward and even fewer would recognize similarities with this film, except the name. My guess is that Sony wanted this film to be a kind of pilot for a new TV series.What really *annoyed* me off was that everything was completely blown out of proportion. Denzel's character goes to help a girl (what else) and kills some Russian mobster in the most ridiculous way possible. But this was just an employee of a bigger mobster, so he sends an uber psychopath to solve the problem. And so this guy has to be killed, hostages enter the fray, captured in some Home Depot thingy, they play 15 minutes of Counter Strike inside, only with household appliances, and so on and so on. They replaced Woodward's brain with Washington's brawn and some ridiculous semblance of planning, since he always wears a stopwatch and measures time for some reason that is never explained.What can we learn from this film? First of all that if you are an ex-CIA killer you can just assume there is no justice in the world but your own. Also, the other people that could help, like the police, are just hired help for mobsters. And if you are a helpless normal citizen that has to work hard for the slightest pay raise, you will be beaten, sold as a slave, blackmailed when you make a little bit of money, perhaps by corrupt cops, and your only hope is some homicidal maniac who really enjoys killing people in creative ways after bullying them into taking the first shot (he calls this ""giving them a chance"").Bottom line: a cliché from top to bottom, this is like A History of Violence on steroids and making little to no sense. A feeler for a TV series that I hope will never be made, it just offends just about everything involved in the plot: the police, the Russian mobsters, any military organization that is not the CIA, democracy, the justice system in its entirety, laptop makers that are not Sony, Home Depot, Ernest Hemingway, Mexicans, fat people... Just say it's a completely average action movie and don't watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Slow and clichéd, but with some fantastic action sequences.","Reteaming 13 years after their Oscar-winning Training Day, director Antoine Fuqua and star Denzel Washington deliver another guilty pleasure with this murky revenge flick. Washington plays Robert McCall, a man with a dark past trying to eke out a quiet life until he feels compelled to help a young prostitute (Chloe Grace Moretz – truly horrible) who is beaten to a pulp by her Russian pimp. Trouble is this particular pimp is part of the Russian Mafia's American contingent, so a simple chat over coffee and cake won't do the trick. So after an excruciatingly slow opening 30 minutes, Washington is unleashed in a tense and ultimately bloody confrontation that results in the Russian mob sending over more minions (led by Marton Csokas' sinister sociopath) to be slaughtered in slow motion awesomeness. If the plot sounds a bit clichéd – hooker with a heart of gold, evil Ruskis, one last job, ridiculously inept and indispensable henchmen – that's because it is. Fuqua attempts to imbue his film with dramatic heft, yet he shouldn't have bothered. When delving into character motives, moral choices and grand, thought-provoking themes, the movie stutters and splutters; thankfully the numerous action sequences are of an extremely high calibre. The finale is especially epic, with Mauro Fiore's cinematography and Harry Gregson-Williams' score combining with Fuqua's flair behind the camera to dish out an appropriately hard core climax. More of a rainy-Sunday-arvo-on-the-couch type of film, but if you're a die-hard Denzel fan then you'll likely appreciate this on the big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Heart, great acting, no shaky cam!","I've been aware of this movie since it's release in 2014. I've even seen clips of it on YouTube every now and then. But I finally decided to take the time and watch it in full, and man was it worth it. Denzel is one of the greatest actors on the planet and I'm not sure this movie would have worked without him.This movie did have a lot going for it though. Great lead and supporting characters. Good score and cinematography, great fight scenes (it doesn't hold back, at the same time it's not gratuitous), and the story although has a simple plot, did more world building than I thought. I enjoyed my time in this scary corrupt version of Boston.If you enjoy the show The Wire, and would enjoy a toned down less hyper version of the John Wick franchise, this movie is clean and handles the story intelligently. Denzel kills every line and steals every scene.My one gripe is the pacing kind of jumps around at the end of the second act before the climax. But they had to get to the ending somehow.Enjoy the show. It deserves the ratings it has, maybe even better!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

If CIA agents were like this we wouldn't need the US Army.The plot is predictable.I thought McCall had a completely unexplained no-guns policy, despite the TV character's highly visible pistol, because he keeps ignoring guns in favor of cutting up his own hands, but at the end he shoots a whole bunch of people.

Well made first 35 minutes the rest is fodder,"The reason why this film has such a good rating can only be explained by the first action sequence. After that it is nothing you would talk about.Of course like most other action movies you shouldn't think too much about the plot here either. A single man who takes on a whole gang of heavily armed criminals. And all because one of them punishes a prostitute who had previously become rebellious. Something that happens every day without a war breaking out.Now, let's get to the acting. They are all over the top. The silent hero, the bad guys and of course the comic relief.I would also like to point out one small thing here: you simply cannot shoot with a nail gun. There is a safety catch that prevents this. You have to press it against something, otherwise...nothing!!!Now, let's get to the most illogical part of the film: the ending. So, a 1.85m tall black man can walk into Russia and enter an oligarch's heavily guarded estate and eliminate all the guards...very believable.But it gets even better, the prostitute who started it all meets the hero again and tells him that she is now going to make her dream come true. Even if our hero eliminated all the pimps...just a few hours later, others would have taken up the prostitutes...especially the young ones.So, the first 35 minutes were interesting, so it gets 6 stars.

Predictable but watchable,"I am not sure why the makers of this movie bothered to get the rights to do a movie version of a television series when the movie has very little of the elements that were found in the television series. I guess the most plausible reason would be that being an official movie adaptation of a television series, the movie would have instant ""branding"" and make it easier to market than a movie with a more original plot line and characters. Anyway, the story and characters in this movie are for the most part nothing you haven't seen before either on television or in other movies. You'll be pretty much able to predict what happens before it actually does. On the other hand, these predictable elements are put forward in a professional manner. Washington does well playing someone with a dark past who is still good at his game, the action scenes are brutal and fairly exciting, and the movie as a whole looks very nice. So I'm giving this movie a cautionary recommendation. If you are looking for something new, look elsewhere. But if you don't mind seeing the same plot and characters all over again, you'll find this movie a well crafted retread.",,Anonymous,Crime

"Washington vs Russians, 2014 edition","It's hard to invent anything new in the genre of the action movies. The Equalizer is no exception. This time, we have Denzel Washington as a nice and hard-working employee of a big hardware store, who comes to a nearby diner at nights to read. But when a young Slavic hooker named Alina, who he occasionally talks to, gets into trouble, this old man, 'dedushka' as the Russian mobsters call him, decides to put some people-killing skills he tries so hard to forget about to work.The movies where a small and quiet man is revealed to be some sort of retired John Rambo who gets back to business for the sake of justice are always a guilty pleasure. You can predict almost all the plot turns, and it's not like it turns all that much, but still you end up rooting for the good guy, simply because all of us sometimes wish that such people really existed in this world. The whole idea of a one-man-army doing the impossible so that the weak and exploited of this world could finally have some peace in their lives will never die as long as we live in a society ridden with criminals and ruled by corruption.Too bad that a likable protagonist doesn't automatically make a movie excellent. And that is why the filmmakers use all the tricks up their sleeves to persuade us to turn off the brain and judge by emotions only. Cruel and dumb mobsters, poor young girls who need protection, ruthless boss villains who seem to have no single positive trait about them, and all that is financed with the Russian oil. Awesome sauce.I do admit, with the way my country behaves lately in terms of the international matters, the return of the old-school image of a Russian evil is very well timed. And i personally have nothing against it, after all, we do deserve to be treated as a threat. I just wish it was done in a fresher way. Denzel Washington is without a doubt a great action movie actor, but it looks like he'll hardly top what he did almost a decade ago in Training Day. Now that was really intense, there he really had to break a sweat to get the job done. On the other hand, in The Equalizer things simply happen the way he needs, so this action thriller inevitably loses the thrills it tried to hold. And while the villain guy was moderately believable as a worthy opponent, and the final scene in the hardware store was really impressive, those were probably the only things in which this movie actually tries to stand out.On the other hand, with a little imagination this average action movie may turn into a very dead on political satire. Evil Russians are exploiting and brutalizing a girl with a rather Ukrainian name 'Alina', and a black man with a profile resembling Barack Obama's and a last name 'Washington' that speaks for itself, manages to singlehandedly deal with all the bad guys and tops it with killing the mob kingpin, whose last name starts with 'Pu' and ends with 'in', in his Moscow mansion. Since we all know that the real mobsters prefer London to Moscow, it makes the allusion even clearer. And the fact that the movie was obviously filmed before the recent political turmoil makes it almost prophetic.But even if that interpretation is just a pipe dream, this movie is not that bad. Especially since for an eye candy it has Chloe-Grace Moretz who's obviously trying to do more various roles but still can't help ending up in the same cute, a little clumsy and somewhat childish image. Not that we don't love her for that, do we? ;)The bottom line is: if you want to see a decent action movie where the good guys win and the bad guys die, or if you like to find the hidden meaning where there probably is none - then The Equalizer's your game. But don't expect anything close to Training Day from it, this way you'll save yourself from unnecessarily high expectations and disappointment that usually follows.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Passable action gimmick that could have been something more.,"The first few scenes of the Equalizer suggest that it is going to be an intelligent movie, and then it turns into a gimmick....Denzel Washington the untouchable action hero.There are individual scenes in the movie that are quite rousing and filmed with flair and panache. It's easy enough to argue that The Equalizer is a perfectly good action movie, but for the intelligent viewer, it is too hard to get completely emerged in because there are too many distractions.The script has a disjointed feel to it and it leaves its hero under underdeveloped. It's always nice to see Washington as a top tier bad ass, who is as untouchable as the younger Steven Seagal, but after fter one action scene you get the feeling that this movie is going to allow him to come away from every fight without even a scratch or a moment of hesitation. And then comes the ultimate action gimmick of all; a scene concludes with him walking away in slow motion from an explosion.The climax of the movie involves a one against ten face off in hardware megastore. Here we start to border on satire as Washington disposes of his enemies one at a time using the merchandise. these images will put a smile on your face, but they go on too long.The Equalizer, like Taken, is an action movie that doesn't rise above the sum of it's parts and leaves you a little dumbfounded about how seriously to take it.. There are dramatic undercurrents in they story that would have elevated the movie if director Antoine Fuqua has not chosen to abandon them.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Russian gangsters are great and the main bad guy is awesome (you know, in an evil bad guy way). Of course Denzel is incredibly engaging, but even the other characters are well done and draw you into the world.From the trailer it looks perhaps a little hoaky with the whole girl asking about the book he is reading, and some of the dialogue from the trailer makes you think this movie will be cliché, but I found that they did a good job developing the characters and those scenes.If violence bothers you, don't go see this movie.

A film with many faults but having Denzel as the lead saved it from failure.,"Denzel Washington is one of my favourite actors of all time, if he's in a film that will one of the deciding factors to whether I go and see it or not. I think the Equalizer was made with this in mind, it is far from great, it feels lazy and lacks any real depth but they know that a film with Denzel as the lead will draw in the audiences.The script, pacing, storyline & character development all let this movie down in my opinion and when you add all of those to clichéd, predictable scenarios; it really doesn't make for a very good movie. The story is so over done that there is no way it can offer the viewer any surprises, we have seen this so many times before, from the plot to the characters to the scenarios, it all feels very repetitive. Denzel gives a good solid performance but he is hindered by the awful, basic, mind numbing script. He really wasn't given much to work with and the scenes where he was given large amounts of dialogue it just felt clichéd and predictable. I think it was trying to be one of those thinly plotted, action movies where you can switch your brain off and enjoy it for what it is. I think it does a good job at being this apart from one major fault: The pacing. The poor script and lack of depth to the plot make it drag somewhat. It is simply too long for what it is; with a run time of over 2 hours it really drags in the middle. The first 30-40 minutes are good and intriguing and the final 30 minutes offer good action and some good scenes, the middle 45-50 minutes simply doesn't have enough about it to keep your attention.The Equalizer isn't without its positives though; Denzel Washington shows us another great, convincing performance, he really is a joy to watch. He plays a very likable character with ease; you always feel like you can connect with him as an actor, that is probably one of his greatest traits. The film looks brilliant; the settings are all faultless and expose a real gritty, atmosphere. Some of the scenes are very well done; the scenes at the start and the end scene in particular are well made and tense. The cinematography was given a lot of attention, the action scenes are very immersing, different approaches are used with slow motion shots and great music.Overall, The Equalizer has plenty of issues but also has many things which I like. It is easy watching, but that is about all. It isn't going to be remembered as a classic and it certainly isn't one of Denzel Washington's better films but it is entertaining enough. Just don't expect too much.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

It's at this point I got thoughts of abandoning this film. It's an absurd premise and weak to build a plot on. Acting is fine as are some of the set action pieces.

Decent but formulaic action,"Washington plays McCall, a guy who works at a home improvement store. At night he goes to a diner and ritualistically drinks tea while reading a book. Also at the diner every night is a young Russian prostitute who waits there to be picked up by her rich clients. They occasionally chat about the books he's reading. His wife started a project to read a list of 100 books but she died before she could complete it. Now he's repeating the project. One night, the girl is bruised. They walk together and her pimp shows up and slaps her around some more. Another night the girl doesn't show up at the diner. McCall finds out she got a beating and is hospitalized. He goes to the hospital and talks to one of the girl's colleagues who tells him how the girls are treated and that they are risking their lives.McCall decides to visit the pimp and after a whole lot of nothing finally explodes and kills all the mobsters there, pretty much single-handedly, that is, often with just one hand. That gets the attention of the main Russian mobster who sends a cleaner named Teddy to take care of things. Teddy is well-mannered, well-dressed, soft-spoken but vicious. After much investigation he finds out that McCall was behind the killings and starts tracking him and even pays him a visit.McCall, still living his slow life, thinks about things, he visits a woman who's some higher up in government. She tells him it's OK if he does what he has to do. Now McCall decides to act. He goes after corrupt cops on the mobster's payroll, destroys their entire operation, and meets Terry leading to the eventual final confrontation in the dark and with water sprinklers on of course, when Teddy decides to take McCalls's coworkers hostage.I'm not familiar with the TV series but this movie is a fairly average and formulaic action movie. You have the reluctant hero with near superpowers, who is forced to make justice when put in a corner. Personally, I don't think Washington makes that convincing of an action hero. He's empathetic enough so I see him taking on the standard Morgan Freeman role at some point. The story is very good though, even though things go pretty much as expected. The movie is about 30-40 minutes too long. For a movie that focuses so much on its lead, we learn next to nothing about McCall. And as much as this director, and others, do their best to glorify Washington--one just has to count the number of slow-motion shots of Washington--it's Marton Csokas who steals the show as the calm and brutal Teddy. The movie also ends on a laughable and improbable situation as McCall travels to Moscow. But I'm in favor of movies who advocate the reading of books, so I'll give it one more point for that.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A worthwhile watch thanks to Denzel,"Denzel Washington saves the day.There's nothing I'd consider special about 'The Equalizer', though thanks to a typically stellar performance from lead Washington I still had a fun time watching this 2014 release. It's a great showing from Denzel, not that that is a surprise given he is - alongside Leonardo DiCaprio - my favourite actor.Otherwise, it's a pretty standard vigilante action flick which probably goes on for slightly too long and features some forgettable, if solid, support cast/characters, the latter is especially true for the rather plain villains. The music is also standard, though does improve towards the end with the final score and end credit soundtrack.All in all, a worthwhile watch thanks to Denzel. I'm hoping the sequel, whilst still featuring a top lead performance, is more of a well rounded effort - I guess I'll soon see!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good film but unnecessarily violent,"Is it ever right for a regular citizen with the 'appropriate' skills to go vigilante and stand up to wrong-doing and a corrupt justice system? In the TV show of the 60's, ""The Equalizer"", Edward Woodward would! In many ways the new film version of ""The Equalizer"" is a story of a superhero, but instead of the cape and the glory of the front page of the Daily Planet, this 'hero' melts off anonymously into the Boston suburbs until it is appropriate to act again. It is a more sinister sort of superhero.Denzel Washington plays Bob (or Robert, when he's reading), a mild-mannered worker in a Boston Do-It-Yourself megastore but a man with a secretive past. Needing only, it seems, about 2 hours sleep a night, Bob frequents an all-night diner where he befriends prostitute Teri played by Chloe Grace Moretz. She ends up in the hospital thanks to some pimp heavies, and Bob exacts bloody justice on the guys. Unfortunately, these are the henchmen of a huge Russian mafia operation in the US, and Bob's fight becomes a full-scale war against the leader Pushkin (Vladamir Kulich) and his bad-guy-in-chief, the curiously named Teddy (played with menacing glee by Marton Csokas, Celeborn in ""Lord of the Rings"" but seen most recently in ""Sin City 2″).This movie is a cut above the normal mafia crime drama story. Washington's Bob is portrayed as an intelligent, thoughtful but deeply wounded man, and the audience can empathise with his burning desire to give back to society and for people in general to just (as Woody in Toy Story would say) ""play nice"". Chloe Grace Moretz is (again) outstanding as the equally wounded Teri trying desperately to find a way out of the deep pit she finds her life to be in. Moretz looks set to continue her trajectory to become a Hollywood Great.And Csokas as the steely and cold Mafia killing machine makes for an extremely menacing villain.Also excellent in extended cameos are Melissa Leo (""Are you still and effective team?"" from ""Oblivion"") and Bill Pullman (""Independance Day"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"").Production values are high, with some glorious cinematography (Mauro Fiore -""Avatar"", ""Training Day"") of the ever-photogenic Boston and the mood lighting (David Lazan/Chris Culliton) of the night scenes and the diner is top rate.After a necessarily slow start to build character and back story, the screenplay (by Richard Wenk) fair zips along, and this longish running time of 130 minutes speeds by relatively unnoticed by the bladder! In particular, the final climatic showdown between the main characters is suitably dramatic, and set in a novel location for such a scene – full of potential for ""Home Alone"" style activity. (In fact, as my son pointed out, there is another – presumably unintended – nod at the end of the film to the ""Wet Bandits"" closure to ""Home Alone"" also).However, what lets the film down for me is the gratuitous violence graphically shoved in the viewer's face (and in one case twice via flashback). The director (Antoine Fuqua, ""Training Day"") should learn that 'less is more' in such scenes, and the imagination is a much more powerful tool: Hitchcock achieved as much by what he didn't show as what he did. The film actually works best in its middle reel, where some of the acts of vengeance are not shown at all: Washington calmly wiping down a lump hammer and putting it back on the store shelves.I am also truly staggered that this film was released with a UK '15' certificate. The British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) seem to have become desensitised to this as an issue. Perhaps they are just reflecting that society itself, with Youtube depictions of gruesome murders and beheadings, has become desensitised to such scenes. (Whilst I appreciate not everyone would share this view) I have no problem with sex on the screen, or swearing (which most kids will hear, and worse, every day in the playground) but this level of uncut violence in my view should automatically be given an '18' certificate. If a director wants a lower certificate, then let them trim the shots.The certificate should be a guidance as to what society things is acceptable for different age groups to see, and for me the BBFC keep getting this wrong with respect to the violence part of their remit, with inconsistent ratings: they give the cartoonish violence of Sin City 2 an '18' but the Joker's 'pencil scene' in ""The Dark Knight"" a '12' – – really? With graphic scenes involving a corkscrew and a power drill in this film, and in an increasingly violent world I would personally not want my 15 year old kid seeing this stuff.Vigilante films have always tended to stir up controversy, no more so than when Michael Winner's ""Death Wish"" came out in 1974 which created quite a storm particularly in the US. Again it is perhaps a sign of our desensitisation that there hasn't been more controversy over this film.In summary, this is a good and entertaining film that I would have given eight stars to with a recommendation to see, but I'm knocking a star off for the unnecessarily graphic violence: if gory violence is not your bag, then this is one you should best avoid.(If you enjoyed this review, please check out my other reviews on bob-the-movie-man.com, and sign up to ""Follow the Fad"".

DENZEL WASHINGTON IS FANTASTIC!!! Top Action Vigilante Thriller. His Best Movie.,"I loved The Equalizer & i loved the legendary Denzel in his role as the extremely skilled & dangerous Robert McCall, an ex-CIA Agent turned Urban Vigilante. Denzel is one of the greatest actors in cinema history FACT & i grew up watching & loving this guy & over the years he's cranked out some Amazing films such as ""Training Day"" & ""Man on Fire"" & ""Deja Vu"" & ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" & ""The Bone Collector"" & many, many more films. I'm a fan of Denzel but some of his flicks i didn't like such as ""Inside Man"" & ""The Book of Eli"" (terrible ending) & ""2 Guns"" but most of his work is usually excellent with excellent performances.Here Denzel gives another incredible performance to his big list of great roles!!! McCall is a deadly man but a good man who will stop & help someone in trouble & here set in Boston he gets in deep trouble with the local scum, the Violent Russian gangsters who pimp out young girls & here McCall helps out a young brutalized girl Teri played greatly by Cloe Grace Moretz & comes head to head with a very dangerous man called Teddy played intensely by Martin Csokas, we also have a small role for the excellent Bill Pullman who turns up later in the film.Director Antoine Fuqua has created a fantastic urban vigilante action Thriller that's exciting, gritty, brutal & fun.The fact Robert McCall works a regular ordinary job in a hardware store is just genius & grounds everything is a sense of realism.McCall goes about his violent business cleaning up a dark crime ridden Boston & meets good people as well as bad people.Some of my favourite moments are just of McCall sitting in the all night diner reading his book & drinking his tea, little scenes like that are just beautiful with the night time setting & the look of the city streets at night are all captured beautifully.My favourite Denzel film.The Action is brutally fun when McCall starts using his ""Special Skills"" on the local thugs & corrupted cops, it's a joy to watch him doing what we would all love to be done in real life!!!Another excellent Denzel Washington film & role, this is probably my favourite Denzel film & role!!! Or atleast in the top of his films list & characters.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good, But More of the Same","This film is based so loosely from the 1980s TV series starring Edward Woodward as Robert McCall, an ex-agent who helped poor individuals who have no one else to turn to in their crime-related problems. But the McCall (Denzel Washington) is here no dapper English gentleman, but he is a genial quiet employee of a Home Depot-type warehouse store who kept pretty much to himself.One day, he meets and befriends a teenage prostitute Alina (Chloe Grace Moretz) at his usual dining place. When she had been beaten up by the Russian mobsters who handled her, McCall gets shaken out of his neat little routines, and an unparalleled killer of immeasurable means gets unleashed to champion the cause of the helpless masses.This is another oft-told tale in Hollywood these days, an ex-CIA agent with superhuman abilities saving the day for some damsel in distress. This year alone, we have seen it in ""A Walk Among the Gravestones"" with Liam Neeson, and ""November Man"" with Pierce Brosnan. With ""The Equalizer"" though, we are given Denzel Washington in the lead role, by the same man who directed him to his Best Actor Oscar, Antonio Fuqua.The action sequences are well-planned and orchestrated, but I can't really say they are all that original. They are of extraordinary violence and gore, I'd give them that, hence the local R-16 rating. The whole ""seeing small details around him while planning an attack"" routine has been done before, and with much more logic, in the Sherlock Holmes films. The whole climactic ""walking away from a series of big fiery explosions behind the hero"" gimmick is practically a staple in countless A, B or C level action films before this one.The best scene in the whole film was probably the one where McCall talks face-to-face with the vicious Russian gang leader, Teddy (Marton Csokas). That scene was one big mind game where McCall exposes the weaknesses of his enemy using mere words. That was an exciting psy battle of wits at its best, better than all the shootouts and explosions in the film.For me, Denzel Washington did not look like he had the right physical look to realistically convince me that he could do the stunts McCall was doing. However, in these intense face-to-face confrontation scenes, you know he is the type who could psych you out crazy even with his penetrating stare alone. This is what gives ""The Equalizer"" an edge over all the other run-of-the-mill action thrillers with the same basic story. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Modern Day Clark Kent,"I wasn't expecting to like this movie as much as I did given the level of violence, however the incredible production kept me engaged until the end. The cinematography, particularly the lighting, is superb throughout, and the slick editing takes the whole production to another level. The action sequences are well choreographed, and the violence is never gratuitous, indeed it's generally not even overly graphic or sustained. Denzel Washington was great in the lead role and Martin Csokas as the villain was also terrific, as always. Even though the story is a familiar one of a reformed man of violence returning to his past sins, this stylish movie adds something fresh to the genre.

There is no equal,"The movie The Equalizer (2014) is apparently based on the 1985 show with the same name, I have not seen the show, but I understand the premise of the show to understand the premise of the movie. The Denzel Washington movie The Equalizer (2014) was a cool action movie with Denzel Washington being great in the movie as this guy with certain skills and someone who can go from being a nice guy standing up for people to being serious and being brutal in his kills. Also, this movie is a brutal movie when Denzel Washington's character starts taking people out or setting deadly traps against the main antagonist.Denzel Washington as Robert McCall was great in the movie; he handled the serious moments very well and when he was being a nice guy when talking to his friends, he was a likable character to watch, and you can understand why he is doing what he is doing. I liked how he interacted with his friends or coworkers as a normal nice guy, and I liked that he will anything for a person to help them out whenever he can, especially when he plays a character with OCD. Also, even though Chloë Grace Moretz was not in the movie that much, I liked how Robert McCall and she interacted with each other leading to having Robert's past be the focus heading to cool action sequences and brutal kills that fit the rated R rating for the movie.The main antagonist of the movie played by Marton Csokas was good, and I liked the moments with the villain and Robert McCall interacting with one another especially one scene near the third act. The action sequences are cool and well shot with Denzel Washington being cool in them setting up brutal traps for the antagonists or killing them with any object nearby him in the area. Denzel Washington was cool using his skills to take down people, but what I would have liked was more background on his character because they do not say that much about him like who he is or how he has these skills in combat or killing people in brutal ways.The Equalizer (2014) was a cool and entertaining action movie that I would recommend giving a watch; Denzel Washington is what makes this movie worth watching with the cool action sequences and how director Antoine Fuqua directs the movie. The movie needed more background to Denzel's character and some things in the movie cannot make sense, but other than that, this movie is a cool action movie that is worth checking out if you like action movies and Denzel Washington.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Lengthy, Boring ""Old Ex-CIA agent"" vs. Gangs movie.","This is a movie in the fashion of Liam Neeson, Kevin Costner, Pierce Brosnan etc. recent movies, where a retired ex CIA agent ""with skills!"" confronts and beats the hell out of some foreign criminals.The main problem with ""The Equalizer"" is its length and rhythm. It lasts ...2 hours and 12 minutes and there isn't much happening in this movie to justify such a long duration. Compared to ""Taken"" the action is minimal.Denzel Washington looks OK at his 60s but his presence and some pseudo-karate-spy moves aren't enough to fill the screen.The rhythm of the movie is terrible. From the beginning you expect to see the (obvious to come) action scenes but....it is taking too long and the scenes are forced and pretentious.The direction is poor, the cinematography unnecessary dark and the use of some super-slow-motion scenes near the end ridiculous and without the impact that the creators went for.There are TONS of clichés like 1 guy vs. 50, Rambo-like improvised traps, lots of ""Who are you?"" from bad guys who are about to die and the infamous ""Cool Guys Don't Look At Explosions"" scene.Chloë Grace Moretz is really good as the troubled Russian prostitute but her part is considerably small.It should be A LOT better but the creators were afraid to take any real chances.Overall: Don't be fooled by the star-status of Denzel Washington. This is a poor movie full of clichés that it would bore you by its length and poor execution.",,Anonymous,Crime
One Of Denzel's Finest.,"Denzel Washington is one of the greatest living actors of this generation, and The Equaliser is a very well made film that allows him to showcase his outstanding acting abilities.The Equalizer is a thoroughly enjoyable action-thriller that has superb performances from both Denzel and Martin Csokas, the latter portraying the main antagonist of the movie, with their sit down dialogue scene in the restaurant across the table from each other being one of the coolest and most memorable scenes in the whole movie.I recently went back and revisited this movie in anticipation of the 3rd movie in the trilogy being announced, and had a very good time with it.

The fact that Robert McCall is a good man who helps anyone around him is part of what I think makes this a good film.With an actor like Denzel Washington you could never go wrong even if it is a typical action flick.

First amongst Equalisers,"I never saw Edward Woodward's Equaliser so I went into this one with an open mind: I guess they're completely different stories sharing the marketable name. However there's just enough puzzling comments made in here to make me think the previous tv series may have some missing jigsaw pieces for me (for example why was he supposedly asking the CIA types for their ""permission""?)
Enigmatic nice guy with OCD's and plenty of books takes it upon himself to revenge the routine beating up of a harmless prostitute by a troupe of violent Russian gangsters by violently destroying them in various surprisingly ballet-like ways. The exhortation rings out to all baddies: Do The Right Thing - if only Good vs Evil was always so simply and efficiently addressed. By the end of the bloodfest Washington passed the test to be The Neutraliser.The violence is concentrated cold and callous - and an utterly unnecessary bore. These are maybe characters better gone, but to display and revel in gratuitous gore is always demeaning and insulting to the audience whether realised or not. If I watch it again I'll probably fast forward the obscene bits because I prefer my Revenge Cool.

Seen it all before,"Okay, maybe I'm missing something, or I've become simply too cynical to appreciate 'The Equaliser.' If you check out the reviews you'll notice that they're overwhelmingly positive. I'm not going to slate the film, but I certainly wouldn't say that it's as good as the majority of people seem to think.In fact, I can't really think of anything negative to say about it, but then I also can't think of anything positive to say about it either. We have Denzil Washington as the star. Naturally, he's a great performer and puts in a decent enough show as a man with a dark past who has lethal ways of getting revenge on those who set out to harm the innocent. The film is shot nicely stylish. Every now and again you'll get a fast paced montage of images with highlight the director's flare. The action scenes are nice (if violent, naturally) and everyone gets what's coming to them. And there's a decent enough amount of other stars, ala Chloe Grace Moretz and Bill Pullman to make this a little more than just a mindless B-movie action flick.Yes, for all the plus points, I found the film pretty average. Bad guys hurt the innocent. Once man stands up to them. Despite everything that's good about it, I just felt that I've seen it all before and, no matter how flashy and violent the action scenes were, I still found it was one of those films where you could do the ironing while you were watching it, or nip out for a drink and you wouldn't have missed that much.Perhaps the most average thing about the film is the bad-guy. How often have we seen Russian gangs bullying their way around America? The lead bad-guy is just a bad-guy. He's completely generic. Yes, he's evil and will kill anyone who gets in his way, but aren't all villains? Seriously, he could have been replaced by any actor and the film wouldn't have changed much.So, I'll end by saying that most people seem to like it. So maybe you should take their word over mine. I'm clearly in the minority here. But I didn't hate it. I just didn't see anything that I hadn't already seen a hundred times before.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Expected Better! 5/10,"Review: I had high expectations for this movie because I used to watch the series and Denzel usually makes some good movies, but I was quite disappointed with the outcome. It takes ages to get going and I'm getting a bit fed up with these directors casting Eastern Europeans as gangsters. On top of that, I found the movie predictable and the characters weren't that interesting. I did stick with the 2 hour film because I wanted to see the big showdown at the end, which was average, and I still was hoping for something amazing to happen, which it didn't. Denzel Washington just seemed to be in a mood all the way through the movie, except for when he was doing his Pips shuffle, and the action scenes were average. The girl that caused Denzel to switch to a murdering assassin goes missing for most of the movie, which was a bit weird, and you don't really find out much about his past which would have drawn you to his character. Anyway, its a watchable movie, just because of Washington's performance, but it wasn't that great. Average!Round-Up: This is no way like the TV series because you really don't expect Edward Woodward to be a assassin. The director did try to use the same concept with Washington by making him a humble shop manager but after seeing him kick ass in movies like Training Day, Man On Fire and 2 Guns, it's really not that surprising that he can take out a lot of gangsters, by hand, after working out his moves strategically, in a Sherlock Holmes type of way. I did get fed up with the slow motion shots, like when he blows up the building and appears through smoke and the whole killing loads of baddies by hand concept seemed a bit unrealistic, but you can't help rooting for the Denzel, because he's fighting for justice!Budget: $55million Worldwide Gross: $192millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/thrillers about a everyday man who turns vigilante after his friend gets beaten up. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Heavily clichéd with annoying generic sound track,"The main character played by D.W. is fine but not reasonably and logically convincing. The guy never worked out in the gym, never jogging, never practiced and honed his killing technique regularly, so how he maintained his cardio and mojo? His reflections, his responses to sudden eruption of violence in close combat would never have been improved and kept in the same conditions as any regular man who could maintain such level. A guy just like everybody else on the planet, luckily got a steady job, worked in the fictitious Home Mart(?), stayed at his apartment after work, then ritually had something in the nearby local diner or café, reading Hemingway, a regular middle aged guy would be luckily not to have high cholesterol albeit hemorrhoid, yet he could kill 5 people in 28 seconds, even faster and quicker than the X-man. Yeah, right.... Are you kidding me?! After he killed those 5 Russian thugs on the upstairs of the Russian restaurant, a smart killer would have clean up in situ, instead, he went home and washed his bloody hands in his bathroom? Killing 5 people in close combat, no blood on his clothes and with bloody hands openly walking back on the streets? Give me a break! The whole storyline is overly one directional predictable and heavily clichéd and worst of all, the soundtrack, so monotonously annoying with fixed tempo, a horrible trendy but stupid chore did by a lousy brain-dead soundtrack guy or group, so boring and so annoying that made the clichéd scenario even more boring. Why the Russian dispatcher would have to kill the young prostitute's co-worker? another pretty Russian young woman, who could continuously generate at least one million US dollars before she became too old for whoring? She was one of the ATM machines that Russian pimping enterprise would like to keep, yet this moron from Russia chose to choke her to death; for what? And furthermore, why she used English instead of her Russian mother language in the last moment before choked to death. Human nature was again ignored by the stupid screenplay writer(s) and the careless director. There are so many flaws and loopholes in this movie that I just don't want to waste my time to point out one by one, in case it might turn into the similar stupid soundtrack like what we have to suffer in this movie.

It bares very little resemblance to the show on which it is based. Not that I don't like Denzel, but I personally was hoping for someone that audiences have seen in a role similar to the TV show. In that respect I was hoping for Timothy Dalton. Regardless this film is as I said neither great nor horrible.

I gave it another shot though some time later. Literally exactly the same thing occurred. But with The Equalizer 3 (2023) just around the corner, I thought I should watch this properly from start to finish to get an idea of whether or not the third installation will be worth my money.And based on The Equalizer (2014), even though I don't think a 3rd installment is justified (let alone a 2nd), I'm happy to head to the theaters to simply sit back and enjoy the action that this has to offer. What elevates the first movie compared to any other ordinary action film is primarily the awesome Saw-like kills that we get to see! The gore in this is more extreme than your standard action flick, but at the same time it isn't too intense for it to be a turn-off in the slightest. It actually makes this rather exciting!In addition, I imagine it comes as no surprise when I say that Denzel Washington was superb as the silent, stone-faced avenger Robert McCall, but the person who surprised me was Chloë Grace Moretz who, with the little screen time she had, shocked me with her almost authentic depiction of the vulnerable & fearful sex worker Teri, especially in the first act. And I loved the scenes with Robert and Teri together, we got to see their friendly bond with each other, and that was delightful to witness, even if those moments were only few and far between.But yeah, I'm going to have to leave it there since I'm really trying to cut down how much I write nowadays.

Washington is great even if the film itself sometimes falters,"The Equalizer teams Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington again for the first time since Training Day. While this outing is far less memorable than their first, both rise to the occasion to deliver an enjoyable action film. While the film translates the television source material with brutal and violent force, it does spend a lot of time developing Washington's Robert McCall to be a meticulous and ruthless killer with a heart and a high standard of morals. This could have been great but for the first forty minutes of the film, we're seeing a routine and as routines go, it is simple to conclude that it gets boring after the first 15 minutes. McCall meets a young prostitute named Alina, played by Chloe Grace Moretz and discovers she is beaten to a pulp and then decides to kill her employers setting off a wicked chain of gangland violence, all falling on McCall to ""equalize"" the situation. As McCall is tracked by a Russian mob boss, you begin to start feeling the story drag out. This is the point where the film should really take off but it actually slows down. It tries to be suspenseful but it actually creates for a pacing mess. It jumps from following McCall to following a city of crooked cops and brutal gangsters. This would have made for an interesting dynamic for the film but the villains are so wooden and clichè that you can't really sink into the scenes as easily as you could if Washington was on the screen. Despite this, the scenes of action really make up for the pacing problems. The action scenes are quick, brutal and never glorifies the violence. It shows it as a reality and as Fuqua's previous works show, he has a clear understanding of violence and he makes sure he shows it as a frightening event. My only problem with these scenes are not the scenes themselves, its everything leading up to it. The scenes of McCall ""analyzing"" the situation he's in are cheesy and done in slow motion, it just took me right out of it. Overall, The Equalizer is a decent film that has its issues but it remains enjoyable due to Fuqua's competent direction and Washington's performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

When a good Samaritan comes knocking.,"Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is a health-conscious, organized man - maybe a bit too much, but he is a caring and likeable character. Teri - or Alina (Chloë Grace Moretz) is a young prostitute who dreams of becoming a singer. These two regularly bump into each other at a diner, where Robert goes to read in the early morning hours, and Teri has a bite to eat after 'work'.When Teri is beaten up by her Russian pimp, Slavi, Robert takes matters in his own hands to avenge Slavi and his gang. When Robert becomes the personification of bravery by going into the lion's den, we immediately realize there is more to him than meets the eye.The fight sequences are brutal and well choreographed. When it comes to vengeance movies, I only view the protagonist as such if he only avenges those who deserve it - and not innocent bystanders. (Vengeance movies like the John Wick franchise where the so-called protagonist kills hundreds of people does not interest me, and I don't view him as a hero). With 'The Equalizer', Robert is indeed a hero and I wish there were more people in the world like Robert McCall.The main antagonist is Teddy - such a cuddly name and yet such a bad guy - with a body covered with tattoos like a colouring book! He is well portrayed by Marton Csokas, who makes for a ruthless villain. Another villain and head of a syndicate Slavi was part of only appears at the end of the film, but this gives us peace of mind knowing his vicious operations will end, which will free a lot of people.'The Equalizer' is loaded with words of wisdom, mostly coming from Robert. The film is off to a slow start, allowing us to get to know the character. As the film develops, it picks up the pace and Robert becomes an unstoppable and determined force. It also allows for very good character study. Denzel Washington does an excellent job portraying Robert.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good acting but turns into Steven Seagal movie,"The characters develop, the story unfolds..then after 40 minutes it turns into a Steven Seagal movie..played with Denzel Washington !! This is not as good as heat/ training day . I think I prefer Kevin's Costners' 3 days to Kill about 10 times over this. I hope he is the good uncle in the next movie!The movie is not original at all, the ending is pathetic, careless,.. the characters become inconsistent and careless! I should have left after 60 minutes..Did the script writers/ directors get impatient half way through ? did somebody tell them we need more Steven Seagal?Disappointed, I still give it a 5 ***** . 3 * for the first 40 minutes. and because the villain was also a good actor and 1* for Denzel ..It could have been 8 * easy had the middle to end of story been more believable, the characters more consistent/ careful.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Black Action Star,"The movie was amazing and will probably stay as one of my favorite action movies ever and to make matters even better Denzel Washington is the movie and his performance in the movie was impecable and so was the main antigonist performance.

A complete action movie that was fully developed in terms of plot, characters, action and almost everything it had to offer.The Equalizer is a remarkable action masterpiece! Denzel Washington isn't just a great actor, he's also one of the top action stars of Hollywood. As a killing machine who is equally disciplined and caring, his performance is a sight to behold.

Denzel has the moves!,"An early scene in the workplace where Denzel claims to have been one of Gladys Knight's Pips shows he's got the moves and is great fun.He is really good in this as a calm but completely badass lead, but I want to give due credit to Mr Csokas for bringing us such a watchable and charismatic villain.

"I can't believe I waited so long... Epic. Just, epic.","I actually thought I had seen this, although when trying to recall the plot, I could not. Unusual for me with a Denzel film as I always enjoy seeing him on screen (I once owned a 3rd gen Monte Carlo because I love Training Day so much).I pressed play on The Equalizer expecting to be entertained. I was glued to my seat the entire way through. Denzel is at his best here and does so much by doing so little, the subtleties in his acting are sublime. He really made me believe this character could do anything.The way it played out at the start made me think it was going to be pretty good, if perhaps a little average. I like that, especially when it just gets better and better and is so well layered. Fantastic character development without giving too much away and keeping the viewer guessing just enough. Perfectly paced, structured, filmed and the whole atmosphere is just a joy to behold. I particularly liked the audio as this is, at least as action movies go, a rather quiet one. The look and feel on screen is fantastic and the audio adds so much to the ambience.I highly recommend giving The Equalizer a watch, especially If you enjoy other films with Denzel Washington. You will definitely be entertained and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzell is one of the best actors in Hollywood,"The movie was amazing and will probably stay as one of my fav action movies ever and to make matters even better Denzel Washington is the movie and his performance in the movie was impecable and so was the main antigonist performance.The action was well layed out and sought through, although there are some scene kinda get me boring but the story and emotion put into this movie is just great and the music in this movie are amazing I even downloaded some of them on my phone so I could remember how it feels to be a badass like DenzelAnd the final fight of the movie where Denzel faces off against Marton and his gang in the super market was if not my fav scene of all time and the way Denzel finishes off Marton was just SOO BADASS and SICK, when I heard they were making a sequel I was the happiest man alive and when I watched it I had the same amazing feeling as when I watched the first one. My honest opinion would be something like 6.5 or 7/10 but I just love this movie SOO much I have to give it a 7",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great action vehicle for Denzil,"ACTIONDespite it's 2 hours and 11 minutes, the movie didn't feel long at all. Inspired by the popular television series from the 1980's, you might say this could be the new and improved version since in this variation he actually kills people for a change which TV syndicate at one time always tried to avoid until HBO started helming their own programs. On the first half hour or so, we see Robert McCall (Denzil Washington also credited as producer) as a regular blue collar worker, working as security in a hard ware store that operates like a 'Costco'. Robert is not like other people since it appears he has a mental disorder, that he has a knack for noticing small obstacles placed around him, and the director seems to point that out to the audience by using close ups of objects Robert notices. There seems to be a diner that he regularly eats in after work, and he also seems to notice other patrons who eat there as well, particularly Teri, the young teenage escort played by Chloe Grace Moretz, who wants to become a singer. By the time Robert notices her not stopping by the diner one day, he feels obligated to investigate. And it is during then we get to see that Robert is not just any other person. Although, I notice some of the movie inspirations, the real question is what are you going to do with them. Some of the ones I managed to pick up is ""Taxi Driver"" because of Chloe Grace Moretz playing an underage prostitute who acts like the Jodie Foster character, The Jason Bourne movies because of the quick action sequences, and '24 Days Later' because of the end musical score hype was similarly different. It's a reminiscent of action movies from the 1980's and 1990's that doesn't need CGI to make it entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

So mysterious and dark,"Robert McCall, a man with a mysterious background who lives quietly and peacefully, finds himself back to uphold justice after he meets a woman who is under the control of a Russian gangster.The Equalizer brings action movies that look calm, serious, and dark. The premise of the story is simple but still interesting. A mysterious man with a quiet life becomes a perfect portrayal of the main character. The plot of the story is calmly paced, neat and full of action. A conflict that for me is not very much brought with high expectations and is quite good. The dialogue in the film is flat without sufficient intonation and emotion. The film brings a smooth storyline. There are not many thrilling or suspenseful scenes. Indeed, seeing one-on-one fighting action is pretty good and cool. Especially in the final battle at the end of the film, Robert McCall is like McGyver in fighting his enemies.Robert McCall is played by Denzel Washington whom I like and am satisfied with. It looks dignified, calm, serious and has a strong stance. It seems to present the impression of being a quiet and peaceful yet deadly and dangerous person. The action from Denzel Washington is unquestionable. It's just that what he brings looks like a superior and the impression of 'the main character who is hard to beat' or the 'hero of misfortune' is so great.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good movie, could have been better","Older black John Wick does good things for people as the antagonist from xXx hunts him down.In all seriousness The Equalizer has some good action, good cinematography at times, and it was entertaining. I marked it down because some of the dialog is not delivered great, and the story was a little generic and predictable.The way John Wick handles it by not screwing around with a story and just getting right into was the way it should be done. The story of this felt like it was trying to give him a purpose to do these things, when you could have just done them from one incident.It also tries to tell you why he got out of the businesses, they give you his whole backstory. John Wick implies it, which it great, it leaves some mystery.Overall, good movie, but John Wick did it better. I won't be buying it, but will probably watch it a second or third time.

Cliché to the max,"Sadly, despite its potential (based on a great TV series) this film descends into a walking cliché aimed at men who think that deep down they are a hero who will emulate Denzel Washington's character. The lack of realism detracts from the otherwise popcorn entertainment value of the film and when you reach the final act, with everything in slow motion to moody music and explosions, before tying up all the loose ends neatly with a bow, it is hard not to roll your eyes and reach for the fast forward button. Having said that, some of the early sequences are very enjoyable and the acting, particularly from Mr Washington himself, does the best can to keep things north of mediocre. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Great Performance By Denzel Washington.,You can notice several things in this scene when McCall start analyzing the area first thing he notices is that the thug thumbs back the hammer he also notices the thugs eyes are unwavering and are at a fixed point that shows that the thug wasn't bluffing and he had the intention of killing the woman for the ring he also notices the tattoos on the thugs hand and neck indicating that he's a part or was a part of the Aryan Brotherhood and is likely done prison time increasing the chances that he wouldn't hesitate to kill the woman after that McCall is weighing his options he could kill the man in seconds and be done with it but there was the risk of the woman being killed in the struggle and as soon as the child walked in he realized that there was even a higher risk of not only the woman getting killed but also more innocent bystanders he figured the best bet was to let the man get away with the money in the ring and then deal with him later I love the way those scenes are shot no words need to be spoken it's all done visually,7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A brutal retelling of a class TV series not that thats a bad thing,"The EqualizerWhen I was a younger boy one of my favourite shows to watch was The Equalizer, Edward Woodward starred ion the 80's TV show which I absolutely loved. Now when I heard it was being remade at first I was pretty excited, all these actors who could I envisioned living up the mastery of Robert McCall, but when I seen Denzel Washington my first thought was WTF! I was horrified, how, and why. Why would they do that, sure Denzel was great in Man on fire and pretty much exactly what a real life Robert McCall would be. So it's taken me a while to sit and watch this one just for the simple fact I wasn't happy with the casting choice and couldn't see justice being carried out. I didn't want my childhood ruined!Robert McCall is a solitary man, a man who has routines and runs his life by them. Robert McCall also has a secret, one that only the closet to him will ever know. Every night Robert takes his tea bag wrapped in a cotton napkin and walks to his local diner, where he always sits at the same table, always places his book in the same position, always arranges the cutlery the same way, every night without fail he will be there. Over time he has formed a simple relationship with a young Russian singer songwriter who also frequents the diner and has her own secrets. By day Robert works in the local DIY store serving his customers the best he can. One thing you don't want to do though is p#ss Robert off and you really don't want to hurt his friends.The Equalizer is a brutal film, its hard core no holds barred action sequences will be enough to force a lot of viewers watching the scenes play out through their fingers. Robert McCall is unforgiving he is a character who sizes up a person and a room in matter of seconds. I will admit Denzel Washington (Man on fire, Fallen) who plays Robert McCall was actually great as the man he recreated and I didn't despise him as much as I thought I would, I would even go as far as saying perhaps it's better to watch this remake of the TV series with a fresh set of eyes, Denzel does his best to make Robert McCall his own and really does it well. Antoine Fuqua (Olympus has fallen, Training Day) really has made a name for himself as a director with his own style. As far as action films go I think he has a great eye for detail, he knows what is needed to make the scene perfect, greatest thing going for him is he likes his viewers to see what is going on in the action sequences, something a lot of directors have forgotten. The film also stars Chloë Grace Moretz (Kick A#s, Hugo) as Teri and Marton Csokas who is actually quite unforgettable in his role as Terry.The Equalizer will leave you wondering at first where it's going as the beginning is quite slow, but once the action picks up it leaves you wanting more. My only critique would be the few plot holes that are very apparent as the film plays out. It's not a game changer as anything can be forgiven if given a chance.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Completely astonished how good this film is...,"I only watched this 2014 film for the first time today.Like everything I watch, I never have expectations as that opens one up to disappointment. But if I had, I would have presumed it to be a good film and help pass a nice evening. I would have been wrong.The script here is nothing new - we have all seen likewise before. But this was far more compact and loved the overt good versus evil messages throughout.Denzel Washington clearly shone and carried this film but all others, for me, gave fine performances.It was the direction that was the standout for me. The attention to detail given to scene after scene was a sheer pleasure that most directors seem incapable of reproducing let alone exceeding. The music score was a superb accompaniment to the stellar film direction and never felt invasive.If only we had more 'Equalizers' to spread this kindness and eliminate the pieces of evil who so despairingly contribute to destroying the world we live in.

The Equalizer,"A man believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and has dedicated himself to beginning a new, quiet life. but when he meets a young prostitute under the control of ultra- violent Russian gangsters, he can't stand idly by - he has to help her.The Equalizer is directed by Antoine Fuqua and stars Denzel Washington. Direction of this movie was discussed for a long time. Indeed it had been told that Nicolas Winding Refn was first approach; which I can perfectly understand as there are some Refn' violent scenes brand throughout the film. I love Denzel Washington, he could make a movie about a man sitting on a toilet for the entire movie ant it would be a good thing to watch. However this film is a little bit more violent than just a man sitting on a toilet (more exciting as well) and Denzel Washington is the one thing that carries this movie along from the beginning to the end; and gives it the credibility it deserves. I really enjoyed the movie on the one hand because Denzel Washington sells every scenes he's in, he makes the over the top violent nature of this movie fun and more acceptable; and on the other hand thanks to Marton Csokas playing a pretty strong villain. Seeing them both interact is one of my favourite part of this movie. My favourite scene is in fact both of them having a pretty deep and serious conversation in a restaurant. This movie is violent, which can turn off some people. I have to admit that some violence may be over the top and unnecessary sometimes, as well as some side plots. For instance, Chloë Grace Moretz' character bring him back into this world and totally disappear for the whole movie. As an older bad ass character Denzel Washington is extremely compelling and endlessly watchable. But I was expecting to learn a little bit more about him though. I like roles like this, played by actors like him or Liam Neeson as well; they are good and smart, nothing about those guys is uncool. Finally, The Equalizer is totally aware of itself, there is no deeper meaning, no Oscars nomination pretending. This movie knows what it is, it knows what it wants to do and does it that's all.Overall The Equalizer is really entertaining. I loved it. The action is good, Denzel Washington is great, the villain is strong, but the story has some holes in it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A tad too over the top,"There is no bigger fan of Denzel Washington than yours truly. Dude is just great at his job. When a person's chosen profession is to portray other people than yourself, it's going to require a lot of studying. Or maybe just a lot of common sense.
 I think almost anyone with enough nerve can probably do some acting. All you have to do is watch how other folks do things in normal circumstances , and imitate them. 
 Yeah right... Denzel does every personality known to man in the most convincing way. From the super dork, to the cerebral peace keeper, to the slightly deranged family man, to the lovingly hateful detective. 
 I like real stuff in movies. The kind of thing that is actually possible for me or someone I know to witness on a given day. The ONE MAN ARMY kinda movie is not really in that realm. I mean does anyone actually have an affiliation with a person like this? Please tell me where these people live. 
 Hollywood has always done a good job of making Marvel comic heros seem to be normal. They make Gotham city and Metropolis look like everyday cities that just happen to have a dude in tights flying around saving days like kids save baseball cards.

Decent but failed to live up to its potential.,"I had high hopes for this movie and, while it largely lived up to them, I felt there were some glaring flaws that could've easily been avoided, which would've resulted in a superior film. For one, Antoine Fuqua did a mediocre job with the directing role. It almost felt like he had never directed a film in his entire life, found a list of all the cool camera tricks, angles, and cinematic effects, and felt compelled to include each and every one of them. How did this impact the movie? It made it seem as though it lacked any identity whatsoever. Secondly, there is a critical moment in the final major conflict resolution that is just terrible. To avoid spoilers, let's just say that the protagonist that had been established throughout the film makes a decision that he would never make. That, combined with the plot getting a little out of hand, made the last quarter or so of the movie hard to swallow. It wasn't all bad, however, as the rating should reflect. The acting was great and fighting sequences were done incredibly well. The build up and initial character and plot development were fantastic too. Unfortunately this film suffered from having a director who wanted to do everything instead of making a great movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Best Action Movie of the Year and One of Denzel's all time best!!,I had the chance to watch this this movie today on its opening night here in Dubai and I intended not to check out either its ratings on IMDb nor watch the trailer or even get to know the plot summary!! I just went in there with no prejudice hoping that Denzel Washington will deliver a decent movie as he usually does and make up my mind on it without any influence by rating or user reviews and to my amazement and amusement I got much more than what I bargained for!! In fact I was in front one of Denzel Washington best and most memorable movies of his entire illustrious career especially on the action side this movie easily compete with some of his finest including Training Day and Man on Fire and to me it was better than both. You see! if you tell the story line to anyone he would easily say been there done that yet a great film doesn't necessarily have a unique story line even the simplest of stories can create a blockbuster depending on how good the story is and how it was made!! Here the story deliver the ultimate fight between Good and pure dark evil and again it is almost a mission impossible with one guy fighting an entire special forces army!! so throughout the movie you are guessing what will happen next yet as any good memorable movie this one is not all about fight scenes which are extra ordinarily done by the way and more real and dark than any of your average action movies nowadays yet the good about this movie is the drama and act part are simply exquisite with some really memorable scenes and lines by Danzel and the crew that's why may be some people felt it slow at times as they may be came in only for the action yet if it was all action then may be you aught to watch a Bruce Willis action flick instead!! For if it was just a continuous shallow fight scenes it will easily loose it's depth and turn into a comic show rather than a good movie.This movie is an epic action movie that I believe in a few years from now shall be more appreciated than it is today!! Because people sometimes don't acknowledge how good a movie is until they hear more about it and probably watch more times to sink in!! This movie puts Denzel Washington character in the ultimate test with him taking on an entire ruthless Russian Mafia Mob with all their power and influence and with a super bad guy adversary played by the dark and sinister looking Marton Cokas who was Excellent in his rule and provided that ultimate adversary atmosphere that is one of the most vital elements of a good action movie just like it was the case in James Bond movie Casino Royale here again we get the same level bad guy if not more dark and sinister.I recommend this movie to everyone out there want to see an epic action movie that delivers to every sense of the word and I'm not who could be easily convinced with good action no matter how big and famous the cast were so here my evaluation has nothing to do with Danzel Washington being in the lead role yet he fits it perfect and deliver one of his best movies to date!!,10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Another Hit By the Denzel Washington/Antoine Fuqua Dynamic Duo,"The Equalizer is the latest film by acclaimed director Antoine Fuqua. Now, I feel a little embarrassed not knowing this director's name by heart because he has quite a few very respectable films under his belt. If you also do not recognize the name of this extremely talented director let me shed a little light. This guy is responsible for Training Day, Tears of the Sun, King Arthur, and of course the movie in discussion. The Equalizer satisfies in all the ways his other great films do but the directing talent is just one factor that makes this movie so great.A movie can have a superb story, amazing cinematography, and mesmerizing writing as well as directing, but without the talent to deliver it all, it finds itself lacking. This is where the gifted cast comes in, notably the star of this film, Denzel Washington. Denzel Washington is so talented he just makes almost every film he touches a hit. His performance in The Equalizer is no exception. I often think about these great veteran actors and actresses who just refuse to pass their prime. A lot of these performers are getting a little seasoned and makes me wonder if they can still pull off a great movie, especially an action one. Actors like Liam Neeson, Sylvester Stallone, and Bruce Willis are some to name a few. However, they refuse to be outperformed by some of these younger actors and far surpass them in authentic entertainment. Denzel Washington is one such talent.The Equalizer is about a man with a mysterious past named Robert McCall (Denzel Washington). Robert McCall is a kind man who is extremely tidy and lives according to schedule. He works at a hardware store and is respected in his workplace. He gives a helping hand to those in need and encourages them. The buildup of this character makes the audience automatically like him. He is a person everyone wants to know and a friend everyone wants to have. As I said, he is extremely likable. However, as with most interesting characters, he has an unknown and mysterious past. I am not going to spoil anything but let's just say this guy can hold his own almost any situation. Robert McCall finds himself unable to sleep most nights and befriends a young prostitute named Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz) whom he meets at a late night diner. Basically, the plot unfolds when Teri finds herself in distress and Robert McCall finds himself reluctantly resurfacing a former skill he vowed to never perform again to help her. This causes a chain reaction of hostile events to unfold forcing McCall back into a life he thought was behind him. The villain in this film is Teddy (Marton Csokas). I have to say, I was pretty impressed with this character. He just made a great villain. Marton Csokas has come a long way since his role as Yorgi in xXx. I was very impressed with the progression in his acting abilities. His performance was another key factor in the success of this film.So my verdict for The Equalizer is definitely two thumbs way up. This is all around a very entertaining film. The story is great and builds a strong foundation for the characters, the action and fight scenes are choreographed nicely, the acting talent really draws the audience in, and the directing is very commendable. In short, The Equalizer leaves the audience fully satisfied and wanting for nothing. I encourage everyone to see this movie. I really enjoyed it and know most of you will also. Until next Wednesday, I wish you all great cinematic experiences.Read more of my reviews at TheBrewBuzz.com",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Quintessential Denzel,"The 2010's was a decade filled with memorable action movies featuring badass special agents who could singlehandedly take down throngs of baddies and still make it home in time for dinner. Denzel Washington has played this role a few times throughout his career, but one of the most memorable occasions was when he stepped into the shoes of 'The Equalizer.'The 2014 hit had a time and place, but thanks to Washington's ability to balance being a serious actor with the ""shoot 'em up"" 'tude needed for a film like this, he made the role larger than the screen it played on. With Antoine Fuqua at the helm, 'Equalizer' was more than your average one-man army story.The moral compass that guided Washington's Robert McCall was admirable, as he cared deeply for those in his life who faced hardships - from his colleague Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis) who dreamt of being a security guard to a mistreated young call girl (Chloë Grace Moretz). While you don't expect to come across ""good"" acting in a film like this, the additions of silver screen veterans like Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman also brought some star power, and Martin Csokas played a true ice-veined Russian villain who had the tattoos to prove it.Sure, there are some borderline ridiculous scenes in here, most of which have to do with Washington outsmarting fellow trained assassins. But when it's the good guy getting to bring those who mean harm to justice, it's not so ridiculous. And to add to it all, this film is a gritty love letter to its setting of Boston.'The Equalizer' spawned a successful franchise and series.

Hollywood Cliché Meets Random Violence of Asian Movies,"I watched this movie not in a theater but on a plane, and I am glad that I did. If I had watched it in a theater, I would've had been depressed for a long time.The story of the movie is extremely predictable--a former special agent meets a helpless girl, and he uses his superhuman ability to kill any bad guy who stands between him and the girl. Because this story has been used in so many movies, it seems making another movie based on the story is completely redundant. Yet, they decided to make another one, and this movie follows exactly the same cliché. The plot is as predictable as it can be.The character development is also extremely poor. Our hero (Denzel Washington) risks his life and breaks vow to his beloved deceased wife for a girl whom he barely knows. There is no chemistry between them nor any rational for his behavior. The movie is also filled with cliché characters--cold-blooded hit-man, dirty cops, underachiever who needs a mentor to name a few.The director tried to make up for the lack of an interesting story and memorable characters with gruesome action scenes that are directly imported from B-level Asian action flicks. Although Denzel could've simply picked up an automatic assault rifle dropped by a bad guy and shot down the rest of them, he chose to use construction equipment to do the job. He was even able to kill a highly-trained former Russian special force hit-man wielding a MP5 submachine gun with a Black and Decker nail gun in a cowboy style shoot out. This might entertain 12-year old boy whose brain is filled with nothing but testosterone, but it makes the movie extremely ridiculous. The action scenes are so ridiculously unbelievable that I couldn't take this movie seriously.In sum, this is a movie that does not have much reason to exist. You will feel that you've seen at least a dozen of similar movies in the past. Please do yourself a favor and skip this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
I expected more but still good,When I heard positive reviews from friends I decided to buy on DVD. I expected more but I was not disappointed anymore. What I missed was a faster pace with much more suspense. It works anyway as a solid action thriller. This could be even a promising franchise for the future. I can imagine a sequel because it lets some potential story development. Denzel Washington came great here and was very cool. The action and execution details were well studied. But be warned: there are some brutal and bloody scenes.I liked the clear message in this movie for peace and not to abuse minor teenagers.For fans of Denzel Washington this is a must see. If you like this genre I recommend all Taken seriesMy rating: 6.5/10,6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tour De Force,"This is the modern day blueprint from which I hope more action films will follow suit. An interesting main character, good villains, good action, great tone throughout and a wickedly awesome musical score that sets the stage. To me 'The Equalizer' is all of that. You get quite a few known faces in the cast and they really showed up.Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) looks and seems like an average everyday joe, but don't judge this book by it's cover. He was once a highly skilled ex-military man knee deep in the intelligence business who's thought to be dead and has put that life behind him. That is until Alina (Chloe Grace Moretz) an acquittance that he always runs into, converses with at an all night diner gets roughed by and put into the hospital by her Russian organized crime bosses / pimps. So sets in motion this man's quest for justice which has far and wide implications. He has to battle formidable ex-Spetsnaz Nicolai ""Teddy Rensen"" Itchenko (Marton Csokas) & his cut throat mercs, a dirty Boston detective Frank Masters (David Harbour) and ultimately ""the head of the snake"" ultra rich, ultra powerful Russian mobster Vladimir Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich).Firing on all cylinders, 'The Equalizer' is a picture coming together in perfect synergy to be something better than it should. There's a great balance of action and heart but everything feels lean & thin with very little fat. They do a great job of progressively amping up the action while showing McCall as a real human being, caring and helping people out without going overboard. The directing from Antoine Fuqua is solid. I put it in the wheelhouse right alongside his best films Shooter & Training Day. Denzel Washington came ready and the script gives him the playground to do so. Best of all, Marton Csokas is really memorable. He's got a lot of fun moments through action or dialog and feels fleshed out to be something more than the usual one note presences we usually get in flicks like these.Enough can't be said of David Harbour & Chloe Grace Moretz too. David just shines in his role and tangos well with both the material & Denzel. While Chloe makes her character's bond heartful which is important when it's the catalyst for starting the whole adventure off on. It's not some manufactured fakeness that's used for a point and then discarded. Melissa Leo & Bill Pullman also put in decent bit roles. Lastly the musical score from Harry Gregson Williams and some licensed tracks pay dividends in helping to establish the tone they were going for.'The Equalizer' is as good as big budget action films get these days in my honest opinion. Containing all the necessary ingredients to entertain, but not stopping there to go a step or two further and provide some layers. I wouldn't argue with anyone who says it's not new ground, yes it's not original at all, but it's a killer fun time that I'm always down to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The vigilante Denzel never disappoints!,"Here is the usual Denzel Washington taking charge of a character, of a discreet but not too refined plot and making it a semi-masterpiece, certainly an engaging and adrenaline-filled film. The events that revolve around Robert McCall (Denzel) are full of violence, exploitation and crime destined to crash against this ex-military man with absolutely unique abilities. The double register on which the film flows sees a person with kind and refined manners transform into a ruthless and infallible killer determined to help those in need, in this case a young prostitute. The characterization of the ""bad guys"" contrasted by Robert's exploits makes the film truly exciting and non-trivial even if, as I was saying, the plot is not the most original. I liked it a lot and as often happens, the first in the series is preferable to the sequels, which are pleasant but predictable. Great movie, great character.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Bang Crash Boom They're all dead,"I usually don't mind Denzel and was looking forward to see this movie... Slightly intriguing at first although somehow already predictable. And then it became so tedious, like if it was superman with a magic wand! There was some good effort with mood, music and sound but at times it was out of syn-ch. with the action, or rather the lack of it. I think I could have watch it in FF one step and save time for the same result I think. Such a shame to waste good actors (for me one good actor) for such a flat story.

Reinvention,Edward woodwards 80s television series of this was fantastic viewing as a kid. This reinvention by denzel Washington is superb. Very sinister and well played Russian bad guys which sets up a very tense thriller almost in the same vein as Taken. The way Robert macall deals with his enemies is so disturbing yet entertaining. I would argue this is one of Washington's better movies and is probably the reason it is the only of his to produce a sequel so far. Part 3 has just come out so I am rewatching the first two to prepare for it. If the first is anything to go by they will be greatWell worth watching.,8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Really well done,"I've been watching a lot of action movies lately and thought this one would be just ok. I remember hearing about the infamous nail gun scene but it really worked. The writing was witty when it needed to be. The characters were well cast. None of this woke nonsense and Denzel was perfect for the lead. The ending KIND of worked but I feel they could have done a bit better in those last few minutes but either way this is a fun movie to watch. Certainly the hardware store aspect of it made this stand out from the many movies similar to this.If you're into movies like Rambo, John Wick 1/2, Under Seige 1 or maybe a bit of a stretch Die Hard you'll enjoy this. I'm certainly watching this again.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good start but then it ended up in a non-credibility mixture of MacGyver and Rambo,"Almost all said in the title. Denzel is great and I really like him but this role is far too overpowered and all the bad guys look so incredible weak that one should ask oneself if those guys could possibly be able to rule/suppress someone without getting kicked by some school boys. I like the first fighting scene (in the bar) which was good but then it started to become ridiculous. He can kill whoever, whenever, wherever with whatever he finds lying around. A mixture of Rambo and MacGyver. Sorry but that was far too much especially the fact that he consequently refused to use the heavy weaponry of the killed bad asses but preferred to use garden equipment or a nail gun powered by a war air pressure patron. I mean look at the power of the ""nail"" gun. I used some of those myself and they can never be that powerful out of the box. That is just one example of an too over-exaggerated ""hero"". 5 Stars because I like Denzel if it would't been him I would give around 3 Stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
At its best when it isn't trying to be 'cool'; at its worst when it is.,"My opinion of this movie has been up and down like a yo-yo over the years. When I first watched it, I really liked it. When I watched it for a second time, I didn't. I remember thinking it wasn't particularly exciting and was too sadistic for its own good. This time, though, that didn't bother me as much. Don't get me wrong: this version of Robert McCall is a total psycho. He solves practically every problem he comes across with violence, performing his efficient brutality with no hesitation and no remorse. He even seems to relish his actions on occasion, taking time to calmly witness the fear in his opponents eyes as he twists whatever implement he has inside them or coldly watches them die. None of that particularly bothered me this time, though. Not because it isn't an issue, but because the movie simply isn't that deep. Yeah, its hero is a bad dude. So what? I mean, it probably should have put more emphasis on making his actions seem at least somewhat undesirable, rather than painting them as being 'cool' or whatever. Yet, it isn't unusual for action flicks to indulge in unhelpful methods of resolving conflicts. The bigger issue is the pacing of the picture, which makes it far less action-focused than it should be and leads to some fairly uninteresting segments. It's at least fifteen minutes too long. The set-pieces are usually so occupied with being badass that they forget to actually be badass. Yet, there's a strange charm that clings to the affair. It's enjoyable fluff that's far more ridiculous than its aesthetic would suggest. It's not great, of course, and it's definitely flawed, but it's a decent action movie with some entertaining sequences and a solid central performance.Original Review: There's a slightly sadistic edge to a lot of the violence in 'The Equalizer (2014)', even to that perpetrated by our hero. It doesn't help that he's presented as a cold-blooded killer who often stares into the eyes of his struggling foes as the life slowly drains from them, someone who murders a number of people entirely of his own volition and not even in self-defence or in direct defence of others (though he does deal out death in order to 'help' people). The violence is so key to the plot, being used in all but one of the 'solutions' to the problems our protagonist aims to 'solve', and even the movie's overall arcs and messages, with our hero actively encouraged to go back to his violent ways and with those methods actually being somewhat endorsed as the only real way to 'win' even in a situation that could've perhaps been circumvented entirely, that the bloodshed feels highlighted almost to the point of glamorisation, as opposed to being shown in a graphic manner (perhaps more realistic than most) to emphasise its consequences - both physical and psychological - or its last-resort nature. These problems are emphasised because the flick clearly thinks it's incredibly 'cool' - with several moments utilising overt slow motion and an over-the-top score to try to convince you of its apparent 'coolness' and, in the process, completely reducing any effect the moment could've once had, instead of letting an inherently impressive moment naturally impress (at one point, even making a scene literally laughable). Despite the fact that it shoots itself in the foot, so to speak, and reduces its own impact through the very techniques it uses in an attempt to enhance it, the initial intention still shines through and actually makes for an experience that starts to, perhaps strangely, feel a little uncomfortable at times. It usually fails to provide enjoyment on either a serious or silly level, despite its occasionally successful character-work and some entertaining sequences. In reality, the first twenty minutes are actually the most successful. It's probably no coincidence that these occur before any of the killing kicks off, with the focus placed on likeable characters trying to help one another simply by being there and doing what they can. The best moments are the ones most akin to a quiet drama - and this is coming from someone who loves action cinema, by the way. This proves problematic, then, given that the whole point of the piece is that its protagonist is a vigilante. There's a key difference between hero and vigilante, though, and the film doesn't seem to understand that. There's no comment on his brutal methods or flawed morals. Most importantly, there's no real entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good action movie with story.,"It is a good action movie with strong story. Actions are classic and believable not foolish or unrealistic like in many action movies. Denzel Washington is perfect in his role. His electrifying actions really impressed me. Mostly silent, but sharp and smart mind, proper guidance and ever help behave to anyone, those are characteristic of Denzel's role is inspirable. Only complaint about we do not know his past very well.

Entertaining movie,In common with a lot of Hollywood features I have to confess I preferred the first half of this movie to the second half.The first half of the movie is very much character driven and focuses on the relationship between Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) and Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz). McCall is a man leading an ordinary life and getting away from the extraordinary talents from his earlier life. He befriends a prostitute Teri who is stuck in her situation despite dreams of being a singer. This part of the movie is extremely engaging and that certainly helps when the movie moves to a more action based focus.The second part of the movie is also pretty good although there's very little of the dialogue that makes the first hour so enjoyable.

One of My favorite movie ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10,"Strengths: The combination of Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington (Robert McCall) is one that always works. They bring out the best in each other. While this isn't one of Denzel's greatest acting jobs, he does way more with the role than you'd expect. The movie does a good job of showcasing how nice of a guy McCall is, which makes his violent outbursts way more interesting. The action scenes are well handled. I loved the way McCall would see things in slow motion before acting them out. They hold nothing back in terms of violence, making sure each scene looks as brutal as it needs to be.

Excellent actors and excellent characters,"Just great acting by Denzel- the action was awesome but the compassion and empathy was also. Great characters and actors.

Bloody Great Action film,"The Equalizer: I am gonna go on a limb and say most Denzel fans have seen his most famous role- Training Day. Denzel's role of the corrupted cop Alonzo Harris is known as one of the biggest badass roles of all time. Picture Denzel in Training Day, but as a good guy. That is his character in The Equalizer. To make it even better, the director from Training Day returned to direct this film. I cannot picture a better scenario. Despite some over the top Hollywood moments, The Equalizer delivers in strong lead acting, great music underscoring, and equally impressive action sequences to give one of the most entertaining action films this year.What I mean by over the top Hollywood moments is things like walking away from a huge explosion without looking back. Training Day was very successful at staying away from those kind of moments which is why it was such a memorable action movie. Unfortunately, this film decided to use those moments which are entertaining, but put it closer into the general action film category. These select few times in the film were the only moments where I was just thinking to myself ""really?"" Fortunately, nothing else seemed to bother me about the film.Now to the best part of the film, Denzel-freaking-Washington. He perfectly played this role, I firmly believe no one could have played it better. He wasn't just able to give you the great badass that the director asked from him, he gave more. He delivered great light comedy that really made the movie whole. Without it, the movie would have been too dark like The November Man. The action sequences in this film were very well done. What I mean is, they did not bring in a kung-fu master to have Denzel fight at the end or anything, it was just great street fighting. Denzel's character, Robert McCall, could slow down certain moments and see all of the angles he needed to defeat his opponent. The audience really just sat in awe at how impressive it was. The action sequences can get pretty bloody, so if you do not like those kind of things, I advise you not to see this film.If you are the kind of person who just loves action movies, I highly recommend The Equalizer your first choice going into the theater.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Leon, the Professional, doesn't have anything over this guy!","A very entertaining revenge movie. Not too far removed from Liam Neeson in ""Taken"" or Jean Reno in ""Leon."" And it has a nicely aggressive surround sound track. We watched it at home and several times we had helicopters flying through our viewing room, and the several explosions shook the pictures on the wall.Denzel Washington is Robert McCall, he is a gentle man who works at a Home Depot type of store in Boston, and spends many of his evenings at a small table in a dive of a corner café, reading one book or another. But we find that he has a mysterious past as a highly trained killer.He strikes up an unlikely friendship with Chloë Grace Moretz as Teri, and he soon finds she is being held hostage and mistreated in the oldest profession, a prostitution ring run by the Russian mob. Bob is sort of able to ignore it until Teri ends up in the hospital, in intensive care. After his offer to buy out her contract is rebuffed and laughed at, he goes to work to exterminate the mob.The main enforcer from Russia is sent to find out who was doing all this and to exterminate him, New Zealand actor Marton Csokas as Teddy.

"""When you pray for rain you've got to deal with the mud, too.""","Growing up I was a big fan of the old Edward Woodward TV series. Honestly, this is nothing like that. I'm not even sure why they gave it the same title. The only similarity, aside from the name Robert McCall, is that both stories are about former secret agents (although Denzel's previous occupation is never made clear) who use their abilities to help people in trouble. In the TV series, he placed ads in the paper and people came to him for help. Here he just helps his friends. I was mildly disappointed because I would like to see Denzel play a character a little outside his wheelhouse. What you see here is pure Denzel like we've seen in many movies by now. Still, despite the fact that it's very different from the series I loved, I had no real problems with the movie. It's very entertaining, as you might expect from Denzel Washington. He's one of the most consistent actors out there that puts out good movies for the masses, not just for the film snob crowd. It's slow-going for an action film (note the runtime) but it's never boring. There's no 'reinventing the genre' here but everything is done in such a way that should please the majority of action movie fans. For those wondering, Chloë Moretz plays a small but important part to the story. She isn't in the whole movie, just the first half-hour or so and the final scene.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A boring Denzel actioner that takes itself to seriously,"While Denzel Washington can be watchable even when he is playing a role in his sleep (like he does here) there is little doubt the shtick that has served him so well in films such as Man on Fire, Safe House, Two Guns, The Book of Eli, Déjà Vu and arguably others is starting to wear a little thin and when the re-teaming of himself and Training Day director Antoine Fuqua (who needs to show more of what he did with that film) produces such a mundane and predictable action thriller you know it's about time to try something a little different.A revitalisation of the somewhat forgotten TV series of the same name, The Equalizer sadly feels like a million similar movies before it despite Fuqua seemingly trying to difference itself from other such action/thrillers by ramping up the violence to 11 and bombarding your eardrums with Harry Gregson-Williams increasingly intrusive score. Another thing that Fuqua seemed to feel was necessary was to edit the film to an at times boredom inducing 2 hours plus and when the story is so cookie cutter as what the Equalizer entails there is no justifiable reason behind this. What Washington's bad guy dispatching anti-hero Robert McCall has to do is rescue poor street working girl Teri played by the annoying Moretz and then kill some bad guy Russians and this storyline is not deserving of the airplay it gets even though it's saved by the sleepwalking through Washington.Although his getting on in years now there is still no doubt Washington cuts a commanding and often mean presence on screen that allows him to make us believe his characters even when they're so thinly drawn and over the top as Robert is here. From his timing of the time taken to dispatch bad guys through to his ability to craft Home Alone quality traps in mere minutes, Robert is some form of retired Jason Bourne who really enjoys reading, not sleeping and killing copious amounts of bad Ruskies. Robert's history is only hinted at but his a man you don't want to mess with and Washington is the reason to watch this forgettable fair as everyone else around him hams it up and fails with particular mention needing to be made of Marton Csokas cringe worthy big bad Teddy.Some neat if over the top action scenes, another good yet worryingly similar Washington performance and the chance to see Washington dance in a hardware store are the reasons to catch this wholly unoriginal and often dull slice of action. It's about time we see Washington challenge himself once more but with his next project being the remake of the Magnificent Seven it looks like this tough man act is here to stay.2 and a half late night book readings out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check into -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pretty good,"The movie ""The Equalizer"" is kind of like a smaller scale John Wick with more grounded action. The only issue with it being smaller is that the end battle is almost a bit too contained, but other than that it works great. The idea for Denzel Washingtons' character makes for an entertaining film, with him essentially being a one man neighborhood watch that takes justice into his own hands.

Everything John Wick wanted to be.,"Guess which movie I'm describing:
A retired hitman/ agent is pulled back into butt-kicking mode because the Russian mafia messed with something he cared about.John Wick? The Equalizer?Answer: Yes.The difference is The Equalizer really just towers over Wick as a film.
Full disclosure: I appreciaed the cinematography of Wick and saw what it was going for but felt the whole film was flat and gimmicky more than the cool and flashy film it was going for.
Not all would agree with me.Where The Equalizer beats John Wick is that Equalizer weaves a story and plotline that is actually engaging, featuring characters that you care about.
There's the human element to The Equalizer that Wick just missed.
Denzel Washington is about the best at his craft and he shines at translating human emotions through his character onto the screen. Further, there was a redeeming aspect to the story with a guiding ""noble cause"" that excused this film from being just another action-thrilller filled with ""senseless violence.""The action sequences, while not as flashy as Wick, were delivered with more meaning.
Wick suffered from losing impact through running a continuous loop of action sequences that all started to blend together.
The Equalizer took care to mind the pacing and rhythm of the story, interweaving action and downtime for plot and character development.The story telling was direct enough to not be confusing, but left enough up to the imagination to avoid being boring. For example, it was never spelled-out what Washington's character did for a living prior to working at the hardware store.There were some interesting McGuyver-esque ""being resourceful with your environment"" elements to the action that was refreshing in comparison to the heaps of cliche action films where gunplay/ Martial arts are the only vehicles for kills.The cinematography was flawless and ventured into some creative shots and techniques. The big climactic ending entailed some dazzling filming involving some artful use of lighting and rain. That film-work alone is worth the watch.The main antagonist did seem to be going for a very Kevin Spacey vibe in looks and persona. The casting almost was a doppleganger for Spacey. I have to wonder if they missed an attempt at getting Spacey for the role. I felt on that front, it felt that character a bit forced
and cliche.My apologies if this review came off as more a comparison, but the two films are just so similar on the surface and (in my opinion) The Equalizer was a superior film in almost every way.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The Equalizer is an exciting, high-adrenaline thriller.","Denzel Washington gives a solid performance as always, but the Equalizer is of the same quality as many other Denzel led thrillers: without him it would not be meaningful, with him it's watchable & special. There's definitely a pleasure in watching Denzel taking down tough- talking baddies, and that's what the film delivers, no more, no less. The conflicts are generally well written and ratchet pressure nicely, especially when Denzel has some chilly conversations with his soon-to-be-victims before they inevitably make their bad decisions. The tense sit-downs were equally entertaining for me just as the bloody violence.

""" when you look at me what do you see?","The Equaliser tells the story of a man with exquisite killing and survival skills ( Washington) with a mysterious past. He uses this for good, helping a girl ( Grace- Moretz) who is caught up with the Russian mob. When members are killed by Washington the head calls on enforcer ( Csokas) to clean up the mess. This leads to an eventual showdown between the two. The cat and mouse game between them is what elevates this film considerably. Both men have their own philosophy and this is fleshed out thoroughly. Although you now how it's going to end Csokas is a formidable villain and very much matches Washington ( which is saying something). The brilliant restaurant scene is reminiscent of Deniro/ Pacino in Heat. Although the graphic kills require some suspension of belief, It is fresh ( being the first instalment) and quite enjoyable.

The Equalizer - Review,"Director Antoine Faqua and Denzel Washington have only made one film together, Training Day, which earned Denzel an Academy Award. Collaborating again, this time for The Equalizer, Denzel and Faqua have made another equally impressive film, but this time with DW as the good guy allowing us to get right behind the character.Beginning with the ordinary life of Robert McCall (Denzel Washington), we exaggeratingly see that is a routine man and secluded life to time perfection. But after befriending Terri (Chloe Grace-Moretz's singer come prostitute character) she is beaten by thugs. Not being able to standby and do nothing, McCall retaliates with the only way he knows going back into his mystery past.Although top-billed, Chloe Grace-Moretz has only fifteen-minutes screen time of the over two-hour feature. That, with perhaps a little too much time focused on ordinary life routine leaves McCall with a rather flimsy excuse and minimal hesitation to go back to his former attacking and defending black ops-commando lifestyle. From then onwards DW's McCall tackles crooked cops and stereotypical vodka drinking Russia mobsters left, right and centre as well as bonkers explosions that even Michael Bay would be jealous of - cools guys don't look at explosions, indeed.Presented very much as a superhero, McCall, before any killing sequences gets almost a spider-sense vision and everything slows down as he accesses possible weapons nearby before swiftly killing. At one point he clears a room of armed Russian mobsters in just 28 seconds - all with a bottle-opener! Impress yes, but it sadly verges on the fantasy rather than reality.Washington, even though a bad-ass commando, has a quiet and malice role. So much so, that the humorous moments, whilst subtle and quirky often seem misplaced as if there should be slightly more, or slightly less to fit in with the films overall ethos. Is he taking it too serious or not?Now aged fifty-nine, Washington seems to have found the action-hero mojo later in his career as Neeson did. And both, whilst Rambo-esqe killing professionals still lack the much needed catch-phrases after killing  'You have been equalized'- for example.The finale of The Equalizer takes place B&Q style warehouse showdown. As the action galore highlight of the film, it fulfills any fantasies to kill someone with mere house-hold tools. But does a spectacular ending make up for the otherwise mediocre beginning and middle?Based on the almost ninety episode series from the eighties, The Equalizer has already had a sequel confirmed before any general release - which whilst premature makes it Denzel's first-ever sequel to any of his films. With each of his latest movies racking in at least $20 million dollars on opening weekends alone, this is also a likely winner and quite possibly his first franchise?",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel is Phenomenal in This,"I had no idea that this movie and the original John Wick movie came out a month apart. I know the Equalizer is based upon the television series, but the style is very similar to John Wick. A likable man, trying to live a quiet life, gets sucked back into using his deadly skillset when dealing with Russian mobsters. The film is also violent, and showcases beautifully its stars fighting and weapons skills. The film, like John Wick, is also the basis for a series of follow up films which has all been well received by the public, even above, the critics. Denzel Washington is perfect in this film. He is the perfectly deadly, yet likable and noble anti-hero. Martin Csokas, from Into the Badlands, is phenomenal in this. He is a great villain. David Harbour is always watchable. Anton Fuqua is a great action Director and this is no exception. His prior work with Washington a big plus here. This is very watchable.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The flow is consistent and accelerates with some pauses that makes sense. All the characters are human except some vilains, obviously psychopathic.I was expecting the regular shoot them up.

Denzel Washington really makes the movie work.,"Robert McCall is a retired CIA agent, one of their best assassins. But he has left all that behind and has settled into a quiet life in Boston working a 9 to 5 job at a hardware store.But when a Russian teen escort he has befriended is almost beaten to death by a Russian pimp, McCall rethinks retirement and goes after him and and his bodyguards. What follows is a Tarantino-styled bloody one-man slaughter.""I promised that I would never go back to being that person, but when somebody does something unspeakable, you do something about it, cause you can."" - McCallWell word reaches Moscow and the powerful mob kingpin, Pushkin.... and Pushkin is not happy.""He funds everything: gasoline, weapons, girls, you name it. He's built an intricate network on both U. S. coasts that are incredibly well-insulated. His money and political ties make him untouchable"" - Susan PlummerSo Pushkin sends his very own top terminator... (Teddy) Nicolai Itchenko to ""fix"" the company problem in Boston.""Basically, he's a sociopath with a business card."" - Susan PlummerWith half of the Boston PD on Pushkin's payroll, Teddy has no problem finding McCall. But McCall goes to Teddy and gives him a warning.""I've done some bad things in my life, Nicolai... Things I'm not proud of. I promised someone I love very much that I would never go back to being that person... But for you, I'll make an exception."" - McCall
Although this is more of a Liam Neeson style character and story, Denzel Washington really makes it work.""What do you see when you look at me"" - McCallWell I did not see Denzel Washington in a movie like this. He literally goes from a quite and meek book geek to a brutal and bloody, merciless killing machine... And I totally believe it. Much more so than I expected.Cast - Denzel Washington, Marton Csokas, David Harbour, Bill Pullman, Melissa Leo, Chloë Grace Moretz.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
This was an action movie,"I went to the movies to see an action film and I got what I payed for, however I will say that the beginning of the movie was painfully slow, watching Denzel Washington read in his empty apartment is not my idea of a good time. However once the movie gets to Denzel Washington beating the crap out of Russians the quality of your experience goes up. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be subtle comedy or it's a Russian style, but the mustache on one of the goons in the movie was just ridiculous, so much that I laughed aloud. The movie definitely could have gone without it. Anyways I was not taken by Chloe- grace's performance as a Russian prostitute, it would have been better casted by someone who looked more mature, like scarlet johansson. I mean watching Chloe-grace in kick ass as a borderline kid and then watching her as a hooker, was too hard to believe.

One of the best action movies ever made. Period.,"I love smart movie-making, where the film doesn't spoon feed you everything, and instead respects its audience/viewers to fill in the missing blanks (another great example is Mad Max Fury Road). This movie starts slow with an intentionally boring life of an ordinary man, then ramps it up to true badassery when the time comes; the optimal use of theme music, and external tracks makes me get goosebumps every single time. Oh, and I've only seen 2 guys who can ""act"" incredibly without ""acting""/ with a poker face - one is Bill Murray, the other one is Denzel Washington.
PS: I love John Wick, but this movie outperforms it in every way possible, except for maybe Keanu Reaves.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Suspend your disbelief now.,"The premise to the story isn't anything new. Ex CIA military whatever operative trying to live a normal life but gets dragged back through the mud. Fortunately this movie has Denzel Washington. Super charismatic on screen, likable character, but at the same time looking like an average guy (no The Rock biceps). Unfortunately the premise to this movie isn't anything new. Protagonist is able to rig Home Alone style booby traps within minutes, survive situations that no real person would be able to survive, situations unfold in the exact way needed for maximum carnage. It's a movie to watch with friends on a Friday night when you can seriously suspend disbelief. It exists halfway between the all out action of a Bruce Willis Die Hard film and a Liam Neeson ""I will find you and I will kill you"" Taken.Oh yeah, Zack Hemsey - ""Vengeance"" is an absolute gem of a track that pops up in the climactic action sequence. Disappointed it wasn't played in the end credits. Instead we were given some gratuitous Eminem rap song.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The first film of The Equalizer based on the TV show.,"Based on the TV series in the 1980s, The Equalizer came to my mind. Now I have not watched the show in general but since I heard of this movie, everyone knows Denzel Washington is a fantastic actor and he'll do anything to keep up the best. Quite frankly the sequel came out in 2018 and I haven't seen it yet and I'll get around to doing it. All right, let's just get on with it. A U. S. Marine turned DIA intelligence officer named Robert McCall played by Denzel Washington who works at the Home Mart hardware store while spending some late nights reading in a diner and he comes across Teri played by Chloë Grace Moretz who works as a teenage prostitute for the Russian mafia. One night, she is hospitalized after being beaten by her pimp named Slavi. He meets her friend, Mandy, and he visits Slavi to buy her freedom. You know, this is just like John Wick to me, not just to say that it's been released the same year but to think that the action scenes look very similar. The fight scenes are very well choreographed and Denzel does an impressive job with the fight scenes. Some people say that this is one of the best action films in 2014, depending what I saw, I'd say I liked what I see. This is a really good film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Typical Denzel Wahington film!,"Denzel Washington films are starting to look like each other. I somehow could predict most of this film in advance. Plus it lasted a little bit too long. Since in the Cinema City they charge more for longer films I had to pay 1KM more for this one. That is not a kilometer or klick but rather konvertible mark, local currency.Well, since it lasted a little bit longer then usual I focused on many neat details in the film. Like the book he was reading, I read it when I was a teenager. Old man and the sea. Other cool details prevail like drilling a brain with a driller or the tattoos of the bad guys.All in all if you like D.W. (not Deutche Welle), and good action, this is a film for you.

Denzel's still got it!,"Without Denzel Washington, the ""save the girl from the mob plot,"" frankly, would have been too much ""dejavu."" However, Denzel's charisma and ability to direct the viewers thoughts away from the plot & on to him saves the day!I thought it could of had a slice more of action in it. But, again, Denzel's knack for capturing your every thought on to what his next move is, keeps us in enough suspense to drown out the non-suspenseful foreknowledge of the plots next move. Director: Antoine Fuqua, does an excellent job of giving us just enough Denzel, to keep us wanting more...during the movie and after the movie is over. Besides, who can tire of Marton Csokas bad guy routine? He's always laid back & cool...creating the impression that he has more layers of ruthlessness then he really does. And last but not least, Chloë Grace Moretz succeeds in making us all love hookers. I gave this movie a 6 for Denzel...the plot leaves more to be desired!",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Im blown away its amazing action film,"Denzel Washington's""The Equalizer"" is a high-impact reminder of his diverse career, combining action thrillers and dramas. The film is based on the 1980s TV series, ""Man on Fire,"" and stars Edward Woodward as a former covert operative. Despite lacking gravitas, the movie is sturdy in pure entertainment, with Washington taking his stealth vigilante role seriously. He pulls out his charm and deadly force, unlike many of his Oscar-nominated performances in ""Flight"" or ""Malcolm X."" At 59, Denzel remains dependable as a man who gets the job done and draws a crowd at theaters. ""The Equalizer"" stars Robert McCall as a low-profile clerk at a Boston Home Depot. Washington, a former Gladys Knight backup singer/dancer, lives a serene life with his co-workers, who respect his quiet demeanor. McCall jokes about his past, mentioning he used to be a Pip, a character he plays with respect and trust. The film explores themes of past relationships, friendships, and the impact of past experiences on the character. McCall, a skilled and skilled pip, can predict explosive situations with precision and swiftly eliminate potential threats. He uses a watch timer to determine the time it takes to eliminate a threat. Despite not using these skills for a while, he spends his nights reading classics in an all-night diner. He is soon called upon to use his fighting skills after meeting a wounded teen call girl who hangs out at the restaurant between clients. His skills are evident in his ability to predict and eliminate potential threats. ""The Equalizer"" is a violent action film directed by Fuqua, featuring a crude ballet of violence and water, aiming to wash away evil. The film's showdown in a mega-store workplace is entertaining, as it showcases Washington's ability to transform everyday hardware supplies into lethal weaponry. The film serves as an origin story for a new franchise, with an ending that suggests a new franchise is afoot. The film also acknowledges that those who qualify for a senior discount can also be crusaders, making it a welcome addition to the action game. The film's focus on mayhem in a place of commerce is a fan favorite since ""Dawn of the Dead""'s climactic zombies-vs.-humans battle. Denzel Washington returns to the role of former black-ops commando Robert McCall in the film The Equalizer, a remake of the 80s TV series. The film follows McCall, who volunteers to assist a young prostitute named Lena (Chloë Grace Moretz) who has been assaulted by her pimp. McCall has a meticulous daily routine, including a smoothie in the morning, working at a DIY superstore, and advising colleagues at a DIY superstore. He also spends time with Lena, sharing his wisdom and reading classic works of literature. The film is a small drama with a vague air of menace, and it's quite compelling. The Equalizer is a small drama with a vague air of menace, making it a compelling addition to the genre. McCall, a 59-year-old actor, takes out Lena's assailants in just 28 seconds at a private bar, leading to a chaotic situation. The pimps are part of a massive Russian crime syndicate, led by Pushkin, who sends his enforcer Teddy to deal with the situation. Dozens of people are killed, shot dead, and their testicles thrown in their mouths. The film has two issues: the desensitization to violence and the audience's disbelief as the toughest killers are laced by a man who can remember the moon landings. Despite these issues, Denzel's performance as Teddy is impressive, making even the most preposterous action scenes thrilling. However, his strength lies in his convincing toughness, preventing the end-of-the-second-act moment where everything seems lost. As McCall returns to overturn the oligopoly, the film forgets the issues of ageing and loss, which could be remembered when McCall returns for a sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
More of Denzel's pious cool,"This is coherent and stylized which is more than can be said about many films. Middle-aged Bob working the Home Depot decides on a whim to help the tormented girl who shares the same diner and happens to be a call- girl for the mob, only of course he's no ordinary man. Zatoichi-like powers of perception and just as deadly. The film in fact recalls Jarmusch's riff on Zatoichi, complete with kindly taciturn hero who lives monk-like in the midst of a comic-book violence.This is the American cool that comes from what we infer the lone hero has had chiseled away from him by sacrifice, it's not the Italian cool of Leone or the Japanese cool of Kurosawa. So there is a heavyhandedness about doing the right thing, a churchlike piousness, which when coupled with suavely evil Russians to whom gory justice is served in a myriad ways suggests just the opposite of introspectiveness.The last third is a complete bust, nondescript shootout, and then just like that show up in Moscow and back home again for the girl to pop up from around a corner and announce that she has ""changed her world"". Denzel smiles understandingly. Denzel by the looks of it has got a new franchise to toy around with for the next several years that lets him inhabit the same avenger persona as always.",,Anonymous,Crime

Good suspense and character-building, we certainly like whom he likes and want them avenged. I just can't see that type or amount of violence being necessary or good for the society in general. It's often said that in the good old days, sex was implied and out of our line of vision. I'm now voting for us to put the violence out of our line of vision also. Kids spend countless hours with the violent video games and movies of this type feed that appetite. What price are we paying as a society? How is this different than the ISIS beheadings? There was so much of this movie that I had to turn my head from, that I quite reasonably deserve a refund.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A Decent Action Flick, But has quite the lack of depth","The Equalizer offers a familiar yet somewhat underwhelming action experience. While it has its moments, it falls short of achieving greatness and settles for being an average action film. Here is what I have to say about it1. Denzel Washington's Performance (7/10): Denzel Washington, as always, delivers a solid performance. He embodies the stoic and enigmatic Robert McCall effectively, making him a believable vigilante with a mysterious past.2. Action Sequences (6/10): The action scenes are serviceable, with McCall using his lethal skills to dispatch his enemies. However, they lack the intensity and creativity seen in other contemporary action films.3. Predictable Plot (5/10): The plot is formulaic, following the standard ""vigilante seeks justice"" trope. It offers few surprises, and you can often see plot developments coming from a mile away.4. Character Development (4/10): The characters, apart from McCall, lack depth. Many are one-dimensional, serving as mere obstacles for the protagonist to overcome. More development and backstory would have added richness to the narrative.5. Supporting Cast (6/10): Chloe Grace Moretz and Marton Csokas offer competent performances, but their characters are not fully explored. Their potential is underutilized, leaving you wanting more.6. Pacing (7/10): The film maintains a decent pace, ensuring that you don't get bored. It moves swiftly between action sequences and moments of reflection.7. Cinematography (6/10): The visuals are well-crafted, capturing the grittiness of the urban setting. However, it doesn't offer anything particularly unique in terms of cinematography.8. Dialogue (5/10): The dialogue is often clichéd, with McCall delivering memorable but overly rehearsed lines. It lacks the sharp wit and depth seen in better action films.9. Soundtrack (7/10): The score enhances the movie's tension and action sequences, but it doesn't stand out as particularly memorable.10. Overall Impact (6/10): The Equalizer serves as an entertaining action flick for a casual movie night. While it doesn't break new ground, Denzel Washington's performance and some well-executed action sequences make it worth a watch if you're a fan of the genre. However, don't expect it to leave a lasting impression or offer a profound cinematic experience.In summary, The Equalizer is an okay action film, but it misses the opportunity to be something more. It's worth a watch if you're looking for a mindless action fix, but don't expect it to be a standout in the genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Neat film. Neato,"I remember the film being advertised as in the same vein as John Wick or Taken. I even went into the film expecting something similar, but the actual movie was nothing like that? But it was still satisfying nonetheless. I found some interesting parallels between the film itself and its main character. The violence, while being creative and scrupulous, isn't really excessive or over-the-top. It is quiet and patient. On first glance it feels cold, stoic, and emotionless, (and it really is for the most part) but if you go deeper you'll find enough heart and emotion. And overall, it is just so damn cool. Maybe could've packed some more energy? Not an all-time classic or something but deeply watchable and satisfying. Can't wait to see the two sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A bottom-shelf action thriller barely salvaged by its top-drawer leading man.,"It's a tantalising thought: Denzel Washington reunites with director Antoine Fuqua for a pulse-racing thriller about a man who seeks to right ('equalise') wrongs done to innocent people. Perhaps they can once again hit upon that thrilling blend of action and drama they cooked up in Training Day, which won Washington his second Oscar. Unfortunately, Washington is pretty much the only good thing about The Equalizer, which is really little more than a pulpy straight-to-DVD film rescued by the efforts and charisma of its leading man.Robert McCall (Washington) keeps his head down and his profile low at his new job in a hardware store - clearly hoping that the ghosts of his past will eventually disappear. When he befriends Teri (Chloe Moretz), a desperate waif forced by the Russian mafia into prostitution, he finally decides to help people with the death-dealing skills he's been trying to keep hidden. After Robert's bruisingly bloody confrontation with Teri's pimp, the terrifyingly efficient Terry (Marton Csokas) is dispatched by his Russian gang-lord to get to the bottom of things.This is the kind of thriller in which the bad guy - portrayed as enormously smart and powerful - lets the good guy slip out of his grasp for reasons of prolonging the film's running time. There's even an extended sequence at the end of the film in which Terry just stalks through a gigantic warehouse for something like twenty whole minutes, never finding Robert until their climactic show-off. Fuqua's film is almost unapologetically pulpy too, setting Robert up as an ultra-violent vigilante who gives his antagonists the ""choice"" to clean up their acts before he does it for them.It'd have been great if The Equalizer had dared to be a little more introspective, delving into the moral greys and difficulties Robert encounters in hunting down Terry and his gang. But, in the bloodshed that explodes all around Robert (most of it caused by him in almost chillingly cold blood), it actually becomes harder and harder to tell whether we're supposed to be rooting for Robert in the first place - even as the film practically yells at us that he's the most heroic person in this entire godforsaken mess.Truthfully, The Equalizer is the kind of film you'd imagine with Jason Statham in the lead - a disposable action-thriller with murky morals that exists solely for car-chase sequences and bullet-play. The fact that it stars Washington is both to its credit and its disgrace. He makes the film worth a watch, actually finding something a little human within a character who wasn't really all that well-rounded on the page. But Fuqua also wastes him, failing to find and colour in the layers and depth Washington could so easily have given Robert. For what it's worth, Csokas is a worthy adversary, stone-cold and utterly brutal, who stands up quite well against Washington.To be fair, Fuqua directs the film with his trademark ferocity, and many scenes drip gore, menace and tension in equal measure. There's even a little welcome comedy courtesy of Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis), the wannabe security guard who becomes the film's accidental hero. But it's not really enough to save The Equalizer from itself - the film practically begs to be allowed to build a new franchise around its butt-kicking protagonist, but fails to prove why anyone but the most die-hard of action aficionados would really want to see much more of Mr. McCall.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Still, all of these movies have to do with bad guys who need to be killed with the general theme of the movies being, how is the hero going to kill them? What innovative method is going to be used?I have wondered if Denzel Washington is proud of The Equalizer movies. That's a real and not a rhetorical question. I'm sure he's making a fortune on them. I can't criticize Washington for making them because I like these movies. They give me my quota of fake violence, some of which is so absurd, it is chuckle-out-loud funny.Anyway, that's my take on The Equalizer.

"It Could Have Been Better, But It Could Have Been Worse","The Equalizer is more of a slow burn than John Wick, and obviously not written with the same intent to have fun with the genre and make something a little bit new in the process, but it is certainly almost as good of a movie. My only issue with The Equalizer comes from the fact that Denzel Washington's character is fundamentally indistinguishable from his role in Man On Fire, essentially the same background can be extrapolated from both characters. This could easily be thought of as having been an alternate reality lived out by the same person in both movies. Having enjoyed Man On Fire a great deal, it is a bit disappointing to see what amounts to little more than a retread with different antagonists. Sure, the motivations that set events in motion are different, but that is really about the only other change. Still an enjoyable and satisfyingly violent movie, but it loses points for a blatant lack of originality in having Washington cast in what amounts to the same role he was already successful with in a better movie. Also, there was really no need for this particular movie to be more than two hours long. Also, it lost a step or two from the original television series. Worth seeing, but it has been done before and better.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

It will be an unforgettable experience for fans of Denzel Washington's genius.,"The action thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua, and was released on 2014, starring Denzel Washington, Marton Sokas, Klose Grace Morets, David Harbor, Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo.
The film begins in a low rhythm and quickly reaches an explosive state shines brightly.
Robert McCall is a man with a mysterious past. Now he is a gentle and ordinary man who goes to work hard and leads a solitary life as an employee of a hypermarket in the city. Meanwhile, he meets and befriends a young woman named Terry at a restaurant he regularly visits at night. One day in front of Robert, she is abducted by Russian mafia men. He later found her in a hospital with injuries sustained as a result of the brutal torturing. He realizes that she has to escape the clutches of the Russian mafia in order to have a good life.
With this, there is no doubt that the revenge against the terrible Russian Mafia for the calm natural Robert will thrill the audience along with the theme and the excellent performance of actor Denzel Washington.
He fought against the injustices before him and came to the aid and shade of the helpless common people. The different presentation, excellent cinematography and heavy BGM bring the film to a high standard.
I am sure The Equalizer will be an unforgettable experience for fans of Denzel Washington's genius.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Equalizer,"In ""The Equalizer,"" Denzel Washington once again proves why he's one of the most compelling actors of his generation. Directed by Antoine Fuqua, this action-packed thriller is a gripping adaptation of the 1980s television series, infusing it with modern sensibilities and a hefty dose of Denzel's trademark intensity.The supporting cast also delivers solid performances, with Chloë Grace Moretz bringing vulnerability and depth to her role as Teri. Their chemistry is palpable, lending emotional weight to their scenes together. Marton Csokas deserves praise for his portrayal of the chillingly menacing villain, Teddy. His portrayal is suitably menacing, serving as a formidable foil to McCall's relentless pursuit of justice.Director Antoine Fuqua infuses the film with a gritty and atmospheric aesthetic, capturing the dark underbelly of Boston with a keen eye for detail. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and executed, showcasing McCall's lethal skills with visceral intensity. From brutal hand-to-hand combat to tense standoffs, each encounter is pulse-pounding and adrenaline-fueled, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats.Where ""The Equalizer"" truly shines is in its exploration of moral ambiguity and the nature of justice. McCall's actions blur the lines between heroism and vigilantism, raising thought-provoking questions about the nature of right and wrong. As he confronts corruption and injustice, he is forced to confront his own past and the demons that haunt him.However, the film is not without its flaws. At times, the pacing feels uneven, with certain scenes dragging on longer than necessary. Additionally, some plot points feel predictable, robbing the narrative of some of its tension and suspense. Despite these shortcomings, ""The Equalizer"" remains a thrilling and engaging ride from start to finish.In conclusion, ""The Equalizer"" is a captivating thriller anchored by Denzel Washington's powerhouse performance. With its gripping action sequences, compelling characters, and thought-provoking themes, it's a worthy addition to the genre. While it may not reinvent the wheel, it delivers exactly what it promises: a pulse-pounding, edge-of-your-seat experience that will leave audiences craving more. For fans of action cinema and Denzel Washington alike, ""The Equalizer"" is not to be missed.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

'The Equalizer' shoots for 'great' and lands on 'good.',"I was a fan of the old 80's 'The Equalizer,' and I knew this modern take was going to be different. So I went into it assuming it was going to be a stand-alone type and that I shouldn't hold it to the series. I was right. If you're a fan of the 80's series, don't watch this movie thinking you're going to talk a walk down memory lane. It just isn't there.That said, it's not a bad movie. It tries to be 'great,' and it lands on 'good.' The first three quarters or so are 'build up,' and the story is OK, but there really isn't much there. It's hard to rely on story when the main character and his past are shrouded the entire time. The story we do know? Well, bad Russian guys are doing bad things. That's pretty much it. Not terribly creative or deep, really.The first three quarters are slow with a bit of action inserted here and there, but it really picks up in the last quarter. Even then, it's only 'good' and the ending is somewhat anticlimactic.Don't go out of your way to see this one, but if you're out of movies to watch, it's not a bad flick. It's just not a great flick. And if you haven't seen 'Man on Fire,' watch it instead for sure. Or hell, watch it again instead of this one. You'll certainly be more satisfied.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

When Pushkin Turns To Shove...,"I can vaguely remember watching at least a few episodes of the original TV series of ""The Equaliser"" which starred Edward Woodward and boasted a quirky theme tune by The Police drummer Stewart Copeland. Woodward in his day was a serious, well-regarded, if very actor-ish performer whose very appearance in such an action anti-hero role as the avenging angel of Boston raised eyebrows about him slumming it at the time but as I recall the show was very successful, especially Stateside and certainly ran for a few series.I say this because for me the idea of Washington, who I'd probably say is one of today's more serious, well-regarded if a bit actor-ish performers taking on such a part in this glossy, high-tech adaptation, is one I found similarly surprising. It's almost a Black Superman role as he plays by day a mild-mannered, heart-of-gold garden-retail store employee, supportive of his co-workers, checked-out by the discerning older lady amongst them, but who keeps himself very much to himself. When he clocks out he lives quietly and anonymously in a small apartment and plays the nighthawk in the evening by haunting his local diner where he eats his meals quietly, reading a classic book to pass the time. He's acquainted with a fellow-customer, a pretty young Russian girl-prostitute and it's through her mistreatment by her vicious pimp that we discover McCall's secret, as he turns into a veritable one-man-army to take on the powerful Russian mafia operation of which prostitution is only one strand, headed by the mysterious oligarch, Mr Pushkin.Mr P then sends over his top terminator, Teddy Rensen (Marton Csokas), a mean mistreater if ever there was one, as you can tell by the tattoo count on his muscle-honed body as the film builds towards its inevitable face-off between the two, which unusually takes place back in the very store McCall works by day. By this time we've learned that our man is a retired Special Operations Operative, who walked away from the job when his wife died and really isn't to be messed with, but those pesky Russians just don't see this and keep coming after him, allowing McCall to devise ever more gruesome means to despatch them one-by-one and of course being the kind of guy who doesn't leave a job half-done, there's a final reckoning with the big boss man in his own lair which serves as a kind of epilogue.I'm not averse to this kind of very stylised, if very violent action thriller, I know my Bond from my Bourne, although the levels of excess employed here make old Jimmy and Jase seem like amateurs compared to what old Bob gets up to.The action sequences are ruthlessly choreographed and extravagantly set up using the by now familiar devices we associate with this type of designer violence with its mix of pinpoint jump-cuts, pyrotechnics, super slo-mo and rigorous fight sequences. Denzel probably gets as little dialogue as he's ever had to speak in a movie, as the strong-silent McCall while Csokas makes for a suitable, if ultimately doomed protagonist. It's all served up with a pounding, industrial-type soundtrack, just as you'd expect.I won't deny that I enjoyed this clichéd, mindless maelstrom of a movie, held together by Den's eye-of-the-storm lead role. And as for Denzel as an all-action killing-machine, well if Edward Woodward would, why wouldn't Washington?Unsurprisingly, I see, the film was successful enough to spin off a sequel and you know, one of these crazy old nights in the not too distant future, I'll probably disengage my mind again and check in on what Mr McCall did next.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Disappointing, as it appears to totally reverse the original premise.","Call it something else, anything else. If Matt Damon thinks it inspired the Jason Bourne stories, then he clearly never watched the original series.For Edward Woodward's The Equalizer, violence was always the last resort... he tried first, to do everything possible to expose the miscreant to lawful prosecution or forced retreat through intimidation. One classic line from the original series referred to killing a man as denying him the last opportunity to change. The Equalizer was a man who had seen too much violence, and only sought to protect, not to cause further bloodshed. Yes, it was sometimes necessary, but there were entire episodes where he found a solution that didn't result in gun play and violence.This is simply, one more cheap Hollywood violence fest that undercuts any attempt at moral authority that Hollywood likes to pretend to on violence in our society. I'm glad that Edward Woodward is no longer alive to see the travesty they have made of one of his most memorable screen characters. I like and respect the ability of Denzel Washington, but I will NOT watch one moment of this cheap knockoff of a series that I very much enjoyed.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
nice action movie,"There is one side in the film when it's totally gripping, that is when we just see the protagonist as a person living in an ordinary life, often being with people and often encountering them getting in trouble by crime. This grounded world just keeps most of its darkness in their presence, sometimes feeling like a doomed, helpless world. But once the hero reveals what he truly is capable of, it doesn't actually sucks out its entertainment quality, but it does betrays that intriguing context, nearly turning itself into a superhero movie, except of course, it's less silly and much violent. McCall, in shorthand, is too competent for any criminal he fights and often leaves with a perfect swagger. It may not be big deal to many viewers, especially the action fans who are already enjoying the blood, but the film sets up an existing theme that seems to be a lot interesting to consider instead of indulging itself with its own way of justice.

What surprises me is that he didn't keep the money before throwing McCall out.Before the dust settles the crew is dead and the pimp is dying a slow painful death. Enter Martin Csokas a.k.a.

Washington and Csokas steer the ship,"While it's predictable and by the numbers, Denzel Washington as the protagonist Robert McCall is exceptionally easy to watch, even when a lot of what happens is ludicrously unbelievable. Csokas as the psycopathic Russian is fiendishly good and the cat and mouse game between the two is hard to look away from.Not quite sure why Chloe Grace Moretz is only seen at the start and end of the film and nowhere in between, as she is a talent and should have been more involved in the heart of the story. Plot holes of illigocality are also noticed on more than of a couple of occasions and set the movie back a bit.

I Can't Trust a Denzel Washington Movie Anymore,"Sad. This was barely a notch above a Steven Seagal movie. But worse, it had Denzel Washington in it. That hurt me.The movie was as cliché' and stupid as most action movies. This one seemed slightly unique in its bland of the revenge porn template with a slasher gore thing. Only the slasher was the protagonist.Seeing Washington put a screwdriver into the back of someone's skull, then pull the trigger, was truly the low point of his career. But it was also another low point in mainstream American film.The moral inversion is almost complete. We have serial killers as heroes. Why not a madman with power tools.This kind of violence is supposed to be funny. The chainsaw massacre, so over the top, you laugh out loud.

The Return of the One Man War on Bad Guys,"The Equalizer is loosely based on the 80's TV show of the same name, but it might have more in common with the corny action movies of that era that featured one man armies against hordes of bad guys. Denzel Washington takes the title role as a mysterious ex government agent of some sort who is trying to live a life of normalcy. But when he befriends a prostitute played by Chloe Grace Moretz and she falls into trouble with her Russian mob pimps, he falls back to his old skill set to reap punishment on her accosters. And Washington's Equalizer ain't no punk b---h.Like the Stallones and Schwarzneggers of the aforementioned 80's films, Denzel is a wrecking ball of ridiculous force and wrath. But while those old 80s flicks lacked style and creativity, director Antoine Fuqua breaks out the tricks and flash of his growing repertoire and holds nothing back in the manner in which Washington dispatches baddies. While I raised an eyebrow at the ease in which a 60 year old Washington worked his way through his adversaries here, I was still entertained by a decent script and well shot action scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Fish gotta be the Fish,"Greetings again from the darkness. While you are likely familiar with slapstick comedy, this latest from director Antoine Fuqua could be described as slapstick action. This fits because the implements of destruction include barbed wire, a power drill, a book (hardcover, of course), a nail gun, and even a corkscrew. Such an unusual assortment takes a bit of edge off the the extremely graphic violence. If the kills weren't so gruesome, we might be tempted to chuckle.Writer Richard Wenk adapts the story from the terrific TV series which ran from 1985-89. It starred the late, great Edward Woodward as a classy, sophisticated guy who believed in justice for those who needed help against the odds. For the movie, Denzel Washington takes over for Mr. Woodward as Robert ""Bob"" McCall ... the seemingly normal guy with extraordinary skills used to balance the scales.McCall lives a quiet life with OCD tendencies. He is a friendly guy liked by his co-workers at the home improvement box store (imagine Clark Kent working at Home Depot), and even mentors an overweight hispanic young man in his quest to pass the security guard test. McCall is also an insomniac who hangs out after hours reading Hemingway at a local diner, passing along words of hope and wisdom to an underage prostitute (Chloe Grace Moretz). None of these people have any idea of McCall's previous career with ""the company"". Our only glimpse of this is a quick visit to the home of characters from his past, played by Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman.Our villains here are the Russian mob, and it's tough to beat that accent for a juicy villain. David Meunier (Johnny Crowder of ""Justified"" fame) is our first goon, followed up by the slick and menacing Marton Csokas (The Debt) who has an impressive resume of his own. It would have been interesting to have more screen time together for Csokas and Denzel, but we understand why that's not practical.Similar to the Bourne movies, the good guy always seems to be a step ahead of the bad, but that has little impact on our ability to find fun in the action. Director Fuqua provides four or five really stylistic shots (including super slo-mo), but also relies on Michael Bay-splosions for one laughable scene at the loading docks. Another missed opportunity is the score. We are slammed with a thumping bass line through much of the movie, rather than utilizing the Stuart Copeland theme from the TV series. Expect McCall to arrange the flatware just so, and continue to dish out justice in at least one sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Antoine Fuqua and Richard Wenk revive The Equalizer in a solid genre exercise anchored around Denzel Washington's commanding lead even if the film is longer than needed,"Set in Boston, Massachusetts, Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is an unassuming man working at home improvement store Home Mart who while personable and charming is also enigmatic as he keeps his past and private life closed off. At a diner he frequents, Robert has the good fortune to meet a teenage girl named Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) who cultivates a friendship with Robert revealing her true name to be Alina who has aspirations of singing. After learning that Alina has endured a savage beating by her pimp Slavi (David Meunier), Robert revisits the skills from the life he thought he'd left behind with his act of retribution against Alina's criminal escort service soon escalating into a full-on war with corrupt cops and Russian oligarchs.The Equalizer is a 2014 action thriller based upon the television series of the same name that ran from 1985 to 1988 and featured Edward Woodward in the role of Robert McCall. Original series co-creator Michael Sloan along with producer Tony Eldridge sought to adapt the series to film around the mid-2000s with the two eventually partnering with producer Mace Neufield and eventually setting up the project at The Weinstein Company where it lingered in development hell. After the Weinsteins let their option lapse the project was revived at Sony Pictures and Escape Artists as a vehicle for Denzel Washington with Antoine Fuqua soon joining as director having previously directed Washington in his Oscar winning performance in Training Day. While critical reception was mixed (though praising Washington's performance and Fuqua's direction), the movie proved a considerable hit for a mid-budget adult skewing action thriller earning $190 million against an estimated $55-73 million budget which gave way to sequels which in a break for Washington's traditional avoidance of sequels or franchises saw him return for each one. The Equalizer is pretty standard genre fare that doesn't break far from convention, but as a genre exercise it delivers on what you want and builds around a solidly engaging character and performance in Washington's McCall.From the opening the movie does a solid job of setting up Robert McCall with Washington playing an enigmatic character of shadowy origin which is pretty standard for this type of film, but while Washington does play into that side of the character he's also allowed to be charming and possess some humor which keeps the film from feeling rote. Washington's performance as McCall shows himself to be someone driven to action and right wrongs and from unscrupulous flesh peddlers and corrupt cops to Russian mobsters the movie gives no shortage of irredeemable villains for McCall to lay to waste. Fuqua and writer Richard Wenk concoct a number of solid set pieces in the film with one of my favorite aspects being that McCall uses almost exclusively improvised weapons or misdirection on his opponents rather than firearms which keeps the set pieces engaging. With that said, did The Equalizer need to be 132 minutes long? Probably not especially since it does feel like the kind of story that would be more suited to a streamlined 90-100 minute runtime. That's not to say The Equalizer drags its heels or waste time on unnecessary material, but there were instances where I could see the plot straying a bit far from the main thread even if it was well acted and had my investment. The movie also felt like it didn't use some parts of its cast as much as it could've with Moretz very good in the opening act but disappears until the very end, and David Harbour feels wasted in his role as a rather nondescript corrupt cop.The Equalizer is well acted and thrilling with a solid lead actor and some memorable setpieces, even if some actors feel a bit underserved and there's maybe a few plot tangents that could've been reined in for a more streamlined focus. However, with a pairing of Fuqua and Washington you're promised something gritty and thrilling and it delivers.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Possibly the best action film ever made,"If you 're a fan of movies with every day bad a$$ heroes then this one is for you, basically Denzel plays a retired government agent/assassin, but he is now working at a diy storestore, he meets a woman who wants to be a singer but is being exploited by Russian gangsters, Denzel is a firm believer in helping his friends achieve their goals and does not like to see injustice, so anyway he helps the lady he met out of her situation, but in doing so opens up a whole can of worms.

Even liberals will like the action.,"""The great and abiding lesson of American history, particularly the cold war, is that the engine of capitalism, the individual, is mightier than any collective."" Rand PaulHe's not the detached Jason Bourne and he's not the swinging Bond, but Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is tougher than the two. A modest Home Mart employee, he has a past no one knows about. When asked by some young co-workers, he admits to being a ""Pip,"" as in Gladys. So goes Robert's infrequent wit in the exciting The Equalizer, based on an ancient TV show.Although he has a limited sense of humor, his past working for a federal investigative agency was intense and unusual enough that he went into a protection plan with a new life. While visiting a diner straight out of Hopper (he is a ""nighthawk""), he meets very young escort Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) and spends the rest of the movie revisiting his considerable killing skills to protect her.So far nothing new except no romance, many clichés, and stereotypes (especially the Russian mobsters and their thugs). However Denzel brings a quiet competence and compassion to Robert's character despite kicking ass every few minutes. Thus, consider the relevance of Rand Paul's comment introducing this essay about the power of the individual. Liberals, however, will enjoy the action with its mixture of caring and retribution.Interestingly, although the Equalizer doesn't stray far from the thriller formula, the characters are unique enough to enlist your sympathy, and we all know from our Greek dramas the importance of having sympathy for the hero.One of the more fascinating motifs is creative killing, wherein at one point, the hero uses material in the home improvement building to take out the Russians. The killing is clean, there's little blood, and it's fun to watch if you enjoy that kind of thing.Given the heat generated by Putin over the Ukraine, this smart film is prescient about the resurgence of Cold War situations and attitudes:""The Cold War isn't thawing; it is burning with a deadly heat. Communism isn't sleeping; it is, as always, plotting, scheming, working, fighting."" Richard Nixon",,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel still delivers.,"While not being somewhat outstanding, The Equalizer is still a potent, albeit a bit too slow-paced, action movie. The plot, obviously, is not very original, so the main question was how good it would be executed.The result is mostly satisfying, among the strong sides I'd name: of course Denzel Washington, who never disappoints (although his other movies I've seen were better), gory action and the overall classic action movie feel to it - the hero is super bad-ass, always walking slowly, dispensing kickassery and not looking at explosions, while the villain is properly menacing and ruthless. The movie's not without flaws, and shaky camera work during action scenes, overly slow pacing and the stereotypical bad guys are among them. (Russian gangsters with cheesy tattoos, lots of vodka and tons of Kremlin and Red Square pictures) Despite that, the movie manages to hold its own and be worth your time and money. It's quite refreshing to watch an old-school bad- ass-distributing-justice movie after all those comic book adaptations and the rule ""Denzel doesn't play in bad movies"" still works.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
All things are not equal,"One of the most exceptional movies in the last few years - Denzel Washington provides a compelling - if not totally believable character. Working off of the 1980s television show with Edward Woodward - the story cuts a remarkably good plot - but do not expect too much from it or you will be disappointed. The biggest critiques I have heard from people are that there are elements of the movie that make no sense - and this is primarily because the scriptwriter has seen the original series and assumed a lot of the character into evidence - but there are notable points in the movie that occur once never to be seen again that make you wonder exactly why the heck they left it in.My biggest complaints are that there precious too few action scenes - Martin Csokas owns the bad guy role to the Nth degree - but with a sinister malevolence rather than a ""kick your ass"" approach. Washington is pretty damn hardcore in this - but his ""kick-ass-omoter"" barely reaches a three on the ""frequency of scenes"" scale. Chloe Grace Moritz plays an outstanding supporting role - but again, there is not enough of a back story to merit the movie - I would have liked them to have drawn out her situation in significantly more detail.Testosterone moment came from scene stealer Haley Bennett and her apparently endless legs.Certain elements of the film are just entirely too stupid to handle with one particular interrogation scene that will have you screaming at the screen ""why doesn't he just press the damn button??"" other than those complaints. The acting with what is a great plot - but a relatively poor quantity of action is utterly superb - and it gives a fine start to what could be a fantastic series of movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Best Denzel Action Movie,"I may be just giddy about this movie because I just saw it and I'm already thinking about when I'll see it again. OK, so the mere fact that Denzel Washington was in the movie was enough to get me to see it. Is he a good actor? Yes, he's great. But it's not only that he's a great actor, he chooses excellent films. He has an uncanny knack to choose perfect roles OR he's just that good that he makes the movies better.I went into this movie thinking ""Man on Fire"", another Denzel action movie that I loved. Well, if you want a true reference for this movie, think Man on Fire, Bourne Identity and R.E.D. but better.The acting was great, both from the protagonist and the antagonist. Not that the acting had to be that great because this was an action movie after all, but it's always better when the actors give a good performance. The directing and cinematography was wonderful too. The director, Antoine Fuqua, who also directed Training Day, masterfully worked the action scenes with well timed slow motion and soundless shots. Even the musical score for the climax was enough to draw you in.The entire movie boils down to Denzel Washington playing Robert McCall, a retired agent that has incredible skills. He played the quintessential hit man/assassin.Intelligent. Check.Creative. Check.Skillful. Check.Ruthless. Check.Ice in his veins. Double Check.Robert McCall was so sure of himself it bordered on arrogance. He was so ingenious it bordered on savant. He was so tactically cold and calculating it bordered on robotic. He was so altruistic it bordered on saintly. To be honest, he was a character that I'd abhor in another type of role just because of how pristine he was, but I admired him in this role. Everyone loves the helper to the oppressed and voiceless.In summary: I loved the story; the build up, the climax and the ending. I loved the players, both the good and the bad. I just plain loved the movie. Throughout the movie I was demonstratively trying to hold back oohs, aahs, yips, yaps and claps. It's been a long time since I wanted to applaud after every action scene. My favorite Denzel action flick.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Old School Action,"A one man show from Denzel Washington in The Equaliser makes it an engaging action movie even though the film is too predictable and clichéd. Smart dialogues, old and conventional but good doses of action and above all a stylish performance from the Academy Award winner DW makes this film a watchable one. Robert McCall who is leading a quiet and peaceful life after retiring as a Black Ops Commando is forced out of his self imposed exile to get back to where he was and what he does best. On trying to help his female friend Alina who is a sex slave in the hands of her pimp, McCall confront and take down the Russian mafia single handedly to extract revenge.Story wise, the film has nothing new to showcase but Washington deserves full marks to make the film a watchable one through his smart and stylish acting , action and dialogue presentation. Its not that we have action each and every scene but an action mood is created throughout the entire length of the film.On the acting side, as said earlier its more or less a one man show from Denzel Washington and he is supported well by a host of other actors especially Marton Czokas enacting the character of Teddy the main henchman of Russian mafia don Pushkin.Nice camera work and cuts along with impressive background score too. But the VFX had some drawbacks, to be specific the bombing scene of undercover building of the gangsters. The latter portions have been too stretched and deserved a trimming of ten to fifteen minutes.Overall, here is a money worth old school action and revenge movie for a target audience that serves its purpose and i go with seven out of ten for The Equaliser. With a sequel in the early planning stages doing the talk, its better you get a feel of the movie now and get ready for more thrills.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Washington in Driver's seat,"I love it when old guys do the ""coming out of the hibernation"" action movies. So I am going to be partial with this review. After a loud ""Olympus Has Fallen"", Fuqua comes out with a bit more subtle action movie this time. It's not complete popcorn stuff. But it's a must watch for Washington's fans. He occupies almost every frame of the movie (no kidding!). The story is pretty simple. But screenplay is well handled. The movie might bore the family audience at times, but not for long.Movie is about how a former CIA (cliché I know) operative takes on Russian gangsters and the whole mob to save a girl whom he meets at a bar. There are some subplots as well to show how our protagonist is a ""Knight in shining armour, except he is living in the world where the knights won't exist anymore"". They add a nice build up to Washington's character and climax.Antonie Fuqua has showed his ability to extract the best from Washington again. Chloe Grace Mortiz has a significant role but she doesn't get much of the screenspace. Marton Csokas gets to play a Russian guy again. Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo add strength to the star cast.There might be a sequel to this movie as there are certain hints regarding the way Washigton's character is portrayed in the movie. When Denzel Washington gives a cold stare and says ""16 seconds"" in that voice, I am not complaining. Are you?",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Non-stop action,"I am not a fan of violence in movies, especially when done to excess. This movie pushes past my normal limit for body count, but it is done is such a way, i.e., without much gore, that I did not find it gratuitous or off-putting. Additionally, Denzel Washington turns in another stellar performance as a man of violence (e.g., Training Day, among others) that the viewer does not mind the extreme willing suspension of disbelief that the director requires.Mr. Washington's character has very little in the way of backstory although his motivation is readily apparent. I suspect that some explanatory scenes were cut from the final print since the movie runs long at over 2 hours. Also I find it difficult to believe that both Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo, each leading actors in their own right, were cast as old friends of Mr. Washington's character with the original intention that they would have about 3 minutes of combined screen time. It seems that these characters would have been the time when the backstory would have been revealed.While there is nothing really new in this movie that makes it a must-see, it is well-shot, action-packed, and, as stated above, well-acted thereby earning a viewing recommendation.To see more of my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The best comic book movie of the year,"I never saw the television show and I have no doubt that Denzel's Robert McCall character is quite different than the TV show character, but he certainly is the best superhero of the year. And that is simply what he is. Antoine Fuqua uses close ups of Denzel's face as he assesses impossible situations and then comes out unscathed usually leaving behind a pile of baddies. I was reminded of Christian Bale's Batman character in those scenes.Reviews of the film have been tepid so far mostly citing it as being clichéd, and implausible, but looking at this like a superhero film elevates it considerably. The Russian mob characters are the heavily tattooed super villains led by the talented Marton Csokas. The violence is all comic book in its execution with a grand finale that takes place in a Home Depot type store. Let's just say Denzel gets creative with a host of the store's products. In fact, the only violence that did not seem comic book like was when the Csokas first exams photos of the bodies that were left in McCall's wake.And the best news of all is that when the film ends we are left with the feeling that we will be seeing McCall in action again, hopefully soon.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Recommendable.,"This film offers us the umpteenth version of someone who is capable of defeating an army under cover of the most trivial objective: to avenge the fate of a prostitute whose luck disappeared. Knowing that we have seen the idea of the film a thousand times, the key is to try to see the outstanding elements. Fortunately for us, we found a few: a good performance by Denzel Washington and the main villain, very well edited sequences where violence prevails with all its shocking beauty, an attention to detail direction and the good fortune of presenting the villains as absolutely despicable beings. . Although not many innocents die, the bad ones generate rejection and desire for an atrocious death. The film satisfies that primal desire with elegance. Recommendable.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel Washington is the man!,"This is my first review..I really loved Denzel Washington in this movie..I think he did an outstanding job, couldn't think of a better actor than him. The way he plays out the roll of this mysterious man who was in his past life a man who eliminated whatever the people above pointed their fingers at is just incredible...You can actually feel his emotions during the movie as he stares down his enemies..that grim face indicating he has nothing to loose and intends to finish whatever promise he made to himself...So overall a fantastic set of actors and actingAbout the movie... It's a slow-paced action movie...nothing wrong with that.. But what it does unlike other slow paced action movies is the way it tells the story-everything is well connected and flows well...and the scene's are just off this world...people will say for a one man army he killed his enemies with little to no effort...Well i'll tell you this... the bad guys were shown as really scary no mercy intimidating type of killers...their presence demanded respect...on the other hand Robert McCall (Denzel Washington)was shown as equally intimidating man skilled to perfection and it really makes you think hard what kind of things he had to do in his past to overcome this new threat...Overall...

Guts Over Fear,"At 60 years old, Denzel Washington is still one of the best action stars on the planet. Can we get a Denzel vs Liam Neeson film already? Or perhaps even a team up film? I believe they are both in their 60's now so the clock is ticking. The Equalizer is a pure action film. Much like Taken, the story takes a bit of a backseat to the insane action sequences. But when you get a film as entertaining as this one, that's quite alright.Washington plays a retired agent of some sorts, who swears to not go back to his old roots and stay clean. It all changes when he sees Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz), a teenage prostitute, being abused. The premise is very similar to Taken, but I think the payoff for this film isn't as high as Taken. Moretz slips out of the film for the better part of 2 hours. It becomes more of a revenge film without exemplifying the reason behind the revenge well enough. I will say that the action is twice as good, but also over-the-top, as Taken. Robert (Washington) kills people in the most unnecessarily strange ways, but it's awesome. It has all the clichés of a action thriller, but yet it works. It also helps that every explosion Robert walks away from there's a great score to compliment it.The film is pretty long for not having a lot of depth to the story, but it still has a great amount of re-watchability. There aren't many memorable characters or even people you care about, besides Denzel. If they end up making a franchise out of it, I hope they add depth to the characters and bulk up the supporting cast.+Ridiculously fun action+Denzel is still a bada**+Catchy music/score-Seen the story before-No depth to the characters7.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Solid Good Film,"Equalizer was a bit of an unexpected surprise. First, I would never bet against Denzel. I usually enjoy all his films. I was on skeptical since Antonio Fuqua has not really won me over as a director. Unlike the majority of people I did not like ""Training Day."" Therefore I was a bit skeptical of the re-teaming of Denzel with Antonio. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised. This movie was really good. Denzel has been on a role lately with his foray into more action oriented films lately. He plays the character with such understated poise and humility. The hand to hand combat was great. The movie has a message but does not hit you over the head with it. Marton Csokas was stunningly evil. He is the kind of villain like Anthony Hopkins....quiet but lethal. Even when he is not doing anything he just makes your fearful of what he could do. I would love if Denzel finally gets his own franchise since this could easily have a sequel. Overall great movie and worth the price of admission. Perfect casting!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Old Timer Who Masters Time...,"""What I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.""The infamous monologue taken from the movie of the same name set a new milestone in action pictures, reinventing the vigilante figure with the additional ""special sets of kills"" and replacing the 'crusade against violence' by a less high-scaled and more personal-oriented fight, like saving young and vulnerable girls from the claws of male predators and abusing pimps. It's quite a bold move in an era where 'damsels in distresses' and urban violence have stopped to be popular tropes, but I guess this is why it took the talent of versatile and quality actors such as Liam Neeson or Denzel Washington to elevate the film about the level of pure macho-power exaltation.Audiences would accept these men as role models rather than regular action movies stars maybe because they bring a dimension of humanity and fatherly warmth. Not that it lacked in Arnie, Sly or Bruce Willis but I'm talking about 2010s standards where it's not too cool to sound cool anymore. As Robert McCall, Washington doesn't replay Bryan Mills but gives his own depth in a role that could have been rather two-dimensional, that he made it to finance his ""Fences"" or make a departure from his award-baity performances doesn't matter, he's quite the man in a performance that isn't too showy even in the showiest parts. And you've got to credit the patience Antoine Fuqua demonstrates in the exposition.McCall is the bookworm, getting through the Top 100 must-read Books, he works in a home depot shop, gets along with his colleagues, coaches one of them to lose weight to pass a security job test and befriends a young prostitute played by Chloe Grace Moretz. It all builds up to the crucial moment where he makes his 'Mills' offer to Russian hoodlums who showed that women's welfare wasn't their priority. They're all drowning in vodka and cocky arrogance, with every inch of their bodies harboring intimidating skulls and tattoos but naturally, no one takes ""Dedushka"" seriously... so the old-timer has no other choice than teaching them a lesson or two about time efficiency. It takes twenty seconds of a nasty fight to make his point but since he aimed for sixteen, we get the idea that he's slipping. Still, it's the establishing moment we've all waited for.The act isn't without consequences and brought the attention to a Russian Mafia ""Don"" named Vladimir Pushkin (quite the name) who sends his best dragon ""Teddy"" (Marton Csokas) to hunt the killer. This is a standard action picture about a man singlehandedly defeating the almighty Russian mafia and while the film does find ingenuous ways to avoid the obvious comparisons with ""Taken"", it's the charismatic presence of Denzel Washington that makes the difference. And it's not a detail, when you have a title that doesn't say much about the film but sound cool enough to make you curious, you've got to have a ""name"" to press the play button.It seems crazy said like this but choosing the right movie to pick on Netflix is such a patience-demanding ordeal that all it takes is a title and a charismatic actor. Say what you want about Denzel Washington, his movies aren't all on the same caliber than ""Malcolm X"" but he always delivers a memorable performance even in a role that doesn't aim for award and where cinematic excellence consists on dodging caricature and being believable as a skilled fighter. And that's the power a few actors can pretend to have, something that makes Washington equal to Clint Eastwood, his ""presence"" is more vital than his ""words"". But even Eastwood couldn't do without worthy antagonist and Washington's presence is enhanced by a solid villain.And maybe that's the aspect that gives the film a slight edge over ""Taken"", which is that the villain always possesses a special set of skills and doesn't let himself intimidated as well. And so we follow a cat-and-mouse chase where the roles are alternatingly reversed and where the chasers become the chased ones and we don't know if the film is as good as the hero or the villain So the film follows a long storyline where we see a lot of fighting, some remarkably gruesome that reminded me of ""A History of Violence"", but even violence can get routinely and the most memorable parts turn out to be the quieter ones, which all takes us to a dinner conversation and the closest to a great confrontation the film ever got.When McCall confronts ""Teddy"" to his own past in Soviet Union, the writing is brilliant, in fact it's so good that the fact that the film chose the safe way and end with a climactic confrontation set in McCall's job area, his own comfort zone, left me disappointed. It seems that Fuqua wasn't so confident about his material that he thought he had to keep on the track and makes the violence an escalating process... but think of a film like ""First Blood"", once we know that Rambo is a man not to mess with, the film surprises us with the heartbreaking Vietnam monologue, revealing a hidden depth in Rambo's personality, I wish ""Equalizer"" could find a way to take us off-guard.It's a sign of lack of maturity when a film doesn't try to surprise you, even a film like ""Taken"" chose to have a shocking moment where Mills' mission proved not to be a complete success, but in ""Equalizer"" even when McCall's friends and colleagues are taken as hostages, it's hard to believe that none of them was killed just to make a point. So, either the bad guys underestimate McCall to the end, or act dumber than they should or get too soft it's almost off-character. I guess it makes the fiim as good as the hero... after all.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

They didn't know how to respond to that. This movie is about him helping some kids get a better life. I like how only the bad guys curse in his movies and you don't see them very much, but he is setting an example to kids who like his movies cursing makes you look like a bad guy.

Denzel being brilliant - a very good film,"I remember seeing The Equaliser, the TV show, when I was young, staring Edward Woodward. This is the same, but totally different.Denzel plays Robert ""Bob"" McCall, and we see him initially start his days in simplicity, in a mundane job, in a simple home, reading, not sleeping and enjoying quiet solitude and routine. The pace of the film can be described the same way. Quiet solitude and routine. Nothing happens loudly or quickly and you have to pay attention. Denzel is at his charming best. Think Training Day, think Safe House and Magnificent Seven with the charm of the Prince in Much Ado About Nothing.Antoine Fuqua, Director, also working with Denzel on Training Day and Magnificent Seven, is flawless, seamless and deeply committed to a viewing experience that immerses the viewer. Often, more often than not, lighting is low in The Equalizer and little is said or explained. What happens in the dark, is salient but not narrated. This makes for a slow burning piece of great cinema; tension and pressure mount and you feel it. Like John Wick (Keanu Reeves) as ""Baba Yaga"" - the bogeyman - Washington's dealings with Russian mob are equally devastating, accomplished and quiet.Watching the film, you don't know who Robert McCall is, just the guy in the 24hour diner reading through the list of 100 books before you die (incidentally I'm shamefully only on 30), and making tentative friends with Alina or ""Teri,"" brilliantly played by Kick Ass star Chloe Grace Moretz, the young prostitute. You don't know who he is, but that is drip fed to you through the film. Unlike other heroes McCall doesn't do what he does for glory or recognition, he does it for justice and moral right. You don't hear Teri's story either, which is a blessing, but not having backstories and motivations narrated is a clever ploy for you to fill in your own blanks, or keep the pace quiet and slow. Moretz and Washington's friendship is lovely and believable. He is a trustworthy person, and like his unobtrusive violence, righting wrongs, you don't see sexual violence in this film either; the awful things Teri has to endure are not spelled out, which is a relief. Less is more. Martin Csokas, a good actor, but known for his hammy portrayal and terribly overdone Russian accent in XXX, was perfectly cast here. He too played it understated and deadly with the confidence or someone who has never been realistically challenged before, possibly drawing on his experience of playing Celeborn in LOTR ... quiet graceful and deadly! When I say unobtrusive violence, meaning you don't always see it, sometimes you do. This is not a film for under 15s by any stretch of the imagination. There's some very up close uses for common household items put to alternative use in the film. If you are a bit squeamish or sensitive, don't watch. That said, Fugua uses darkness and suggestion well even in these scenes. Everyone in the cast put in performances to be proud of, but Washington of course was the stand out. He truly is a phenomenal performer. Whatever he touches is golden, and I very much like seeing age and experience, and economy of violent movement, showing professionalism and realism over glamour and youth and showy unrealistic fight scenes any day. Especially with Denzel! Marton Csokas, known for his terrible Russian accent and hammy acting in XXX, is infinitely more formidable as a Russian mob fixer, here.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Denzel Washington has been in a lot of Good Movies - this is not one of them,"Denzel Washington has been in a lot of good movies. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. Having appreciated the mid 1980's series upon which this movie is loosely based; and liking Denzel Washington as an actor, I went to this movie feeling that the movie had a better than fair chance of being a good action thriller.The movie starts promisingly as we see Robert McCall's (Denzel's) efforts to positively impact those with whom he works and socializes. Unfortunately, the movie goes downhill from there. While Good guys killing bunches of villains and being unrealistically lucky is standard fare for mindless action films, the initial 20 minutes plus of this film tried so hard to convince us that this was not going to be such a film that the transition to being a mindless action flick is jarring and disappointing.Sadly, once Robert McCall begins his killing spree it truly does become a mindless action film that is largely without suspense or fun. The lack of fun comes from Washington's character who despite very token almost meaningless efforts to give the bad guys a chance to do the right thing, clearly enjoys figuring out all sorts of ways to kill them.Of course only bad guys use guns, but highly trained ex CIA operatives/assassins like Robert McCall eschew guns. So ex CIA operative Robert McCall does the competent professional thing by leaving guns on the ground throughout movie, instead choosing to kill the villains using a wide variety of methods that in real life would have put himself and the people he is supposed to be protecting at far greater risk.As described above, the situations Robert puts himself and the risky way in which he engages the bad guys completely contradicts the idea that he truly is this methodical experienced professional. That he manages to come out ahead could only have been accomplished by script writers with no regard for realism or the viewer's sense of credulity.The situations were so stupid that even I watched the film I found myself angry with the scriptwriters for being so obviously lazy.Frustratingly, Washington's character does not even do a good job protecting the innocent, putting them at risk even after being directly warned they will be put at risk by his actions.In the end this was a poorly made film not because it featured the hero doing ridiculously unrealistic things, but because the movie worked hard at the beginning to tell us this was not going to be mindless action flick, but than went on to deliver a mindless action flick that really was no fun at all.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Insanely good movie,"I have DREAMED of this movie to be created. I have dreamed to see on the big screen a movie as powerful as The Equalizer! It sucked the last air out of my lungs while watching it, and it left me ... hope-full. Hope, that there will always be someone who cares. That there will always be someone who cares enough! Enough, to go out to serve and protect the disadvantaged ones. I do hope the ""tyrants"" around the globe would watch this movie. I cannot imagine something worse, that the mighty one breaking the spirit of those less fortunate. If someone has power, then this power should be used only in service to the others, nothing else. Great acting, great fighting scenes, great directing! It did thrill all my senses, it made me think, it provoked me in many ways. I do not buy movies on DVD, BUT this one will be purchased and played again. I saw it yesterday and I am still buzzing all over :)",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ideal Denzel,"His heart is pure. He's beautiful. He's skilled. I had such a good time and amwait for the next one.I'm a Denzel worshipper and therefore biased, but I enjoyed this so much more than John Wick. The Wick films may be better executed but I was left cold by the Wick character. So much so that I've put off watching the next 3.Denzel is riveting as always. I thought all of the performances were great but he effortlessly carries the whole picture.The only criticism I would have is that the exposition was sometimes a little heavy handed and we didn't need to see his observation technique the same way each time. It would have been enough to see it once and then just let Denzel's face tell us thereafter.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
the quiet exterminator,"Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) should be a super-hero. After all only a super-hero can destroy in 28 seconds the US East Coast command center of the Russian mafia (actually exceeding by 9 seconds his plans), can survive an army of armed and dangerous enemies in a Home Depot, even saving the lives of all his good friends, and then take a flight to Russia to destroy the whole organization's brains in the viper's nest.It is actually the anti-hero vision of the character that gives this story a high dose of credibility. Yes, I am incredulous of having said it :-) Denzel's character building is so rigorous, so precise, so human that he not only builds himself as the positive character we as viewers can sympathize with, but also lightens the whole story, which otherwise would be a brutal encounter between yet another retired agent and the world which would not let him enjoy his quiet reading and lattes at night hours, a world full of violence, of human traffic, of ladies in distress silently shouting for help with nobody to hear but Hollywood super-heroes.Director Antoine Fuqua seems to make amends to me for Olympus Has Fallen which I liked much less for various reasons. I would have liked Chloe Grace Moretz to be more on screen, but her absence for much of the screen time after having been the trigger of the story has logic. The Equalizer is based on a TV series from the 80s which I did not see or maybe I forgot, but there is enough good material in this film - including mystery hints about Robert McCall's past including a tragically lost love - to make me hope that this is another start of a series, on big screen this time.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Overall OK, Nothing GREAT!","Denzel Washington has done pretty good quality movies before. This is definitely not one of those. It is a normal action movie with a weak story line. It has some good scenes, but the justifications for the story were missing. Denzel never failed to deliver 100% in any of the scenes. But that was not enough to make this movie great. Other characters in the movie didn't have much role to play as this was a 'one man show'. The bad guy's introduction was good and his role lost the pace later. Very little effort was made to make the viewers believe why someone would go to such an extent to play GOD. Could have used a little more humor to keep the audience entertained. Denzel's fans can watch it without getting bored, others watch in when the DVD comes :)",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
You have seen this film before 1000 times,"A highly trained, retired field operative resorts to violence as the only way to free a Russian prostitute from brutal Russian men who are part of an international crime organization. The many years of retirement didn't show any sign of rust on Robert McCall (Washington) as he ran through his adversaries, dismantling one after another, without batting an eye. He made it look too easy. These bad Russian men had nothing for him, which is probably the biggest problem with this film. There is nothing interesting about a Good vs Evil film with weak bad guys. The filmmakers did work hard at trying to make Teddy, played by Marton Csokas, look ruthless and deadly. But I was never convinced, and I doubt whether the many who saw this film with me at the Toronto International Film Festival were convinced as well.I found the film rather boring for the most part, with a setup unusually longer than anything Hollywood released in decades. The dialogue was heavy handed. The supporting roles didn't provide nothing more than their vulnerability to the scum of society, which beckoned on a hero like McCall to teach them a lesson or two.And as I stated in my summary, you have already seen this film a thousand times already: the bad guys shooting big, scary guns and rarely grazing the hero, the hero walking away in slow motion from an explosion he caused, bad guys tracking hero down in this sort of cat-and-mouse thing, damsels in distress, high octane martial arts. Wait, the filmmakers did try to make the film unique by excluding a car chase and having McCall kill each and every bad guy in the most unique way every time. A bullet to the cranium wasn't good enough. No. He had to use methods like overflowing bathroom sinks to electrocute someone. He seemed like he was trying to one-up himself every time. The hero doesn't make any mistakes in the process, even taking the time to catch a fly ball to win the company baseball game. The way he swooped in, in slow motion, and snatched that ball from the joker character who thought he had it was roll-your-eyes worthy and completely laughable.However, when the film got going it started to be exactly what I expected; an entertaining, highly stylized, popcorn film. At the same time, being Fuqua's weakest directorial effort since his first film, I cannot recommend it. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel delivers the goods,"Denzel Washington delivers as ex CIA operative Robert McCall who routinely goes about his business in downtown Boston - with a little OCD thrown in for good measure. Robert promised his recently deceased wife that he would move on from his former life and that was all going well until he befriends Teri/Alina (a very underused Chloe Moretz) who is on the receiving end of some harsh treatment from her Russian pimp.Now this is an action movie - it isn't pretending to be anything else - so don't go in expecting some deep and meaningful character development scenarios. This is Denzel handing out justice in his own way, as Robert McCall decides to help Chloe out by taking out the local Russian Mafia (after trying to buy Alina's freedom). This doesn't sit well with the Russians and soon Teddy (Marton Csokas) arrives to try to figure out what went wrong.From this point in your belief needs to be subdued a bit as Robert appears to always be one step ahead of Teddy and his band of local goons - including the clichéd 'dirty cops'. Even though the movie has a number of action checkpoints we the viewer need to pass (show me an action movie that doesn't) I found myself buckled in for the ride.What I think could hurt this movie is the fact that Denzel is teaming up with 'Training Day' director Antoine Fuqua - and we all know that was a successful partnership back in 2001. My advice - be prepared to suspend a little bit of belief and just sit back and enjoy the ride and who knows maybe Robert might be back to help someone else.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Antoine Fuqua and Denzel are a powerhouse,"This movie is brilliant! The only reason I don't give it a 10 is because that is reserved for The Godfather and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. However in the action genre, this is absolutely one of the best! The cinematography is fantastic; the lighting, camera angles and film noir scenes give it a gritty realistic look. The casting for the villains are terrific. They are guys you really hate, unredeemable men, yet Denzel's character still gives them the chance to do the right thing. Denzel is a brilliant actor. His look says it all, without any dialogue. I loved this movie and was on the edge of my seat until the very end. Should have one an Academy Award for best picture!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
6.5/10,"Forget originality, forget emotional depth, forget interesting storytelling and you will have the same fun I had in the theater with ""The Equalizer"". It's pretty obvious that I wasn't going in expecting an Oscar contender, I just wanted to see Denzel be badass. Even though the film doesn't really succeed one hundred percent as a good action flick it still has many enjoyable aspects.Firstly, foremost and obviously: Denzel. There's really nothing that I can say that has yet to be said on him, he is just awesome, charismatic and badass. He has the ability of gluing you to the screen and without him the movie wouldn't exist. The other highlight in the cast is definitely Marton Csokas. Again nor Robert McCall nor Teddy have any actual depth as hero or villain, but the actors playing them really do a great job and contribute hugely to the fun factor of the movie. There is lots of unexpected violence that firstly caught me by surprise, but as the film went on it made it all the more exaggerated and enjoyable. Finally the action scenes are all very well staged, even though they don't do anything new they have a great vibe. Most of all the final climactic scene was actually pretty suspenseful and carried on for just the right time.On whole ""The Equalizer"" was all of the above, but it really fell flat in doing anything to make it a superior action movie. It is filled with clichés, a couple of useless characters and should have been cut by at least ten minutes. Moreover the visual style of the movie offers some good, well staged action scenes, but for the rest doesn't feel shot that well. There were sometimes where I blinked at the screen because of poor lighting. The closure of the movie is totally silly and cheesy. Finally Denzel's character is never, ever in danger and as much as it was fun looking at him being a badass it didn't add up to a cool hero: the stakes were never there.The film is just another action movie with very few brains, seeing it in the theater is worth the experience, but I don't think I will ever watch this again.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Absolutely Amazing,Every minute of this action packed movie is amazing. This is the single best movie I have ever seen. All of the actors do great jobs at their roles from the villains to the side characters they all give convincing performances. Denzel Washington proved that he is the best actor of all time with his great performance in this masterpiece. The plot makes sense and is not contrived at all. There are no loose strings or plot holes making this movie very well thought out. The music in this movie is some of the best i have ever heard. I will definitely be purchasing the soundtrack if one is ever made for this movie. The movie does a great job of making all of the characters seem important to the audience and has Denzel feel like the greatest vigilante of all time. You must see this movie as soon as possible.

The Second John Wick...,"The Equalizer is an american action movie, with Denzel Washington in the main role, as Robert McCall, a normal man with a background of a secret agent, with a purpose to fight for freedom and justice. I have to admit that this was a very enjoyable film, could fix some small details that I think was important, and now I'm going to tell you what was good, and what was bad. The build-up of the movie was amazing, with great suspense, and they explained everything and keeped the story in a way that made sense. So I liked the story, and the actors were pretty good, especially Denzel Washington as Robert McCall, the main role, and I think the main antagonist, Nicolai Itchenko (Teddy) was very good, and very evil, a villian that was not important in the beginning, but become more important later, that I liked. The things they could change was that they could make more things less predicatble, and to explain more of the things that wasn't explained. They could also have more fighting scenes, and less scenes that was only about violence. Beside that things I think this movie was absolutely fantastic! I recommend this movie for fans of for example John Wick and James Bond, where the genre is pretty similar to each other. It was better than John Wick, and a movie I think you should watch anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

After some time and an involuntary hospital visit of Alina caused by her employer, Bobby decides to intervene and pay this man a visit.Watching the Equalizer is like a 90 minute déjà vu (no pun intended). There is not much originality in the story or execution of it. This does not mean that it is not entertaining though. Denzel Washington is capable and charismatic enough to capture and hold the attention for the most part of the movie. The action sequences are well choreographed and executed.

The greatest action film in a very long time,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningRobert McCall (Denzel Washington) was an ex CIA operative with a lethal set of skills, who quietly left the agency and settled in to a quiet life working for a Home Department store. But when he strikes up a friendship with Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz), a young girl aspiring to be a musician, but entrapped to some vicious gangsters, he finds himself forced to employ the skills from his past life once again, setting him on a collision course with Teddy (Marton Csokas), the gangster's brutally efficient enforcer.Adapting an old TV show from the '60s seems to be the norm these days, which on the surface doesn't offer much in the way of surprise or even excitement in The Equalizer's way. But left in the right hands for a change, everything's come off a treat, and the result is a solid, effective action adventure, that evokes great memories from the good old days when action was at it's height.Over ten years after Training Day, Denzel and director Antoine Fuqua have re-united and re-created that hard-hitting, superb magic once again, only this time with Washington in the hero role. And how finely he fits it, too, perfectly fitting the character and suiting his physical requirements down to a tee. He is matched by Csokas as the bad guy, the best in a long while, eerily menacing, methodical and suddenly shocking with his unassuming moments of enraged violence. Unlike many modern directors, Fuqua is not brash, and allows his story to take it's time and progress at it's own pace, with a proper beginning, middle and end, stretching at over two hours, but never weary or dull, and culminating with one of the best action sequences in a long while, with a Home Department store being turned in to a battleground, with a selection of DIY equipment not really being used for their intended purpose.The names involved should have got my senses buzzing more than they already did, but thankfully I was not disappointed. This is just the best action film in years, brutally violent, intelligently written, well directed and polished with a slick veneer. It's good that it's taken so long to getting round to writing the review, as it's given me more time to rave about it as much as I should, and give it the justice it deserves. *****",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

He plays the part of ex-CIA Special Operator with realism to the point where he is a Poster Boy to link up with the members of Seal Team 6 to fight ISIS.

Typical action movie but with good acting,Robin hood ex black ops Denzel Washington goes on a killing spree of Russian gang members. The plot is as simple as that really. :)I have always been a fan of thrillers and this movie is a recommended watch if you're a fan of them. Denzel's acting is fine. The direction of the action scenes is top notch. I liked the enriching camera zooms with slow motion play on the little details in several scenes. There were parts where I thought that the story is too straight forward with little left for the imagination. I just wish it had more plot twists because the end was pretty predictable.

"Graphic Kills, Story Lacks Thrills or Surprises","When you have a Denzel Washington movie you can be sure that fans are going to flock into the theaters to see the legend himself. Today I went back into the trenches of the local theater to watch Mr. Washington's latest adventure entitled the Equalizer. This film based on a television series from the past, has promised some dark justice being served in the streets of New York City with the hint of action that many movie goers have come to expect. Yet is this just another knockoff Taken, or is there actually something that helps this movie stick out?For those who haven't seen the trailers, The Equalizer's plot is about Robert McCall, a retired special forces agent, who chooses a simpler life of working and reading after some major life event. Of course, the dark world that he dove into seldom leaves it's denizens alone, and McCall finds himself back into the bowels of darkness to correct the problems at hand. And just like the trailers promise, this movie is indeed dark in nature. After a rather drawn out introduction into the world, the first mission, as seen in the trailer, rips off the training wheels and throws you into throngs of violence. Using the power of quick observation, a knock off of Sherlock Holmes, Washington brings his skills of improvised weapons use on to the screen. While this is clever, and quite awesome, the downside is the amount of gore that follows his moves, and the areas to which those devices are inserted. Should you go see this film, there is hardly any censorship in this film, but instead an eyeful of sharp objects being slowly jammed into the unfortunate victims. What makes it even worse, is the sounds the victims make, especially during the prolonged moments where the victim seems to be savoring the kill. Some of course will like this, but for this reviewer there is a limit to how much hostility one can take in a movie. Unfortunately this scene is not isolated, as the carnage and suffering only get more intense with each body added to the count.Intense suffering aside, the next component that you might be wondering about is the action that is promised in the film. So what about it? Well it depends on what you define as action. If you are thinking of action like Taken, where our ""hero"" moves through the setting with superhuman reflexes, firing bullets with one hit kill accuracy that many gamers would kill for, then you will be disappointed. Instead this action is a bit more conserved, focusing more on using his mind then tearing up the bad guys with force. Sure McCall has some moves that you want to see, especially close up, martial arts moves to disable the weapon from their hands. Yet the fight scenes often involve slamming someone's face viciously into an object, and are over in a matter of seconds from the beginning. Such brief spurts of action, were fine, but for an action movie I had expected a little more excitement and a little less torture. At the end, the battle was a little more to my expectations, though still filled with gruesome kills, some of which, I have to admit, were pretty sweet to see, sort of like Home Alone meets the Punisher. No matter what the scene is though, Denzel Washington brings the edge that you expected to see, so much that a few in the audience yelled, ""He is such a bad"" well I won't finish that quote.What else is there to say about this movie? You can pretty much guess that it is all about Denzel, with just about every scene having the legend in it. Luckily his acting is still top notch, and brings a lot to the movie in just his character. As for the story, well it's alright in some places, but for the most part it's rather plain. The main plot itself has very little sustenance, with what seemed to be a slight attempt to interlock the cases with a big mafia group. It failed for me though, and the mafia group became nothing more, than more bodies for Denzel to pile up. Denzel's character has little story development, the fragments we get hastily explained and sometimes ill-timed that it loses any value. Perhaps the only thing that really develops his character, is his ""fight"" to fall back into the soulless monster he was prior to the movie as he doles out justice. Yes, one will feel a mixture of emotions at the bad guys getting their just desserts, but aside from that there isn't much emotional stimulation behind this film. As for the dialog and humor, they are not strong enough to make up for the story. References to classic literature being integrated into the morals was a plus for me, a nice twist to the typical, overdramatic scenes we often get. Yet these heart filled moments are offset by yet another curse laden dialogue that seems to become the common trend. Guess they will never learn huh?Overall The Equalizer is an okay film, but failed for me on on a lot of levels. Fans who will enjoy this the most are those who think Denzel can do no wrong, and those who just want dark, twisted kills. The legendary actor still impresses me with his commitment, but for this reviewer, Mr. Washington cannot carry this movie for an entire two hours. My scores for this film are:Action/Crime/Thriller: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Totally Denzel!!!,"I was never a big fan of the original TV series with Edward Woodward (RIP), but Denzel Washington in lead here brings a totally new and added dimension.With enhanced skills and a huge element of mystery, the new Robert McCall is just what this piece needed to give it a formidable ""reboot"". This movie will either lead to more sequels, and/or updated TV series.If you're looking for great action with a rich flavoring of character interest, this movie is for you. However there is an element of this character that somewhat reminds me of Denzel's John Creasy in ""Man On Fire"" (lots of body bags needed here).This was one of the very few films that I can say that I enjoyed every minute of. What I also really liked was the fact that McCall was involved in helping several people in this film in addition to Chloe Moretz's character.Denzel was in stellar form, and I hope he can continue with this franchise should it remain on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Same Denzel: how many times do we have to see him squint his eyes and look with serious hatred, then suck on his bottom lip. It was great in Glory, but come on man, learn some new facial and vocal expressions already. He is the same in every movie.

Washington challenges Liam Neeson's senior action flick,"A recent cinema-going of Denzel Washington's latest thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua, the man behind his Oscar-crowning good-cop-goes-bad turn in TRAINING DAY (2001, 8/10). But that is only a one-off bait for his Oscar consummation. As one of the most consistently bankable actor in Hollywood (at least in the domestic market), Washington's good-man card never fail his audience, bar his sortie in portraying an ambiguous character as a drunken pilot garners him another Oscar-nomination in Robert Zemeckis' FLIGHT (2012, 7/10). So this reunion is more or less commercial-oriented than an ambitious art-house attempt as Fuqua has established his status as the Hollywood go-to action journeyman after producing profitable outputs like SHOOTER (2007) and OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN (2013).The plot is a derivative individual heroism boosting fare, Washington is Robert McCall, a former government agent, now lives alone in Boston as an ordinary employee in the Home Mart hardware store. His quiet life is disrupted when he bonds with a young hooker Teri (Moretz), who is in the throes of a brutal Russian gangsters, after Teri being violently beaten by her pimp Slavi (Meunier), Robert decides to save her from the business, but instead, he swiftly kills him and his minions. Subsequently he determines to single-handedly takes on the entire gang, lead by the merciless enforcer Teddy (Csokas), as well as the big boss Pushin (Kulich) in Moscow.It sounds Liam Neeson has some serious competition in the sub-genre of twilight badass actioner, but unlike Neeson's family man Bryan Mills in TAKEN franchise, Robert has no such liability, he is purely a righteous vigilante, a Black version of the Punisher, lynches low-life scumbags where legal law force fails to execute, indeed near the end, he even accepts request from Craiglist (a sequel is already being announced). Although it is impossible to swallow the concept of the protagonist can spectrally annihilate a whole mob by himself (with a little help from his amiable Hispanic friend) without sensing the off-putting whiff of propagandizing Hollywood's individualism, Fuqua manages to glaze the film with a Neo-noir patina in a steady pace to accentuate his aesthetic demanding and stylish cinematography; in lieu of resorting to ostentatious action stunts (surprisingly comforting there is no car-chasing sequences at all), Fuqua actually is patient enough to allow Robert's situation and his struggle being cogently formulated before he turns into an invincible executioner of justice and starts his fulfilling mission of killing.It is an entertaining movie, sometimes too violent for common taste, but sharply hits the bulls- eye for its target audience. Its ultimate depot confrontation calls to mind a darker and more lethal upgrade of HOME ALONE gimmick, and the face-off between Robert and Teddy is unexpectedly anti-climatic. Washington is so comfy in his wheelhouse and can feasibly pull off the platonic friendship between him and Moretz without any May-December suggestion. The perpetually Russell Crowe dead ringer Marton Csokas finally gets a bigger part as the gentleman-looking but beast-inside killer, it is the best offer Hollywood can ever offer to him, it is also a timely wake-up call to reconsider his career options, maybe a romantic comedy for a change.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Comic Book Action Well Done,"Denzel Washington nails the character, at least the character that was written in the screenplay, which is not the Equalizer from the TV series. He is more of a superhero in the movie franchise and you have no doubts that he will outlive all who oppose him. The suspense comes in to play, more with his friends and acquaintances and the viewer is led to worry about their survival, while expecting Denzel's character to kick a_s without fail. The cinematography is dark and the editing is tight, with little doubt as to what is going to happen, just uncertainty as to how it will happen. The Equalizer can use anything at hand as a deadly weapon. This is entertaining and if there is a sequel, it will make money. The depiction of the protagonist as a reluctant hero is ludicrous, considering his lame retirement job and the pleasure, almost joy, that he gets out of killing. Not for intellectuals but good entertainment for action fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
You will be equalized!,"Greetings all, I happened upon this film having seen very little advertising save for the odd television teaser, from which I discerned a Taken-esque format. And to my pleasure this delivers very much like the first Taken did. I could draw more comparisons with the wonderfully brutal fight scenes but we all know this formula by now.My main praise must go to Denzel Washington who charismatically plays the introverted, unsuspecting lead. He brings a weight and dignity to the role that may have been lost had some one else filled this position.The action is very convincing, with deafeningly loud gunshots and uncompromising hand-to-hand choreography that really leaves you in awe. Although there is a purpose for his actions, I did find it hard to justify some of his killings, especially since he appears remorseful over past wrongdoings.As supporting casts go this was not star studded, and nor did it need to be, with nameless henchmen receiving their fair share of fisticuffs left, right and center. I must give a hand to Martin Csokas, who adopts the lead psychopathic villain with such grace, and a reasonable Russian accent.For me the downside of this film was Chloe Grace-Moretz. Perhaps it was because of the lighter films in which I'd seen her feature, but I found her a hard pill to swallow as a Russian-speaking prostitute. In fact it left me a little uneasy at the sight of it.As a sucker for a soundtrack I was very aware of the particularly entertaining, gritty musical pieces that featured within. They grew in decibel as the drama did and the main theme left me wanting more. It was somewhat reminiscent (in places) of Electro's suite in The Amazing Spider-man 2. Highly recommended.Overall I would very much recommend this film, most definitely if you are a fan the first Taken, which this will undoubtedly be compared to. But more so for it's ability to be a decent standalone action thriller, if not ever so slightly predictable.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Righteous Vengeance!,"The Equalizer is a loose remake of a TV show from the 1980's that starred the late Edward Woodward. It ran for 88 episodes and the lead played Robert McCall, an ex-special forces agent, turned private detective who assisted those in peril. Following the success of films such as Taken, The Expendables amongst others, Hollywood has discovered a market for the ageing action hero and therefore it was only a matter of time before a big screen adaption of The Equalizer was greenlit. The result is a satisfying and often brutal revenge action thriller.Denzel Washington likewise plays kind hearted widower Robert McCall, known as either Bob or Mr McCall to his colleagues who, by day works in a Home Depot type outlet and by night lives a quiet life reading books whilst sipping tea at a local diner into the early hours of the morning. He befriends a young prostitute Teri (Chloe Grace-Moretz), who also regularly frequents the diner, and witnesses her Russian pimp strike her after she arrives late to a client. Soon after she is hospitalised and McCall's conscience tells him that he must take the matter into his own hands. After swiftly taking out the pimp and his four colleagues in 28 brutal but gloriously choreographed seconds, McCall is advised that he has taken down the east hub of the Russian Mafia.When word reaches Mob boss Pushkin of McCall's vigilantism, he sends highly trained 'Teddy' (played excellently by Kiwi actor Marton Csokas) to find and kill McCall and with half of the Boston police department on the payroll, it's just a matter of time before McCall is found. But, of course, McCall possesses a particular set of skills and the past that he has tried so hard to leave behind has trained him for such an occasion.Although the plot is nothing new, the tension builds well and the action is handled superbly by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Olympus Has Fallen). There is a number of loud and full on action set pieces but also several quieter scenes which are as equally as gripping. Denzel Washington is as cool as ice and as good as ever and is easily one of the most consistent and reliable actors working in Hollywood – can you believe he is almost 60? Age is definitely not a barrier here.The Equalizer is one of more surprising films of 2014. The gritty tone and occasional splattering of blood set this apart from most of the ""toned down"" action films from the last few years. Whilst it's not perfect, it has everything a modern action film fan could ask for and if you like your movies with a bit of righteous vengeance then look no further.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Love of Battle Was Not Neglected,"This picture looks like it is a well-made over the top revenge film, but it is more in the line of a setting things right for the other characters type of story. It looks like this film was based on the TV show of the same name that was released in the '80s. According to IMDb the TV creator got a movie credit. The action and violence in this picture is highly realistic and often brutal. Robert McCall is not the type of guy to go in locked and loaded and blaze away. He is more like to pick up weapons off his targets and make do with what they have lying around like corkscrews or even a shot glass. He is pretty much deadly with anything. I was reminded of Man on Fire (2004) when I was watching this, another Denzel film with a pretty and young, white girl in trouble with the same determination from the protagonist. Still I recommend ""The Equalizer"". The story continually builds upon itself slowly revealing the larger scope of our hero's world and the director was very mindful of his spaces and was careful where objects were placed and shown. I was pleasantly surprised to keep finding things slide into place in front of the camera. But the love of battle was not neglected. The fight scenes used elaborate setups in editing where extreme close ups of the protagonist's eye would show a reflection of the room, mixed in with half a dozen of cutaway shots this was graphically brilliant in its imagination and ever so off-putting in its gory nature.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Equalizer,"I've got to say, I want to see more of Robert McCall, the main protagonist of Equalizer. This guy is a realistic badass, using his skill and perfect timing to even the odds in a one-man-war against the Russian mob, who have taken over his city.At first, I didn't buy this movie (figuratively speaking). First maybe 30 minutes were a snore, but once it got into it's odd groove, the movie is pretty cool. Some little bugs, like an overuse of slow-motion (in an attempt to make it ""cooler"") and some other stuff, but the overall product isn't bad.The musical score is awesome. The only time I remember a better one is in Transformers (you can hate on the movie series, but the musical score is one of the best I've heard). The acting from Washington is believable.The overall believability in this movie help it gain it's own footing in the individuality.One of the things I wished they focused more on is his past. It's so murky, that it leaves you scratching your head.The movie is gritty, dark, and again, realistic.The preview was promising, the style was cool, but in the end, most of the movie until the end is boring.

Denzel Washington knows what he is doing,"I saw "" The Equalizer "" starring the immensely smart Denzel Washington as the protagonist. He plays this shrewd man called Robert McGall who stays away from what he does best until a day arrives when he comes across a situation which forces him to expose his ""other"" side. And then all hell breaks loose. And thereafter, the movie's entertainment quotient increases by leaps and bounds.Denzel Washington exudes this chic persona in almost every movie starring him. He does the same for this movie and the result is for you to see. And the bad guys are just as awesome. The man who plays their head seems to be the perfect fit for a heartless villain, ready to pounce on his adversary at the first given opportunity.Antoine Fuqua is a lovely director. He had directed Denzel in the super-awesome "" Training Day "" and their second collaboration has done wonders again. The city of Boston has been shown in all its grandeur.

Denzel Washington is back...,"""The Equalizer"" is an Action - Crime movie in which we watch a man believing that he changed and left his past behind him. All of these change when he meets a young girl who is under the control of Russian gangsters and he decides to help her.I liked this movie because it reminded me a combination between the ""American Gangster"" movie and ""Training Day"" which in my opinion is two of the best movies of Denzel Washington. The plot of this movie is very good with a lot of mystery behind the main character which is something that makes him as the time passes more and more interesting. The interpretation of Denzel Washington is for one more time magnificent. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is Chloë Grace Moretz's who played as Teri the young girl who is under the control of the Russians.Finally I have to say that ""The Equalizer"" is a very good movie and I strongly recommend it to everyone to watch. In addition to this if you are a fan of Denzel Washington's then this movie is a must for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
All action and no substance; that's OK sometimes though.,"'THE EQUALIZER': Four Stars (Out of Five)Denzel Washington and director Antoine Fuqua team up again, for the first time since 'TRAINING DAY' (13 years ago), for this feature film adaptation of the popular 80s TV series (of the same name). Washington plays a former government agent, named Robert McCall (the role was originated by Edward Woodward), who comes out of retirement to help those in need of his special skills; in this film it's a young prostitute, who's been beaten by the Russian mobsters she works for. It costars Chloe Grace Moretz, Marton Csokas, David Harbour, Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo. It was written by Richard Wenk and based on the TV series created by Michael Sloan and Richard Lindheim. If you like 80s exploitation action flicks you'll love this movie!Robert McCall (Washington) was a very lethal, and expertly skilled, black ops operative; who worked for an unnamed government agency. He's now retired and trying to live a peaceful life, while working at a hardware store, in Boston Massachusetts. When a young call girl he knows, named Teri (Moretz), gets into trouble with the Russian gangsters she works for, McCall feels compelled to come out of retirement and help her. He becomes a one-man killing machine once again!The film is a lot more violent than I was anticipating. It's gratuitously violent; like the beloved 80s action flicks that used to glamorize excessive blood and gore (there's many scenes of Denzel using various tools, from his store, to brutally murder bad guys). If you don't have a problem with that, and enjoy movies full of it, you'll love this movie. I enjoyed it quite a bit but I used to like this type of movie, a lot. Denzel is great in the film and Fuqua does some awesome stylized directing; but it is all action and no substance.

You will become a fan of Denzel Washington after watching The Equalizer,"+ Denzel Washington : Amazing - Editing could have been better Denzel Washington has created a strong reputation of himself as a hard- hitting performer with powerful dialogues coupled with stylish-action stunts. The Equalizer might be similar to what you have seen before on the silver screen but it the strong charisma of Denzel which makes the film simply superb.Robert is an ex-army man leading a simple and quiet life until one evening his life changes when tries to do the right thing by saving an unknown person's life.Based on TV series,The Equalizer is a simple story told with fascinating execution and commendable action scenes, and that is the beauty of this film which was little over-stretched in the climax but was saved by astounding Denzel Washington. Antonie Fuqua ( Training Day ) did pretty well in shaping the movie to be a blunt and taut revenge action-packed thriller. The movie takes sometime to build on you but when it does , there is no turning back. Each scene is beautifully depicted with rocking background score and applauding dialogues. Icing on the cake is the well-choreographed action scenes which has been executed brilliantly with graphic bloodshed looking like a PC game. Script is tight and will keep you engaged. The flip-side is unnecessary inclusion of climax scenes which could be easily be edited. Art direction and cinematography is superb. I loved Denzel Washington's punchline as he turns from a common man into a super-human rescuing the girl from the hands of evil. Do not the miss 16-seconds action scenes between him and the thugs. ChloÃ« Grace Moretz does well in the supporting role.You will become a fan of Denzel Washington after watching The Equalizer. Good 3/5",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

It wasn't a fast-paced continuous action film like John Wick nor it had much action sequences.It's rather slow-paced, with movie continuosly losing and regaining its grip unlike John Wick. I was more impressed by the character of Denzel Washington.It's not a revenge drama or a detective film its a movie about a man fighting for justice and beyond himself.

inferior to the TV series,"Denzil Washington is a good actor but he has made a poor decision by agreeing to star in this movie.

It is nothing more than a generic shoot em up.The pacing of the movie is poor, and it is a considerable time before anything happens.There are a number of action scenes in the latter half of the film, but they are shot in a typical modern Hollywood style, which removes the excitement by distancing the audience because of bad camera-work and editing. The script is unimaginative and the modern Equalizer has nothing that you haven't seen before in countless other films.The violence is more gruesome than it needs to be.If you want to watch he best of Robert Mccall then watch the 1980s TV series.

Black Rambo,"Watching the end scene I thought how a man of color became a black Rambo and Denzel is just that in this movie. No hesitation accepting he had the skills much like the white Rambo in Taken. Men like Rambo movie no matter how they are the same picture painted with different colors. So what? This is a movie and nothing more. You have to suspend thought because it meets a visceral need to have power and control. It is as old as the day...to see justice in this lifetime.This movie like many others portray evil and the wicked heart of man, and in this sense, the movie was factual and accurate. This evil really happens. There is gospel in here if you look closely. Justice must be forthcoming or life is absurd. No, worse, life also then is evil if evil wins.In the end, it is instant gratification, and for men, these movies are essential because The Equalizer gets justice done so we don't have to in our own world. That's the gut or reptilian effect.On a pure acting note, another example of how character actors are the best and the dude you might meet at Home Depot or Lowes shopping probably has more acting chops that most A-list personalities.

A waste of screen talent....,"Expecting a literate interpretation of the oh-so famous (iconic?) Edward Woodward ""Equalizer"" this was a total disgrace to that theme and title. Woodwards Equalizer was understated, intelligent, well acted, complex in character and storyline and thus engrossing and entertaining. This thin poorly written 'shot-em up' show case for Denzel is a pointless showcase for his depth or even his screen charisma. (Surely he didn't read this before he signed in??) The story is so flawed it reeks of 'somebody didn't attend the read thru' of this screen play...without spoiling.... just watch for the huge disconnects in time-line AND locations once the so called 'action' begins.(And THAT to take forever given the vapidness of this over-used dialogue). The music simply drowns this film in some supposed 'dark power vibe' that never matches the scene or the transitions particularly. The 'drone' even over rides some key Denzel dialogue (and our new theater is DHL certified so was not the sound system). It didn't 'fit'... didn't add and certainly was annoying at best. Denzel has a few charming moments.... but as a menace??/ never.... neither the scenes nor dialogue supported that.

The Equalizer,"""McCall"" (Denzel Washington) has taken refuge from his chequered history by laying low working in a DIY store, minding his own business. That peaceful existence is compromised, though, when his colleague ""Teri"" (Chloë Grace Moretz) ends up in an altercation with a mysterious thug that puts her in hospital. Seeking to avenge this, his meticulous retribution soon attracts the attentions of the equally calculating ""Teddy"" (Martin Csokas) who seems to have an army at his disposal for ""McCall"" to find various ways to slaughter whilst both play a perilous cat and mouse game. Now there's really precious little jeopardy here. We know how it's going to end up, but along the way Washington and Csokas create quite an effective degree of menace aided by loads of dimly lit photography and fairly end-to-end brutality. We, of course, discover a little more of why our ninja has become a recluse - but that's provided more for reference rather than to subsume us in a mire of sentiment and there's actually very little here to distract us from an out and out revenge thriller that delivers well.

He's coming out of retirement,"Fast paced action, sweet close-up slow motion shots, and a terrific story make The Equalizer starring Denzel Washington a must see for any action or drama movie lover. Unlike some action movies that tend to lean on long intense gun fights or action sequences to make up for a lack in story, The Equalizer has an amazing story to accompany the awesome action sequences viewers will undoubtedly take away from this movie. Another thing this film does well in is taking its time to explain the plot and each character. It doesn't skimp on any part of the story, especially the characters. The Equalizer explains in detail each main character and some of the sub-main characters and how they fit into the movie. By the end of the movie, if you pay attention, you can pick out each character and tell what their role is in the movie, even if the names are a little hard to pronounce. The story flows throughout the whole movie and never leaves you bored and looking for the exit of the theater. It will make you feel connected to the characters, even some of the minor ones. The Equalizer is great at keeping you on the edge of your seat. Camera work is a big part of why I gave this movie a 9/10. The camera will get close-up during certain scenes and gives a perfect sense of symbolism. It makes great use of ""power shots"" when the camera is facing upwards at a character giving the sense of superior power. It also makes amazing use of dramatic shots, especially with Washington's character. You will see my favorite shot in the entire movie near the end (Don't worry, no spoilers) When it zooms close-up on Washington's face and slows down the role to show the water falling on and off of his face and head. That shot gave me chills. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie is that you never really find out what Washington's character did before this movie took place. You find out what kind of connections he has but nothing more. But at the same time, I did like that sense of mystery around his character. It worked perfectly for the movie. The Equalizer is a must see even if you don't particularly like action movies. There is a terrific enough story to keep anyone interested in this movie. Denzel Washington never seems to disappoint. Definitely earns 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

It's good to fantasize about being able to cheat the odds,"The run up is a little slow but does invest the film with a little more soul than it would have had without it and it also gives Chloe Grace Moretz an opportunity to show her stuff.The thing about action movies like this is that they have to seem just plausible enough or the whole thing crashes down. That requirement is fulfilled here and you are able to enjoy a ride you don't see much anymore, the hyper-talented agent willing to get back in action. Denzel is up to the task and so is Chloe, but for me at least the most surprising delight was that of the bad guy played by Marton Csokas. The guy plays a Russian fixer who is called in to restore the criminal status quo. And in a few beautifully acted scenes, you're convinced he's going to succeed.A good time at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""You are what you are in this world""","If that line from the movie were true, Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua are the embodiment of it in ""The Equalizer"".Those familiar with Antoine Fuqua's filmography know that he likes it gritty, dark and violent, but also that his films are very much character-driven. That's what separates this film from your average action, revenge-type movie.Denzel Washington is Robert McCall, a man with a mysterious past who strikes an unlikely relationship with a young prostitute (Chloe Grace-Moretz). This relationship and what comes of it will make his past come clashing with his desire to leave it behind.Washington plays a broken man at odds with his choices, and it's no surprise how well he can play it. After all, he's done it before. But make no mistake, this is not ""Man on Fire""...This film is much slower and takes its time exploring both the character and his choices, which as the film progresses seem logical and consistent with what you've seen. It doesn't have Tony Scott's flare and visual tricks, but it's much smoother, less distracting, slicker and atmospheric.The action scenes are mostly well done, and Marton Czokas plays a worthy adversary to Denzel's McCall. Yes, some of the dialog is a tad cliché and some lines seem out of place, but it won't pull you out of the movie: this is not a movie about great dialog and it certainly won't win an Oscar for best screenplay; its strengths lie in the exploration of the character, his motivations and inner conflicts, as well as in the creation of a great visual atmosphere totally ad-hoc with the story. In the end, that's really what the film is about: a man, his past, which is never entirely revealed but does help to understand him, and how it will affect his future decisions (I did say mostly well done because for most of the film the actions scenes were actually plausible and added realism to the film, whereas the final showdown does go over the top...It's fun, mind you...but highly unrealistic. When you see it you'll know why)One additional aspect I'd like to highlight is the soundtrack, which contains songs by Eminem and Zach Hensey, among others, and really adds to the general dark atmosphere of the film. Sometimes songs in films are badly chosen and kill the mood...It's the complete opposite here, they enhance it and help heighten emotions.I'm not a huge fan of Fuqua's previous films, but I did enjoy Training Day, The Replacement Killers and Shooter for what they were. This movie is a step up in pace, story and visuals, while keeping some of his trademarks. If you like dark, well-paced gritty thrillers, or Denzel walking around with a broken gaze and nothing to lose, this film is definitely for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
unimpressive,"This movie is a somewhat overly clichéd attempt to return Denzel Washington to his previous state of ""badassery"". It's filled with relatively weak symbolism, mediocre dialogue, although Denzel does have a few pretty badass lines. The action is really just okay, half of the killing happens off-screen and the rest is just not very entertaining, the best fight scene is probably the first one. A load of slow-mo scenes that just don't cut it nowadays. If you've heard the lonely island song ""Cool Guys Don't Look at Explosions"" this is the where that idea came from. Even the villain is weak,they even say he's an intelligent person, but the entire movie is Denzel's character, Robert, outsmarting him. Sure there are a few close calls(which let's face it, you can guess the outcome), but none of them were due to a clever ruse concocted by the enemy. There is little semblance of ""intelligence"" in this movie.There's nothing really special about The Equalizer, it's not complex, there's really no plot to be foiled, and overall it's just not really that entertaining. If you're looking for a much more badass,no-brainer modern action flick I'd suggest John Wick, even though they have a somewhat similar storyline.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Entirely too predictable..,"The only thing that was not predictable was somehow you sensed some twist is coming, but it never does. A regular superhero movie without being called it that. The protagonist, our beloved Mr. Washington, never sets a foot wrong. Never ever gets beaten and is always two steps ahead of the bad guys. The action sequences are well done and I quite enjoyed them. The humane story arcs of helping someone at your mundane jobs, (playing batman at night), and telling that he had a dark and painful past was too forced (he takes a break from all the action, travels to some important person's house for a few days, just to explain that there is a past!!!! 20 minutes just for that! Out of nowhere!). There is absolutely no reason for anyone to spoil the movie.. It spoils itself.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Denzel is great, as always!","Now is the time for us to get a chance of judging a notable actor's performance in a brand new production, which will became at lea, t as classic as the actor in the leading role after a few years, and its name will definitely not sink into oblivion.Although, I haven't got any little thoughts about the plot, and I haven't seen the trailer either, I'd been feeling myself really excited about movie, because Denzel Washington as one of my favorite actors, who hasn't made any disappointing movie so far in his carrier. And this was the same in the case of The Equalizer. The acting performance is simply phenomenal! Denzel is visualizing the usual figure who probably has been an outstanding but now already retired spec ops agent, what we cannot be bored of. The Oscar-winning actor brings life a character of the same style on the canvas almost every time, but somehow he's still able to show the audience something new. If it's needed, than ha could be funny and humorous, he could be sympathetic and patient, but he could also be very tough and serious if the situation required that. This is the character which is well- known by the wide audience, but sometime he could always produce some new attributes and different nature.The other actors also performed a flawless job. This is Chloe Grace Morez's first performance when she appeared on the big screen like character seemed to be really natural to me, so that I couldn't have noticed the slightest spark of acting. But I mean this in the good sense. The character's really come to life on the screen.The storyline is simply brilliant! The very beginning felt a bit sluggish, during the first 10-15 minutes, I would have been thinking that we would get a fairly towed movie. But later the plot will have the ability of catching the audience's attention so hard, that you won't feeling of when will it end"" or this movie is so tardy"" for a minute of the 130 minutes runtime. Around the 40th minute of the whole movie it pushes a so brutally epic scene into your face, what your brain can hardly accept and process. It's a so well choreographed and perfectly executed scene, that usually could be seen only seen at the end of the movie as the finale of the whole production. I've also had the feeling of the movie's ended, because the scene was immediately followed by 5-10 minutes of peaceful atmosphere, but fortunately it's darkened really soon, and the tension kept going on.The villains are popping up right after each other in the film, and we constantly have the opportunity of getting know the bad guys taking their place higher and higher on the hierarchy of the underworld. Marton Csokas has the ability of representing the irritatingly arrogant and disgusting right hand of the mafia, who's dealing with all the dirty affairs of his boss. But almost everybody will like his character despite of his repulsive nature, but because of the excellent acting performance.I also bow down before the writer, because the dialogues are so funky and fast-paced, what I think I haven't experienced for years before. Danzel's usual humorous style against the good guys could prevail as effectively just as the usual condescending, and efficiently argumentative style against the bad guys. He could even twirl the minds of the most elusive and dodgiest criminals effectively by the play of words, so that they could react with only silence, big eyes and open-mouth.The restrictions on age in the film is completely legitimate, because the fighting scenes are made so brutal and expressive, that hey hit the screen with true vengeance. I've almost felt the pain when I heard the cracking of an arm or by the sight of a knife slicing through a limb of a lucky man. The camera work is not the most appropriate in every single moment, because there were some hand-to-hand combat scenes where I could have barely seen what's really happening and who's actually hit who. But there is not any bigger (and other) mistakes in the whole movie at all that I could take into account. Denzel tries to get to the Russian mafia totally alone, which could sound totally crazy and incredible, but somehow the movie could present the happenings in a more or less realistic way in front of our eyes, so that we can totally accept this fact.I don't want to spoil the plot and overall essence of the film, because it's far more pleasuring to realize it by ourselves by seeing the whole production.Overall, the movie is great! In my opinion it could smoothly deserve the movie of the year title, and I'd dare to risk a couple of Oscars. Although the movies of this kind are unfortunately not often welcomed by the academy. Shame on them! Nevertheless, I would recommend the film to almost everyone who has the ability of enduring the brutality on a serious level. And for the fans of Denzel it's a must-see masterpiece!Rating 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Revenge Is A Dish Best Served Denzel,"No one, and I mean NO ONE, does revenge like Denzel Washington. And when he's a man on fire, you get giddy with expectation on his killing sprees. Especially if they're cartoonish bad guys. A video game come alive, this movie is FUN. I grew up with the original t.v. series...and the update is nice. It is stripped of pure camp and gone the way of most Denzel movies. He's the best of the best with a dark past. If you haven't gotten enough of this, watch this flick. It's a LOT of the same, but still worthwhile time waster.Antoine Fuqua again proves he has a very sympathetic ear to the streets. Meaning, he likes the percentage of people who are always getting screwed in life. I like that. I like that theme. And I like there is someone who doesn't wear a cape or have superpowers that have been bestowed on them due to gamma rays or whatever. It's just a man who was upset. Nothing wrong in that. If you spend too much time on the logic, then screw you...this movie isn't your cup of tea. Go watch some British BBC spy movie that gives you every dull detail of its inception. This is good ol' fashion American butt-whipping. Fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

True Justice,"Based on a TV show from the 80's but with some changes (McCall was a British SAS ex-operative, not an American), comes this remake directed by Antoine Fuqua (Olympus Has Fallen, 2013). Denzel Washington is Robert McCall, a former CIA operative that is morally compelled to go back into action to help a lady in distress. Though it looks like ""The A-Team"", it is surprisingly deep in terms of character motivation, and those characters are way better performed than the standard blockbuster movies.Fuqua is reunited with Washington after ""Training"" Day, (2001), the film that got him an Oscar award as best leading actor. Fuqua has made some major blockbusters but all of them very well crafted and full of deep-layered characters that reach you (""King Arthur"", 2004) or ""Shooter"" (2007), both blockbusters that were also critically acclaimed.He usually gets to work with solid cast, and this time is no different: Chloë Grace Moretz (Dark Shadows, 2012) or Marton Csokas (Lord of the Rings, 2001-2003) or ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) support Washington, and they both deliver (Csokas is great as a crazy Russian operative).Bottom line, a great action movie, the kind you watch all over again every time is on TV. Let's not kid ourselves, if we had to choose a film to take with us to an isolated island, we would not choose a David Lynch or a Hitchcock film, but something like this or the Lethal Weapon saga.

Spectacular action movie with a lot of heart,"This movie is really a cut above the rest of the action movies out there. The entire opening of the movie is so well acted and perfectly sets up Denzel's character, who continues to be fleshed out in the sequels.Obviously they have to cut a few corners in the fight scenes, because Denzel is no spring chicken anymore, but it doesn't really hurt the movie.As action movies there are of course better things out there and purely on action it doesn't stand out against things like John Wick or The Raid, but the story of Denzel's character and the struggle he goes through, is what sets it apart. He continues to be my favorite actor.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

It reminds me of Bourne movies, highly professional and really, really enjoyable. The filming is super, wherever this movie goes, streets, bars, stores, one gets a real sense of rich urban texture. For no other reason this is a great look at Boston. The director has a talent for lighting and sympathetic closeups, as well as a sort of earthy pathos. It's a good length, its a good pace. How the baddie got his accent is pure talent. Denzil is as cool as Man On Fire. This movie is a guaranteed antidote.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Such a waste of good material and acting,"This movie was such a disappointment I felt compelled to write my first review. Denzel Washington usually does a good job of selecting movies to star in that are good for what they are. Some are deeper than others but that is OK because whether the movie is mindless action, deeply inspirational, comedy, of some other genre it is still entertaining if it is done well. This is the first movie I have seen of Washington's where I felt the movie was well below average.The acting was fine but the storyline was stupid. It alternated between trying to be deep and thought provoking only to then have the characters do things that would be incredibly stupid in real life. The writers and directors were just being lazy and having characters do things to make a point they wanted to make or to advance the plot with no regard for whether or not it made sense for that character to take that action.I loved the Equalizer series. Part of the charm was that Edward Woodward was a secret agent who was past his prime. He was still very competent, but he had to rely more on planning and getting help from others. I knew that would be difficult to do in a movie format instead of a series but I had hoped that with Denzel in the movie it would at least be good. Instead, the movie starts interesting enough, then gets stupid spoiling the more thoughtful storyline, has a brief intense action scene, and then for the rest of the movie I had lost respect for the credibility of the plot and was alternatively bored at the attempts for depth, the laziness of contrived plot points, and the over the top action.This movie was such a waste of talented actors. The actors did a good job with the well written plot line and if the movie would have stuck to trying to be a story driven drama it would have been very good. The action scenes were good but getting to them seemed contrived. It was like they wrote the action scenes then had to figure out how to work them into the movie. If the movie wanted to just be an action movie with very little meaningful plot the scenes would have been very good but there needed to be more action.I can't recommend this movie to anyone. If you are in the mood for action, there is not enough. If you want a compelling storyline, they do not tell it well and insert dumb scenes into the movie to either preach at the audience or to give an excuse for the action scenes. It seemed to me like the people making the movie had a good story but then were worried that the general viewing public would be to stupid to get the point if they did not include lots of talking about the evils of (no spoilers) and then throw in some action scenes for the masses.I still plan on watching any movie with Denzel Washington in it, this rubbish was not his fault unless he had creative input. But I continue to be disappointed at the large number of movies being produced that seem to cobbled together to reach an audience but lack focus on being entertaining.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel is a bad mf in this,"Well, Liam Neeson must have been busy so the producers got Denzel Washington to take the lead. This character is exactly what Neeson has been playing in his recent movies like Taken. I guess now that Denzel is over 60, he wants to become an action star like Neeson.In this film, quite, mild mannered Robert McCall, whom works at a Home Depot type of store, befriends a young hooker. Well the Russian mob beats her up and he's mad. First he tries to buy her freedom, but when that fails, we find out exactly what kind of a guy McCall really is. Pretty good scene as to how he takes care of the gangsters.Well the head of the mob is losing money, so he sends his ace guy to find out whom killed his guys. The guy tracks down McCall and he's not prepared for whom he's up against. McCall visits some old friends to find out whom these mob guys are and then it's on. McCall uses his ""skills"" to take care of the bad guys in some pretty cool ways, never using a gun.FINAL VERDICT: Fun, over the top, action flick.

So boring I fell asleep,"Seriously, it was that bad. Normally, a movie featuring so many guns and spilling so much blood would get my attention, but the action sequences were just dumb. From beginning to the end, the whole thing felt like a mindless grind. And you could tell from the sticky performances of the actors that they thought the project was stupid too. But with a $50 million budget, it must have been a nice payday for everyone involved and so they went through the motion to get the movie done.Denzel Washington shows his age and is unconvincing as a super assassin. He is too rotund around the waist for people to believe that he has the quick moves needed to get the kills. Washington is best suited for a movie like ""Flight"" where he played a bitter and washed up alcoholic. For his own sake, he should either get in shape or turn down these action roles.""The Equalizer"" should never have been made. There is no need to insult the audience with this kind of trash.

Comic book stuff but entertaining,Denzel Washington is excellent as the invincible hero taking on the Russian Mafia. His character is a combination of Steven Seagal and James Bond.

Washington carries this film thanks to his particular set of skills,"""I am offering you a chance to do the right thing. Take it.""With the exception of Training Day, which I absolutely loved, Antoine Fuqua hadn't directed a film that merited much acknowledgement. Being able to team up with Denzel Washington once again definitely attracted many people's attention towards this project, but if they were expecting The Equalizer to replicate the success of Training Day then they'll be disappointed because what they get with this film is a standard, by the books action thriller. It plays out like most revenge thrillers do and it follows the standard formula of the genre in such a way that you can easily predict the outcome of most of the film. What The Equalizer does have going for it however is the presence of Denzel Washington in the titular role playing a character with a particular set of skills. Washington is solid and he elevates this generic film in such a way that he manages to keep us entertained. There is something cool about his character and he portrays that interior smoothness very well here. His character may seem calm and friendly in the surface, but when it comes to helping the weak there is no one who can serve them justice better than him. His character will easily remind people of Liam Neeson in Taken, or even Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher although Washington's character is much more likable. The film also takes its time to set things up and it works to the films advantage here; I would even say the buildup is much stronger than the execution. The stylized violence is also present in this Fuqua film and I enjoyed the overall look of the film with the underlying score setting the tone. The Equalizer reminded me a lot of Man on Fire, which was a film I really loved so if you were a fan of it as well you might want to check this out. It is very similar in structure and I would go as far as saying that it has a superhero movie feel to it as well.I have seen over 20 films starring Denzel Washington and I yet haven't seen one I disliked. Sure, there were some average films he made, but never have I been disappointed by his movies. I know The Equalizer isn't groundbreaking and I shouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did because it is full of clichés, but it was impossible for me to resist Washington's charm once again. He gives a solid performance in this action thriller and he carries the film. The female characters are all portrayed as victims here once again, but Chloe Grace Moretz sells her character very well. She has some solid scenes with Washington at the beginning of the film which help set the premise of the film. Melissa Leo could have been the strongest female character in the film, but she only has a brief appearance. This is basically a one man show with Washington personifying coolness. Marton Csokas is set up as a pretty strong villain during the first half of the film, but he could have been better used in the second half. Csokas is Washington's counterpart (kind of like what The Joker was to Batman) and the buildup to the face-off is what works best in this film. I had a great time with this action thriller despite all its flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Based on the 1985 TV show, Denzel Washington is an ex.. special something who helps crime victims by charmingly killing bad people.","The Equalizer is based on an '80s T.V. show, and now it's back for a new generation, a new take, a new, and awesome I might add action film directed by mister Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Southpaw). The film follows Robert, played by Denzel Washington (Training Day, American Gangster). Robert is a man of a mysterious origin. Who believes he has put the past behind him, dedicates himself to creating a quiet new life. He works at a Home Depot, takes public transportation, goes to the same restaurant every night to drink tea (even though he brings his own tea bag, so really he is just ordering hot water), reads his book, talks to an underage prostitute, named Teri, played by Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick Ass, Let Me In) and doesn't bother anyone. Until, the Russian mob get violent, and abuse Teri. That's when Denzel decides he needs to get back in his old ways, and deliver a fresh can of whoop ass to the bad guys.Denzel Washington's performance in this film is one of the best performances 'I've seen him do in a long time. His character is brutal, bad-ass, charming, has a hunger for justice, and overall this is a very cool character. This is how I imagined The Punisher in his older years.Antoine Fuqua really knows how to mingle a magnificent action movie. It's action packed, stylized, and some very cool shots throughout this film. Denzel Washington really is like a modern day, stylized superhero. Did you notice he wears the same type of shirt throughout the movie? That might as well be his superhero costume! Spray paint a big bat logo on it, and he is good to go.Accordingly, my only complaint about the film, is it could have been trimmed down to a shorter movie. Also, the villains could have been fleshed out a little bit better. They come off as typical foreign villains we've seen before.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on The Equalizer. A good action movie, that has a cool character, scenes, and a cool story. My only complaint is the film's running time is a little long, and with a story like this it doesn't need to be this long.

Brutally Fun,"The Equalizer = 8/10Positive:-Denzel Washington carries the film with his charisma and plays a great character who has an incredibly likeable and heroic nature-The story is simple but works well and is an exciting mix of John Wick/Film Noir and 80s action films.Although the story is thin, it fits well into the nature of the film and still knows how to captivate the entire run length-The film has many interesting characters and element such as. Corruption, prostitution or David Harbor plays a corrupt cop with a great chzarackter development-The kills and fight scenes are really engaging and are very creative and brutal-The entire finale from the hardware store to the Russian villa is awesome and you sit there with your mouth open and are happy about each of the creative kills.Negative:-The plot of the film is too thin and full of clichés and 1000 views dialogues and fight scenes despite the good elements. Many elements look like John Wick Lite or have often appeared in other films and this unfortunately makes the story quite forgettable.-The Russian Mafia antagonist is a walking cliché and ""Teddy"" as the major antagonist is awful and a single overacting and no motivation or memorableConclusion: A classic and fun revenge thriller with really brutal kills and an incredibly symphonic Denzel Washington. The film is a colorful mix of genres and sometimes looks like a darker John Wick. Nevertheless, the film doesn't live up to its role models and gets lost in its annoying clichés and its non-existent story. The badly written Russians don't help either. Still, you end up sitting there with a smile on your face and it remains an impressive performer.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Long, boring, strung out with a plot that we've seen done better 1,000 times before.","This movie was very painful to watch. You'll find yourself waiting ages for action sequences that are very predictable and bland. Half of this movie is spent on small talk, and self reflection. Guess who the bad guys are? You guessed it, the Russian mob. Other than enemies filled with borderline racist stereotypes, you'll find yet another cliché ex-assassin turned regular guy, turned vigilante protagonist. This movie will continually, figuratively give you the middle finger by withholding information from the viewer, to the point where the movie won't even show you action sequences.This film takes beyond what seems like an eternity, to even establish who the protagonist is, or anything about his past. Another thing this movie lacks in, is plot stability. You'll repeatedly find yourself asking, ""who are these guys? Where is he? What is he even trying to accomplish?"" Do not be afraid to get up to use the restroom or cook food without pausing the movie because you more than likely won't miss anything ""important"" because this movie lacks any important material. Even the soundtrack for the main action sequence is boring and repetitive; It is ALMOST literally (I'm not making this up) comprised of one single piano key being struck.The sole reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1, is because of Denzel Washingtons acting.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Too long and full of action tropes,"Pros - Denzel, without him this movie is very bad
Chloe (not in the movie enough)
Strong scenes between the 2
Good hand to hand combat, unique ""weapon"" useCons - villain caricatures (stereotyped Russian mob, dirty boston cops)

There are So Many Actors But There Is Only One Denzel,"Another Masterpiece for the One & Only Denzel. Some Actors Act But Few Like Denzel Wake Up in the morning and being themselves in front of a Camera. The Equalizer is a great movie made only for Denzel. His Performance is Just Brilliant. The Story is well-written. The choice of actors and actresses was great. The Humor and action is well put and with the right amount. If you are a fan of Denzel and who isn't :) , you gonna love this movie. If you want to re-live the experience of Man On Fire then The Equalizer is your Chance to Do that. It's a Must See Movie.

Live action classics,"Why not write about all the parts at once?Surprisingly, only 1 part can be called a movie, and not a popcorn entertainment with beer.Good color correction, a stopwatch feature, which for some reason was forgotten in the sequel, but returned in the triquel (surprisingly), the action episodes are the best here, and the final location is just great. In the sequel, the ending is also not bad, but the triquel is super bad, but I'm getting ahead of myself.The plot is again surprising, although it is sewn with white threads between the parts. The main thing is that in part 1, which I recommend watching, I don't even want to skip the chatter. The following films cannot fully boast of this.And there is also a cool composition in 1 part.

Fuqua's Best Work in Some Time,"I have an on-again/off-again relationship with Fuqua films. I've grown increasingly disenchanted with his post-""Training Day"" films, and I've been waiting for one to rekindle my interest. Despite really liking the TV spots/trailers for ""The Equalizer,"" I still had my reservations about seeing ""The Equalizer."" But I'm glad that I did, because it's the Fuqua film I've been waiting for.SYNOPSIS - Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall, an ex- government/CIA agent (it's never explicitly specified what he did; only implied). Now living an ostensibly honest life in Boston, Massachusetts, he's been able to successfully distance himself from his past life all the while helping and assisting those who he is friends with. After getting to know a young aspiring singer—Alina (played by Moretz)—who hangs out at a diner that McCall frequents, he realizes that she's involved with some shady people. McCall decides to help her next, but doing so not only makes him confront his past... it begins to unravel a thread that he may come to regret ever tugging in the first place.REVIEW - Directing & Cinematography, 10/10: Surprisingly deft behind the camera, Fuqua shifts his directing style in ""The Equalizer,"" clearly taking inspiration from ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" director Zack Snyder at times. The film itself looks fantastic, each shot is crisp and sharp; Mauro Fiore worked with Fuqua on ""Training Day"" and ""Tears of the Sun,"" but also with Peter Berg on his film ""The Kingdom."" I may have had gripes with some of Fuqua's past few films, but I've always admired his cinematography, and this notion still holds with ""The Equalizer."" Fiore does a great job, as familiar Boston settings almost act as complimentary characters in each scene.Writing, 9/10: I had watched this film a week after seeing Liam Neeson's kinda-sort-similar ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" which was a massive disappointment to me solely because the of the writing. I'm glad to say that ""The Equalizer"" doesn't suffer from this problem. Richard Wenk does a commendable job of introducing us to McCall and revealing his quirks to the audience. Every character in the film is flawed—even McCall—yet Fuqua and Wenk are able to translate them to the screen with both delicacy and intrigue. I have only two gripes with the writing. First, as some other reviews have astutely noted, Moretz's character is unfortunately relegated to a massive supporting role. I found this to be an utter shame, as she portrayed Alina with such a tenderness and vulnerability—I was really disappointed that she had probably less than 10 minutes of screen time. My other writing- related issue stems from what I've dubbed ""End of Watch"" syndrome. For anyone who has seen David Ayer's film ""End of Watch,"" you'll know that, while a good movie, it's highly far-fetched simply because so much happens to the two protagonists in so little time. This happens a little bit in ""The Equalizer,"" as McCall—who had apparently lived a 'normal' life since his retirement from the CIA up until the beginning of this film— suddenly has a string of nearly-unbelievable action-packed encounters in about a 48-hour span, none of which are actually related to each other! But I can suspend my disbelief; this is a film, after all, and that is the agreement we make as an audience. It was just a little TOO unbelievable, but hardly a deal-breaker. Although if extra- terrestrials some how wound up in the film, then that would be a different story!Musical Score, 10/10: I'm a bit of an audiophile, and I contend that a fantastic soundtrack is one of the biggest assets any film can boast. Literally from the opening scene of ""The Equalizer,"" I knew that the film was in great hands musically. It wasn't until the credits that I realized why: they were able to nab the great Harry Gregson-Williams (the first two ""Narnia"" films and ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" among many many others). Oddly enough, he's also scored a number of Denzel films: ""Man on Fire,"" ""Deja Vu,"" ""Pelham 123,"" ""Unstoppable."" For some films, the music is just 'there'; it's really nothing more than filler. But ""The Equalizer"" benefits greatly from Gregson-Williams' subtle touches: uplifting at times and dramatic when needed, the score for this film is one of the better ones I can remember for big Hollywood films this year, probably right behind Tyler Bates' work on ""Guardians of the Galaxy.""FINAL THOUGHTS - Denzel is great as always, but I also want to give proper credit to Marton Csokas who plays the main antagonist. His chemistry with Denzel Washington is just a pleasure to witness. It's a shame he's always some twisted villain in the majority of his roles!In the end, ""The Equalizer"" has something for everyone: attention- grabbing music, great characters, an aesthetically awesome look, fantastic acting, interesting story, and pulse-pounding action. I'd highly recommend this film to anyone, especially anyone who lives in the Boston area (it can be great fun to see landmarks and areas on film that you see every day). And another plus is that it's only in 2D so that you don't have to get suckered into the inflated 3D prices these days! To be honest, you don't really need to read a review about the film to know what it's about. It's Denzel being a badass. We've all seen this before, haven't we? Especially given that Denzel's done ""Man on Fire!"" But if you STILL have doubts, let me put it this way: I can think of a thousand things that would be a much bigger waste of $10, even if you end up not liking the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel is a BADASS,"I went into this movie with an open mind as Denzel is ageing and this movie didn't have much hype. I left throughly impressed and would go back and watch it again. Denzel plays a very calm, respectful and polite older man who frequently visits the local coffee shop where he reads books and chats with a young girl who is into some pretty negative stuff in her life. (Prostitution) He acts as a father figure to her and tries guiding her in the right direction in life. Just as this happens sh*t hits the fan and that's where the action picks up. You find out quickly that he possesses some 'special' skills. Basically this is the type of movie you can't help but get behind and cheer for the good guy. He exacts revenge on everyone who does him or his friends wrong. He does so in a very savage way and uses odd weapons to get the job done. (Rarely uses a gun) Throughout the movie you're shown how great of a human being he is, as he constantly tries helping less fortunate people get ahead in life. The villains are cast very well and give you the impression that they're no one to mess around with and surprise you with intelligence. However a villain is a villain and you know how that ends. If you want to see a truly badass movie with a ballsy tough guy this is the movie. It's not 100% action all of the time but that's what makes it great. Lots of buildup to the ass whoopings! 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Similar to Taken but with no strings attached. Expect a sequel if it does well $$ wise,Rating it 7 outta 10 coz there are 70 movies worse than the 30 out of 100 that came out and I have seen this year. Not a MUST WATCH at all...but entertaining almost always.Its like Taken...but no family part of the story...instead its random strangers the protagonist (Denzel) knows better than the other 20 people in the flick. A better plot when thinking about sequels coz there might even be. I only say its like Taken coz its the Action movie minus the usually accompanied humour. Denzel and Liam aren't Bruce or Arnie or The Rock xDOne thing that stands out is the hand to hand combat is almost real time...except the villain kill (stands out quit noticeably). Otherwise slo-mo is used exclusively for explosions and crashes.If you're bored on a drunk weekday...you could watch this move skipping the initial 10 mins and never think of a rerun but just be entertained,7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best vigilante movies I've seen,"How could anyone not like a vigilante movie? It's surprising to me Hollywood doesn't make more of them considering they always seem to be well liked and successful. Plus the formula is simple enough to create. Then you simply find the right actor and boom! Box office success. The first vigilante movie that comes to mind for most people I'd imagine would be 'Die Hard'. Then for the younger generation I'd imagine it to be 'Taken' (and possibly a few of the older generation because it was pretty good. And now I'm telling you once enough people have seen 'The Equalizer' it'll be right up there amongst the other big guns because it is very very good.The most important ingredient of all to the vigilante genre has to be the star. Bruce Willis was perfect in his role, Liam Neeson was even better in his role and now here we have Denzel Washington, one of the coolest actors in Hollywood. For an old man (he's 60) he absolutely nailed it. First of all you'd never guess he was 60, I believe he worked out very hard for the role. Secondly it's his demeanor throughout that defines the character. He's so in control, so calm and collected that never once do we feel he could be in the slightest bit of danger from these ragtag Russian gangsters.And unfortunately therein lies probably the only downfall in 'The Equalizer'. Perhaps he's simply too in the control the entire time. It makes for a lot of fun no doubt about it, but somewhere in those 2 hours and 10 minutes you have to have your hero in a precarious position where it seems all is lost only for him to miraculously escape. There's a scene where you could argue that was the case but I don't think it was enough. That's the only criticism though I could find in this very fine film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
appalling,"Built entirely on clichés and relaying on questionable morality, the movie is circular, ""solving"" at the end the so-called ""problem"" that presented itself in the beginning. The appalling evolution of the characters, portrayed by the moral: ""do what you feel like"", is surpassed only by their poor definition. The script is trivial and contains elements never elucidated, i.e., the role of starting and stopping (when the character remembers) the wrist watch. When it comes to the camera-work, I have to, in all fairness, say that it's the best aspect of this movie I rated with 3. However, this is eclipsed by the editing and probably by the director's choice to film wide angles, for example, when he shouldn't have had.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
A cinematic marvel spoilt by a simplistic story line,"It seems that all the world's problems with crime could've been solved if only we had Robert McCall on the other end of the line. This unstoppable force of nature could bring in world peace in no time, and if we gave him some more leeway I'm sure he'd solve world hunger and global warming too. Which is plainly speaking just a shame, the film as is is superbly shot and acted, it uses the cinematic image like very few others in the industry do, and previous encounters with Antoine Fuqua, proves that he simply has this great understanding of the visual aspects of movie making, The Replacement Killers and King Arthur are just two obvious examples. The original series, was superb because in its Edward Woodward version McCall's limitation were always part of the story, he was super because he never tried to overcome a roomful of armed gangsters, he strategized his way around such circumstances. And never tried to solve the entire American problem with the Mob. What's the point of translating TV masterpieces of the past to the big screen if you miss its core point.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not quite The Equalizer I remember,"As a fan of the TV series I was disappointed that this bears little resemblance to it's source material. That isn't to say this is a bad film. In the series Edward Woodward fed up working as an agent gave it up, but wasn't willing to let his expertise go wasted. He took out an ad to help those in need. He occasionally had help for former colleagues. He lived in a nice apartment. Drove a Jag. The very city of New York was almost a character unto itself. The Robert McCall Denzel plays him more like Liam Neeson in the Taken series. 
I guess my big problem is once again Hollywood has taken a property with name recognition. I enjoy this film for what it is, but I would still love to see a faithful adaptation of The Equalizer.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Simply superb,"the equalizerWow. Just finished watchin this and it was great. first I gotta say, I'm no big fan of Denzel. the movies I've seen by him that has been enjoyable have been few, and far between. For a role like this I would actually have chosen Jason Statham, but I guess Denzel's name draws more people to the movies. But Denzel did a superb job. I was truly and toughly entertained, and that is a long time since I've been. Chloë Grace Moretz Plays extremely well for her young age, and I think she will go far. I really liked her performance. She handled the act of playing a prostitute really well for her young age. The only thing that draws the movie slightly down, is the whole cat and mouse game, that goes on all through the movie. They need to come up with a new way, to make these type of movies, without the cat and mouse game . It's been used through and through ,and its get tire some an stupid after while.

There is a few action scenes here and there, but way too few of them and sometimes even off screen...On the other hand the story is nice, Denzel play his part very good, Chloe do the job even tough the role is small.

Chillingly good,"8 October 2104 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Equalizer. Believing he has found a quiet life in Boston, having put his military past behind him McCall (Denzel Washington) comes to the aid of a young girl he has befriended and suddenly finds himself taking on a large chunk of the Russian Mafia. This film had quite a long slow start and I wondered where it was going for a while, however as the pieces of the story came together you became aware of the complexities of McCall's character and the horrors he thought he had put behind him. Superbly acted by Washington, this character was a man of few words and he was chillingly inscrutable as he was facing down his foes. If I had to complain about anything, it was maybe 15 to 20 minutes too long, but that is a minor gripe against what was a good film.

Equalizer: When Denzel Cleans Up with Blood and Style,"It's a fact-Americans love hating on the Russians, and Hollywood keeps running with the joke. In The Equalizer, we get Denzel Washington as a budget Batman: no cape, no gadgets, just a spiral notebook and an unhealthy obsession with timers. The result? He carves up Russian mobsters like a Sunday butcher on steroids. Even John Wick might've taken notes.Denzel Washington is the guy who kills with style: Colgate smile, crisp shirt, and moves so sharp they deserve an Oscar for choreography. He doesn't just annihilate his enemies; he gives them masterclasses in cinematic death-precision strikes, perfect angles, and slow-mo shots that would make Zack Snyder weep. Denzel is the badass uncle everyone wants at family reunions.Antoine Fuqua delivers nostalgic, no-nonsense action on a silver platter. You want old-school ass-kicking? You got it. Somewhere between Expendables and The Raid, Equalizer ticks all the boxes: explosions, knife fights, and villains dying with more flair than extras in Rambo II. Even the slow-motion scenes are tailored for fans of dusty VHS tapes.The story fits on a cocktail napkin: a kind-hearted man decides to save a young girl from the clutches of some very bad people. It's classic but effective, as long as you don't overthink the plot holes. At times, you'll wonder if Denzel has a divine GPS or the gift of teleportation to show up at the perfect moment. But hey, it's an action flick, not a logistics seminar.Special shoutout to the villain. He's not just another generic Russian with a bad accent. No, this bad guy is smart, organized, and genuinely intimidating-a refreshing change in a genre where antagonists are often dumber than Bowser's world domination plans.The Equalizer is unapologetic popcorn cinema, elevated by sheer talent. Denzel Washington dazzles, Antoine Fuqua delivers, and audiences are swept away by the beautifully choreographed violence that reminds us why we love action movies. It's not perfect, but who's here for perfection? We're here for the explosions and hammer blows-and we can't get enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Semi-stylish, weak script, good acting.","The biggest issue with ""The Equalizer"" has to be that it is an adaptation of an old TV show, the script is full of the basic cliché which have been seen in numerous action films, from the protagonist showing a character a picture and the facial expression gives it away that they know the character (in a bad way of course) or the ""let me tell you a story"" where the protagonist sits the antagonist down to tell him about someone, the protagonist getting beaten down struggling in the final fight against the big henchman, the reason why this film isn't ruined completely is the very well done performances by Denzel Washington and Marton Csokas. Antoine Fuqua is a very poor mans David Fincher, at least in terms of this film, this is one of his best film since Training Day but it is nothing special especially during a year like this which is filled with great films and performances. It's certainly tolerable as an action film, with this film a lack of humour didn't hurt it too much whereas I found Olympus Has Fallen suffered tremendously from it's lack of humour. I also find Mr. Fuqua's use of CGI a bit alarming in regards to how it looks, I've noticed this in a few of his films where the CGI just looks bad and really sticks out. The ending is immensely weak, and although Chloe Grace Moretz does a good job with what little she's given, it really feels cheap the way they bring her in right at the end after being absent for so long, showing Denzel emailing her would have made more sense and wouldn't have looked as forced.This shouldn't be a spoiler but if it is, you'll probably love this movie, The finale occurs in the Home Hardware place where Denzel's character works. Now I didn't like the department store fight of Mr. & Mrs. Smith, this one is a little bit better but not much. I personally found it underwhelming as the first trailer I saw I figured, you know what would be convenient for the screenwriters, if they end up having a big shootout in the end inside that store. These screenwriters obviously work in conveniences, and Fuqua would have a decent style, if David Fincher didn't exist (I'd say this film is almost like Fuqua mimicking Fincher, however all of David Fincher's films are comparatively better, outside of Alien 3).",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A bit slow and flawed, but OK.","Not that much action in this action movie, most of it is over in a few seconds except for towards the end of the movie. But the movie is very slow for just as long in the beginning, and much of the time in the middle seems to be there to pass some time in between the beginning and the end... Some thrilling sequences and some crime are in the movie, so OK, it has the claimed ingredients even if it could benefit from at least having more action.At least one event with an electric drill that was rather unrealistic took place, the ""usual"" misunderstanding about how electricity behaves in water was also found time for. Several episodes where people had guns (close by) but chose not to use them took place. The worst case of them all took place at the last scene in the ""Home Mart"". Alternative ways of doing things might look ""cool"", but they are not necessarily neither the smart or the effective way of doing things. Usually it is neither.The movie was OK to watch even if I found it to be to slow for to much time. So if you like action movies with more style than contents, see this movie.

Denzel,"So the main thing going for this movie is Denzel Washington. Yeah, I could say that about some of his other movies as well. But he is basically the only thing that really stands out in this generic film. Sure, it has some cool scenes with Denzel playing this badass. But it's nothing really knew in this type of genre. The plot is about a man with a past that is seeking redemption and retribution. He is a vigilante that puts the law into his own hands and handles things like ""The Punisher"". But probably not as cruel when it comes to handling the bad guys. Mainly because he at least gives some of them chances before he gets his hands dirty. I was able to sit through this, but it isn't something I would watch again. Mainly because it's just not that entertaining in my opinion and the character development is poorly constructed. And that includes the plot as well. It just didn't seem to flow that well. Marton Csokas was good as the villain Teddy, but his character was poorly written and his character didn't seem to bring out his full potential as the villain. Decent job sort of building him up and nothing. The only scene that actually stood out for me is when Denzel's character is sitting in front of the villain in the restaurant.

There's the bonus of a good guy having to do some very bad things in the name of justice. He's trying to mind his own business and the cruel world just keeps reeling him in and forcing him to use the skill set that he would rather forget about. I love a good action movie and this delivers.I loved the character development and his relationships with the guy at work and the teen-aged hooker. Loved it so much, I may make it back to the movies again to see it. Will not discuss specific plot and story lines as that have been done repetitively here. Although the villain was great and kept my attention as well. I loved the way he saunters around in his tailored suits and the mind bending exchanges that he and Denzel have with one another.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brilliant,"I'm honestly not much of a Denzel Washington fan (still not), however, I haven't enjoyed a film in a very long time as much as I did this one. It's got nothing to with Denzel really... well, at least for me it doesn't. But what truly made this film as outstanding as it was and utterly brilliant in every way possible, was the way it was written, the way the story unfolds, the way it almost forces you to be neutral (unless you're a Denzel fan then you're obviously cheering him on from the moment the production studio logos appear).But I cannot think of any other film (help me if you know of any) that so brilliantly makes two extremely opposite characters - the protagonist and antagonist obviously (or good guy and bad guy as we call them now), appear so similar, just to make them face off at the end in what usually is a sharp contrast of good versus evil. And it's really not a question of who's gonna win at the end (because it's obviously the good guy -duh!), but the challenging part really, is who do you root for!We all love villains - not that we root for them, but we just love the characters. But in this film, you not only love the villain, but you feel a strong urge to secretly root for him. Mainly because it takes a while for you to realise he's actually the bad guy. So torn between two worlds, you're literally forced to step out of the picture and eagerly watch the action unfold with bated breath to see what will happen next. By the time the end credits roll, you're still sitting motionless in your seat trying to take it all in. The adrenaline in this film is extremely high - even in some of the slower paced scenes. Watch with caution if you cannot handle that.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"If you liked The Book of Eli, then give The Equalizer a look.","This film is based on a TV show from the 80's,from the same name, which I never saw. This was an entertaining action thriller, don't get me wrong it was a little flawed, but I still enjoyed. It feels like a cross between Man on Fire(2004), Taken(2008), and Jack Reacher(2012).Robert McCall(Denzel Washington) someone with a dark past, tries to live a simply life in Boston, he has a job managing Home Mart. He befriends a troubled teenager(Chole Grace Moretz) and discovers she is mixed in with some bad people, he uses his deadly set of skills to help her out. But only brings more bad people that will stop at nothing to bring him down. Will Robert get them before they get him?Denzel was awesome here, he was bad ass and ruthless, but I also like the way he does not play the character has one noted. Chole Grace Moretz is also good, the amount of minutes she's in it. The actors playing the bad guys are great, there cunning and menacing.

"Pretty Boring, but Great Themes","The Equalizer has a pretty solid script, but it has terrible editing and pacing.The main character is the definition of a person with perfect moral. He is ruthless, but he kills to save people. The themes of caring, kindness, giving people a chance are not complicated, but important. The story is predictable, but engaging.On the other hand, the movie is not. The editing is terrible. The fight scenes are just bad, because I couldn't see anything. The pacing is also horrible. The beginning was good, it had a lot of similarities to John Wick and I though that would be the slow part, but the fight sequence in the end was a lot more boring, I fell asleep several times. The cinematography was sometimes gorgeous, but in a few scenes, it was just pretty bad. Denzel Washington is a terrific actor and he created an interesting character, his performance was great.The Equalizer is pretty boring, I think it could've been a lot better with a shorter runtime and well-edited fight scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another Denzel Washington Triumph,"I can't remember ever watching a Denzel Washington film I didn't enjoy and this one was no exception.I can remember English actor Edward Woodward pioneering the original American, made for television series, back in the late 1980s and bringing the role of Robert McCall to our screens.Denzel does amazing justice to the film version of this debut vigilante role, with a strong story line full of action and violence and a depth of character which sets the scene nicely for any follow-ups which may come along ...

And I first thought Denzel would say; Uh, I don't know.I mean he didn't even know the little girl, and didn't even trust her enough to tell her what happened to his wife etc.Nope it just felt like another brainless go in and kill everyone.

Equalizer,"Superb movie! However, I could not understand the dialogue between the woman (CIA??FBI?? Secret Service??) sitting on the porch with Denzel visited (from his past).

Additionally, I applaud the security guard for his unselfish assistance in ""never leaving anyone behind"" even though, he seemed to be mentally injured.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great movie - but should be classed in Sci-Fi section,"I know this wasn't based on a true story, but the producer was silly to portray 1 ex-CIA operative to be able to take down an entire Russian mafia, AND take care of corrupt cops while stopping the occasional burglary at the local Home Improvement DIY.Robert McCall makes the SWAT team look like like the Rugrats. The movie started off incredible, the first 30mins were captivating, However the plot thickened, the film got progressively worse like a crescendo. It put Rambo to shame as it amassed weight on the ""bullshit scale"". At one point I really wondered whether the entire state really needed any more police, perhaps 1 Batman was enough.If you can watch this with an open mind where ""anything is possible"" then this movie is great. If you're too analytical, then don't as you would be disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Nice Classic Straight-Up Action Film!,The narrative is strong. The characater-development is excellent. It has a great feeling of vengeance and empathy and compassion and vile hatred and mixes those feelings in a toxic blender of violent oppression.All for Robert McCall to use with his quest to take down the Russian mob. I'm not entirely sure how they got this far with this much exploitation but it is a good basis for a storyline for a movie.The use of girls and trafficking is heatful and emotional and it sets a big trigger in McCall's mindset to go back to his roots and destroy the mob; once-and-for-all and any corruption entangled with it!For that just enjoy the ride! The sequences are polished and well-done and not overused CGI. It does get a bit repetitive as a concept but that's to be expected. It has an excellent score.There is character-building sub-plots going on and I think that really does a benefit to understand his motive. I really enjoyed this movie and if you don't take it too seriously I think you will too! It's very well shot and excecuted with great techincal skill by the Director.It's very nearly a masterpiece but not quite. Cool movie. 8/10!,8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Watch out for Denzel Washington,"The Equalizer stars Denzel Washington and is directed by Antoine Fuqua who directed Training Day, which also starred Denzel Washington. Denzel Washington plays a hitman who wants to lead a normal life, but after an innocent girl played by Chloe Grace Moretz ends up in the hospital by some Russian gangsters he decides to take matters in his own hands. We don't really know what Denzel did before he decided to live a normal life but from what I saw it looked like he was a hitman and I like how he portrayed the different personalities to this person. The movie was a little too long for my taste, because it focused on his vigilante personality while at the same time dealing with the Russian gangsters. But what I really enjoyed was how he goes to an ordinary innocent man to an assassin when people mess with the things he loves the most. He's not necessary lonely he likes helping people and he tries his best to leave his past behind and the concept of having someone go from innocent to hitman is very well acted by Denzel. But this is where the movie has its faults. For one thing Chloe Grace Moretz doesn't have a lot of screen time and I felt that they could've done so much more with this character so we could understand the pain and suffering she went through. The main antagonist is the other problem. He tries so hard to be scary and intimidating that it almost comes off as laughable because we've seen this happen in so many movies that he doesn't really give us anything to work with. This movie is more of a spy movie than a revenge movie as it is mostly a cat and mouse and also feels like a Hitman video game than anything else. So overall, I'm not saying that it's a bad movie, it was average with a protagonist that was likeable, but there were some pieces that didn't fit together and that's where it went wrong.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Liam Neeson found his match,"Quickie Review:Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is a law abiding citizen respected by all his peers. He has chosen to leave his dark and mysterious past behind to live a quiet life. However, when his friends are threatened by criminals and corrupt cops, Robert cannot sit idly by and takes matters into his own methodical hands. The Equalizer, is not deep in narrative or storytelling, but quite frankly it doesn't have to be. This is just a fun film where you just get to relax with your snacks and drinks to watch Denzel Washington kick rear-ends till the very end. If that's all you want and need, you'll be more than satisfied.Full Review:Let's be honest here, nobody is expecting an instant classic from this movie. As long as this movie delivered on the fun action, it did its job.Thankfully it was entirely Denzel Washington show and he killed it in his role while he killed the Russian mob. I tend to like the more methodical action heroes, people who give attention to the smallest detail for everything they do. You see that throughout the movie where Washington is thinking ahead and timing his moves perfectly. The fights are well shot too with little shaky cam and perfect sound to really make every punch or shot feel painful. The villain played by Marton Csokas was actually pretty good. They could've gone the generic villain route and this movie would still have worked, but Marton Csokas brought in just the right amount of unbalanced temper that he was big enough threat to care about.The Equalizer is not without faults. One in particular that kind of took me out of the movie was that there were way too many subplots within a short time span. This also made it feel longer than it should. Other than the main plot of the Russian mob, there were two or three other subplots where the Washington's character needs to intervene additional criminals and/or corrupt cops. These were supposed to show how loyal and honorable Robert is. Yet I feel, this could've been achieved through the main plot itself, making the overall movie a bit more concise.Overall, I enjoyed watching The Equalizer, I got exactly what I was looking for. Fans of movie such Taken, Dredd, or some fighting elements of Bourne Trilogy, will find it to be an entertaining time in the cinemas. Now let just have a cross-over with Taken to watch Denzel Washington and Liam Neeson duke it out!Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Don't expect too much excitement,"To be honest, Denzel Washington showed off a brilliant performance and his character is pretty good. Everything on the other hand was pretty mediocre, the action scenes were a bit boring, the plot was tiresome, and there wasn't much excitement until the last twenty minutes. Chloe-Grace Moretz did an okay job but she doesn't offer much screen time as I was hoping. There were many scenes throughout that simply didn't make much sense which took away the film's entertainment.The action scenes were not terrible but I believe they could have been done much better. The main character (Denzel Washington) fights off some of the Russian gangsters near the beginning and the fight looked rather unrealistic, especially when he drives that corkscrew through the guy's jaw. The final fight scene at the end, however, was pretty good and was a good end to the climax.I recommend this film to anyone who is a Denzel Washington fan.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Denzel does what he does best...,"I really enjoyed ""The Equalizer"". Denzel gives a fine performance as the cool-as-ice professional who sorts out the bad guys, and ""equalizes"" the equation. It's a role we've seen him do before in ""Man on Fire"", and he gives a seasoned performance again here. The action was well paced, and the story built nicely to a satisfying climax. Certainly the story was somewhat predictable, with the final outcome all but inevitable, but if you like films where good triumphs over evil, and does so violently (ala ""Taken (2008)"", ""Leon: The Professional (1994)), then this film will not disappoint. My only real criticism, and this is really nit-picking, was the song during the final credits. I'll say up front that I'm not an Eminem fan, but I found the lyrics distasteful and ""singing""irritating. Just my opinion, but it left an unfortunate final impression. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
good action movie,"This was a very good movie, but a little too long. The set-up was slow but I knew what was coming so was willing to wait it out. Denzel Washington's character is a former CIA-type who now lives alone and works at a home improvement store. We get to see a lot (maybe too much) of that store. Luckily, the action in this movie finally started and it eventually became explosive and non-stop. Very fun to watch! Many of the characters were pretty one-note, with the exception of the villain and Chloe Moretz as a prostitute. Those two were very good.

Same old but REALLY satisfying,"I love Denzel Washington. Unfortunately I wasn't impressed with some of his latest films (Safe House was a joke and Unstoppable was pretty horrific) but nevertheless they are always entertaining. I loved 2 Guns and I was really looking forward to this one; The Equalizer. It's definitely one of the better action films released in recent years.Some bad stuff: I really don't think Chloë Grace Moretz was suited for this role. Also, her relationship with Denzel was fake as hell.A lot of the film (all of it) was highly manipulative: Denzel is everybody's saviour, sad music at all the right moments (and there're a lot of them), waaay over the top slow motion usage etc.The bad guy was super cheesy although I do like the actor in other films.Good stuff: The action. The kill scenes are epic and although Denzel doesn't really pull off action scenes, it doesn't matter because they are filmed superbly.

Yes, it is the Hollywood version of a human with superhero skills. I guess it is simply too much to make a movie of just a normal guy or gal who gives to others.

"Super bloody, but still enjoyable","The Equalizer is a movie that I wanted to see because it was a movie that I wanted see because Denzel Washington was playing him and the director of Training Day, Antoine Fuqua, was directing it and the film was based on the 1980's television series of the same name.The film follows Robert McCall and he is a retired black ops government operative who lives in Boston, Massachusetts and works at a Home Mart hardware store, where he befriends many of his co-workers and also tries to help a security guard trainee Ralphie pass his qualification exam. He has promised his deceased wife that he would leave his old life behind, but is compelled to act after his teenage friend Teri, whose real name is Alina, was seen being mistreated by her pimp, Slavi and this leads into him seeking on the Russian Mafia. He then identifies himself as ""The Equalizer"".The film is a dream come true for me. When this came out, my mom got this movie for me on Bootleg, along with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", while my sister, Da'Quantria, got me ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and I liked both of those, but I also really like this film and it was so damn good.The plot is really amazing and it does not take me that many times for me to understand and the script writer of this film, Richard Wenk, did a really great job and it was spectacular and amazing to see and hear the dialogue was really amazing and so damn spectacular.The one major thing that bothers me and this is the reason why this movie appears on my Top 10 Overrated Movies list on IMDb on my profile is because some of the action scenes can get a lot bloody and violent in a few areas. I don't mind blood at all, but it's just that they use way too much blood in some of the action sequences in The Equalizer.The performances in this film as phenomenal in this film. Academy Award winner Denzel Washington is known for his superbad villain role in the 2001 film, Training Day, which he won the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal and that film is just beautiful and amazing and it is really cool to see him as a good guy, fighting against the Russians once again, after what the Russians did to him at the end of Training Day.Chloe Grace Moretz plays Arina / Teri and she does a great job after I watched her in ""Carrie"" and in ""DARK SHADOWS"", and she does two hell of a performances in those films and she's really nice here. Melissa Leo, despite my mixed feelings towards her in PRISONERS, I like her in this film. Her performance is incredible. Bill Pullman is in this film and does a really great job. Martin Csokas plays Teddy and he does a great job too, despite the amount of screen time that he has in the film, he does really great. The production values are amazing, especially the music and action sequences but like I said, the action sequences are way too bloody, gory and violent and I think it does not hurt my viewing experience. This is an R-rated film, so if you did not like blood and violence, don't watch it for all you sensitive kids, but for all you people who likes blood and violence in action movies or scary movies, or science-fiction or zombie movies, The Equalizer is definitely worth a watch.I give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars and the film is just really amazing and I have no problem watching this again and again. The film is just really amazing and Denzel Washington's performance is the best of his long time career and I encourage you to watch the film. You might get something out of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Denzel Washington. Need I say more? Okay I will:,"This is an obvious popcorn movie. It has some real flaws, some awful stinker decisions, but hey it's Denzel and he can and will save the day, and the movie.Overall I feel the acting was good by all involved, even if the scripting and dialogue wasn't exceptional. I didn't find the hardware store angle very mature, and those portions of the films suffer accordingly - but nothing against the acting. It was simply a weak premise. So I groaned and let it play out. Did I mention this movie has Denzel Washington?This movie takes a different road than many, in that the protagonist's past was far more secretive. It was not ""in your face"" about it, which I found refreshing. Denzel played the role perfectly as a quiet, calm, deep and mysterious good guy. With all sorts of... skills lol.The movie moves along very well, I never got bored. The bad guys were sufficient. Here there is everything a person could want in a movie like this. But there are some problems. It seems the director isn't much of a man's man and is painfully unaware of certain manly things. These irked me. Some of the situations were outright ridiculous, where about 99% of any other man would act and react differently. So there is some painful disconnect in some of the scenes in this regard.But my bottom line: I watched this twice, almost 10 years apart, and enjoyed it both times. At times this was a 5 Star movie, and at times it was a 2 Star movie. If you like this sort of thing, hero guy with a secretive ""skill set"" past, you should definitely watch. You will not waste your time or money. For me personally I simply cannot watch Denzel Washington and not love the role he plays. He is one of the great actors and you just love whoever it is he plays in his films. Sorry for being biased. No I'm not.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pleasantly Surprised...Spoilers,"First, let me just say that I was a big time fan of the television version of The Equalizer in the 80s but the only similarity is that the characters share the same name.Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall, a super organized and friendly loner that works in what appears to be a Home Depot type of store. His past, which is clearly working as a CIA operative who was believed killed, haunts him so he can't sleeps and spends his evening at a local coffee shop, reading and socializing with a very young attractive prostitute, Teri, played by Chloe Graze Moretz.After Teri is assaulted and hospitalized by her pimp, played by David Meunier - Justified fans will recognize him, McCall proceeds to go on a killing rampage which starts a war with a powerful Russian king pin.The story then follows a by the numbers action/kill fest that leads pretty much where you expect to go but what makes it work are excellent performances by everyone in the cast and the tight story telling. There is no chaff in this film and it does not pretend to be anything than what it is, a great way to spend a couple of hour being entertained and not thinking. If you are not a ""fan"" of pretty graphic violence you may want to avoid this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hoping for better from Denzel,"I am a great fan of Denzel Washington and really wish he made more movies, but this one I didn't enjoy. Yes his performance was good; he always is but the movie was nothing but one scene of stylized violence after another. I enjoy bad guys getting there due as much as anyone but sometimes it's just a little too much and frankly just ridiculous. Here you have two intelligent people couldn't they find something more interesting to do with Nikolai and Robert but this. Again Hollywood suffers from really terrible storytelling. It seems the only good storytellers are Disney and Dreamworks. Maybe Denzel should consider doing an animated movie or some Indie movies instead of this junk.

In turn, he sends in ex-Spetsnaz (Marton Csokas) to kill McCall.But in order to do that, the specialist must survive McCall's carefully orchestrated counterstrikes against him.Based on the '80s TV show, this take on the revenge-for-hire premise lacks character development and depth, but it makes up for both in stylish violence and restrained bravado.Plus, with the Russians out of the way, the Asian gangs can now move in.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

I often asked myself ""why is this happening right now, wouldn't something else make much more sense?""Though these two downsides were quite annoying, they are the only ones.The way the dialogues are written is really clever, especially the way Robert, the main character, is answering tricky questions is super cool.

"A thrilling, entertaining action thriller that's comparable or better than Taken","""...Brick by brick, dollar by dollar, body by body, I promised I wouldn't go back to being that person...But for you, I'm going to make an exception..."" This is what Denzel, being an absolute badass, says that to his enemy in a key scene of the film. Just when you think Liam Neeson was great as a lone-wolf action hero in Taken (2008), here comes Denzel Washington, upping the ante as McCall, the Equalizer. Yeah, I was completely sold by his performance.Based on the 1985 TV series of the same name, Denzel stars as McCall, a retired man with a shady past, armed with a formidable set of skills like no other, chose to work at a Home Depot hardware store and lives a quiet, peaceful life. However, he soon discovers all the injustice that are happening around the neighbourhood and decides to take matters into his own hands to 'equalize' the situation by helping the helpless.First and foremost, I couldn't provide any comparisons with the old TV series as I've never watched any of the episodes before. Similar to Taken (2008) or Man On Fire (2004), I don't deny the fact that the film has a preposterous premise. One guy against the entire mob? Seriously? However, despite its silliness, Denzel Washington - a two-time Academy Award winner with numerous bad-ass roles in the past such as Man on Fire (2004), The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009), The Book of Eli (2010) and Unstoppable (2010), managed to deliver a strong, convincing performance with some very catchy, powerful punchlines that actually makes the viewers believe that he's the guy who is really capable of taking down the entire Russian mafia on his own. He owns the character and makes the character come to life on screen.Aside from that, we get to know him just from his expressions when his personal background is briefly mentioned in the film. Although the film relies on a few plot contrivances for it to work (typical issue for most action thrillers) and it also includes the much overused 'walk-away' explosion scene again, but Denzel just look so bad-ass whenever he fights on screen that I willing to overlook some of its flaws.On the other hand, Marton Csokas did a great job in his portrayal of Teddy/Nikolai, the intimidating and menacing Russian mob fixer who's sent by the mob to deal with the situation. There's one particular disturbing scene in which he slowly circles a terror-stricken prostitute while comforting and reassuring her that it's going to be okay before leading her to an inevitable fate. Chloë Grace Moretz did a fine job as Teri as well. It's such a shame that she was taken off screen rather early in the film, only to reappear again in the final moments.The film gives a satisfying climax and the action is well choreographed. Another notable mention is that the film contains a lot of bloody and gory violence. If some viewers feel uncomfortable with on-screen gruesome violent fights, then in that case it's probably not advisable to watch this film. However, please keep in mind that these people (the mafia characters the actors portrayed) are not considered as humans, but merciless scumbags. They treat women as nothing other than sexual objects for money, willing to kill anyone without hesitation or remorse, thinking they're high and mighty and forcibly exert authority and influence over others. In the film, McCall gave them a choice beforehand, but they choose to belittle him instead. So, violence was necessary and they've got exactly what they deserve. To be honest, I don't feel sorry for them at all.Overall, the film exceeds all my expectations. The film delivers, in spades. I expect Denzel Washington to kick some criminal ass and I've gotten more than I bargained for. Gruesome and brutal, but highly rewarding. Revenge is a dish best served cold. Highly recommended!Rating: 8.5/10http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/09/movie-review-equalizer.html""One day someone does something unspeakable to someone you hardly knew, so you do something about it because no one else is going to...Because you can.""",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

I really don't see how can others say this is not a good movie! Maybe it's not a NEW thing but it's very well made! I read that this movie is not good because the age os the main star! common? really? what else but not a experienced trained operative?I can say that if you see it you will not regret the time!

Great action thriller,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Equalizer"" (2014) is a very well made action thriller. Acting was solid, directing, script are the first rate. The picture is superbly paced - at 2 hours running time it never drags or gets boring. The movie kinda surprised me whit it's plot, i guest it the other way around at the beginning of the film, but i was surprised. It's R rated so don't be surprised that it's violence is on screen - it would have been impossible for this movie to have other more soft rating - violence (but not gore) perfectly fits this brutal, dark and gritty world.Overall, ""The Equalizer"" is first rate picture that every action thriller fan should not be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Overrated,"Visually appealing yet remarkably devoid of content and vitality. But that's what a Hollywood ""action potboiler"" is supposed to be all about, isn't it? I'm not sure what I was expecting, and yes, I'll have to reflect on that, but ridiculously slicing-and-dicing and hole punching and barbwire garroting, etc., the generic Russian prison tattooed bad guys in the local hardware warehouse left me cold and annoyed I'd shelled out the price of a ticket. I wonder how it would have played if he'd worked at Dunkin' Donuts? Admittedly, the bad guy was venal and repulsive, just another ""thug doing his job"" (trained on the streets of Grozny?) when no one else on the oligarch's staff can get the job done - and he got his just desserts. Yay! And the reformed teenager finding him on the street at the end to thank him? You're kidding, right?",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Entertaining,"I never had a chance to watch this movie but when I today I finally watched it.It's pure entertaining action drama which gives you John Wick type vibes. I'm not comparing the movies, both are good in their own style. The story was simple and effective, the screenplay was good but little bit loose, the direction was good and the performances were aldo good especially Denzel's.The climax fighting sequence could have been shortened as it felt a little bit stretched to me and giving the final villian such a short time and killing him so instantly was the shortcoming.Overall, I enjoyed the movie and you should definitely give this movie a try.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mix between action and drama,"How ""The Equalizer"" became one of the greatest modern action sagas should surprise no one. The film, by investigating the dual morality of the main character, turns this film into a crossroads of what is or how to reach the most positive conclusion for the greatest number of people. The plot from the first minute focuses on exploring the personality of Robert, an apparently positive man with the moral action of helping whoever is in front of him, but with a disconnection from the world in which he currently lives, not really feeling like he belongs. Nowhere, neither with his co-workers nor with himself, being more a remembrance of what he was more of who he is today, having an apparent connection with Teri, both seem to get along so well because of the limbo in which his life finds himself. , they are so different but with the same uncertainty about their lives, they are aware that they are not happy where they are currently, but they know that they cannot get out of there, it is the most they can aspire to, while Teri faces it in a more gray, Robert sees it as the possibility of having a connection with a group of people, since without that work he would have no purpose. Being a reminder for me of how three-dimensional people are, not being a cliché in their profession or in their actions with others, each person has a double face that they do not expose to everyone. Something that I really liked about this film is how they do not glorify violence, it is more the driver of such an extremist resolution to which they have pushed the character, since Robert moves and justifies himself in using said violence for a greater good. That directly affects other people and not only himself. Teri's apparent kidnapping by the Russian mafia is what forces him to come out of ""retirement"" and return to being a ""vigilante""; having an amoral dilemma in his actions, not being governed by the actions he does but by the results achieved, not acting violently for himself, but to help others which in a certain way for me makes him a modern ""Robin Hood"" ; having a ""clemency"" to whom he faces, since in his construction he always provides a second option before dispensing justice, either with the police that makes them choose to return the money to those who had been asking for a bribe, or with Frank to who gives him the option to turn himself in even if it ruins his career as a police officer. The confrontation between him and the Russian mafia being the only way to regain his personal ""freedom"", since they interfered with Robert's close circle, this film being more than a story of revenge. The message, how I perceive it, is that having a group of people around you makes you get up every day since a person without anyone around him will hardly have motivations in his life. Whether in the first act when Robert helps Ralphie become a security guard, or in the third act when he has to risk everything to save his companions from his personal feud with the mafia; Closing this subdialogue is how Ralphie returns to help Robert, even if it is an apparently suicidal mission, supporting and helping others almost never goes unnoticed.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

FFS Denzel!! Why?,"NOT a remake of the great 80' series starring the imperious Edward Woodward. With that out of the way, I will begin.. Denzel plays a man living a fruitless existence, trapped in his thoughts of a shadowy and chequered past. So far so good as Denzel appears to have slipped back into the acting mode which has been sadly missing for so many years. A brooding and thoughtful performance some might say. I'm really beginning to enjoy myself at this stage. BANG!!!! I really cannot begin to explain my disappointment as Denzel suddenly descends into killing mode. How many ways can a human being kill another human being( lots). Typical formulaic Hollywood crap ensues. None of the action is even remotely original! A total bore fest for the remaining 90 mins, leaves me clambering for the exit as the end credits being to roll.All In all this has been done before and to far greater effect in Taken. At least Taken doesn't pretend to be something it isn't .",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
"This IS Denzel's ""BadAss"" Character","Denzel is awesome in anything he does. He's a great man and a great person as well. He does so much good in this fallen world to help others and he speaks out against the stupidity all around us in an intelligent and concise way. His acting is superb. In this first outing as his new character ""the equalizer"" we have Denzel at his badass best as a conscientious but very meticulous genius of a type of vigilante but not, he's gives all his ""victims"" a chance to do the right thing, but of course due to the pride of most evil people, they don't and they face the consequences of their own actions. On this first outing he saves a young Russian girl from the Russian mob in various ways, while also dealing out justice for a few innocent victims. It's too bad we don't have a real person like this. Great plot, action and a bit violent and gory, not for the squeamish or small kids. Can't wait for number two. This franchise will last like mission impossible if they don't screw things up in the sequels.no nudity, or questionable content.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of Denzel Washington's best action movies,"In the film Denzel Washington plays a retired spy called Robert McCall who now works in a hardware store and in his spare time he helps various people. Theain person he helps in this film is his friend, Elena, who has been forced into a world of prostitution and one of her clients beats her up. After seeing Elena at the hospital Robert goes on a revenge spree and starts taking down the whole gang of drug dealers and pimps that Elena has got involved with. Whilst Robert is taking down these bad guys there are plenty of fighting scenes where he kills the drug dealers in a stylish but some of these scenes are over a bit too fast.There is also one scene where one of the cashier's in his store is robbed and instead of showing a fight scene it just show him buying the hammer and then cleaning it the morning after.The last fight scene is by far the best part because Robert fights against the last few bad guys and kills them in gory ways. Also during this scene some of the bad guys are hard to kill and you feel like Robert has met his match.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""I don't have a lot of time. Which means you don't have any.""","FILM: 8/10.Who needs Batman when you've got a senior citizen who works at the local hardware store? No one apparently, if The Equalizer has anything to say about it!Denzel Washington steps into the role of Robert McCall, a calm and collected employee at a hardware store by day, and a righteous vigilante by night. It's a premise that might remind you of certain other action heroes (*cough* John Wick *cough*), but it's worth noting that McCall was doling out justice a month before Mr. Wick even stepped onto the scene.Washington and director Antoine Fuqua do an outstanding job in developing McCall's character. It's a calculated development, making sure that even though he's out for vengeance, you're rooting for him all the time. He's such a nice guy when he isn't taking out bad guys, and Washington's performance gives McCall a depth that's truly engaging.Sure, it's not exactly a novel story - the lone hero seeking revenge against the Russian bad guys - but damn, is it entertaining. The action sequences are intense, and McCall's methodical approach to taking down his adversaries is both satisfying and mesmerizing to watch.The pacing keeps you engaged, and the supporting cast, including Chloë Grace Moretz as Teri, adds to the overall appeal. The chemistry between McCall and Teri brings an emotional layer to the film that elevates it beyond your typical action flick.Overall, The Equalizer might not reinvent the wheel when it comes to its plot, but it doesn't need to. With Denzel Washington in the driver's seat and Antoine Fuqua at the helm, it's a thrilling ride from start to finish. If you're looking for a well-executed action movie with a character you can genuinely invest in, give this one a shot.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 10/10.1080p presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10/10.DTS-HD MA 7.1 audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Much More Enjoyable than I Expected,","The Equalizer is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It ended up a lot better than I expected, I'll watch anything with Denzel Washington, but this appeared very cliché and typical from its trailers, offering nothing interesting or new material for moviegoers. While it may not have the most original set up and storyline, it makes up for it with a dazzling performance from Washington and Antoine Fuqua's cool and slick directing style, this saves it from being a boring movie. It's a very good franchise vehicle for Washington, he owns this role, his character has many flaws which manage to make the character more likable and help us symphatize with him more, but there is still a lot to learn about Robert McCall which future sequels could answer. It has its flaws, but the Equalizer mostly makes up for it by being a generally enjoyable movie, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or thriller.A man who decides to put his dark past behind him must jump back in to action to save a young girl who is under the control of Russian gangsters.Best Performance: Denzel Washington Worst Performance: Bill Pullman",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Violent... and monotonous!,"Don't get me wrong, i love Denzel Washington. I love every action flick he plays in 'cause he brought such charisma on the big screen. This one is an exception. I was ready to get pumped up by all the gore galore and crazy fight choreographs... and it's not what i am expecting, at all!The story is about a man named Bob McCall, a mysterious man i might add, who stumbles upon the world of Russian gangster. He met a girl named Teri, who is one of their prostitute, that one day got beaten. Bob got furious and goes for vengeance against them.The movie got me all right, but i've never been so bored in my life. Let's start from the action. It didn't work. It supposed to give me any impact, yet i felt nothing. Blood are spurting everywhere, all right. But, why do they have to make it so bland?The actors done all their things the script requires... nothing evoked emotions from me. I blame the screenwriters for giving no depth and not a single twist. Bad move!Although, there are several things i'm going to highlight, like the camera-work. I loved Antoine Fuqua's style and it gives the movie more dignity than it was. And some scene involving Chlöe Grace Moretz with Denzel gave me a little bit interest for the dynamic they showed.I know Denzel Washington fans are going to love it, but just a fair warning; it's not really fun to watch even if the violence pushes your button. In the end, it's a bit of a dud.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Equalizer has no chill,"I'm giving this movie many stars because I love justice 😎 After hearing how fantastic this is so many times, I finally got around to seeing it!In this film, Denzel is outstanding and demonstrates his fierce side. This movie is great if you want to watch a pure action thriller. It's the ideal movie for a hangover on a Saturday night. This is not the movie you should see if you're seeking nirvana or enlightenment. This is a film about an eye for an eye kicking your butt two hour lenght.You are captivated from the first scene to the very end, and it's never too late to appreciate a great thriller.

The Equalizer for sure has it's own problem but it's just doesn't change the fact that it's just fun and entertaining all the time,"In my country (Thailand) it's pretty bad luck for The Equalizer to hit the Cinema when John Wick a very success action movie staring Keanu Reeves just came out last week because of that it's just make everyone compare The Equalizer to John Wick instantly and that's pretty unfortunate for The Equalizer.The problem that The Equalizer has but John Wick does not is John Wick is a Action movie that know it self really well , it doesn't try to be anything else other than an fully action kicking-ass movie but The Equalizer just trying and push the script and it's dramatic too hard despite the script is not actually that good or even that much interesting and with the slow style of storytelling by Antoine Fuqua the director of this movie it's just make it even worst because not only the plot is not interesting and you don't really care it that much the movie just force you to eat it anyway and very slowly too and that's make the first half of this movie fells boring.BUT... when the first half is actually over and Denzel Washington goes to kicking someone the movie just come back to the right track instantly , the action scene is pretty good and really entertaining but it's more like a close combat rather than shoot everything in John Wick but i personally like the action scene in The Equalizer more.Denzel Washington himself again really bad-ass in this movie with his cold brutal meaning style of acting makes this movie really fun to watch , there's also Chloe Grace Moretz in this movie she's pretty good in it but unfortunately the role she got just really not good enough so she's not that memorable as she should be but despite characters she doing pretty good in this movie.Overall The Equalizer is still a really fun bad-ass action movie staring Denzel Washington it has it's own problem for sure and a Huge problem too but that doesn't change the fact that the movie is fun and entertaining to watch a lot .",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
What was Denzel thinking...|?,"I don't mind rubbish, if it's entertaining rubbish. I don't even mind lazy film making, if it's at least on a par with other cheap entertainments... but this is garbage.I'm especially disappointed that Denzel Washington was in this. Indeed, I feel sorry for all the other actors (jobbing or otherwise) who clearly did their best... with this cheap imitation of a film.My general 'rule of thumb' for a bad movie, is that I could have written it. In this case... I could have written this when I was 7 years old.'Formulaic'. 'Robotic'. 'Unimaginative'. As exciting as unwrapping a new toilet roll.All I wanted was a half decent movie that delighted me with feelings of revenge, justice and juvenile type pleasing violence. Instead... I got pretentious posing, a ludicrous 'set up'... and enough clichés to last me a lifetime.Denzel Washington is far better than this turkey.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Almost as good as Goodfellas, La Femme Nikita, or the Usual Suspects","I love Denzel Washington's work. Again in this film, his work is satisfyingThis story, though common, was interesting, and the make-up was excellent.Some of the shots were too soft for the hardened criminals that were to be depicted, however. I particularly don't agree with shooting older men from below. Seeing a witty Denzel is more interesting than seeing a puffy Denzel. Everyone looks puffy being shot from below, unless they are rail thin and/or under the age of 25. It would have been o.k. to just shoot the young people from below, and the older people at eye level, or above to make it more dramatic.The one scene that I did not like was the tanker being blown up, as it was the same scene from the Usual Suspects. The same everything -- slow mo walking, blowing up in the background someone young probably directed this and didn't see that movie, or they quoted it.In any case, it was still a very interesting, good film that is worth watching. My favorite part was that Denzel won again! I like that about him.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
