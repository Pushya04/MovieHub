This movie is titled wrong,"This is my first review. Not because I feel the movie was exceptionally good or bad, but because I feel like critics and reviewers appear to miss the main objective of this story.Complaints about a lack of context are all over the place. The officers' motives & the real reason for the riots in general; those 2 aspects seem to iritate people greatly. Although I have to agree that these could have been worked out better, I don't feel like this was the movie's purpose. The story doesn't want to go too deep into the whole civil war that was going on in those times. It doesn't need to tell the story of how corrupt & unjust the force of law was back then. There are more recorded cases, movies, series & songs then we care to admit that factualize these terrible times.
It simply serves as a base for a much more personal, much deeper story concerning that specific night and that specific place.This movie is not about Detroit, or the riots. It's about what happened to those people in that motel in those couple hours. It's an emotional rollercoaster and a look in the minds of the victims as they went through hell and back. And once you realise this you'll find this is an excellent motion picture, with good acting, solid writing and directing and the capability of leaving you feeling empty, powerless and even ashamed.That, to me, is a great movie.

What Happened...Not Why It Happened,"The poster of Annapurna's newest film, Detroit hangs at my local theater like a provocation. A thin blue line of police officers struggles to hold back angry black protesters as big bold letters are scrawled along the side. The tagline reads: ""It's time we knew."" Those words, along with the required ""from the creators of..."" accolades are the only things on the poster that aren't sideways.They might as well be though, considering the 1967 Detroit riot is about the only thing about Detroit most Americans know. And I'm sad to report that while the film does a good job of filling the screen with a few powerful moments, it never provides much insight into the ""untold"" story of the Motor City or how its story fits into the larger context of modern racial relations.After an awkward Jacob Lawrence inspired history of the Great Migration, the film captures the precipitating actions of police that turned the city's long sitting racial resentments into a lit tinderbox. In a hybrid of dramatization and archival footage, Detroit then glosses over the actions taken by the state to subdue tensions before setting its sights on a host of singular stories. It becomes high noon at the Algiers Motel where unarmed black teens face off against white police and National Guardsmen. Then comes the trial.All of these events could have been their own movies and delved into deeper depths as to the cause, devastation, aftermath and public perception of what was later dubbed the black days of July. Yet because Mark Boal's screenplay is so laser-focused on documented events and momentary minutia, everything is squished into an off-kilter collage of well-meaning but superficial docudrama. One whose central story, the Algiers Motel incident, is treated more like a genre horror film than either a granular traumatic event or police brutality in microcosm.Detroit basically pulls a Dunkirk (2017), building unbelievable tension while giving us the bear minimum in character. It's all about the situation and the situation only. The recreation of which is beyond reproach. However, Detroit's grand design creates a narrative dissonance. One in which the individual experiences of real people just don't translate all that well.The problem is compounded further by Barry Ackroyd's unvarnished cinematography which cuts between extreme closeups of wounded faces, voyeuristic overheads and wide shots of crowds angrily gathering in the streets. The lack of establishing shots, aerials, use of recognizable landmarks etc. hammers home the idea that something like this can happen anywhere. But the question, why can it happen anywhere, remains illusive up until we here the words ""police criminality should be treated the same as criminality."" By then it's too little too late.Luckily director Kathryn Bigelow is very adept at inserting humanity within the margins saving Detroit from being just another Patriot's Day (2016). She finds a particularly redemptive subject in Algee Smith as up-and-coming Motown singer Larry Reed. The young actor displays an emotional intelligence well beyond his years, formulating a character that starts out with youthful swagger, ends with a shaken core, putting you in his head-space at all points in-between. Additionally, while most of the films attempts to color opposing forces with shades of grey fall flat, Reed's arc feels tragic but sadly understandable given the circumstance.Unfortunately for both Bigelow and the city of Detroit, Detroit's script casts too wide a net to be especially impacting. It's procedural approach stifles the emotional stakes and its over-arching theme is turned in with much less humanity and passion than is deserved. Even with a towering performance by Algee, and the inclusion of Will Poulter who plays menacing/in-over-his-head real well, Detroit just can't transcends its trappings. To add insult to injury, the film itself was shot primarily in Boston...so there's that...",7.0,Anonymous,History
Nails the What But Leaves Out the Why,"Director Katheryn Bigelow does a wonderful job of creating a great deal of tension. She does so by cutting from one tightly framed slightly wobbly shot to the next. Each character's face floods nearly the entire screen after each of these cuts. This makes the movie deeply personal and almost claustrophobic at times. The slight wobbles of the camera as it focuses on a face, adds to the uneasiness and unstable nature of the situation.What I'm saying is the movie is expertly directed. That's evident early on and remains that way throughout. The issue holding this movie back from becoming one of serious best picture caliber is the writing. The story felt a bit underdeveloped.The brief on-screen text explanation of the tension between the Detroit Police and the city's black residents could have served as a helpful addition to a setup that followed in the movie. I would have had no problem with that. But after the movie plays for 20 minutes or so, I realized that the text was the sole source of setup.That's a classic case of telling instead of showing. Movies are a video medium. Use that. Don't casually display the text on screen. This choice may have been made for the sake of time, but I think the filmmakers would have been wise to focus more on the setup aspect. The text explanation felt like an inconsiderate means of storytelling.After the opening text, the movie meanders for a while, eventually introducing the key characters and providing an appetizer of their personalities, foreshadowing their upcoming behavior.Moments like these showcased strengths in the writing. The writing did not completely ruin the movie; it simply was not an Oscar-contending performance, like Bigelow's work.The movie overall is well made, thanks in large part to Bigelow's deft direction, but it's not without flaws. One that I already mentioned is that I wanted the actual movie (not solely text) to better set the stage of this city that's on the verge of riot.The second criticism ties into the first. Because of the lack of stage setting, this becomes a movie that expertly depicts the what, but fails to fully deliver on the why.I see the riots. I see the emotional toll that police misconduct had on the abused citizens. I see the guilt that certain uniformed personnel felt for standing by and allowing the abuse to take place. What I didn't see enough of is why all this happened. I wanted a more personal detailing of what led up to the night shown in the movie. The actions are clear and powerful, but the motivations are vague and weak.I came away from the movie wondering what message the filmmakers hoped to convey. While the title is Detroit, the story has a much narrower focus. Were the clear majority of Detroit City Police Officers upstanding in their behavior, with only a few tragic bad apples? Given the choice focus on only a few officers and a select group of citizens, should I assume that these officers' misconduct was the norm or the exception?Perhaps it was not the filmmakers' intent to answer these questions. Maybe they only wanted to tell this specific story, without greater implications, which is fine. I just personally wanted to see a broader depiction of the city's atmosphere leading up to, during, and following the riots.",7.0,Anonymous,History
No Redaction Will Be Allowed,"The facts, not alternative facts but the facts. Once you have that then the artist comes and tells us, dramatizes, enlightens without distorting the facts.

Great Filmmaking with a Point Of View,"Unless you believe the Black Lives Matters movement has unanimous appeal, do not expect the reviews of Kathryn Bigelow's ""Detroit"" to garner universal praise. By no means does this movie play it safe and, for that reason, it does not seek or expect mass appeal. I suspect that the film will unleash fierce critics of ""Hollywood Liberal Bias"" and generate howls from those who want to remind us that most cops really are good as well as others who are equally vocal and can't stomach seeing more non-threatening citizens brutally murdered by policemen of a different stripe.""Detroit"" is a movie that is set in 1967 but it is a statement about the type of policing that continues to occur far too frequently in many African American communities. Just as it is not possible to talk about the recent events in Ferguson, NYC, Minneapolis,Baltimore, Chicago, Charleston, Cleveland etc., etc. without expressing a particular point of view, ""Detroit"" will also reveal many pf our biases as we process the portrayal of the searing events as they may have occurred at the Algiers Motel in the midst of a race riot.""Detroit"" will also force us to talk about our preferences for films that move and disturb us over those that simply entertain and the amount of ""historical accuracy"" we expect to see in non- documentaries that are set in earlier times.Bigelow shoots the movie with an unflinching eye and her point of view is obvious. She errs on the side of the cringe worthy and outrageous when depicting evil and the actors are committed, inspired and superbly directed.""Detroit"" is a film that is as difficult to watch as any two hour merciless tragedy involving people we know and care about and it is deeply stirring as it incites (if not assaults) our emotions. This is a stunning film but well crafted art, like our own reflections in the finest of mirrors, isn't always pretty.""Detroit"" intends to upset, provoke and unsettle and, by that account, it is an unmitigated success.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Taut Yet Overlong Drama,"Detroit is the latest addition to Kathryn Bigelow's lengthy filmography and it is the most Bigelow-esque film you'd come to expect from her. The film displays raw realism with the actors looking very real and naked from their famous personas. The story is jam packed and while I think this source material would have made a much better miniseries, Bigelow makes the story work with sacrificing some facts for the sake of cinema. The big question is: is it as good as the critics say it is? The answer: No. Not Close. But with that being said, it is a damn good movie that is definitely worth seeing.Telling the story of three murdered African American men in a motel in Detroit during the city's infamous riots and civil rights movement, Detroit stars an all star cast that is certainly better on paper than they are in this film. John Boyega, Will Poulter, Jason Mitchell, Anthony Mackie, John Krasinski, and on and on-but none of them are really served as a main character. Bigelow is so determined on telling the facts of the case that she sacrifices good performances in order to give us a slice of reality. The film plays out like the most expensive reenactment of a tragedy on Investigation Discovery and, when looking at the facts of the case, this is the best compliment I can give the film. It sounds back handed but it is extremely informative even if it is picking a side in all of it. The one thing Bigelow does best is showing a true story like it is unfolding in front of you. She does it brilliantly in The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, but Detroit is where it is to a fault.With a 140-plus minute running time and a gaggle of characters to keep track of, the story is just too big for a feature film and requires patience. Despite this, Kathryn Bigelow does her best to tame Mark Boal's bloated script to a digestible film and the results are mostly good. The performances from the actors are real, raw and authentic in every aspect but never enough to burst off the screen. Bigelow lets the events unfold and do that for them. Overall, Detroit is certainly a good film in need of an audience just a very patient one.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Intense, emotional and a must watch.",This movie has a very intense pace. It's a story who had to be told and I believe that Directress Bigelow does it very well. In every frame there is something interesting going on and some kind of challenge. This gives a special feeling of how terrible things were at the time. I just have some trouble with the characters depth because it never really fleshes out the characters. Also some characters appear in a certain cliché way. You care and feel for them through the visual atrocities and because of the rejection of racism but not because you like the character on an emotional level. If you want to see a movie with a point of view and want to be emotionally moved then this is for you.,8.0,Anonymous,History
"Bigelow is good at making a thriller, but not a drama","Kathryn Bigelow is known for her documentary-style camera-work and the creation of an intense atmosphere. This can be seen, either from the early work like Near Dark and Point Break, or from her more recent films such as The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty. In one word, she is a good director for thrillers.But Detroit is not a pure thriller. It is more like a period drama. On the one hand, the interrogation in the motel is the thriller part of the film, and without any doubt, it is brilliant. The audience keep wondering what would happen next. On the other hand, the film as a whole is mediocre in story-telling and character development. The setup for the interrogation is unnecessarily too long. Also, the courtroom process after the interrogation is too short. For more than once, Bigelow just simply displays lots of texts on the screen to make up for her unbalanced story-telling. John Boyega's character could have been the most impressive because he is the most struggling one in conscience. Yet it turns out to be untrue due to the limited time and space given to the character.Overall speaking, Detroit could have been a thought-provoking classic, but it lacks depth in the end. There is no deeper discussion on the cause of the injustice or the impact it is could bring to real life. One real classic period drama is Spielberg's Schindler's List. In this aspect, Bigelow is still one step away from being a great director.One more thing, Will Poulter deserves a nomination for Oscar best supporting actor, whose performance is the key to the success of the thriller part.",,Anonymous,History
Even more disturbing than I imagined,"This film tells the story of a night going desperately wrong in Detroit.I knew the film would be disturbing, so I have put off watching it. And it is really disturbing. I feel so so sorry for the residents of the hotel. No one deserves to be treated like this. This film shows me just how it is to be an ethnic minority in Detroit at the time. The injustice is just shocking. I sympathise with the victims, and really wish that justice could prevail.",,Anonymous,History
True story suspense drama that is entertaining enough,"It's 1967, and rioting and looting has broken out in the city of Detroit, with buildings being burned and shots being fired. The situation has progressed to the point that National Guard troops have been mobilized in the streets, and no one is safe. It's with this setting that the main story unfolds when shots are reported fired from a hotel, and police and troops converge on the building, leading to tense situation that leaves several people dead. The cast includes John Boyega as a black, uniformed security guard who gets swept up in events; Will Poulter as the leader of a trio of beat cops who take things too far; Algee Smith as an aspiring pop singer who has the misfortune of checking into the hotel; Anthony Mackie as a recently discharged Army veteran.This seemed like the kind of film to ignite a firestorm of controversy, with its setting of racial unrest and us-vs-them police misconduct coming on the heels of the recent incidents across the country, from Ferguson to Baltimore. Maybe people were exhausted from the news, or perhaps other current event spectacles rendered past injustices as moot points, whatever the reason, the film flopped at the box office although the critics enjoyed it. I liked it as well, but not as much as they did. Bigelow and Boal previously collaborated on the superior The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty. They attempt a ""you are there"" cinema verite style that uses a lot of handheld camera and very little gloss or overly stylish cinematic tricks. They also made the wise decision to cast relative unknowns so as not to distract from the story, with the biggest names in the cast (Mackie and Krasinski) in lesser roles.There's quite a bit of build up before the movie gets to its main focus, but that may have been necessary to explain the actions of those involved when things finally hit the fan. Running just under 2 and a half hours, I found it a bit over long, and could have seen at least 15 minutes trimmed away. The performances are good for the most part, but I'm not too fond of Poulter. This isn't a bad movie at all, but it is hardly a stand-out in Bigelow's catalog of films.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting and intense from the opening scene until the last.,"'DETROIT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new crime drama based on the racially charged Algiers Motel incident, during the 1967 12th Street riot in Detroit (the film was released to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the horrific incident). The movie was directed by Kathryn Bigelow, and it was written by acclaimed journalist/screenwriter Mark Boal (the duo also performed the same duties on both 2008's Best Picture winner 'THE HURT LOCKER', and 2012's Best Picture nominee 'ZERO DARK THIRTY'). The film stars John Boyega, Will Poulter, Algee Smith, Jason Mitchell, Jacob Latimore, Hannah Murray, Kaitlyn Dever, Jack Reynor, Ben O'Toole, John Krasinski and Anthony Mackie (who also costarred in 'THE HURT LOCKER'). It's received almost unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's also a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I found it to be extremely well made and involving.The film begins with a police raid of a private party, in 1967 Detroit, which then resulted in multiple days of rioting. The story then centers on a police raid of the Algiers Motel, on July 25th, where police believed a sniper fired on them from. The raid resulted in the terrorizing of several black suspects, and two white women, and the deaths of some of those involved. The story then shifts to the court room battle that followed the incident.The movie is interesting, and pretty intense, from pretty much the opening scene until the last. All of the performances are good in it as well, and of course Bigelow's direction is almost flawless. For me the film was also very educational, as I knew very little about these events in history (prior to seeing the movie). I think the film is yet another great example of what a talented filmmaker Bigelow is, and obviously her and Boal make a great team together too. It's also cool to see Boyega in another strong starring role; a 'STAR WARS' actor that's actually making a name for himself (outside of the franchise) is always good to see.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/W6So6Kz52VQ",9.0,Anonymous,History
"enlightening, but frustrating","Long before the 1992 L.A. riots that were sparked by the Rodney King verdict, in 1967, the city of Detroit endured riots depicted in the historical crime drama ""Detroit"" (R, 2:23). The two uprisings were separated by a quarter century, but the underlying causes and results were very similar. Back in 1943, in the middle of World War II, Detroit had previously been the scene of major rioting. Those two Detroit uprisings were separated by nearly a quarter century, but the underlying causes and results were very similar. The riots of '43 were an expression of frustration by the black community over poor economic conditions and abusive treatment by police. Some of the police committed additional abuses while trying to put down the riots, while some of the rioters took advantage of the chaotic situation to loot business, destroy buildings and harm people who had nothing to do with the problems in their communities. 24 years later, many of the same conditions and frustrations still existed in Detroit's black communities and in July 1967, in the middle of the Vietnam War, tensions boiled over again, with similar results. Almost exactly 50 years after those riots, Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow (""The Hurt Locker"") chronicles what happened during that week in Detroit and, in particular, tries to clarify the still somewhat murky story of what took place on the night of July 25-26 at a motel called the Algiers.In 1967, Detroit's inner city was a tinderbox of racial tension and social unrest, needing only a spark to make it explode. This film starts by showing the incident that provided that spark – and depicts the explosion that followed. Late Saturday night / early Sunday morning, July 23, 1967, police raided an unlicensed drinking establishment on 12th Street. The police, who were almost all white, arrested everyone who was in the club, all of whom were black. A crowd gathered outside began harassing the police and throwing things, forcing the police to withdraw as soon as their raid was complete. Emotions were running high and the crowd began looting nearby stores, beginning what turned out to be about five days of riots. Police tried to restore order, but weren't supposed to shoot looters, although that's exactly what we police officer Phillip Krauss (Will Poulter) do. As the violence continued, public events were being cancelled, such as a concert where the up and coming singing group The Dramatics was just about to take the stage. Instead, the guys hopped a bus and tried to make it home, but the chaos of the ongoing rioting led them to take refuge in The Algiers. Very close to that motel was black security guard Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega) who got called in to help protect his boss' grocery store from looters. Dismukes makes nice with the National Guard troops who take up a position across the street by bringing them coffee and chatting them up. And so the stage is set for the Algiers Motel Incident.The Algiers was filling up fast with people seeking safety from the ongoing riots. Almost all of the Algiers' guests were black, but there were two 18-year-old white girls there (Kaitlyn Dever and Hannah Murray), visiting from Ohio. They are approached by one of the guys from the Dramatics, ""Cleveland"" Larry Reed (Algee Smith) and his friend, Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore) and the four of them get friendly, hanging out by the motel pool. Later, they go up to the room of Carl Cooper (Jason Mitchell), where there is a small party going on. As Cooper is messing around with one of his friends, he fires off a starter pistol that others think is a real gun. Soon, the sound catches the attention of people outside who now think there is a sniper shooting from the Algiers. National Guard troops, Michigan State Police and Detroit police, led by officer Krauss swarm the hotel, some of them literally shooting first and asking questions later. Dismukes ends at the Algiers too, but Krauss takes the lead. He and his fellow cops spend the rest of the night terrorizing, threatening, abusing and eventually killing motel guests, at first trying to find out who the ""sniper"" is and, later, covering their tracks when things get out of hand. Krauss struggles to orchestrate and continue the cover-up as he, two other officers and Dismukes stand trial for murder.""Detroit"" is a strong and valuable dramatization of historical events, but falls short of its true potential. As Bigelow directs the script by Mark Boal (with whom she also collaborated on ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty""), she tries to do too much. She shows scenes of the 12 Street Riot without really setting up the vital historical context or effectively portraying its development. When she gets to what she really wants to focus on, the Algiers Motel Incident, she allows to hang over those scenes the question as to why the people who knew that Cooper only had a starter pistol never said so while the police were brutally interrogating them. And then the courtroom scenes are so short and tightly edited, that they don't really tell us much. By trying to tell two stories – the general story of the riots – and the specific story of the Algiers and its aftermath, the film doesn't tell either of them especially well. However, Bigelow does present images of 1967 Detroit that look so authentic, you'll almost think you're actually there, and she gets excellent performances from all of her actors, regardless of their varying levels of experience. The two main things Movie Fans will learn from this movie regarding race relations in America (especially with stories like this one regularly echoing in the news) are how far we've come, and far we have yet to go. To be sure, both are important lessons, but ""Detroit"" could have accomplished so much more. ""B""",6.0,Anonymous,History
Great movie,"This movie grabbed me from the very beginning. I completely lost myself in the portrayal of events...scared ...shocked...angered. There are many critics of this film that claim its not ""historically accurate."" Baloney!! Three unarmed young men were found shot to death in a location that was not involved in the rioting at all. The only people in the hotel with guns...were cops. Detroit homicide detective and the DA thought these cops were guilty...otherwise they would not have been brought up on charges. Those are the ""facts"". It's odd to me that the ""not historically accurate"" criticism is being played here. Dunkirk isn't historically accurate, Gettysburg wasn't historically accurate..and so on.

"""Detroit"": Madness in The Motor City","I was a child during the hell on earth Detroit summer of 1967. I don't remember it. Acclaimed Director Kathryn Bigelow has done one helluva job recreating the powder keg that exploded over a half century ago in the based-on-actual-events drama ""Detroit"".It is profoundly difficult to process that a human being could be as recklessly racist as these rogue cops are.

Darkness and tragedy of the Detroit riots come about in the incredible account in Detroit,"The city of Detroit is in a tough position. It was once a vast metropolis with several factories calling it home, making it a mecca for families looking for a quality and a safe security. Things changed when many of those car factories either closed or moved, turning a vast city into a ghost town. It's still standing and has plenty of people, but it now exists as a shadow of its own empire. Politicians and companies are in the middle of getting back a state of industry, so who knows what the future holds. It holds a lot of history, both good and tragic.In the late 1960's, race relations were at the brink of an explosion as African-Americans were crippled by poor living conditions in cities and were being provided little help from the government. While white Americans were enjoying a better life in the suburbs, the cities continued to unofficially segregate blacks into the urban environments. This anger eventually erupted in a series of riots that provided fuel for the media on the troubling issues for African Americans. Though each city riot had their fair share of casualties and damage, the one in Detroit was said to be the worst. It has been recreated in the Kathryn Bigelow film, Detroit.On the July 23, 1967, an unlicensed club was raided upon and shut the party down. This triggered a mob to start throwing rocks at police cars and they would later loot and set fire to various buildings. This was considered the start of the Detroit City riots. The second day is more of the same, except officer Phillip Krauss (played by Will Poulter) guns down an unarmed looter. Though he's told he'll be investigated on possible murder charges, he's not taken off the force. The riots become so violent that the governor approves the National Guard and the Army to provide help.On the third day, the Dramatics, an R&B group's performance is canceled when the riots come close to the theater. They try to leave the city, but lead singer Larry Reed (played by Algee Smith) gets separated and makes it to the Algiers Motel, hoping things will cool down the next day.A prank goes bad when a blank gunshot is confused for a sniper attack, causing the police to arrive quickly to find the shooter. Officer Krauss leads everyone down, including two white girls, a recent Vietnam veteran Lou, and Larry Reed for brutality-like interrogation. Though security guard Melvin Dismukes (played by John Boyega) is there to witnesses it, he watches as he tries to ensure everyone will leave alive.Taking an entire city based riot and putting it into one film cannot be an easy task, but Kathryn Bigelow developed Detroit into a magnificent, very tense look into events that identifies a lot of problems that are not only historically significant, but could be examined in a modern subtext. I love how the story is set around the tragedy of the Algiers Motel incident, which could be seen as the heart of the darkness.The script is great, the direction is great, the pacing is great, and the acting is all great. Every single person is the right choice for their character, especially to the big three, Will Poulter, John Boyega, and Algee Smith. Their performances had my eyes straight ahead to the screen as I was always curious to see what happens. I felt every emotion go through my body as I succumbed to the events projected, dragging me into the riots and of Detroit.I'll give this ten Dramatic albums out of ten. I can say that Detroit is a frontrunner for the Oscars in a lot of categories. Is it better then Dunkirk? Hmmthat's hard to say as despite both movies portraying major events, they feel different, which should say a lot about the importance of film as an art. We'll just have to wait for the end of the year to find out where it places on my scale. I can say that this is an engaging movie that completely sucks you into the madness. Detroit will continue to survive, though movies like this need to be seen to understand its darker moments, so don't miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Great Performances, But A Bit Long","There are many different ways to see Kathryn Bigelow's latest film, ""Detroit"". The odd thing is that the audience may not be the only ones asking that question. From what the trailer conveyed to me, it is the story of the horrible tragedy that took place during the riots in the city in 1967 at the annex to the Algiers hotel, but from the first twenty minutes it felt like more than that. As the film kicks off, an off-hours club is raided by local police for not being licensed properly by a police force that is seen as corrupt and overly forceful. As the rioting escalates, Patrolman Krauss (Will Poulter) decides that he needs to take matters into his own hands to an extreme. After he is put through an investigation for shooting someone he decides is a looter, he responds to a call of a possible sniper at the Algiers, sparking a night of terror for the people staying in the building. From two young free spirited ladies (Hannah Murray and Kaitlyn Dever) just wanting to have a good time to aspiring singer Larry (Algee Smith) and his best friend (Jacob Latimore) and a Vietnam veteran just trying to get back to normal life (Anthony Mackie), the night gets worse as it gets longer.Even after the incident completely unfolds, there is another thirty minutes that deal with the legal fallout from that night followed by other ancillary stories that I could see as trying to tell the full story, but at almost two and half hours, it just seemed like it was never really sure which path it wanted to follow. I felt like the events leading up to the main story could have been trimmed back, and even some of the third act as well. The second act is so emotionally draining that anything that came after really did not give me the chance to catch my breath so I could digest the aftermath. I guess the slow pacing that book ended this film combined with the meandering story in those areas are what really took me out of it, which is a bit of a shame given some very powerful performances here from some great actors like Poulter who is so convincing that I fear that there are some out there that will have difficulty drawing the difference between the actor and the character; this performance is THAT good. Mackie is also very good in his limited screen time, but Smith absolutely brings an amazing emotional gambit to the role of Larry. Only having seen him as Ralph Tresvant in ""The New Edition Story,"" this role gave me a whole new respect for him as an actor, and I look forward to where his career goes from here. John Boyega also has a great turn, but I really thought there would be more from his character within the story than there was. If there is one character I would have like to have seen more fleshed out by trimming more from others, it would have been his.Given that ""Detroit"" is a late summer release as opposed to an October or November release raises some questions as to the general perception of its award potential given the principals involved (I would like to see Poulter at least get recognized as well as some technical awards like sound design). I cannot say that this is in any way the worst film I have seen this year or even in the bottom half; what I will say is given the keys myself, I may have approached this story differently while making sure its message and heartbreaking story stayed intact.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Was this filmed by a high school kid holding an iPhone? My eyes were going cross-eyed and I got a migraine 30 mins into this film with the idiotic shaky-cam, out of focus, and moronic unnecessary zoom-ins/outs. Kathryn Bigelow needs to go back to Directors school to learn how to direct the cameras to capture the moment (scene) properly, learn how to edit a film to a respectable length, and fasten the pace to keep the viewers attention.

As gripping as they come!,"The super cinematic duo of Director Kathryn Bigelow and Writer Mark Boal have constructed an impactful, passionate project in the film ""Detroit"". Rev up your Detroit Pistons, because this one is riveting. It is based on the true story of the 1967 Detroit riots centered on the police brutality travesty that happened in the city's Algiers Motel. Bigelow helms the movie in a masterful manner that magnetizes the viewer into the action, especially in the film's brawny second act. Boal scribes up a script as sturdy as a Detroit Tiger. The film's acting ensemble assembled roaring performances as loud as a Detroit Lion; including John Boyega, Algee Smith, Jacob Latimore, Jason Mitchell, Jack Reynor, Ben O'Toole, Anthony Mackie, Hannah Murray, and Kaitlyn Dever. But it was Will Poulter as the savage, racist cop Krauss that was the standout here and should be ""red winging"" it to a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. ""Detroit"" is one of the best films of 2017, and should be seen as soon as possible in your motown. ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,History
Gut - Wrenching,"Kathryn Bigelow has another HIT!!! This movie is outstanding and the acting is SUPERB. Bring your thickest skin...in other words, be in a decent frame of mind when you see it; it is tough to watch.Detroit is about one horrifying night in 1967. The events are based on true facts and compelling. There is a heart-wrenching scene in the film that will tear your emotions apart. The scenes are so well played that you will feel the dire distress of the characters...the danger and difficulty...and your own anger in being helpless.The movie captures the time period...50 years ago and even brings in a piece of music history from that night that plays on today.Don't miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
gripping drama but poor history of the Detroit riots,"All filmmaking is exploitative. Whether it is fair or not will depend on many things, one of which is the respect shown for the film's subject matter. Many movies are marketed as fact-based but really only exploit history to create entertainment. This is the case with Detroit (2017): a gripping drama but a poor historical account of the worst public disorder in the US since the Civil War.Understanding the broader context is important. The Detroit race riots were part of a national wave of civil unrest that swept America in 'The Long Hot Summer of 1967'. There were 159 documented riots across a nation mired in a long history of slavery and systemic discrimination against its African American population. Detroit (2017) compresses the painful history of American racism into a few minutes of simplistic animation followed by archival footage of widespread racial unrest, burning buildings, mass protests, and police confrontations. Most of the two and a half-hour film then presents a prolonged dramatisation of a single episode of police brutality that occurred after the raids that triggered the riots.The early part of the film shows a number of sub-stories coming together as a result of the raids. In the midst of the chaos a group of fleeing African Americans are detained and interrogated in the Algiers Hotel after what was believed to be sniper fire on police and national guards. The handful of police are led by officer Philip Krauss (Will Poulter) who is already under threat of a murder charge after shooting a looter. He is sadistic in his methods. The suspects are kept facing a wall while one by one he applies terror tactics to make them inform on the so-called sniper, even staging fake killings to maximise panic. It is an agonisingly long and repetitive process, during which deliberate and accidental fatalities occur. The film concludes with a brief account of the courtroom drama in which the white officers face a white jury for a predictable outcome.Viewers hoping for a balanced picture of the Detroit race riots of '67 are unlikely to be satisfied. Instead of looking at the climate of hatred for black people, the film presents a 'bad-apple' account of one psychotic policeman with a taste for torture. The portrait of cruelty is performed to perfection. Poulter fills the role with callous indifference to pain or fear and it is his cold- blooded performance that drives the tension curve to its inconclusive finale. While there are many strong performances by others, this is virtually a one-man tour-de-force portrait of right- wing white supremacy.This film is entertaining if you have a taste for prolonged violence. Others may feel that the Detroit riots are being exploited and that racism deserves more respect than a tale of a lone psychotic. A redeeming feature is its timing. It arrives half a century after the depicted events, while alt-right forces of the world are again on the march. Detroit reminds us how ugly civilisation can be.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this film as I am a big fan of Kathryn Bigelow as she is one of the few people in Hollywood actually tackling important topics but I walked out completely disappointed.The mostly unknown actors were all exceptionally good and should have careers ahead of them. The Color grade, Casting, and lack of soundtrack was also very good. What was bad was the childish script which was filled with cartoonish stereotypes from every class, gender and color. I found myself cringing at how awful some of the dialogue was and the direction was pretty much a complete mess.Anyone that is a fan of Bigelow's films knows that at some point she goes off on some tangent for 15 minutes but them usually rights the ship back on course. This entire film was off course from the opening 15 minutes which is just disarray (which I understand is part of the point) that goes on way too long and we learn nothing that drives the narrative along. The beatings were like seeing the equally awful Passion of the Christ... You get so desensitized by the constant beatings that you really don't care any more. The tacked on Penny Marshall-esque ending was filled with so much saccharine it could have induced a diabetic coma and did a complete injustice to The Dramatics. It was sad because I was really hoping for this to be an important film especially in the timeliness of this decade but instead it became a Lifetime Movie with over the top violence.In the end I could have lived with the direction if there wasn't such a laughable script. How you take a topic like this and turn it into something that awful was truly amazing. Just present the story and you have a great film but instead you end up this disappointment",5.0,Anonymous,History
Crooked A-- Cops!,"Detroit is based on a true story about the 1967 riots and how these white cops treated these black kids in a hotel and all over Detroit. Will Poulter plays one of the crooked a-- cops in the film. Oh my God this guy was rude to not just blacks but everyone whites, black etc. John Boyega plays a security guard who was just trying to help out his fellow black citizens and got mixed up in a sick mind game with the Detroit PD who terriozed these kids who didn't do anything but be at the wrong place at the wrong time.
 That's basically it. A movie for me was a bit hard to watch because I'm white it makes ALL white people look bad. NOT all white people go around being rude, hateful and racist to other minorities. Should you watch this film well I will admit their are a lot of language, violence and images that might be too much for some people but it's based on true events so they had to do that to tell the story. I rented it from Redbox so it was only a dollar so not that big of a loss if you don't care for it. I gave it a 6 out of 10 because I did like the acting and the music in the film but that was about it.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"A vivid, brutal retelling of true events that are still relevant 50 years later.","Art is not always easy to swallow. However, some art is essential. This is a story that needed to be told.Oscar winning director Kathryn Bigelow has knocked it out of the park once again with Detroit. Once again, Bigelow takes on delicate subject matter with the expertise of a great filmmaker. The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty are good films in their own right, but this is far more affecting and heart-wrenching than either of those films.Detroit is filmed wholly hand-held, and the shakiness that comes along with that direction choice is extremely effective. Before the riots even start in the film, you will be set on edge by the shakiness of the camera and jarring cuts. This alone creates tension that is only ratcheted up little by little as the film progresses. There are many scenes, that because of the tension created with the camera-work, along with the terrifying nature of the situation, feel like something out of a horror film.Every actor here gives a near flawless performance. While John Boyega is being marketed as the star of the film (which, duh, he was in Star Wars), this is actually a film without a standard Hollywood- style star. These actors—even the bigger names—are treated as equally important details in a larger event. In fact, despite the presence of Boyega, Anthony Mackie, and Jason Mitchell, I was blown away most by the lesser-known Algee Smith. The performances here are emotional, powerful, but most of all, real. None of these actors feel like they are acting for an Academy Award, instead each actor embodies the real life people that lived through these events.The shocking nature of this film is all thanks to the film's subject matter. But I'm not here to critique subject matter. Detroit, from a purely narrative standpoint, is brilliantly written—jumping from characters and timelines until all roads meet at the film's crescendo. Instead of the route Dunkirk chose—throwing you right into the fire with characters you don't know—Detroit instead gives each character scenes that let you get to know them as people, allowing you to genuinely care about them.While this is a great film, it is a hard watch. This is an emotionally grueling film in the same way 12 Years a Slave and Fruitvale Station are. With that being said, the two and a half hour run time of this film is exhausting. There is not much that could be cut out of this film, but the length is something that can really work against this film.Detroit is a poignant film, not only due to the masterful direction and performances, but because of it's relevance in the world we live in today. This is an unflinching, timely achievement—and may be Kathryn Bigelow's magnum opus.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Detroit,"While sitting through the new film, Detroit about the Detroit riots from 50 years ago and also what happened afterwards at The Algiers Motel, which could be described in no other terms than extreme police corruption, intimidation as well as flat out abuse of power and racism, it left me pondering as I sat in my theatre seat about how exactly I would rate this new film in my review for it and what also I would say about it. The problem proves to be a perplexing one because as one who reviews films would know, you basically have to review a film on a number of different levels and looking at several sections of criteria and merits within the film to give the film a proper rating and overall review. If, I was to look at this new film as someone who is overall judging the technical achievements, or faults within it when it comes to things such as direction, writing, cinematography, acting and just overall how this new movie was made I have to say with great and precise determination and praise that it far excels in each and every one of these levels of craft and overall filmmaking. There really is no weak link here because everything on a technical as well as skilled level is just done so well here and everyone both in front of and behind the camera has achieved true greatness with this film and I think however you felt about the film after you came out of viewing it, I think few people could say that it was poorly made, or even the least bit amateurish because nothing could be farther from the truth. It is probably the most skilled and polished piece of work I have seen thus far this year as far as sheer craft, technical ability and overall filmmaking talent goes. So why am I hesitating and not just singing the film's praises repeatedly over and over? My main problem lies not so much with the film's subject matter, or what it is about, because even though I am sure that there was much fabricating and the writer and director took a certain amount of liberties when telling this true story and even within the end credits it admits that some, or maybe more than we think of what we saw was up to the writer and director involved because some things that would make the film more coherent, or just that much more effective as far as storytelling goes was added, or dare I say made up to make things a bit juicier, or probably the best word I can use here is 'shocking'. I realize that to make a film powerful and overall to have a great affect upon it's audiences you have to leave your viewers sometimes with strong emotions, or a sense that what they just saw was powerful, or moving, or whatever adjective best suits the film in question. This is a story that definitely needs to be told to shame both the police force and attitudes of the law enforcement in this particular situation, but also raise questions about one's own moral duties, or questioning inwardly about what we ourselves would do in these particular situations. To film a story like this, I realize that to capture it authentically you do need to show some violence and brutality up to a certain point as well as both scare and perhaps even provoke your audience into some kind of fear, or tension to really get the mood across about what you are displaying on screen. On the other hand, I felt that while this film needed to be forceful with it's approach that it crossed on my levels what is appropriate and after awhile the language as well as the violence seemed to not just border, but over engulf itself by being far too excessive with it's use of screen violence and language that at times it was not only a turn off, but also quite unsettling as well. I realize the filmmakers really wanted to pack a punch with this story and the overall product and they certainly achieved that, but perhaps going to this far an extent was not necessary in my opinion and I feel that in the meantime they are going to turn off many potential viewers of this film and may even cause more sensitive audience members to leave the theatre in disgust. I feel that to make a film effective you do not need to resort to these type of tactics to get a response from your audience and again here it feels excessive and almost like it was trying to attack and manipulate the audience. However as far as technical achievements go this far far surpassed all my expectations on that level, so I am giving it a perfect rating for that alone as well as the fact that this is a story that needs to be told even if it would have been just as effective, or preferable if they toned down the brutality a notch. Overall you be the judge, but be forewarned.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Curiously Lacking A Clear Focus,"When I started seeing promotional material for ""Detroit"", I thought that it really had the chance to be something special. It is very timely in today's social/political climate, and director Kathryn Bigelow always takes such care in her films to portray the truth. While this seems to indeed be the case in ""Detroit"" as well, the film comes off as lacking a clear focus in terms of what it wanted to accomplish short of ""showing the facts of what happened"".For a basic plot summary, ""Detroit"" tells the story of the 1967 race riots that tore through the city of Detroit, MI. While the first half of the film looks at the riots as a whole, the second half focuses in on one specific incident where the Detroit PD roughs up a group of African American men (and two white women) in trying to find a weapon that was fired from that location. The shocking brutality and subsequent trial are all chronicled in the back half of the film.There are two things that I really wish ""Detroit"" would have done different:1. It almost seems to be two different movies, and I wish Bigelow would have stuck to the first one, so to speak. As I've mentioned, the first half is really gripping, showing the beginning of the riots and what they might mean for everyone. I was really ""into"" this movie, as it truly does parallel many similar themes and problems even today. When the film switches to the one Algiers Motel incident, however, I felt like it bogged down and never really recovered. Perhaps had the film focused on that single scene from the beginning it would not have been so jarring of a switch, but as it stands I didn't like the focus going from wide-angle to pretty strict zoom.2. I know that Bigelow likely wants to remain a-political in her filmmaking (from what I remember, a similar thing happened in ""The Hurt Locker""), but I also feel like this isn't a story that can be told without taking a bit of a stand. That doesn't happen here, though, and the movie has less of an impact because of it. Instead, this is very much a ""just the facts, ma'm"" approach that, at nearly two and a half hours, becomes hard to get through.There is enough in ""Detroit"" to make it a watchable movie, as the acting performances are great and the general atmosphere of the whole piece is pretty chilling. Plus, Bigelow does a great job of subtly showing how similar race issues continue to plague black/police relationships. Basically, it does a great job of showing how the problems often remain even after the actors change.So, while not a bad movie by any stretch, ""Detroit"" is one that I was quite underwhelmed by. I wanted a more consistent storytelling approach and a bit more of an impactful, articulated message within it. It's worth a watch if you are interested in the type of topics it delves into, but it likely won't vault to the top of your best-of lists.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Will Poulter here is....just wow,"""Detroit"" is a brutal piece of documentary-cinema from two people who have kinda taken over the mantle Oliver Stone used to have all wrapped up, at least in my eyes, as political activist filmmakers.Kathryn Bigelow and her screenwriter Mark Boal are now moving away from the war on terror and looking at a war here at home which has unfortunately been going on forever between the police and black people. This particular incident is without question the one of the most brutal and egregious, happening in 1960's Detroit.It is something else to see the National Guard just rolling in to a U.S city, really on edge and ready for battle. Like one character says, it seems ""like Nam"". And also like Nam, the civilian casualties really leave you pressed against your seat in horror.This is a response to all out riots which go on for several days, as a result of black people being rounded up and beaten by the police. Even black service men are treated abysmally.One thing I wish this movie would have done more with is what is the driving point of wanting to destroy one's home in order to attain social justice? The movie tells us black- owned businesses wrote 'soul brother' on their windows in solidarity with the protesters but they were still ransacked just as hard, but that's all the info we're given.But regardless of that, Boal and Bigelow have set up a clear bias that the cops consider blacks less than by the time we get to the real heart of the story, and what comes next proves that they were just getting warmed up.We've seen something like this before and the real tragedy is it always starts with something very small that snowballs into a living, breathing nightmare. We're looking at men being lined up at gunpoint and shot, beaten, women molested, there's more, it's horrible.This is a horror movie. I've seen ""Annabelle: Creation"", that's horrific but it's fun. This is the type of horror movie that really does leave you feeling the world is a messed up place. Bigelow really couldn't do a better job of setting this scene. You hear the cracks across the face with the gun, she focuses in on shaking and holding hands for support.And that cute kid from ""Chronicles of Narnia"" and ""Maze Runner"" has this whole other side to him where he can seem like the biggest racist, psychopathic cop among a sea of other racist psychopathic cops. Honestly, I kept looking for a white cop in this movie who seemed somewhat solid in his decision-making and there's maybe one.Will Poulter is so good in this movie that everyone else kinda seems less than. John Boyega is here as a guard whose just trying to survive the night and pacify where he can, but in the end I thought he came off just as ineffectual as his character does.Like there is this whole thing in the end of how his character received death threats after all this and really had a tough life but it tells us this in text at the end of the movie and doesn't show. Also the last 40 minutes or so I thought felt like a bit of a slog as Bigelow just seems to be quickly brushing over the outcomes of all this in general.In the end I liked the movie but felt it could have gotten a bit closer to most of it's characters and given us more insights into those struggles characters faced following this event.But this really is one of those points in American history where you just leave ashamed to be white; not to say that is the film's purpose cause it's not. It's eye-opening though because ""oddly enough"", this is a situation where problems concerning race were not fixed and 50 years later, they're still not fixed.All we're doing is celebrating wins on either side which is ridiculous. People are still happy about O.J. for Christ sake. A guy who knelt during a football season and gave millions to charity still can't get a job.So I give it an 8 out of 10.

A very intense and gripping film...avoid reviews labelling it historically inaccurate.,"In short, the film was far from a masterpiece. With that being said, it certainly contained an phenomenal amount of tension throughout, and managed to stop my eyes from wondering about the movie theatre.The reviews that shun the film for being historically inaccurate are completely unfair and some of the points made in them should not even be paid attention to because of how ridiculous they are. In fact, the film specifically states how scenes have been dramatised due to lack of evidence or knowledge in certain scenarios that occurred during the periods portrayed.Some of these members are rating this film one star, simply based on the historical inaccuracies, but is that the only thing to base such a narratively-rich film on ? What about all other components that should be analysed when reviewing a film ?A 7 out of 10 is a fair score. Without giving anything away, you will be able to get through this film quite comfortably, maybe finding that it does drag a bit and some scenes could have been shortened (especially the first half of the film). However, overall, a solid piece of film.DO NOT LET THE REVIEWS MOANING ABOUT HISTORICAL INACCURACIES PUT YOU OFF.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Bigalow's latest is a film of its time... and unfortunately still current.,"Katheryn Bigelow's new film should make you angry. It made me angry. As this year's Selma (on steroids) the film is an ode to how incidents can get out of hand: at a macro level we see how a stubborn chained door triggers a series of riots 50 years ago that reduced the 'Motor Town' to a war zone; at a micro level we see how a childish prank turns to a terrifying ordeal for the guests of the Algiers Motel.While I was aware of the historical context of the Detroit riots, the Motel incident was new to me. How accurate is the film? Not very, from the many comments made online and from diversions in the story to what's reported on the 'official' wiki page. But what's clear is that the facts of what occurred have been refracted through the multiple lenses of the police, the victims, the state police, the troopers and the legal teams arguing those facts. So no one can be sure anymore.Bigelow - particularly as a white women - is brave to make this film. You would like to think that, after 50 years, American society has 'grown up' somewhat but, after the recent police-on-black incidents in places including Ferguson, Baltimore and Charlotte, that is clearly not the case. So this is a rather incendiary picture: as a white liberal, I was angry; as a black person I would be furious. This hardly pours 'oil on troubled waters'.But enough of the political context: what's the film like? The answer is tense: very tense!The riots are wonderfully staged with masterful cinematography (by Barry Ackroyd, ""The Hurt Locker"", ""Captain Phillips"") that blends filmed footage with documentary footage (cleverly upscaled for the big screen) such that you often can't see the seams. Once in the annex of the motel the film becomes grippingly claustrophobic as the racist cop Krauss (Will Poulter) becomes the king - no, the dictator - of all he surveys. Here the film editing and sound design is superb, and it would be astonishing if these disciplines are not up for Oscars for this work.It is difficult to single out specific acting performances, since this is a fine ensemble performance (a One Mann's Movies award prediction:  the The Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture). But I will reference a few: unknown Algee Smith owns the role of Larry Reed - lead singer of Motown group 'The Dramatics' - showing how the events of the night sapped his enthusiasm for life; Jack Reynor extends his impressive CV (after ""Sing Street"" and ""Free Fire"") as the most hapless of Krauss's cronies; and John Boyega (""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"") delivers a Poitier-level of screen presence as fish-out-of-water security guard Dismukes. A mid- film twist in the film concerning his character (at least as written and portrayed) delivers a powerful kick to the gut that Boyega acts beautifully.But the starring role goes to Poulter as the malignant police officer Krauss. With a resume as diverse as ""Son of Rambo"", ""We're the Millers"" and ""The Revenant"", Poulter is making it into the top tier of young movie actors. As Krauss he is 100% believable.I loved the first two thirds of the film: gripping, thought-provoking and scary, but with entertaining elements of the Motown scene, through the eyes of 'The Dramatics"", thrown in to add humanity and context. If it had finished then, I would have been happy:  10*, no problem. Unfortunately Bigelow and her standard screenwriter Mark Boal (""The Hurt Locker"", ""Zero Dark Thirty"") rather over-egg the pudding in the final reels, making the film over-long and undoing some of the previous good work. The film sprawls into multiple different areas including courtroom scenes, mourning  families (introducing brand new characters), a Larry Reed story and related Dramatics fall-out, with only the latter storyline being really welcome.This is an important film, and will no doubt feature strongly in the Awards season.  It is also, notwithstanding its flaws, a very good film that was a hard watch but impressive.

Very uncomfortable viewing but powerful movie-making,"There are far too few female film directors and probably none as commercially and artistically successful as the American Kathryn Bigelow. Her two previous works, ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty"", were both outstanding and showed men in uniform under pressure.""Detroit"" has the same essential theme but, as the title makes clear, this time we are on Bigelow's home territory of the United States. Indeed we are in the midst of actual events, the race riot which took place in one of the country's major cities over five days in July 1967 when 43 were killed, 1,200 injured, 7,000 arrested, and 2,000 buildings burned down.As the film unfolds, the focus constantly narrows, starting with a quick animated history of black migration in the USA, moving on to the rioting throughout the 12th Street area of Detroit, then closing in on the Algiers Motel, and finally remaining in real time in an annex to the motel where we find ourselves in a kind of horror movie.This is a long film and the final segment jumps forward a couple of years, with glimpses of the court case where all the accused were acquitted, to conclude with short text advising the viewer on what happened to the chief characters in the incident.If this is a cinematic tour de force by Bigelow, it is a tribute too to writer Mark Boal and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, both of whom she has worked with before. The inter-cutting of contemporary news footage and the use of hand-held cameras mean that the viewer is drawn into a seamless exposition that, from the beginning, induces anxiety and, during the interrogation sequence, is some of the most uncomfortable viewing outside of the horror movie genre.The acting is excellent across the piece, but the stand-out performances come from two British actors: John Boyega (""The Force Awakens"") as the black security guard caught up in the events and Will Poulter (""THe Revenant"") as the white Detroit cop who orchestrates the whole macabre, and ultimately murderous, shake-downI saw Bigelow interviewed about her latest movie on ""The Daily Show"" and it is clear that she regards ""Detroit"" as not simply a 50th anniversary commemoration of a dark period of American history but a call to today's America to recognise that race is still a bitterly divisive feature of society that continues all too often to witness young black men being shot down by white policemen who are rarely called to account at a time when the current occupant of the White House is adding by word and deed to the already toxic atmosphere.",,Anonymous,History
I was there!,"I am a Detroiter who worked on this film.First, the production quality was very high, I enjoyed working on it. It was actually filmed in the very Police Precinct on Livernois Ave. Where it all happened. The amazing thing, is that nothing has changed to that building since 1967. Very Mid-Century Modern Municipal Building. The Riot has frozen the place in a time warp. It is Still a Police Station.We were all dressed in period costume and had to get period haircuts. I was a detective with a rubber .38 revolver. Many Riot Cops were there, and National Guard with M-1's with real Bayonets. I'm surprised no one got stabbed by those! The production crew kept us indoors and away from Livernois Ave, as we looked real, and they were terrified we might actually spark a new riot. They treated us well.It was a racially mixed crowd of actors, and we all knew each other well, so it was easier to pull off those scenes(tight community). I actually stood next to Director Bigelow herself(She's very tall).That area is still pretty rough. They changed the name of 12th street to.""Rosa Parks"".Second, while we were filming, I got a gut feeling that this might be a ""Hollywood Hit Piece"". There are probably 20 other reasons that Detroit has collapsed into what it is today. Any one of those reasons themselves would have doomed Detroit. And they are still present today. Of all of those causes, ""Racism"" was probably the least of them. Detroit was the ""Great Black Hope"", were you could take a bus from a Southern Cotton field, straight to the Middle Class, much like Atlanta is today. Many of those Detroiters went to College with me, and they got their American Dream. So, if you watch this film, take it with a grain of salt. Yes there is always Racism, but Detroit was at the low end. You have to have a plot, and a crisis, or films don't work. The plot could have been written a little better and a little more factual, But these are strange times.Anyway, I saw this on Cable again the other day, and saw the back of my head for a second! I kinda ducked the camera for ""safety"", in case this show went off the rails.(It did).

Detroit,"There is something about Detroit that I found deeply uncomfortable while watching.I questioned myself. Why am I being subjected to prolonged scenes of black people being abused and eventually death for some of them?It is like when a male director appears in a television show to defend his latest controversial movie. He tries to explain the 30 minutes sequence where a young woman gets gang raped by six men has artistic merits. His movie is pro feminist and non exploitative. The television host looks at him in a disbelieving manner.From Oscar winning director Kathryn Bigelow. Detroit is a docudrama of true events at the Algiers Motel that has been fictionalized.In July 1967 there were riots in Detroit. When shots from a sniper are heard in the vicinity of the motel. Three white policemen charge inside and pin 6 young black men and two white women against the wall as they look for a gun.Although they find no weapon they brutalise the men, perform mock executions and three of them are killed. The women are made to strip and abused as well.Later the three cops and one black security guard are eventually charged for their murders.Bigelow brings an immediacy with the way the movie is shot. However the characters have little depth. Will Poulter plays a trigger happy racist cop but no context is given as to why he behaves this way. John Boyega plays the security guard who ingratiates himself with the police but cannot do anything to help the men. He just tells the men that it is going to be a rough night and they just need to get through it.However at times this just felt like torture porn.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Detroit is a film takes its time, sets its scene well. Its glossy and powerful when it wants to be and it's quiet and speaks for itself when it needs to.","It's a surprisingly impactful and energetic powderkeg of a film.
There's something great about the sets and locations, with their dirty, ugly, boring authenticity. Tied to this is the great minor cast, with the yellow teeth, and the plain faces; the sort of ordinariness of them all, that goes along with Boal's elegantly simple script where it feels anything can happen at any time. Boyega is dynamite, his raw, bare constraint as an actor and his character's struggles moving me to tears throughout.
Bigelow's camera is always motivated so despite the film's length, you look away and you're likely to miss something. The disconnect and then sudden connection between stories has a classic movie feel, more than any Bigelow, Detroit is an underrated masterclass of editing.
Detroit is a great film, but be warned, it's a horror, a horror where truth is even more horrifying than fiction and the trauma is etched on the faces of all involved, and maybe even on the soul of America. And this was only 1967.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Harrowing and Uncompromising in Its Handling of Unimaginably Sensitive Material,Kathryn Bigelow directs this docudrama that depicts a racially charged police raid on an unlicensed club that would begin the infamous 12th Street Riots. Caught in the cross-hairs are a struggling R&B group called the Dramatics and two college co-eds visiting the club for weekend partying. The events unravel in heartbreaking and enraging ways. What would initially begin as a sadistic prank to ward off the co-mingling of the white females and black males leads to uncomprehensibly devastating results for all involved. A truly grim look at these events the picture veers far from sentimentality which keeps it at a clipped pace and allows for more structure surrounding the state of affairs amid the egregious hotel raid.,9.0,Anonymous,History

July 23, 1967, May 25, 2020, 8pm. Fifty years later, racial discrimination and violent law enforcement by some police have not changed much. What we see is not hope but despair.
If weapons are the tools given to the police to defend justice, the violent law enforcement is indeed the trigger to turn the police into criminals. The history of racial discrimination accompanied by national development has long been deeply rooted in people's minds.
Movie art comes from life but is higher than life. I did not deliberately choose this film for ""Detroit"", but as I gradually went deeper, the atmosphere of despair and suffocation made me truly understand the horror of racial discrimination and violent law enforcement. The separation between the film and reality is gradually being broken. With the wave of anti-racial discrimination in the United States, maybe those criminals were not brought to justice 50 years ago. I hope that this kind of thing does not happen today.
I hope everyone understands that racial discrimination is all harm and no benefit. Whether it is white, black, or yellow, we are all human beings with basic human rights, freedom, democracy, and fairness, which have been universal since we were born. Power. And this problem is not just a national problem, it is a problem for all of us. I know that if you don't act, the change will never come, but this change should not be to fight back with violence. This world may be so real and desperate, but I hope to quote Mr. Martin Luther King:

Detroit (2017),"Directed by Kathryn Bigelow. Starring John Boyega, Will Poulter, Jacob Latimore, Algee Smith, Jason Mitchell, Hannah Murray, Kaitlyn Dever, Nathan Davis Jr., Ben O'Toole, Jack Reynor, Anthony Mackie, Peyton Alex Smith, Malcolm David Kelley, Joseph David-Jones. (R)Searing period drama detailing events during the 1967 Detroit riots, especially the Algiers Hotel incident where local law enforcement assaulted several young men and women, resulting in multiple deaths. Bigelow's intense, up-close filmmaking style makes this a grueling experience, exhausting at length, even numbing, but ultimately the sort of visceral experience that overlooks nuance and depth in order to hammer home an effective emotional response. Because the characterizations are so defined by in-the-moment action and individual-as-community representation, there isn't always a sense of background and internal motivation that might have explained specific behavior, reaction, attitude or accountability; the audience is forced to make their judgments based on knowledge of historical context and personal opinion. Well-acted by a talented cast despite the shallowness of the personas they inhabit; as propaganda of outrage, though, the film is a startling one that should linger uncomfortably.75/100",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Most Important Study of Our Own Failure,"Before my screening of Detroit played, the trailers shown beforehand featured these dumb action movies with bad CGI, you know, the ones expected to score box office success. Boy did it feel refreshing to see what I went to the theater for: a thriller based on a thought-provoking true story about how little has changed since the incident at the Algiers Motel.First, a stylized prologue educates us on the public 1967 mindset by painting out the prior 100 years of racial history. The colorful film reel fit for an elementary classroom then time-warps us into the riots stirred up by Civil Rights, no sugarcoating included. The Black community embraced unlicensed after-hours club for the initiators of violence. The White police officers reacted to the rebellion by scaring them with death games. In any other director's hands, this project would have turned out as hate-fueled anti-White propaganda much like The Birth of a Nation or Get Out; rather, director Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty) and her team made great strides to tell the real story of what happened in Detroit.Everything within the first charcoal-tinted twenty minutes brings sense into Detroit's economic structure of the time. With each bike stolen, with each fire set ablaze, with each fireman injured by a thrown rock, with each Black woman sexually harassed by an officer, with each piece of real historical news footage, the attention closes in on the personal conflict within the riot rather than the spectacle itself. Although the usage of religious institutions deserved stronger prevalence across the entire runtime to match the moral strife of the time, the big picture still explodes with a great undying flame.True to Bigelow's traditional style, a documentary approach records the dramatized events. Despite an unnecessary musical score by James Newton Howard (The Fugitive, Michael Clayton), a grainy Steadicam stressfully complements the sudden edit cuts, transferring the 1967 motion sickness into your own eyeballs.The tension really sets its spark ablaze during the entire middle chunk: a motel-set interrogation in search for a blank-loaded gun aimed at the police outside. These victims, two of them Ohio-local White prostitutes, the rest young Black men, face the worst of Detroit's hate over the next hour and a half. The one holding the gun is shot dead, nobody knows the gun's whereabouts, yet the cops only see an easy chance to humiliate the weak one by one.Every performer gives their greatest effort, the most impactful being a respectful Army Veteran who to the police is no different than any other negro. But Larry, a struggling musician also harassed that dreadful night, adds the most soul to our soulless history. The two whores receive the same poor treatment as their Black companions, lovingly supporting each other even after one gets stripped nude by a cop. While their stories lack their full potential, standing more as victims than empowering female role models, their sentimentality despite their destructive lifestyles make it easy for women to connect with. As with the other Black victims, none of them were motivated enough to cheer on, yet you can still tell them each apart simply by looking at their wardrobe.By now, I believe screenwriter Mark Boal (The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty) just proved himself to be the most underrated writer in Hollywood today, as he achieved great heights to the artform by writing under a variety of styles, including courtroom drama, real time, and visual storytelling. His intense dialogue helps us to physically feel the situation without coming off as one-sided. He structures the multiple events so that every death hits you hard in the right timing, as true to the expressed motives we learn about each character, whether Black or White.The issues seen here at Detroit looks upsettingly familiar to the anti- Trump riots we see today, almost normalized on a daily basis as it was back then. However, hope manages to lie within its social message: no stereotypes raise their ugly head, not all Blacks involved in the riots are mean spirited, and not all cops are racists. The different social groups stand up for one another and some even stand up for the other side, in a story everybody over the age of eighteen needs to know at once, especially now during the summer season.So bottom line, this history lesson matters to you: Black or White, male or female, young or old, innocent or guilty!",8.0,Anonymous,History

A Sadly Familiar Story,"""I don't wanna get involved in any civil rights mix up."" This quote from Detroit is actively denied at every turn. An incredible film not just for its actual merit, but also for the shocking lack of justice, and the film's refusal to ignore it. It's not an easy movie to like, though it's easy to recommend. That's the problem. The sad prescience is a large part of its success, seeing how little has changed in 50 years. An eye-opening and in-depth vision of the black experience that's unflinching, empathetic, and well-rounded. In 1967, during a time of civil unrest in Michigan, a trio of police officers wreak racial terror on a house of mostly young black men after mistakenly thinking they have a gun. It's told in a potpourri / cinema verite fashion, with a collection of smaller stories all feeding into the larger narrative. At over 2 hours, some of the smaller moments up-front are weak, but once we get into the actual house and the ensuing legal battle, we're hit with the brutal intensity and infuriating horror these people were forced into through no choice of their own. It's all so overwhelming, it would be difficult to believe if not for all the proof we see on the internet every day. Unfortunately, this happened before there was a camera in every pocket and on every eye. Bigelow gives us a view we couldn't have had, showing every angle with dogged specificity. It's far from the best racially charged film we've gotten recently (odd tonal shifts, on-the-nose dialogue, easily fixed miscommunication), but its whistleblower mentality brings a brutal honesty to an all-too-current topic.",6.0,Anonymous,History
One of the most important films you'll ever see,"Even if Kathryn Bigelow's #Detroit movie may not purposely intend on pointing out the continued failures of our justice system with regards to police crime in today's world, it succeeds in doing exactly that. This is a raw and disturbing depiction of an even more disturbing true story that for one reason or another had been stuck as some kind of historical footnote for the past fifty years but it is timely as ever and it's one of the most important films you'll ever see.The director who gave us ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty"" proves once again, with ""Detroit,"" that she is not one to run away from controversial subject matter. Written by her frequent collaborator, Mark Boal, ""Detroit"" is set during the most terrifying civil unrest that rocked the iconic motor city in the summer of 1967. The story zooms in on the Algiers Motel incident involving the death of three black men and the brutal beatings of nine other people including two white women.Bigelow and her crew apply the famous cinema verité style of filmmaking that allows you to feel like you're there in that hallway with those victims as they're hands and heads are up against the wall, as the cops are beating on them. It doesn't get more visceral and up-close than this, the cinematography that is in constant motion elevates the intensity because it engages you the viewers and never lets go. Everything about this film is meant to create a sense of discomfort in addition to its trying to also reach some kind of authenticity that comes across as thoughtful and respectful. It's very hard to watch, definitely not a film for everybody.Bigelow knows the importance of setting up the context and so the film comes with a prologue that briefly explains the history behind the migration and also the transfer of wealth away from the neighborhood and how pressure cooker builds up, how the events culminate into an uprising and ultimately this collision between a few racist cops and a few unfortunate young folks. So that way you get a better understanding as to why the collision got to be as violent as it did.In the roles of the villains, actors Will Poulter, Ben O'Toole and Jack Reynor give performances unlike any other corrupt cops we've seen before. Poulter in particular, perfectly embodies what a person would do when he's on an absolute power trip. Poulter is a remarkable young talent with skills beyond his years. Equally impressive are Jacob Latimore and Algee Smith who play characters traumatized, physically and mentally affected by the incident. Rising star John Boyega plays an African American security guard who's unwilling to speak out but doing his best to keep anyone from getting shot. Some might see it as complicit or cowardice, he might see it as surviving.By the way, even though the film's focus may be on this motel incident or on this Detroit riot, screenwriter Mark Goal manages to make it also be about these individuals, and so you fear for them every passing minute. The production design and the combining of archival footage and photos from that night make it seems like you've been transported to 1967, this is a film that pays attention to details and goes the distance and does whatever it can to convey what I think it tries to impart to the audience and that to me is the relevant theme indicating that if you think our criminal justice system is broken and messed up, if you think inequality is bad today, imagine the cruelty and the unfairness they had to live through some fifty years ago.

Another Solid Effort From The Creators Of 'The Hurt Locker' & 'Zero Dark Thirty',"From the creators of The Hurt Locker & Zero Dark Thirty comes another sharp-edged thriller that's brutal, violent & unsettling from start to finish. Encapsulated with a volatile atmosphere, unfolding with raw intensity & overflowing with charged emotions, Detroit takes hold of the viewers attention within its first few minutes and doesn't let go until the very end.Based on the infamous Algiers Motel incident that took place during the 1967 riots in Detroit, the film re-enacts the fateful night that saw a group of police officers stepping out of their line of duty when they responded to an earlier complaint with retribution rather than justice on their minds and went further than just beating up the nine residents that they rounded up.Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, Detroit finds the esteemed filmmaker employing all her trademarks to capture the chaotic aura of the story's provocative content, and she manages to keeps things tight & tense at all times. The drama is gripping throughout and doesn't dial down on violence while the grim mood is further amplified by its frenzied camera-work & slick editing.The Algiers Motel setting is finely detailed and the entire riotous ambiance is effectively recreated. The performances are no slouch as every cast member contributes with an emotionally compelling input and play their part as per the scene requirements. The strongest act comes from Will Poulter who sells his racist cop character so aggressively that it overshadows the other actors' inputs.On an overall scale, Detroit is a nail-biting dramatization of a historical tragedy that may not be as accomplished as Bigelow's previous two directorial efforts but it is a sturdily crafted period piece that shares much similarity with the current climate of racism in America and shows that not much has changed in the last 50 years. Brought to life with cut-throat fierceness & further strengthened by solid performances from its cast, Detroit comes thoroughly recommended.",,Anonymous,History
A difficult film to watch and a lesson for today,"Time magazine described Kathryn Bigelow's 2008 film, The Hurt Locker as a ""near perfect film"". It's hard to disagree as it went on to win six Oscars including Best Picture and Best Screenplay for Mark Boal. Bigelow and Boal went on to collaborate again for 2012's Zero Dark Thirty, again receiving critical acclaim and one Oscar. So it was with excitement and goodwill that I went to see Detroit to see if the dynamic duo of Bigelow and Boal could work their magic again.I was not disappointed. Detroit is a superb piece of story-telling with incredible editing by William Goldberg who picked up the Best Editing Oscar for 2012's Argo. One often forgets how an editor can influence a film; it's feel, look, pacing, etc. We know Goldberg is no stranger to action, tense editing plus the interweaving of actuality in to his editing. For Detroit, he scores again. Forgive me for focusing on editing, but for me, it was one of the successes of the film and should not be underestimated or under-appreciated. This is a strong contender for another Oscar for Goldberg.Based on actual events and people, the film tells the story of how a police raid on an after-hours party in Detroit in 1967 resulted in one of the largest race riots in United States history. The story is centred around the Algiers Motel incident, which occurred on July 25, 1967, during the racially charged 12th Street Riot. It involves the death of three black men and the brutal beatings of nine other people: seven black men and two white women. Fro the initial police raid through the build-up of the riots and the looting, to the actual events at the Algiers motel, to the subsequent charging and trial of three police officers, their acquittal and the after effects on the lives of the key characters, this is a troy that needed to be told. It is painful, nay difficult to watch in places. Bigelow does not shy away from putting the heart-wrenching, visceral brutality and naked racism right in front of our faces.John Boyega, keen to shed any hint of Star Wars typecasting, gives a powerful, if muted performance as a local security guard who gets embroiled in the events at the Algiers Motel. He goes from advocate to helpless bystander and ultimate patsy, upon whom the Detroit police try to place the blame for the murders carried out by their own officers. It is a measured performance and identifies him as a singular acting talent of a new generation.Anthony Mackie also gives a stand-out performance. Known for playing Falcon in the Marvel films: Avengers, Capt America: Civil War, etc. I had placed him in a box of competent but not an actor of note or substance. I was wrong. His performance here is worthy of a supporting actor nod at next year's Oscars.English actor, Will Poulter plays the villain of the film, if there is such a thing in a city so demonstrably racist. Poulter's unhinged performance is magnificent as he unashamedly displays his racist attitudes, through his brutality and subjugation of the victims in the Algiers Motel, right up to his realisation he may have over-stepped the mark and his subsequent attempts at cover-up is the locus of the film. Poulter carries it off and Bigelow's close-ups of him as he displays his bigotry are breathtaking.I could write a lot more about this film: it's cast and crew, the plot, the pacing, the moral but I will, uncharacteristically, leave it there except to say that it is a difficult film to watch, but necessary. In these sexist, misogynistic, racist, Trumpian times, films like this deserve to be shown to everyone, nay everyone should be made watch and feel uncomfortable.A staggering film. 4.5 out of 5. My highest rating so far this year.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Detroit (2017),"I still haven't seen Near Dark, but have been really wanting to do so. I will say this though, Bigelow's Strange Days is amazing. In recent years Bigelow has shifted focus to more politically-war themed films. With Detroit, Bigelow brings attention to the Algiers Motel Incident which occurred during a race riot in Detroit. Her past two Academy Award nominated efforts made it seem like Detroit would be a contender this year. Overall, I am quite disappointed with this film and I'll tell you why.As mentioned earlier Detroit depicts the real life event at the Algiers Motel, where black men and two white women were rounded up and humiliated by cops because of gun shots fired towards police during a very heated riot. The film enlists the help of John Boyega, Will Poulter, Anthony Mackie, and an impressive Will Poulter. I did really enjoy seeing Hannah Murray in a film as well, she's a cutie. I thought Poulter was a perfect casting in this role. He impressed me, and now that I think about it his Pennywise from It may have been an interesting but successful casting if it panned out.The film mainly suffers from being too long. The incident itself, while interesting does not need to be padded. The events of the night are portrayed for far to long, and the aftermath itself loses steam fast. The performances are good but there's a real sense of just showing the story without portraying it in an impassioned way. Obviously the events of the film still resonate today and should have really rallied a reaction but the film just falls flat.I do like Bigelow as a filmmaker but she takes a misstep by recreating the events for this film. I don't expect this film to make any real splash awards season because its actually far from good. Poulter or maybe even Boyega may have an outside chance of a nomination but I don't see this film staying in memory for very long. Disappointed, but I know Bigelow will bounce back.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
"""Detroit"" is Haunting and Still Relevant","The complication about making films where we as American's show our mistreatment of black people within our own country is that too often these are the few times we see a mostly group of people of color in Hollywood films. As these films have become more financially successful, we have been able to expose the world to lesser known stories (for example Hidden Figures and this film Detroit).Detroit takes place in 1967 during the midst of the riots after a black owned Blind Pig bar where patrons were kicked out due to lack of liquor license and eventually leads to the towns people rioting and destroying the nearby businesses, even with tags of ""Soul Brother"" as a way to try to protect their black owned business. However, most of the film centers around the several young men and 2 women staying in the Algiers Motel as Carl Cooper had a starter pistol and shot in the air, as police mistaken it for a sniper, and begin to surround the Algiers and harass and intimidate the guests beyond recovery.What the director Kathryn Bigelow (Zero Dark Thirty) is create a consistent tension when seeing the scene in the motel play out, and lets the viewer view helplessly as they see the psychological harassment these young people faced against police and even marshals not even stepping in. The acting is very solid across the board, particularly Algee Smith (Ralph Tresvant in The New Edition Story) and Will Pouter (We're the Millers & Maze Runner) as a racist cop that Will performs almost too hauntingly well and could argue a Best Supporting Actor award for his performance.The film also includes Jacob Lawrence's Migration series, a 60 panel epic from the 1940's in a 3D esque animated way to explain to the audience how things got to where they area, however, I don't feel stylistically it was the right case for this kind of film narratively. The Jason Bourne-style shaky cam gets VERY jarring at times and hard to digest given there is very few moments when the cameras still, even in the quiet developmental periods. Also there's a scene early on involving Will's character with a decision he makes and how the characters handle his discipline that feels like a glaring flaw of how he could be allowed to progress in the story without giving too much away.Detroit is not a easy film to watch, nor does it desire to be. While it can serve for a good introduction for people who never heard of the riots, the film was better titled Algiers Motel as the riots is more of the backdrop and less of a history lesson.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Hyper-realistic, depressing, engrossing docudrama.","""Sniper in the window."" National Guardsman, right before the window and the little girl were fired on.The Detroit racial riots of 1967 have often been described as a war zone, and that's what director Kathryn Bigelow has done in her docudrama Detroit. Just as in The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, she has taken strife-ridden history and recreated it on the screen to such a degree of terror realism, almost hyper-realism, that ""based on a true story"" is too tame to do justice to her reenactment.That she is a Northern-California woman depicting a seminal black experience is both problematic and astonishing: ""What better way to use your white privilege than to undermine it, raise questions about it, leverage it on behalf of black and brown people who usually don't have a voice in the matter at all."" BigelowThe operative motif for me is the music hall, where, after riots were fomented by a gratuitous police raid of an unregistered black club, Martha and the Vandellas sing No Place to Hide and a young male foursome called The Dramatists wait to go on stage. The promise of the young group is shattered by police clearing the hall for safety's sake. The disintegration of social opportunity and the danger of modern racism is the heart of the unrest.The overly-long sequence at the Algiers Motel is the central violent piece, where black men and white women are rousted from the hotel, and three men are murdered by a rabid group of Detroit police with the National Guard acquiescing. The police's torture of these benign revelers, albeit one has shot a starter gun at the police from a window, looks as if the cops will eventually be exonerated of their crimes because of the riotous circumstances.More importantly, the next 50 years will be fraught with such white violence against blacks that we can all wonder what we have learned, if anything. Is racism just a part of our societal fabric? If it takes hundreds of years, equality will happen, but not 50 years out today.Bigelow and her Zero Dark Thirty collaborator writer Mark Boal, along with gifted cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, have created an unforgettable landscape of destruction and carnage right here in America. While some may complain that the up close, personal, and jiggly hand-held camera is annoying, none may criticize the realism Bigelow has created.Too real, and too possible that it may happen over and over again until we get this race thing right.",,Anonymous,History
Challenging And Disturbing; But Is This A Story For White Voices To Tell?,"Kathryn Bigelow's fact-based drama is an intense, gruelling experience that in many ways plays to her well-established strengths as a director. Over her career, she's shown herself especially adept in two areas - scenes of violence, whether they be played for thrills or more didactic purposes, and the relationships men form with each other. The first 40 minutes or so of this film set helpful context around the riots in Detroit in 1967; as a non-American, this is not a sequence events with which I was especially familiar, and the particular events at the film's centre are completely new to me. This opening segment bristles with tension, fear and effectively establishes the city as a ready to explode; the fear of the black population, their alienation from privileged whites and some disastrous policing decisions (sending in tanks especially stood out) are all given room to breathe.The bulk of the film is given over to the events inside the Algiers Motel, which resulted in policemen being charged with assault and murder. An on-screen disclaimer at the film's conclusion remarks that the facts of these events remain in dispute; but having pieced the script together from eye-witness testimony, the exhaustingly extended sequence of mental and physical torture, murder and sexual assault leaves nothing to the imagination. It's mostly shot in intimate, hand-held close-up, as if to implicate the viewer, asking us if we'd have intervened or if we'd be able to stand up to such relentless abuse. It's harrowing, enraging, upsetting stuff.The final segment touches on the trial of the policemen and hints at some of the longer-term impact on those involved, but this is more of an afterword in the light of what comes before. It's a long film, and much more would have been excessive, but the result is a conclusion that doesn't allow to grasp the fuller nature of the trauma such events leaves on the individuals and communities which experience them.Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty - about the hunt for and killing of Osama Bin Laden - was a film that felt almost wilfully misunderstood by people on all sides of the discussion around the issues it raised; one wondered if a male director would have been given more slack. It's an excellent, challenging film. Detroit doesn't function in quite the same way, and I'm left wondering why this story has to be told by a white director and writer; this is a film that purports to show us the pain and suffering of black people - but it seems to me that it's largely constructed with and for the white gaze.The performances are all good, the film's intensity unflinching; there's little discernible white saviour narrative that so often drives such stories. But still it bears something of the sense of white people trying to articulate something that we can't ever properly find words for. Does that mean the film shouldn't have been made? I don't know. It's hard to say - there's much that's good, and many like me will know much more of these events for watching it. It's a challenging, upsetting film - but it's telling a story that needs to be told in other ways also.Bigelow remains a formidable director whose work would I suspect be more widely praised were her gender different; Detroit is perhaps the film of hers that hardest to evaluate and assess.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Recommended,"​'DETROIT' - 2017Directed by Kathryn BigelowStarring John Boyega, Will Poulter and Algee SmithPlot Overview: ​In the summer of 1967, rioting and civil unrest starts to tear apart the city of Detroit. Two days later, a report of gunshots prompts the Detroit Police Department, the Michigan State Police and the Michigan Army National Guard to search and seize an annex of the nearby Algiers Motel. Several policemen start to flout procedure by forcefully and viciously interrogating guests to get a confession. By the end of the night, three unarmed men are gunned down while several others are brutally beaten.It's hard to review a film that is so harrowing and depressing. Such a barbaric and disgusting event requires the utmost of a care and compassion and empathy, and I think that Bigelow nails it. Detroit is such a hard to watch and upsetting film, that I couldn't watch it multiple times but that shouldn't represent the quality. It is a truly amazing movie that deserves the Oscar buzz it's getting. I definitely recommend it, just be preferred to squirm.Representing such a tale on screen in a semi-entertaining way(I don't mean fun) while simultaneously being respectful and poetic to the night's events is a very difficult task. And honestly, the movie may have worked better as simply a documentary. But we got a movie, and it was really good so I'm not complaining. The story for this movie is a very harsh and upsetting one, and Bigalow/the writers deal with it in the most perfect way possible. I agree with the criticism that they don't delve into WHY it happened, but I'm just happy this event was brought to modern day audiences, and those of us in the UK, who didn't study this event(not myself but others I know). Great movies that are hard to watch are things of rarity. I'm not talking about 'Saw' or whatever, that's just disgusting and hard to watch. I'm talking films that make you uncomfortable for watching them purely because of the sadness and barbaric nature of the events. That sums this movie up. I rarely squirm or avert my eyes in a film like this but for sequences in this movie, I found it challenging to not do so. Watching is difficult for points in this movie but I think that should merely serve as credit for what Bigalow has created.Now, for the performances. This movie is an ensemble cast and every single main performer does a fantastic job. Most notably, however, would probably include the likes of John Boyega, Anthony Mackie, Will Pouler and Algee Smith. While every single actor does an amazing job and draws you deeper into the world(that is unfortunately ours) that Bigalow has 'created', these four were the main ones that stood out and were memorable for me after the movie had gone of.This is pretty much the first movie I've seen that features Boyega(because I don't like Star Wars. This review'll get marked down purely for this comment I guarantee it) and after seeing him perform, I'm shocked he's not in more movies. The man was excellent in this movie.Anthony Mackie, who is perhaps most well known as 'Falcon' from the MCU, shows a different side of him that I hadn't seen before and does it masterfully. He provides such a deep and harrowing performance that I very much so hope that he appears in more dramatic roles, and doesn't get stuck in a 'Goofy sidekick' typecast.Will Poulter, formerly known as 'Eye Brows Kid', is also in this movie as a corrupt cop. And corrupt is the key word. Poulter is despicable, disgusting and destructive in his role as Krauss, and that really just shows how remarkable the performance is. I hated this guy from second one and he doesn't disappoint that initial expectation all the way through the 2 hour run time.And then there is Algee Smith. The performance Smith gave was exceptional. I mean exceptional. The man stood out among everyone else and delivered a powerful performance. I commend the performance and truly believe that he should be given a round of applause because he was so, so good in this film.The cinematography and editing are also excellent in this movie. It is a very good looking movie. I love the grittiness and grimness that make it feel like a dystopian future, which is what it was for African-Americans at the time. I do love how Bigalow has directed this movie.As for flaws, I'll say that the opening third of this movie drags on way too long and is very dull. The setup for this film is done for what feels like an eternity and they REALLY could have cut chunks of it out. That is honestly my only flaw with the movie because, apart from that, it is pretty great. I can definitely recommend it but be prepared to feel uncomfortable. It's not for the faint of heart. I'll rate Detroit 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Start and finish are good but the middle act is sensational,"Racial tension always has the potential to reach boiling point and Hollywood hasn't shied away from depicting such a thing happening over the years in films such as Do the Right Thing and Selma, neither being afraid to show just how ugly things can get when they go beyond the boiling point, often making for quite tough viewing. Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit is certainly a film that shares a lot of similarities with those two films.The Detroit riots led to days of violent public disorder back in July 1967, leaving parts of the city destroyed. During the riots, three African American men were murdered at the Algiers Motel.Bigelow's film opens with an animated prologue that explains the ethnic situation of Detroit in 1967 and wastes no time by getting straight into the matter of how the riots broke out. It's from here that Detroit took me by surprise a little, Bigelow choosing to spend the opening act of the film stringing together a number of sequences depicting crowd violence and police brutality, filmed almost in a documentary style.It feels as if there is no real narrative at this point however, I do like how it gives some context into how bad things got in the city throughout the riots. We are introduced to a number of characters but these introductions aren't drawn out at all, purposefully by Bigelow as she wants to focus more on the violence on the streets.Then, suddenly, the characters we've had brief introductions to are thrust together in difficult circumstances and this is where both Detroit and Bigelow are at their best. The central act of Detroit takes place within the Algiers Motel and it makes for one of the most intense and brutal sequences of film so far this year, the aforementioned tough viewing well and truly coming into effect. It's a bit of shame that what comes before and after doesn't feel of the same standard though otherwise we'd be talking about film of the year material right here.Coming to the performances, Detroit sees two exciting young British actors work together in John Boyega and Will Poulter however, the writing doesn't really allow both men to get a chance to shine. On one hand, Poulter is absolutely brilliant as Philip Krauss, a Detroit policeman who uses and abuses his position of authority to intimidate and humiliate those he comes across in the Algiers Motel, in a performance that will leave you seething with rage. Then there's Boyega as Melvin Dismukes, a security guard who tries to defuse the situation, who feels rather wasted which is annoying because Boyega is such a talented actor. He just doesn't really get anything to sink his teeth into, Poulter instead revelling in the chance to play such a vile character.Bigelow's Detroit is an important film, elevated by a tight central act, that feels a little underwritten in other places compared to her other work. That being said, it's still a very good film that you should see, even if you just go to witness Will Poulter's superb performance.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Detroit,"Based on a true story, and on the facts - insofar as they will ever actually be known - this is a gritty and quite depressing depiction from Kathryn Bigelow of one traumatic night in the city. It was during a night of rioting that a squad of police officers respond to reports of gunshots at a city hotel. Upon entering they discover a group of black youths, a couple of white girls - and what follows is a potent mix of racial hatred, bigotry and violence as the boys in blue leave what integrity they might have had at the door and leave again with three dead bodies and nine others savagely beaten to show for their policing efforts. Will Poulter sheds his nice but dim ""Harry Potter"" image and is really effective as the lead officer bent off exacting his own stye of justice, Ben O'Flynn also works well as his complicit sidekick and there are strong performances from Anthony Mackie, Algee Smith and from John Boyega as the state policeman trying to do his best to tread the very perilous line between law enforcer and African American. It shies not from presenting us with a ghastly human face for the spontaneous and plausible attitudes of superiority and disdain held by the polices and depicts with some menace how their captives are terrified and humiliated by the people they ought to heave been able to trust - and that extends to the ""slutty"" two white girls too. It's really one ensemble effort, the direction is taut and at time the whole thing just has a relentlessness that does make you wonder (I am not an American) how the hell this could ever have happened in a land that purported to be civilised and free (in 1967). Not an easy watch, but the events in Detroit 50-odd years ago still resonate with issues of policing and racism just a potently now, as when this is set.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Law and Disorder,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆☆ out of 5 )GRADE: A-THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Kathryn Bigalow creates a searing docudrama about racial unrest in America.SYNOPSIS: The Detroit riots of 1967 serve as the backdrop for a vicious attack on some party-goers by some police officers.JIM'S REVIEW: We see it on the news...police officers being secretly photographed using excessive force to arrest a possible lawbreaker, or the opposite viewpoint, an average citizen choosing a violent act of aggression against the police force. It's seems to be an everyday occurrence in our 21st century. Hate speech and violent actions are rampant these days, and with that comes the issue of poverty, crime, and racism underscoring the rationale. 50 years ago, that same savage behavior happened sporadically, or at least, not to our knowledge in this age of social media. Intense, manipulative, and uncompromising in its vision of racial unrest in America, Kathryn Bigelow's film, Detroit, is a harrowing look into our nation's class divide.'Just as Ava's DuVernay's epic 2015 film, Selma, looked to the past to show our present, so does this equally fine film. Yes, there will be a backlash against the film's liberal bias, or its ugly view of police brutality, or the fact that a white female director has chosen to tell this tale. But those are smoke and mirrors deflecting the real message of the film. Its social conscience prevails, even if its story is told in black and white (or black vs. white), with little gray to be seen. Both films show that black lives rarely mattered during the turbulent sixties and not much has changed with law enforcement or the court system from then to now. And that is the most telling fact, sadly proving that history continues to repeat itself.A city is a microcosm of its inhabitants. Using the Detroit riots of 1967 as its backdrop, this docudrama incorporates real life characters and events to convey its human drama. As the film begins, it's summer in the city. Temperatures are hot with no relief in sight. The police raid an unlicensed bar and its patrons are being ridiculed and threatened. A rowdy crowd gathers to watch the proceedings and a mob scene erupts in violence. The riots begin and grow over three nights. National guard troops are called in to ""calm"" the protesters.In Mark Boab's exceptional screenplay, we focus on a human drama that tragically plays out during one of those nights: In a small hotel room, some friends gather to party and forget about the turmoil that surrounds them. Stereotypes abound. The angry young Negro. The bigoted cop. The righteous African-American police officer being falsely accused (John Botega, being the heart and soul of the film). All are thrown into this melting pot called America and the hatred and prejudice boils over in the most unsettling of ways. A starter pistol goes off, bringing the police to the premises. Lead by a sadistic officer named Krauss (a menacing Will Poulter), the stage is now set for repeated acts of inhumanity and sadism.This hostage situation sequence, which becomes the riveting section of the film, includes scenes of psychological torture and brutal violence which go on for too long, making the film squirm-inducing and quite disturbing to watch. This confrontational scene is in-your-face cinema verite that engulfs the moviegoer to witness acts of cruelty that go unpunished. This is serious filmmaking about an all-too-serious subject, and the director never shies away from the events, although she does take some creative leeway with the facts to dramatize her narrative.Ms. Bigalow's direction is brilliant. She layers her narrative with such clarity and insight, establishing the incident and creating many memorable characters that are caught in the crossfire. She mixes newsreel footage with her reenactments of the crimes in such a subtle and forceful way. Production design by Jeremy Hindle, Barry Ackroyd's photography, and the editing by William Goldenberg and Harry Yoon captures these grim times vividly. The filmmakers create a realistic war zone and fill it with images that depict the conflict between racesThe film has one of the best ensembles of the year. Algee Green, Jacob Latimore, Jason Mitchell, and Anthony Mackie are terrific. Also providing excellent support are Hannah Murray, Jack Reynor, Ben O'Toole, and Kaitlyn Dever. The aforementioned Mr. Botega and Mr. Poulter are outstanding in their roles and should be garner many well-earned accolades this award season.Detroit parallels a nation at war with itself, and though the message is often preachy and overstates its position too often, the overall impact is thought-provoking if disheartening. Ms. Bigalow's tale of law and disorder will upset and stun you, but it just might open up a needed discussion about the taboo subject of racism in America that is still infecting our country today...50 years later.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Off-putting style but important story,"Set in 1960s Detroit, despite the civil rights acts being passed black anger has erupted in Detroit over various perceived injustices, the film uses a slightly strange opening narration to chart the decline of the inner city and the demise of the automobile industry. The film has an almost documentary like style to it, which I got a bit sick of after a while, the constant handheld. The fast editing too also has you thinking this is trying to be Jason Bourne or something. I will say the 1960s setting was well done through the props, the cars, the costumes and makeup. What is going on though with Hannah Murray's accent? The film has a good sense of escalation, the cops become almost crazed in their brutality while others see what's going on but don't want to step in. This is a long film, it didn't do well at the time, it is scary and depressing I suppose in equal measures, not the kind which you'll get much enjoyment from.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears,"1967. The police and black inhabitants of Detroit seem perpetually in a state of conflict, largely due to the police's biased, heavy-handed attitude towards African-Americans. This comes to a head when the police raid an unlicensed black club, causing the local residents to riot. The State Police and National Guard are called in and Detroit starts to resemble a war zone. On a fateful night, the local police round up some suspects at the Algiers Motel in connection with (what they believe is) sniper fire. The police handling of the situation soon gets out of hand.A thought-provoking drama, directed by Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty) and based on a true story. Shows quite well how police can abuse their power and not treat citizens equally, fairly or civilly. A great exposition of police brutality and racial prejudice (and, to a degree, injustice - more about that later).However, not perfect. The scenes inside the Algiers Motel are drawn out to the nth degree. The point of the scenes was made quite quickly and drawing it out just seemed like it was drawn out for the sake of it. It became rather cartoony after a while, especially the way the cops behaved.All the characters also seem so one-dimensional, either being ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"", rather than having some characters who are just going about their jobs and lives. Some of this seems to be Bigelow trying to balance the actions of some individuals with those of others within the same group, as is to say, ""Hey, they're not all like that"". For example, after escaping the Algiers Motel a black man is confronted by a police officer who turns out to be helpful and nice - too nice.With less time spent on the incident and more on the court case we could have had an incredibly powerful drama on injustice (in addition to covering the themes of racial prejudice and police brutality). Instead the injustice seems like an after-thought, with the police brutality the main focus. It would also have made for a better-paced movie - instead of the slow-fast-slowish we ended with.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Disappointing,"I give this 4 because I appreciate a director giving this era some limelight. Beyond that, there is little to like: The narrative arc was fractured - clunky and misjudged, the acting poor, the character development non-existent, it suffered significant historical inaccuracies, and was frankly boring to watch for the most part.John Boyega, although billed as a major player, was on the sidelines of this film as was every other actor except the central sadistic cop. Had an entire cinema to ourselves and still considered leaving several times. A terrible disappointment. Watch 'In the Heat of the Night' instead.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"Gripping, powerful, and hard to watch.","I can definitely see why the critical reception wasn't higher than it was (not that it wasn't favorable). I think the beginning and bookend portions of the film are flawed. I appreciate that Boal/Bigelow wanted an epilogue, I just wish it had been executed a lot better. Other than the section of the film that is the main event, it's a little clunky and messy. Still, the majority of the film is gripping, powerful, and heartbreaking. It's definitely not going to make for a super fun and light Saturday night, but I do think the film has gotten a bit lost in the shuffle among all the other Oscar contenders, unfortunately. This is definitely one of the best ensemble casts of the year, with everyone delivering really strong work. It's great to again see Jason Mitchell as a stand-out.",,Anonymous,History
harrowing tale,"It's 1967 Detroit. A police raid escalates into a full blown riot. National Guard is called in. The local police is dominantly a white force. A black singing group is forced to cancel their show and they spend the night at the Algiers Motel where they meet a couple of white girls. Policeman Philip Krauss (Will Poulter) shoots a man in the back who manages to escape. When the man is later found dead, murder charges are recommended against Krauss. Despite that, he's allowed to continue his patrol. Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega) is a grocery store security guard trying to keep the peace when a National Guard squad arrives. Sounds of gunfire from the Algiers put the group in heightened fear as everybody descend on the motel looking for a sniper.This is a harrowing true tale directed by Kathryn Bigelow. John Boyega and his character is great. Baby-faced Will Poulter delivers a compelling villain. His partner is more the traditional greasy haired racist. The band is solid with a great lead performance by Algee Smith. I do have a problem with Carl who plays the clown very broadly. I have some issues with certain moments but the whole night is a harrowing tale well told. Dismukes being arrested is a great sequence. However, the trial can get a little repetitive. I prefer the ending to wrap up quicker. With such a tough film, it's hard to sit through the extended closing act.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Bigelow gets it wrong,"I'm a huge fan of director Kathryn Bigelow and when I heard that she was making this film and when rumours leaked out that it was going to primarily be focused on the Algiers motel murders I was more excited than ever. It seemed like the perfect project for Bigelow to tackle.Unfortunately the result is a messy, gloopy, half-committed mess and Bigelow never quite succeeds at bringing to life a half-baked script.Now to start off the film is not solely focused on the Algiers Motel incident. It's a film in three parts, the first dealing with the start of the riots in Detroit, the second zeroing in on the terror at the Algiers, and the third showing the trial that happened as a result of the Algiers murders.Right away Bigelow gets it wrong. The rioting that took place is poorly explained and she and writer Mark Boal actually mostly shows the start of the riots from the perspective of the police, bizarrely making it seem like rioters were just interested in looting despite the fact that there were multiple reasons why they were angry and lashing out. As a result the first third of the movie is just like a noxious clash of violence and terror as Bigelow introduces and obliterates so many characters, the violence seeming random and unending and not in a good way. The final third of the movie is similarly sloppy; I've seen court room dramas handled with more grace, and subtlety on Law & Order.However the middle section, at the Algiers, is where most of the pieces come together. If there's one thing to trust Bigelow on it's scenes of torture and she spares nothing when it comes to these scenes. Now I've heard criticism saying that these scenes amount to torture porn and I disagree, the violence in this section is necessary to show just how brutal what happened was. Bigelow isn't glorying in the moment but she isn't flinching away from it either. This happened and she wants her audiences to know it and understand it and feel angry and hurt and ashamed because of it.Unfortunately the rest of the movie just doesn't rise to the level of the middle section leaving the film as a half-baked mess. Only because Bigelow is such a talent is the film still somewhat worthwhile to watch because despite everything there is much to criticize and some to admire.The best parts of the movie are the cast (almost uniformly stellar but Anthony Mackie, Algee Smith, John Boyega and Jacob Latimore are standouts) and the costumes. There may not be many speaking roles for women in the film but there were a lot of women extras and the clothes they wear are FANTASTIC.A missed opportunity from Bigelow.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Bigelow applies her usual style, and produces probably her best film yet","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningJuly, 1967. The small town of Detroit in Michigan has erupted in a fireball of chaos and violence. In the middle of all this, a group of young African American musicians are hoping to get their moment in the spotlight and perform to a crowd at a local music venue, only for their show to be cancelled and to be forced home by the police like everyone else. They find themselves holed up in the Algiers hotel, but after a reckless shot is fired from a window, they are all rounded up by Officer Krauss (Will Poulter) and his men, in a bid to ascertain the shooter that leaves three of them dead by the end of the night. It's up to Officer Raymond Dismukes (Will Poulter) to keep the peace and prevent any further loss of life.One of only a handful of female directors in the Hollywood sphere, Kathryn Bigelow has a distinctive style that she's established as her own. Whichever project she's brought to life on the screen, you know it's one of her films you're watching when you're right up close and personal in the action, fully immersed in whatever dramatisation is unravelling on the screen as though you're one of the characters sharing the events. Here, she's shone a spotlight on a particular incident in America's heavily fractured racial history, occurring at the height of the Civil Rights movement and massive social upheaval and change. The tensions of the time elevate the material to an even higher level than it's already managed.It's a depiction of events that occurred fifty years ago, and the half a century mark might have had some impact on Bigelow's decision to bring it to the big screen. But it's a quirky kind of fate that such a historical event is being portrayed at a time where racial divides seem to be springing up again, whether imagined or factual. But unlike the phoney grievances spouted by the likes of the militant, lawless BLM and ANTIFA today, this comes from a time when the AA population really did face massive prejudice and discrimination, and really did have a fight on their hands, and it's to Bigelow's credit that it doesn't feel like she's forcing any leftist narrative down our throats, and lets events unfold as she's interpreted them.Performances wise, as the bad guy, Poulter does look a little too baby faced to be taken entirely seriously in such a serious, commanding role, but that's not to say his delivery is without impact, showcasing a hot headed, bigoted lawman who knows he's got authority and abuses it to out-pour his controlling, bullying nature. The rest of the main cast, made up of a raft of current, trendy black talent, including Boyega and Anthony Mackie, are the cowed, powerless rounded up suspects, with the exception of Boyega, as the level headed lawman who must keep his cool in this tough situation. It's from a different time, one most of us can only imagine, and go by what we've learned. And hopefully, we all have. *****",10.0,Anonymous,History
Civil rights in a time of illiberal justice....,"It's quite common for a film to be released just as the political environment fits its underlying story. Just as the recent far-right marches have gathered attention in the US, this film highlights a racially toned note of the abuse of power.Based on a true story, we have here one night in Detroit when riots are underway and the army and police are out in force. A laddish prank leads to a unit of militant and aggressive white policemen doling out their brand of abusive 'justice' to a group of young black men and their two white lady companions in a hotel.It's an uncomfortable watch. Filmed mostly in a hand-held and documentary style (without any amateurism) we feel like one of the bodies on the ground as we watch the policemen way overstep their line, and sadly there is no hero to fly in to save anyone.The story is an indictment of the US justice system at the time, and covers many different aspects, however there are too many underlying themes that are best left for a more appropriate forum.If there is a criticism, and it's fair to raise the point, then it is that the film is very partisan. Going by the high level notes, we can't disagree but rights & wrongs will have been done on both sides, but that does not in any way condone the actions of the policemen in this story.We have a myriad of characters, with Will Poulter at the lead policemen in the unit standing out as the racist, angry and brutal aggressor. The whole set of supporting actors perfectly fits this harrowing story.I'd recommend this, when it comes to award time this will stand out for various reasons. Should hopefully help to ignite some good discussions too.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A Dark, Shocking, And Haunting Vision Of One Of The Most Vile Moments In America's Past.","""Detroit,"" is based on the true story of the 1967 12th Street Riots and Algiers Hotel Incident in Detroit and is brought to us by the writing/directing team of Mark Boal and Katheryn Bigolow, who brought us ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" two admittedly overrated movies but two that are still very good in their own right. If there was a team to adapt this true story this is the team to do it. ""Detroit,"" isn't the best of the trio, nor is it the best movie of the year, but it is up there in my top ten.The performances were really good in this movie. John Boyega gives another really great performance in the movie, as Star Wars has really launched him into stardom and he continues to shine in everything he has been in. Anthony Mackie was also really good in his short amount of screen time, as he has been good in all his other previous performances as well. The standout here is Will Poulter as the head police officer trying to ""control"" the situation in the hotel, and my god, was his performance Oscar worthy. He captured evil, vile, vicious, and violent nature of his character who is a total racist prick. After seeing him in a handful of other movies, i really made nothing of his acting talent but the guy has a strong potential, and easily gave one of my favorite performances of the year (though I DO NOT condone anything his character did).The entire second act of this movie, an hour long sequence inside the Algiers Motel, was one of the most intense, gut-wrenching, shocking, and haunting things I have ever seen. Even though there isn't much in the way of character development for this film, you really feel for the characters regardless. It is a terrible situation that these victims were put into, and it makes you disgusted as a human being to watch another human being do this to another human being. It speaks volumes about the consequences of racism not only in past society, but in today's society as well.The minimal musical score and camera-work really add to the realism of the entire situation and gives the viewer the sense that they are right there, watching the situation unfold right before their eyes, unable to do anything to prevent the said events from happening. It's harrowing, dark and disturbing. The camera work is all hand-held, and the editing is pristine that when the camera starts to get shaky it is edited in a way where you can still understand what is going on, similar to the style of filming in ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty."" For almost the entirety of the runtime, there is no musical score.The first act felt like it could have been a tad shorter, but at the same time it provided background for those viewers, like myself, who were unfamiliar with the situation so that viewers could get a better sense of what was happening in the city of Detroit at the time.My only major complaint with the movie is that it feels a little too dragged out at the end. It has the ""Return Of The King"" ending, and could've honestly been 15 or 20 minutes shorter.This is a movie that impacted me deeply, made me disgusted as a human being that racism was and still is a prominent problem in society today. It was a dark and disturbing portrait of a terrible moment in American history. this is a movie that will spark conversations about the entire situation and the consequences of racism long after credits, in a manner similar to how ""American History X"" made you think after the credits.I am going to give ""Detroit"" an A.For a further in depth analysis of the film check out my review on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAIMbghP7BA",9.0,Anonymous,History
Reigning Oscar Award Winning Filmmakers Looking for more Nominations,"The story wasn't proved enough to have a movie made after it. You knew what this would be just by the title.

The makers of this film made it with the assumption that it'd be Oscar bait, and that's the exact reason why it isn't. They knew the story they told wasn't proved enough to be 100% true but they labeled it as a true story and went with the project anyways. It ran longer than it could've but it held my interest. the acting is spectacular, especially Poulter's performance. Directing and cinematography were good too, but keep in mind this story is impossible to depict because the events that took place in the motel were only seen by the people who were in it; they could only resemble the the scenes in the motel based on the victims' perspectives and a few documents. The scenes might not be 100% accurate, but they teach us of the danger racism brings upon the world, and that's a pretty important lesson in today's world.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Don't believe in white privilege?,"Don't believe? Don't think that racially motivated police violence is a thing? Then open your eyes and see this movie. White cops terrorizing black civilians has been a problem for decades, not just with Rodney King, not just the incidents that have flooded social media since Trayvon Martin. This sort of thing is embedded in America's history.I am a native of Detroit, and even I had never understood the severity of this incident, and the depths of racism within the Detroit Police Department back then. Real life incidents in the modern south mirror exactly this sort of situation. Each of the officers involved in this situation was acquitted multiple times, and walk free to this day.Is that justice? In many ways, the timeliness of this movie makes these modern incidents impossible to ignore in a discussion of what it depicts. Justice is not seen for victims. They suffer and die and have no recourse.And as is seen in this film, there are no heroes. There's nobody standing up for the victims in the Algiers. There's nobody walking in to save them from the oppression they're facing. There's only the cops wielding their power with impunity, vengeance ahead of justice. Anthony Mackie and John Boyega play two tremendous pop-culture heroes, but neither one of them is rising up to stop the madness in this film, because it didn't happen. Only other situations saved these people from further embarrassment, injury and death.The film is buoyed by amazing performances from its principal actors, and under Bigelow's stark, realistic direction, we can see the gritty hours of danger that these people lived through, and can empathize with those who had to endure it.It is a hard film, a difficult subject to tackle for a crew, and even for the audience to watch, as it is easy to become uncomfortable watching these events, knowing they really happened. It is almost like watching the SS terrorizing Jews in Nazi Germany. But it is a viewing that should be undertaken, because the understanding and clarity that a viewer can get out of it can change a person's entire perspective on race and police violence.Will this movie change he country? Probably not. But if it opens even a few eyes to what our society is and has been, its job will be done.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Important story to tell no doubt, but as a film it's a disappointment","An important story to tell no doubt, but as a film it's a disappointment in my opinion.Of course I cared for the characters from the first second due to the obvious subject matter, but that's as far as I ever got. It's a long 143 minutes, with one scene in particularly lasting an age without really doing much; except the final act of it. A film needs to do more, if this was a documentary - even a docudrama - then fair enough but it isn't.It also wastes a pretty top notch cast. John Boyega is in this, portraying Melvin Dismukes. The amount of times he's just there standing around doing nothing is frustrating, he has a few moments where he gets to act and you can see his phenomenal talent - especially one time where you see the effect of events on Melvin - but that's about it. A waste.Similar can be said for Anthony Mackie, star of one of my favourite films in 'The Adjustment Bureau'. He plays such a minor role, you cast someone like Mackie you gotta use him more surely?Will Poulter gets most of the screen time. He's good I guess, not sure we need to see quite as much of him as we do - given his character is an open/shut case. Elsewhere, you have other familiar faces like Tyler James Williams (shoutout Noah) and John Krasinski.I don't intend to crap on this film. It's clearly well made, has great intentions and relays a notable story. I'm just disappointed with the end product, I judge films as films and 'Detroit' is rather underwhelming.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Remember the Excellence of Near Dark and Strange Days? Forget it,"Long gone are the days in which Katryn Bigelow was concerned with doing original subjects and/or good action movies, now we have the socially-concerned ""documentarian"" that mistakes ""reality"" with a shaky cam spit on the viewer's face every two seconds and ultra-boring plot renditions that go nowhere. This is not how you do a documentary, young jedi. Avoid at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Overlong, but draws real power from a harrowing centrepiece","For her latest feature, following 2008's Oscar winner The Hurt Locker and 2012's Zero Dark Thirty, visionary director Kathryn Bigelow takes us to a different war-zone altogether, the 1967 Detroit riots. While it lacks the nerve-racking tension of the Iraq-set The Hurt Locker and the engrossing detail of the hunt for, capture and execution of Osama bin Laden in Zero Dark Thirty, Detroit lays bare police brutality and civil unrest with all the discomfort of a well-made horror movie, as the paths of various characters caught up in the chaos sweeping the city lead to the Algiers Motel, where many are about to experience the most traumatic experience of their lives, and for some, the last experience they will ever have.Bigelow attempts to contextualise the central incident by depicting the roots of the rioting: An illegal blind pig in a black Detroit community is raided by predominantly white police, who take an unnecessarily heavy-handed approach to rounding up the bar's inhabitants. A small crowd quickly starts to gather outside, and soon enough the police are being driven out of the area, and neighbourhood shops are being destroyed and looted. Both the Army and National Guard are brought in to bring the troubles under control, while Detroit police hunt down any looters hoping to go unnoticed in the crowds. It's a good thirty minutes before we reach the Motel, and this time is spent establishing the various characters who will become major players later on. These characters are painted in broad strokes, but it's effective enough in establishing the kind of world they inhibit, and why they have good reason to fear the sight of a policeman, innocent or not.At the film's heart is Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega), a security guard caught somewhere in between two worlds. He is a figure of authority and takes his job incredibly seriously, but he's also black in an institution made up of mainly white folks, so he finds himself also having to toe the line when dealing with officers clearly harbouring racist feelings. There's also Larry Reed (Algee Smith), the lead singer of R&B group The Dramatics, whose big-break concert is cancelled because of the riots. Larry takes his friend Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore) to the Algiers Motel to lay low while the riots calm down, and the two pass the time by chatting to two girls (played by Hannah Murray and Kaitlyn Dever). The girls are actually prostitutes, and the group wind up caught up in a prank involving firing a blank-shooting starter pistol at the police through the window. Believing to be under attack from a sniper, the police and National Guard storm the Motel and begin a night of humiliation and terror for those simply caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.At the Motel, cop and baby-faced bigot Krauss (Will Poulter) starts to systematically strip away the humanity of the residents, using everything from intimidation, violence and mind-games to find the lethal weapon that doesn't exist. Flanked by Ben O'Toole and Jack Reynor, Poulter is magnificent, digging deep to somehow find a shred of humanity in a character so inherently evil. As is Boyega, who manages to hit you with a gut-punch during the final act as the seriousness of the situation - and his role in it - suddenly overwhelms him. The film goes on to detail the immediate aftermath and the subsequent trial of the three police officers, bringing in an unnerving slimy John Krasinski as the defence. At just shy of two and a half hours, Detroit feels overlong despite Bigelow's best efforts to keep the film moving at a pace. The final half hour could have been wrapped up in text, but it does pay testament to the survivors, some of whom were left with mental scars from which they would never fully recover. Detroit's real power stems from the harrowing, maddening centrepiece at the Algiers, a terrible abuse of power not terribly different from some of the news stories we still hear about today.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"gritty, in-your-face, hard to watch as it should be.","With Detroit, ostensibly about one night of terror that cops bring on a group of black men (and two white women) after a toy gun goes off as tensions are high during the 67 riots, Bigelow returns to the horror genre. The vampires are gone - you cant compare them to cops. It's shot in a documentary style, but its content brings it into a realm of the visceral disgust of the and in the human spirit. The cast gets to show themselves as human beings before the living nightmare takes hold - even, to the extent the movie can allow Will Poulter, who is the quintessential young-racist cop devaluing his position to that of a terrorist after realizing he won't get support from his superiors (when we first see him he shoots a man stealing groceries in the back, killing him) - so that only makes it much worse.It's showing the dark side of the American character; Night of the Living Dark Thirty (it also seems like an unintentionally poetic irony that it's the Algiers motel, ala the Pontecorvo film, to which Bigelow and Boal owe a debt). Like their previous 2012 film, it looks at torture and justice, but here its less ambiguous where its intentions and spirit lies. It may not be subtle, but this subject isn't supposed to be, and there's no such thing as indifference when it comes to the shock of oppressors and the oppressed. Like Romero's film, it's intention is to make you feel like there's not a moment of breath to be had. It's a reality that provokes with the underlying point (especially at whites): what the hell is going to be done about this?One fault: its too long. Or, more approximately, it almost feels like the movie is over by the time its at the last 20 minutes. We know where this train is headed because its the same goddamned train American police have been riding on in the courts when it comes to violence and murder. Trim maybe 15 minutes and it could be a masterpiece.As it stands its really good and perhaps so strong a tonic that its hard to see wanting to experience more than once. At the same time I can understand it rubbing some as too much; the review on Rogerebert.com went as far as to say it was not right for a white person/white people to make it. I totally get this being upsetting - but I put it to you (and I know I started this review comparing it to other works by Bigelow, notably her breakthrough Near Dark but that's just me): if you didn't know it was directed by a 65 year old white woman and written by a white (former) journalist, would that stand out? Does it truly make a mark against this all? I don't buy it.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Devastatingly Phenomenal,"I saw this movie about a week ago, right after the events that took place in Charlottesville. I think that certainly added to the visceral and emotional reaction I had while watching Detroit. Bigelow made a really smart decision in containing and isolating the story. I thought this movie would be covering the entire Detroit riots, but instead it focuses on one individual experience. This allowed me to become very attached to these specific characters, and to feel the true weight of this one experience. And this one experience really does help define and give context to not only these riots, but to the formation of such things as the Black Lives Matter movement that is happening today. This was a really smart direction to take the story in, and it absolutely pays off. The performances are all fantastic. Algee Smith and Jacob Latimore are actors I'm not very familiar with, but they did excellent jobs leading this movie. I thought John Boyega would be the lead, and he's not. He takes a much more subdued role, but it works in that it allows Smith and Latimore to really shine. Boyega is good in this, but I don't think he was given enough to do for us to truly see just what he's capable of as an actor. I'm glad he's getting roles outside of Star Wars, but I still think we have yet to see the full extent of Boyega's acting capabilities...",9.0,Anonymous,History

Amazing filmmaking. But I don't care.,"Bigelow has the artistry to, in every one of her films, put us in dangerous immersive situations. Her paradox is that we never really care.

Gorgeous cinematography, gorgeous editing, gorgeous acting, a master class in filmmaking. But I don't care enough to go further. I want real caring. I'll have to go elsewhere.

Kathryn Bigelow is on a roll.  Three classics in a row.  This may be the best.,"It's fair to say that Kathryn Bigelow is on a roll.Her last three movies (Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty and now Detroit) have been gut busting horror shows about the human condition.I love that Kathryn Bigelow sits in the 'male' directors' chair. I love hat she must be and should be a feminist icon, because she does the sort of movies that she makes much better than most men make them.Kathryn Bigelow likes an explosion, a gun, a death. But her female perspective on this raises it from guts and gory/glory into something higher. Something more profound.Zero Dark Thirty and The Hurt Locker both took on war as the subject matter. This does too, but it's the war of the races. The war of oppression by white men upon black in the Summer of Love.Ironic, because this is a film about hate. Racism. Supremacy.It opens with a short animation that perfectly encapsulates America's fundamental tic. The thing that won't go away. The displacement of race. From the displacement of American Indians to the displacement of Africans to the slave plantations of the Deep South and latterly their displacement into the Northern industrial cities like Detroit.This displacement, in fact, displaces the white ruling class into the suburbs and that's the start of deep tension and resentment.We have witnessed this in the UK too, as gentrification of once unfashionable districts has displaced both black and white working classes into modern day ghettos. And it ain't stopping any day soon.What Bigelow achieves with this movie is a political calling cry to any liberal minded decent human being, regardless of colour or creed. It vilifies the atrocious white police force of late sixties Detroit (Yet, I don't think Detroit itself was much different from other places – there were riots in Harlem for instance and we all know about 1980's LA).She creates an almost documentary feel that is more 4D than any of the 4D Sh!t you'll see in multiplexes. Because this is for real.Apart from the relatively well known John Botega (brilliant thank you) her massive ensemble cast is star-free. That's kinda how she rolls.But each and every one of the 20 or so leads (yes 20) will have had life-affirming, and early career defining, roles in this epic.But one stands out above all else in this majestic movie.Will Poulter.The actual devil incarnate.Were he real, not an actor, he should rot in hell. But he's only an actor and his performance is surely Oscar worthy. You simply despise this evil racist bastard. And he is unflinching in his evilness. The smirk at the end of the movie almost gets you out of your seat.This is a truly great movie. A movie that should be syllabus material on any High School history course.Kathryn Bigelow and her team (especially writer Mark Boal) deserve all the awards that this movie will hopefully receive.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Compelling stories don't always makes great movies,"This may be better suited to a TV mini series because it had a good setup, harrowing story but a rushed ending that lost its impact.Bigelow direction, with the real film of the riot cut in, is impactful but somehow we sacrifice character for story in a movie that is a little underwritten.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Disappointing: Not The Actors' Fault,"Let me be very clear; the actors in this film are top-notch, but they were directed and handed scripts by amateurs. The writing is horrendous, and as another astute reviewer noticed (Mr. Crowford), this film was not realistic in the time frame it was supposed to be in. In addition to the authenticity issue, I found the stereotypes of whites in the film to be offensive, although mildly amusing. Of course, we are used to seeing stereotypical black characters portrayed in several films, and we usually recognize them when they appear. One token ""good"" police officer does not get the job done for accuracy. There were several dozen white (and black) officers hurt during these riots; not one of their characters were examined.The actors do the best they can with the very shallow script, and I was impressed with several of them, but they sounded like kids at a high school play in several scenes because of the script and indecisive directing. This film could have been so much better, but when political hijacking takes over good filmmaking techniques, it usually results in an inferior product.Arthur H Tafero AskMrMovies",5.0,Anonymous,History

Provocative fact-based drama,"An American drama; A story about a group of rogue police officers who respond to a complaint with apparent retribution rather than justice in mind, launching a raid on a group of African-Americans. Public anger reaches a peak after the incident as relationships sour with authority. Detroit is a dramatisation of a tragic chapter from America's past, a provocative period piece. More than 40 people died during the so-called ""Detroit Rebellion,"" most of them African Americans; many were shot by the police or national guardsmen. The writers aimed to convey the underlying truth. Any viewer aware that the film takes poetic license will have some doubt about what is true and what isn't. It's an immersive experience that places the viewer at the heart of the unfolding chaos. The cinematography is brilliant. Vintage lenses are used to capture multi-angle digital footage, interweaving seamlessly with archive material. However, there isn't an authenticity to the dialogue, a charge that the screenwriter accepted. John Boyega gives a careful performance as the security guard who is caught between his race and his uniform. Will Poulter succeeds in characterising a corrupt, racist cop, 'Officer Krauss', a fictional character said to be a combination of a number of different officers from the Detroit Police Department who were present at the Algiers Motel that night. Detroit isn't immune from its critics. It is told in a mode disengaged from the cultural and systemic forces in America that led to that kind of police brutality in 1967. Leaving the viewer feeling angry was the director's intention, and it succeeded.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Bigelow's masterpiece,"I've said it before and sadly I have a feeling I'll be saying it until the day I die but there are times when I've felt ashamed to be white, ashamed to belong to a race that over the centuries have felt they are not only superior to people of other ethnic backgrounds but have a right to kill them as well. Racists may be in a minority but in the overall scheme of things they represent a large minority and rather than stand up to them, often a blind eye is turned. Silence, tragically, gives consent.Watching ""Detroit"" I felt ashamed and at times I felt physically sick. I was upset and I was angry. Kathryn Bigelow's magnificent new film is not specifically about the Detroit riots that occurred 50 years ago; the riots form the backdrop to a film about one incident when three racist white police officers shot dead three Afro-Americans in a motel. It's a film that doesn't hide its anger; about as even-handed as Bigelow gets is in showing that, while the riots themselves were the direct result of racism, particularly on the part of the police, both sides were culpable in the outbreak of lawlessness that followed. But then Bigelow gets down to the business of showing just how one-sided the events that occurred at the motel were. The police, and one officer in particular, (Will Poulter in Oscar-worthy form), are clearly monsters and the victims wholly innocent. The National Guard are bystanders who don't want to get involved while John Boyega's black security guard is caught helplessly in the middle, (at one point he's described as an Uncle Tom; he doesn't object).Tragically, ""Detroit"" is not about events that just happened 50 years ago but which have been happening throughout America on a regular basis ever since, so Bigelow can't be accused of simply opening up old wounds. Still, there will be people who will say she should have left well enough alone and will ask if we really need a movie like ""Detroit"" at the present time. Unfortunately I believe we do and until such time when this kind of racism is totally eradicated we will always need movies like ""Detroit"".Will it draw an audience, both in America and internationally? Will the prize-givers award it with the Oscars it so richly deserves? In a just world, and we know this isn't, Bigelow, scenarist Mark Boal and cameraman Barry Ackroyd would all be honoured. In the end, of course, it hardly matters, (though I would like to see the film get the audience it deserves); that it was made at all speaks volumes and gives credence to mainstream American cinema.

A fictitious version of real events.,"This film is what is called a dramatization, which is in keeping with the old the tag line ""based on a true story."" There was indeed an incident at the Algiers, and three young men died. Exactly what happened that night has been researched and debated for fifty years. Half a century and nobody can tell the actual story with certainty. This film gives one version, but that is not based on good evidence, it is a theory of what may have happened, and fictionalized to make for more exciting cinema.I would give this movie a 10 as a propaganda piece, zero as a documentary, but more than one star for good acting which is unfortunately countered by inauthentic locations. The Algiers is gone, but much of 1968 Detroit is still there, and if you are going to build a set there is plenty of space in Motown, yet the filmmakers did it in Massachusetts and missed the opportunity to include as much authentic Detroit scenery and the presentation of real Detroit people as could be done with a film set 50 years ago.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Overall, the piece is unfocused and ultimately too big, but the central set-piece is tense, compelling and vigorous.","As a whole, 'Detroit (2017)' is too unfocused and too big for what it is trying to achieve, with the first act standing almost entirely alone from the following two and feeling sort of superfluous in the overall narrative. The central set-piece - and even, to a lesser extent, its much slower aftermath - is compelling, vigorous stuff that's unrelenting in its tension and urgency, though. It never just feels like one race against another, but rather humans placed in a situation where good and evil are shown in shades of grey. If you're even remotely human, the brutality and oppression of the piece will make your blood boil and the flick pulls no punches when it comes to the injustice on display. The lack of any comeuppance almost feels like a lack of narrative closure - you truly want to see the perpetrators punished, and this alone is an achievement - but instead it simply emulates the messy and unfulfilling way that life often works. While the story mightn't be entirely accurate to the real-life scenario (the events of which were never accurately established in court), it does work as an examination of what could have happened in a terrible situation that took the lives of three young men, one which is still scarily relevant today. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

The Characters of 'Detroit' Could Use Some Fleshing Out,"My biggest gripe about ""Detroit"" is that the screenplay fails to fully develop its four characters featured on the movie poster. Instead the intersection of Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega), Greene (Anthony Mackie), Larry Reed (Algee Smith) and Philip Krauss (Will Poulter) occurs with little background information to flesh out any of the characters. Despite this, John Boyega turns in a solid performance, displaying flashes of Sidney Poitier (think Virgil Tibbs from ""In the Heat of the Night"") and Denzel Washington. Will Poulter is convincing as the dastardly horrific, torturous police officer Philip Krauss.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Detroit is yet another hard hitting factual based drama from Kathryn Bigelow.,"I'm starting to fall in love with her. Zero Dark Thirty is one of the best films of this century and does not get enough credit. Detroit, although not in that league, is still absolutely powerful in every aspect. A film that both informs and thrills the audience of the 1967 Algiers Motel raid in Detroit. An event that is not talked about much, documents and footage of the raid have been scarce and so consequently there are scenarios that are dramatised. This added drama is what prevents Detroit from being a documentary reenactment. It's a clear three act narrative. The first act plays out like a documentary, educating viewers about the riots of Detroit. The second act is the genre shift to a thriller, the motel raid. The third act is the courtroom drama that deals with the legal aftermath. Sure, it's mechanical...but Bigelow directs the heck out of this which is why it feels so raw and powerful. Her directing style is frantic. Constant shakiness and zooming, it involves the viewer...draws them in. An event like this cannot be handled with care and fluffiness. No, it needed to be brutal and Bigelow was the perfect choice. If a film dealing with racism and/or segregation makes me angry inside, it's done its job. If the film does that and engages me throughout its run time...well we have ourselves a home run. Aside from Bigelow being a standout, Will Poulter deserves a lot of recognition. He's come a long way in recent years and believe this is his best performance. John Boyega also gives an understated performance. The violence is savage, but it needed to be. Someone gets hit, you are also going to feel it. My only one criticism is that the ending dragged. When your second act is a thriller, your third act consequently will slow down in pace and unfortunately it slowed down too much. Still compelling, just more at ease. I suspect Detroit will be overlooked during Awards season. It's a shame because this is a powerful important film that has outstanding direction and some strong performances.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"10 minutes in, its breathless","Just finished watching this amazing film by the director who also legitimised torture in her previous film. Perhaps this is her attempt to redeem herself. Regardless, she has created a film that takes a large-scale drama (the Detroit riots) and manages to convincingly bring our focus into a chamber drama with an insanely bigoted white cop and a bunch of accidental hotel guests (with just two exceptions - you guessed it - black). As a film it takes your breath away with the suspense that just keeps building. As a portrait of 1967 USA, it also seems on the money ( though that is hard for me to judge other than from what I happen to know of history).

Rightfully As Distressing As Horror Flicks,"In Detroit, Kathryn Bigelow & Mark Boal dramatizes the Algiers Motel incident from the 1967 Detroit Riots, and delivers this pristinely, ushering a harrowing, even sickening watch experience. Yes, the dynamic director-writer combo behind captivating war-dramas such as Zero Dark Thirty, conveys on screen this tragic chapter of America's history, immersing their audiences to the brutal, traumatizing reenactments that doesn't seem to spare any ounce of distressing detail. The staging of the tortures, the mock executions, and the ensuing torment from their victims brims with praise-worthy authenticity, capturing not just the bleakness of this single horrifying incident, but the overall SORRY state of escalating racism, that draws discomforting parallels to the present. Damn.Of course, the performances from Detroit demands mention, as John Boyega, Algee Smith and Will Poulter breathes life to the central characters flawlessly. Boyega for instance, captures the powerless & the confused, in constant conundrum on his role & participation, and amazingly does so through facial expressions alone. Smith on the other hand, oozes with charisma and talent, elevating the tragedy when the horrors come bearing down on his crowd-pleasing, reachable persona. As for the picture's depiction of straight up inhumanity, Will Poulter delivers. He is unrelentingly intense, unpredictable and reeks of dangerous tendencies, offering that overly familiar, terrorizing caricature of a prejudiced policeman.Overall, Detroit is a riveting horror-picture disguised as a period drama. Here, Bigelow unapologetically places her audience right smack in the middle of this mindset-forming, brutal episode, and through superb filmmaking and finely-acted, realized characters, the torments are deeply perceived.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Intense Flavours,"Watching Detroit I realised a few things. not in the usual manner. but in a way that could come across as strange. going to Rio to see it with a Dutch girl, that was seemingly into different types of experiences, Detroit blew both our minds. it's an intense film. barely any of the film is set in any other place but a hallway and a room.it's a distinct claustaphobic feel that makes this film so engrossing and dark. but i prefer the darkness, at times. darkness in films is a notion often wasted on perception. but that's a whole other thought. but it really is. what is darkness? sometimes i can watch something someone found extremely dark and see complete humour. but hear there is no real humour, to be honest. a McQueen film has bits of humour but this doesn't really have any. it's documentary esque. as race is the primary concern here. and it's brutal.this is the type of film that makes a person really think. what is governance? what is corruption? and again, what is race?when we finished watching this film we both were utterly in deep emotional paralysis. and walked down the road in slight funk. i soon left for a trip to Marrakesh and this film haunted. it's a film that i wouldn't want to waste the words good or bad on. it's needed. it's important. and once it starts it will have you consumed. you'll shed a tear, as the ending is sop dramatic. not to giveaway anything but verdict! wow... anyway I'm going to honestly get back to this breakfasty meal but solid film.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The film follows the racially charged violence of Detroit '67 that sadly highlights how little has changed,"In July 1967 tensions run high between the Afro-American community and the Detroit Police Department. After the police aggressively break up a party, a race riot breaks out in the city lasting for several days. A group of friends and two white girls have fun at the Algiers Motel. When the police believe there is an active sniper coming from the motel, the police subject their captives to psychological torture that leaves three young black men dead.Kathryn Bigelow's film is undoubtedly controversial and would inevitably open up old wounds. This film gives both a sense of flavour and the political clinate of the period, as well as demonstrating how little has actually changed.Much of the film, from the opening animated prologue to the Algiers Motel incident itself where a large part of the film's tension sits is a drama ride. What actually happened on the night at the motel is still sketchy, but Bigelow's film gives both a vivid and compelling account of events. But what the film doesn't tell us is actually how little has changed, but allows the viewer to think for themselves. Meanwhile, the background story of the vocal group, The Dramatics look for a deal with the Motown label while we see them waiting to go on the stage after Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, the image of 60s Detroit many are sure to prefer to remember. More could have been made of the subsequent trial, but an otherwise solid film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Vidiot Reviews...,"DetroitRioting nowadays only occurs when a sports team loses the championship.However, as this drama reminds us, riots were once used to protest injustice.In the wake of a police raid on an African-American club in 1967 Detroit, Governor Romney dispatches the National Guard to help local authorities contain the looting on 12th Street.When shots are fired from a nearby motel, overzealous officer Philip Krauss (Will Poulter), his fellow guardsmen and a private security guard, Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega), violently interrogate the black occupants to find the shooter.Matters escalate when two white girls are assaulted in Krauss' twisted game.A chilling tale of police brutality that still holds true today, this well-acted and heart wrenching depiction of actual people and events is hard to watch at times, but harder still to ignore.Furthermore, be sure to always carry a box of donuts with you to avoid police harassment.

"I love the D,  so I hate that I disliked this film.","People are writing that it's mostly fictitious, which actually makes sense because the fact that so many people were remaining silent and taking a beating for a moron who caused the incident and was already dead was absolutely baffling.I'm white and from the Detroit suburbs. I've lived in L.A. for the last ten years. I know that this film is about a tragedy that occurred during the '60s (when I wasn't even alive), but I want to state that the Detroit and Michigan police in general--black, white, Asian, etc.-- were FAR kinder to me and much more scrupulous than the scum who patrol the streets in Los Angeles (almost totally white and hispanic), which is another thing that annoys me tremendously-- the racism of assuming that American white cops are supremacists who never abuse white citizens.This film is also obscenely long. I have made several short films, so I knew precisely which parts should have been cut out-- everything from meaningless shots to forced acting.Will Poulter is a remarkable actor, though. He was great in The Revenant, and he steals the show in this film. Anthony Mackie is an awesome talent as well.But overall, I just couldn't justify sitting in a theater for almost 2 1/2 hours while I and everyone around me had the same thought during 2 of those hours-- JUST TELL THEM THAT THE DEAD IDIOT DID IT.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Don't forget to breathe,I just finished the film & my stomach is still taut . The performances were engrossing & I was repulsed by the behavior of the cops but could not turn away from the portrayal. I liken this to watching Mississippi Burning .....it conjures up all types of emotions. Several people have written that the story tells of what happened but doesn't delve into the why of it.

An all too real depiction of American racism in the 60s, which you may draw parallels with to the present day.If anything, the court case felt like an add on and I would've liked to have seen more of it, having invested time in caring about the outcome.A solid, enjoyable and at times shocking 7 out of ten",7.0,Anonymous,History

Good film but not a perfect one.,"In July 1967, racism and segregation in the city of Detroit led to riots between black people and the police. In only a few days many people were injured or arrested and building were destroyed. The movie takes place during these riots in the Algiers motel. The film is based on a true story. During the night, some policeman entered the motel and pointed to black men with their gun. Tje acting was good because the actors were well selected for playing these characters. I didn't really like the music because althaugh the singing of the characters was not really bad but the background music was not good at all. There are several good scenes but the main scene was too slow and too long. In general the pace of that movie was really slow. I like the film, the action, the plot and the atmosphere yet there are some defaults like the pace and the music. So this movie was good but far from to being perfect.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Real and Brutal,"Detroit (2017) is directed by Kathryn Bigelow, director of The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, and revolves around the Detroit riots in 1967. Tensions between white and blacks has reached an all-time high, and the film follows a hectic and violent incident between white police officers and black men at the Algires Motel one night during the riots.Detroit is a bleak, depressing and brutal depiction of a group of racist police officers and how flawed the American judicial system was in the 60's. Kathryn Bigelow paints a nightmarish picture that grips you from beginning to end, it's intensity basically radiating from the screen.All actors give 110% to their role, and praise has to be given to the main racist cop, played by Will Poulter. He plays the part excellently, and one can only imagine how difficult it was for him to act this way in front of the camera. Next to the cops, the black victims were also played flawlessly by a various cast.The film begins at a brisk pace, thrusting you right into the brutality of the impending riots. However, the majority of the film is set in the Algiers Motel, telling the violent incident in graphic detail. The film never had me bored; however, the run time is definitely its main flaw.The film drags on for far too long. There are many moments where I thought it was going to end, but it continued to run. Not saying the subsequent scenes were bad, but the film had me checking my watch a few times towards the beginning of the third act.Despite its overdrawn length, Detroit still provides a very down-to-earth and intense experience, definitely worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,History

American Horror Story: Detroit,"Kathryn Bigelow's latest film, Detroit, recounts the chaotic 1967 Detroit Riots as well as the following incidents at the Algiers Motel. To say the film is not for the faint of heart is a massive understatement. Detroit unapologetically personifies the horrors of racism, bigotry, and cruelty. From the opening frame to the last, Detroit is a masterclass of unnerving, riveting and downright horrifying cruelty. It's as important of a film as its cry out for change.Kathryn Bigelow seems to have found her niche with real life dramatizations of American history. With this film, she reaches the heights of Paul Greengrass (Captain Phillips, United 93) in the art of creating tension and sustaining it. She masterfully captures the intensity, frustration, and chaos of the riots. The riots feel so tangible it's as if Kathryn Bigelow walked in on a riot and started filming. She displays the same skill with the Algiers scenes except with much more precision. The whole second act of the film is more terrifying, intense and horrific than most horror movies. It's so well done you don't even notice that it takes up the majority of the film's long runtime. Bigelow even keeps the film rolling through scenes (particularly at the end) where other directors may have stumbled. Bigelow, with Detroit, succeeds whereas Christopher Nolan, with Dunkirk, did not. Bigelow captures the tension early on and doesn't let it leave her grasp while Nolan undercut the tension and didn't get it back again due to his compulsive need for complexity, and incoherence.Detroit may be a masterclass of tension but it also features an exceptional performance from Will Poulter. Will Poulter shines as the racist cop Krauss, and completely shatters his image of creepy virgin eyebrows kid from We're the Millers. From the get-go you just couldn't take your eyes off this monster. His unrelenting ferocity and devilish hatred towards his victims makes your skin crawl in fear. This is an excellent performance that deserves Oscar attention (though may not get it due to how controversial his character is). Another standout was Algee Smith who may make a name for himself, maybe even as a singer. John Boyega (Melvin Dismukes in the film) was good even though Mark Boal (the screenwriter) may have forgotten about him as Boyega just stood by as if he was a ghost. Another hiccup that the screenwriter never addressed was why didn't the civilians at the Algiers just blame the dead black guy (played by Jason Mitchell) for shooting at the police and hiding the gun, especially since he was the shooter. Maybe a case of don't talk to the police or they're honoring their dead friend, but some clarity to this would have been more appropriate.Some of the biggest complaints about this film is that like The Passion of the Christ it focuses on the violence in favor of a deeper meaning. But the violence in Detroit and in The Passion both serve a purpose. They do not glorify their brutality but they show the audience the true horror of that brutality, and what had to be sacrificed for a greater change. Another popular gripe is that the film is historically inaccurate. The filmmakers even displayed a subtitle stating that they had to dramatize certain events and fill in the blanks since some things are still clouded in mystery. Even the real life Dismukes said in an interview that the film is 99.50% accurate. That statistic should also silence any haters calling this film SJW propaganda.Detroit is an absolute must watch. It's THE best film of the year, thus far, and due to its relevance should be a definite Oscar contender. Kathryn Bigelow has made her best movie here and has established herself as one of Hollywood's most prized directors.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Detroit,"The summer of 1967 brought not just the sweltering of the summer heat, but also a wave of unrest. One of the largest race riots in United States history came to a fever pitch in Detroit in 1967. Detroit had begun to rebel in response to the racial tension between the city's largely African American population and the white police and their brutal treatment of the citizens of the city. Kathryn Bigelow helms an exploration of one evening in the city at the Algiers Motel which resulted in the deaths of three black men and the savage beating of nine others. The true story took place 50 years ago and one could only hope that would exist as a black mark on our nation's history and a past that we have learned from. Unfortunately, however, civil unrest and racial tensions are at an all-time high. This time, we also have a president who refuses to condemn the hateful actions of the individuals perpetrating such hate. Especially in the wake of the hate riots in Charlottesville over the weekend, it doesn't take much to realize that the united states are not as far removed from the tensions of 50 years ago. Not only are racial tensions at a tipping point in 2017, but so are religious tensions. I feel as though I am watching the world in a pre-WWII state. Islamaphobia is at an all time high, and with white supremacists canvassing the streets carrying flags with swastikas and giving the heil Hitler salute, it's certainly not a comfortable time to be a Jew. This bit of commentary is far off from the film Detroit other than to serve as a sad reminder that we no longer have to wonder what it was like to live in such volatile times because we are still experiencing them.Detroit opens with a history lesson told with an artistic touch of stop motion animation which covered hundreds of years in the span of minutes, a superb way to introduce the film. Blending actual footage of the time and footage filmed for production, Detroit packs a heavy punch giving audiences a dramatized understanding of what happened, while still providing an actual look at the historical context. Much of the filming is achieved using hand-held cameras which go a long way to add to the disorienting feeling of a time which so much carnage and turmoil took place. The audience is placed in the heart of the narrative giving the feeling of watching the documentary which is completely necessary in order to understand the struggle as much as possible.The true strength of this film lies in its narrative structure. Clear moods are established in each act of the film. The first act is made up of a largely episodic narrative in which we see many struggles across the city without one protagonist being clearly identified. This structure allows for both the idea of togetherness and isolation. You see how different people are affected by the same racial unrest which goes to show that every citizen was vulnerable and each person of color a target. You also see just how isolated the city is from the rest of the world. When the National Guard is called in and you see even federal agents stepping aside to let them deal with their ""state issue"" one can truly see just how helpless the citizens were. The frenetic camera movement and drastic angles lend to the desperation in the atmosphere at the time. A minor detail is the excellent attention paid to period detail throughout the film. A film as strong and important as Detroit is certainly going to be remembered for other aspects than this, but it does excel in period design. My only complaint is that the film is a bit heavy-handed in some of its symbolism, I much prefer the subtle touch, and trusting the audience, but this is a small quibble in relation to the film. My only other complaint is that the film was a bit long and could have benefited from more aggressive editing, some nightmares are best- shown bits at a time in order to drive home the impact, and the systematic killing that took place in this film is one such nightmare. Audiences need to know that this happened, and I'm not suggesting to spare us from the truth, but some cutting could have better painted the picture. Detroit is my favorite film to come out of 2017, and I despise making such statements with so much of the year left, but Detroit is a film that should not be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Terrifying,"Detroit is not an easy film to watch, lots of violence and racism with certain scenes that will make you blood boil. It is a very gripping viewing experience despite the film being over 140min long. The acting from everyone involved was commendable as well.Racism and police violence in Detroit at that time are a fact and there is no point denying that. Everything reached a boiling point with the riots. Looting and destroying public property is not the right answer, neither is the inappropriate response from the police. Detroit shows a specific event during the riots. The white police officers are shown as cruel and terrible people and black people and two white girls are the victims which is absolutely correct in that case. It is important not to fall under the influence of stereotypes or generalisation when watching this. Some will say Detroit tried to show white police officers too negatively. The ones in this film rightfully deserved it. Despite some dramatisation, it is the truth. Detroit is not trying to generalise here, the race does not define whether a person is good or bad, that is within people, no matter what they do or where they come from. But in the event shown in the film, white did abuse the black, racism was present in those times and is still present today all over the world. There is no use in pretending otherwise.I would recommend the film but see it with an open mind.",9.0,Anonymous,History

A clinical autopsy of a riot 50 years later,"'Detroit' won't be a money maker, judging by the poor receipts after opening in America. Worldwide it may do better. Katherine Bigelow is a creative film maker and 'Detroit', her cinematic homage bears this out. Teamed up again with writer Mark Boal (Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty), she, at 67, shown she is the leading woman director of her time. Working against a handicap: the estate of John Hersey who wrote the best seller 'Algiers Motel Incident' who wrote strongly of the incident in July 25-26 1967 that occurred during the rioting that rocked Detroit and many say hastened the decline of city during the sinking fortunes then of America's car makers, during the declining fortunes of an America engaged in a failing undeclared colonial war in Vietnam. Bigelow and Boal and their team of researcher performed a yeoman's task of researching, rummaging archives, finding old photos and newsreel footage, and more than that finding the people--police and victims--of the incident at the Algiers Motel. And from that intense labor of 'love', they made a powerful film of police brutality and the craven behavior of the Michigan and National Guard sent in to quell the riot. Not only that, they assembled an ensemble of black and white actors that breathe life and tension and energy and artistic passion into top shelf acting that they might not of had, especially the black actors. John Boyega gave a nuanced, sturdy performance of a security guard who looks to save black lives until the safety of dawn; Anthony Mackie is no stranger to Bigelow films, and Algee Smith whose career and life the riots sent into a direction he least expected and ended his dreams of a singing career on the Motown label. The undisguised racism of the police force is not varnished in the least, The young British actor Will Poulter gives an over the top performance of a racist cop with a taste for brutality and murder. And 'Detroit' cannot have come at a better time in today's America where the president encourages police violence against dark skinned Americans and sojourners; where the incidence of police killing blacks with impunity have engendered the 'Black Lives Matter', to protest the endemic, seemingly pathological torrent among the police who can shoot, kill and main blacks and other minorities and whites who challenge authority. 'Detroit' resonates to that condition which is being pandered to by a Republican administration, an administration that seeming reimposed old rules and behavior that draws sharply between citizen and second class citizens, which the country had thought had been put behind it. But how fragile it the illusion, especially the ill will and outright hatred of Obama, the first black president. And the Republicans openly playing the racist card as America slouched to a more open society demographically and racially. And yet the violence and brutality Bigelow's camera captures, left this review ice cold. It was as though I was witnessing coldly and clinically a medical examiner's autopsy of a corpse. And yet, I would recommend this film highly. Many won't see it--too violent they might say. But they must, turning one's eyes away won't make the systemic police and racial ugliness disappear. Of course at Oscar time, 'Detroit' will receive nominations but hardly garner a statuette. Too bad.",9.0,Anonymous,History

When the movie gets going, an unlicensed club is raided by the Detroit Police, and it's not long before the mostly white cops beat up the mostly black patrons of the club, Things get out of hand pretty fast after that, and before we know it, the city is ablaze, the National Guards are called in, and a state of emergency is declared...Couple of comments: this is the latest film from critically acclaimed director Kathryn Bigelow. I adore her most recent work (The Hurt Locker; Zero Dark Thirty), and hence had high hopes for this movie. Here, working from a scrip by frequent collaborator Mark Boal, Bigelow intends to bring us what happened during the riots in Detroit exactly 50 years ago. For sure there were a lot of things that went wrong, on both sides, and hence these are important social issues that merit, indeed need, attention and discussion. It is then all the more regrettable that Bigelow chose to make the film the way she did. Almost from the get-go what we see and experience on the big screen is an incessant use of hand-held cameras (and shake them a bit for good measure). That, in combination with the all too frequent extreme close-ups, make for almost impossible viewing over an extended period of time. Let me just admit it right here and now: I made it through half the movie (70 min.). Realizing that yet another 75 min. was to come, and that I had a headache induced by watching the film, as well as possible motion sickness, I simply could not carry on and bailed.

Makes you sad and angry,"Very moving and shocking film about the Detriot riots. A film that makes you think a long time after seeing it. I had some issues with the first 20 minutes or so because the film lacked getting drive but after that it really turned out to be a truly great movie that perfectly mixes elements of drama, thriller, mystery and pure horror until it turns into an even more shocking court room drama. Why shocking? Because of the way the people thought in the late 60s. The acting was good and constantly strong. Algree Smith is the great new discovery of this film. A strong performance from the beginning to the end with an excellent character development that is very well handled. Also Will Pouter was excellent. Less character development but pure menace. A huge step up from his usual performances and he really played excellently against image. While the character on paper is rather one dimensional the performance he brings out is he best of the movie. John Boyega is doing the right decision in-between his ""Star Wars"" films. The performance was very solid and I really loved his character. The interrogation scene was excellent. Good support by Jason Mitchell, who once again proves to be a versatile actor to look out for and Anthony Mackie who really held himself in the background and let his new comer co-stars the show.

A well-made but cold thriller,"Out of all the film's that were largely ignored over the recent awards period rush of late last year and early this year, Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty follow-up Detroit is one name that stands out above the rest as perhaps the most curiously overlooked of the lot.Based on a true story, featuring an up and coming cast of recognisable faces and touching on hot-topic issues that remain prevalent and in the public conscious of America to this day, Detroit had all the hallmarks of a critical darling and awards season contender that instead faced a rather bleak box-office and audience reception despite many critics hailing Bigelow's realistic and confronting direction as some of last year's best filmmaking.There's certainly no faulting Bigelow's directional style that she harnessed with The Hurt Locker and established further with Zero Dark Thirty, as Detroit well and truly feels like a documentary as the talented director melds together archival like footage of the Detroit race riots of 1967 and her narrative take on a particularly shocking incident involving a collection of Detroit police officers and their treatment of a group of predominately black locals but there's something hugely amiss in Bigelow's scope and decision making.Firstly, Detroit is far too long at 140 minutes plus and while the film's opening half is strong and involving, an extended hotel segment that anchors the whole film is repetitive to the point of infuriation while the film's final 30 or so minutes is hugely misguided and uninvolving making Detroit feel far too often like a chore to sit through.The other key element to Detroit's disappointment is in its lack of audience involvement with the characters within Bigelow's feature.There's fine work by performers like John Boyega, Will Poulter and Jack Reynor but there's nothing tying us to these characters emotionally despite the trauma and experiences they are going through and while Poulter makes a mark as the detestable racist cop Krauss, all other performers feel like passengers to a narrative that is saying a lot, of which much is important to say, but delivering it in a heavy handed and increasingly uninvolving fashion as Detroit's promising and confronting beginning gets lost in its repetitive nature and overdrawn nature.Final Say -There's some great moments within Detroit and there's little doubt that Bigelow's particular style of filmmaking is in a league of its own when it clicks but with a failure to create an emotional core and with a an unnecessarily long and repetitive approach to one particular event, Detroit peters out too a mere flicker, instead of lighting a burning flame.2 ½ church choirs out of 5",5.0,Anonymous,History
If you're not a racist and don't like police you will get mad watching this good movie,"Detroit is a story from 1967, but it could have been from today or tomorrow because nothing really changed or will change. There is still as much racism, if not more, then in those days. Now it's just a bit more concealed, even though with Trump as president, racism is now more in the open again and more tolerated. Detroit is a hard movie to watch, aspecially if you are a normal human being that has issues with racism, police brutality, and injustice. It won't give you a good feeling, on the contrary, it made me mad and sad. Unless you're one of those dumb racists, then you will probably get a kick out of watching innocent minorities getting beated and killed, and all that unpunished. The arguments will be of course that they got it coming and so on, the typical narrow minded racist nonsense. It's a fact that black and other minorities still not have equal rights, and that police still can kill innocent people without getting any convictions. There is a law for the rich, and a law for the poor, a law for the whites, and a law for the minorities. But Detroit is a really good movie, hard to watch but well made, with an excellent cast. They couldn't find anybody better than Will Poulter to play the racist officer. He has already a natural face of a coward, if you could put a face on a coward. He was perfect for this role. Very well acted even though I felt deep hatred towards him, but that's only credits to his acting.

Worth to watch ! Good storytelling with drama crime genre movie !,"First, you need to know that this movie is not an action crime movie, but its a crime drama history movie. So it makes this harder to be the movie that liked by the audience. Many people prefer crime movie with action and stunt style, but this movie is different. It based on true event, and believe me, this crime drama movie really blows your mind !At the first 15 minutes, it shows us some background character, and background story with some documented photo or news that was related to terrible happenings in Detroit. Some people may not know about this event and these facts really helps you to know and understand some background story.And still, Detroit still gives you many intense scene that makes you curious what will happen next. The interrogation scene with some bad police is really good and with deep emotional feeling. This scene has become one of my favourite in this movie and i like it a lot, but at some point i feel it is too long. The other good scene is at the court. Personally, I always like the court scene about the lawyer vs prosecutor, it really feels like the big war with your mind and words !On the other hand, i think this movie duration is too long and somehow can be boring if you not really like this kind of movie. And i think it will be better if you add a bit of comedy into the script. But believe me, this movie is worth to watch and gives you a lot of knowledge about the Detroit event.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant film. Must watch!,"I was watching this last night here in Australia where we have a film series of BLM movies on tv atm. I knew nothing of this film or the story & I was shocked. I had not known specific details of what had happened in the late 60s other than knowing that there had been riots.
atm I am also watching 'African Americans: Many rivers to cross', a brilliant 6 part PBS series. Having just watched the civil war episode & grasped that slavery only finished 100 years before the 60s era, this film shows how recent the slavery era still is. Only 100 years set these times apart & that explains why segregation & police brutality was so easy to maintain& get away with. This film gives insight into police violence & the ability to hurt others particularly African American men, the loyalty of white people (the jury was all white). The people who committed these crimes basically walked free. The mistreatment of white girls for being around black guys is depicted well. That white police could mistreat a black guy who had served in the military shows how brazen they were in their right to rule over black people.
If you care about the freedom of all people, then this is a must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Bigelow and Boal's Torture Porn 2: This Time It's Bad,"""Detroit"" is disgusting--and not only for the racist Milgram experiment based on the real incident at the Algiers Motel--but for how director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal exploit the events for their morally-dubious depictions of torture continued from their last collaboration, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012), which depicted so-called ""enhanced interrogation"" in the lead up to killing Osama bin Laden. Well, whereas Bigelow and Boal controversially thought it fair to suggest that torture was useful for that purpose; in ""Detroit,"" they seem to entirely reverse course. The only consistency is the cinematic exploitation of racial others being traumatized by sadists with guns--or, rather, cameras. Such exploitation is much easier to overlook when those being interrogated are terrorists and when gruesome scenes are kept brief, or when the revulsion remains the domain of fictional horror flick scenarios, but ""Detroit"" is based on a real tragedy, involving racist cops murdering innocent Black men and sexually and otherwise physically assaulting two women, and it goes on for a long time--seemingly longer than the already-lengthy runtime would indicate.It would be one thing if this sequence were brutal only to authentically depict a historical tragedy, or to relate it to the more recent context of police killings, the unrest in Ferguson a few years prior to this movie, as well as the Black Lives Matter movement and preceding the current protests and violence of 2020, but ""Detroit"" doesn't serve that function. The picture's prologue, going so far back as titles explaining the Great Migration and segregation, to the 1967 Detroit Riot, and the picture's third act, which mostly focuses on a farce of a courtroom drama at the expense of following through on tracing the survivors living with the trauma they endured (only the singer receives any justice in the latter regard), are completely blundered. We see one of the cops murder a looter early on, which is never followed up on, either. It's just another scene for the filmmakers to perversely demonstrate a simulated lack of respect for Black lives on par with its villains. Sure, it's hackneyed screenwriting foreshadowing that a character is a sociopath, but it also foreshadows the sickness of Bigelow and Boal's torture porn to come and the by-large removal of the same agency of its Black characters as done by the picture's villains towards its victims.As pointed out by film critic Mike D'Angelo, one of the most glaring indications of this picture's problems here is in the editing of the death of Aubrey Pollard. Unlike the pretend executions that the police enact in their perverse game, the picture cuts away from the room where this one takes place, as we hear the shotgun blasts, only to learn shortly thereafter that the cop really murdered Pollard--seemingly unaware that his fellow officers were only playing a twisted game aimed at manufacturing confessions. That is not how you film a docudrama. It's a shameful folly of suspense filmmaking. It's intended to be exciting and thrilling, and that's shameful.One silver lining of ""Detroit"" is that it's masterfully photographed and even the editing and cutting back and forth between characters is effective for its intended purposes, misplaced and hostile as they may be. The shaky, darting camerawork especially works well at affecting a spectatorial participation in the hectic events. If only such stylistic competence were in the hands of filmmakers who also had the compassion and understanding of how to depict such a tragedy.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Gripping,A fact-based drama set during the 1967 Detroit riots in which a group of rogue police officers respond to a complaint with retribution rather than justice on their minds. A harrowing and caustic account of a real-life tragedy.,8.0,Anonymous,History
"Gripping and horrifying, Detroit is a horror film dressed up as a thriller","As a child, you are told that the police are there to protect you. If ever you should find yourself in a sticky situation, calling the police is the safest option as there is always an obvious line between the good guys and the bad guys. Upon closer examination however, this isn't as true as one might hope. As part of the civil rights movement, blacks demanded justice in reaction to incidences of police brutality targeted upon members of their race. Many whites turned a blind eye as experience told them that only the guilty fear the police or are arrested. When police brutality began spilling into the public eye and into the suburbs- their suburbs- deniers were finally exposed to the reality of police brutality.In the fifty years since the 12th Street riot and in light of events in recent years, the viewpoint that police are not to be trusted has not disappeared. Riots in response to police brutality still happen. Innocents are still slaughtered by prejudiced and violent psychopaths in police uniforms. Helpless and frightened, victims in Detroit are just a few of the many that police have lashed out against without provocation. When it comes to a bad cop, they will opt to ""protect and serve"" themselves first no matter how innocent those they interact with may be. Over the course of a near two and a half hours, Detroit brilliantly depicts this as black men and white women are violently tortured by white and black cops alike, all the while other officers extend a helping hand in the midst of the darkness. It is a surprisingly balanced and reasonable approach to such a hotly contested issue, yet it never shies away from showing the truth in every bloody detail.Read more: https://cineccentric.com/2017/08/19/detroit/",8.0,Anonymous,History
A wasted opportunity,"Very much 'preaching to the converted'. The total lack of any decent brave white characters will put off many who might be convinced.The drastic violence goes on for far too long. A 90-minute film that loses 75% of the drastic violence would work far better, if the aim is to improve white attitudes.Also it seems baffling that no one mentioned that the shots were from a starting gun. Several have seen it, including the white woman. And the guilty party is already dead, so why not blame them?The WIki entry says it lost money, and I'm not surprised.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"It's not pretty, but it really happened this way.","Well I finally got my hands on a copy of the new movie, ""Detroit."" It was supposed to be all about the 1967 Detroit riots which I remember very well. Only about 10% of the movie involved the riots itself. The rest was about the police brutality, including the State police and national guard. Justice gone terrible wrong. Lots of violence and some profanity. The movie was very riveting, and I never lost interest while watching it. Keep in mind that the movie is based on fact, and what you see really happened the way it was portrayed on screen. It was a time in our history when good people went bad.

Riotously epic,"This review of Detroit is spoiler free**** (4/5)DETROIT IS PERHAPS the boldest title for writing-directing duo Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow's latest, re-enacting the true history of one of the darkest chapters in American history - the summer riots of 1967 in Detroit, Michigan. When forty-three people were killed, 1,200 were injured, 7,000 were arrested, 2,000 buildings were torched after a police raid on an unsuspecting African-American group which then broke out in a five-day civil rights war and it became the biggest race riot in modern history, as Motor City was left in a smoking husk. Sure, Zero Dark Thirty was intense but this is perhaps Bigelow's most gripping film to date depicting real images of torture and a brutal re-enactment of the famous Algiers Motel war, in compelling form.Over the last few years Bigelow has proved that she is the master director behind time bomb cinema from action, Point Break to its tick-tocking rhythm with Strange Days and The Hurt Locker. This kind of filmmaking proves to be no stranger here as her latest erupts from the opening reel. After a timely scattering of news archive footage, you're plunged into a fiery recreation of history. As the city's people congregate in the dark streets, anger ensues as objects are thrown, gun shots are heard and a volcano of smoke flying into the air. Bigelow effectively introduces her different perspectives; firstly there's Will Poulter's introduction shot and chase at a rioter, secondly Larry (Algee Smith) the lead singer of a Motown group, third is Greene (Anthony Mackie) a Vietnam War veteran and lastly there's John Boyega's young convenience store guard Melvin Dismukes.The riot is into its third day when these perspectives converge in the Algiers Motel – used as a refugee camp for those who want to get away from the burning streets, perhaps in a hideous twist of irony, becoming the dark backdrop of the brewing massacre about to erupt. There are bullets coming through the walls, in an attempt for the police to track down a sniper. The motel is raided – violence, terrorisation and torture initiate as people are tied against the wall in a vicious interrogation section led by Krauss who does anything to get information from the guests in the motel.Graphically recreated in real-time it's an hour-long section which you will remember for days, perhaps weeks or maybe decades it's enough to make you shudder. Bigelow's directing isn't exactly easy on the eyes either, it's sometimes gruelling as men and women are tortured for information, they're beaten and constantly threatened by the police in the building, it's nightmarish too, the deafening gun shots are enough to haunt you. However it's always on edge, always moving and a gripping almost real-life re-enactment of modern history. This is closest to the horror of Near Dark, were as that's fantasy the horror of Detroit has a sickening flash of reality. Backed up by Boal's tremendously researched screenplay it pulls all punches. Filled with brutal, yet stunning imagery of events gone by, deafening shouting from the police which fills the entire bleak atmosphere of the motel and phenomenal performance as all players are on top form. As the night of torture erupts around the building – its Bigelow's casting of Poulter that shines here, he's unflinching, unhinged, and unchained as you wouldn't expect beneath his baby faced demeanour is something vicious, yet in every moment he's fantastic.After this gruelling, yet breathtaking center-piece the film sighs for a breath of fresh air when the third act rolls in. As the city-wide riot comes to a hasty close there are many court cases involving the police, news stories and a chance to re-build the burning city skyline. Inevitably, this falls short of perfection, granted it's a well-made section filled with Boal's exceptional writing, flawless performances, and Bigelow's incredible hand in direction but it's often left gasping for air. Still, this is an utterly compelling riot epic that's always moving and will effortlessly stay with you well after the credits end.VERDICT Gruelling, nightmarish, yet always an utterly compelling and moving riot epic thriller one that expertly and unflinchingly recreates one of the darkest chapters in American history.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Immensely gripping,"Detroit is a tough watch that starts a little scattered but once it gets going it's impossible to look away from. Gripping in the most harrowing of ways and spending a large amount of time pulling no punches when it comes to its depiction of police brutality which makes the following trial all the more infuriating to witness.John Boyega is terrific at being understated here. Everything he's witnessing and put through clearly takes a massive toll and it's only ever let out in restrained moments of heartbreak. Will Poulter excels at portraying one of the most monstrous characters ever put to screen. Making everything more shocking by emphasising his character's belief that there's nothing wrong with his actions.Kathryn Bigelow's direction brings so much intensity with its handheld and highly mobile camera work which has a greater sense of realism when combined with the archive footage interspersed throughout. However, as undeniably effective as it is, nearly 2 and a half hours of this frantic camera work can be a little nauseating.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A bad documentary but what an amazing movie !,"Before the crisis, Detroit was a wealthy city thanks to the development of the car industries. But unfortunately it became a ghost city because of the oil price inflation, and many car industries left it.In 1967, huge riots burst in Detroit, caused by police violence towards black people, with violent consequences and the economic crisis didn't help.The movie is based on a true story, it represents the racism of the detroit police and the different treatment between black and white people.In the film, there are six black men and two young white women.Among them, one black man will do something stupid and the police will go to the Motel Algiers and they are going to have the scariest night of their life and three will die but which ones ?Thanks to the good acting, we can feel the fear of the victims, the brutality of the bad police officer, we also feel the darkness of the situation.The plot is far to be the worst, because of the fact inspired by the original tragedy.We loved the movie because we felt the tension and the sad reality of the police violence.

"The storyline for this is very well told, gives a good glimpse on the intensity of the times and characters involved.","Detroit (2017) is a movie my fiancee and I watched in theatres immediately upon its release. The storyline takes place in Detroit in the 60s at the Algiers Motel during a time of extreme civil unrest. The police arrive at the motel with an agenda in mind and get infuriated when they see black men and white women intermingling and try to make an example of the men. When their example goes too far lives are lost and things get out of control quickly. This movie is directed by Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker and Near Dark) and stars Anthony Mackie (Avengers), Laz Alonso (Avatar), Tyler James Williams (Dear White People), Mason Alban (Power) and John Boyega (Star Wars). The storyline for this is very well told, gives a good glimpse on the intensity of the times and characters involved. It also shows the consistent challenges in US history of police brutality and overstepping their responsibilities due to personal beliefs or perspectives. It also shows the mindsets of those living in Detroit at the time, from both sides. When these movies are over it's always sad to see the talent and perspectives of the victims involved in the incidents and wonder what they could have been if not impacted by challenges due to the continuous race wars within the United States.

Not very well balanced,"I was living in Detroit, on the west side during this time. I can tell you, it was scary. I expected this movie to show me some things I may have missed, but it didn't.

There are some factual errors and some anachronisms, but mostly they wouldn't be noticed except by someone my age.
I have to admit to being somewhat disappointed by the amount of attention given to the events at the motel, not to say this wasn't important, and the acquittal of the police involved had very dangerous consequences.

Even more specifically it covers the incidents in the Algiers motel.""Detroit"" is a film about racism, but it is not a standard one.In the first place, with respect to films covering race discrimination in the USA we often think about the South, see for example ""Mississippi burning"" (1988, Alan Parker). In the South slavery was legal longer than in the North, and with its abolishment race discrimination did not die automatically.""Detroit"", ast the title already indicates, is situated in the North. Discrimination of black people in the South led to their migration to the big cities in the North. When the white population of these cities moved to the suburbs the city centers became more ghetto-like. These predominantly black centers turned into hot spots of racial tension of their own.In the second place ""Detroit"" focusses on discrimination in the police force. This is a very current problem as various recent incidents of police violence against black puople underscores.

"Enthralling, powerful, and at times hard to watch","Detroit is a historical drama thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow, based on true events during the Detroit riots of 1967. Knowing next to nothing about the infamous Algiers Motel incident, I was still excited to see it based solely on how intense and gripping the trailer was. It would be a very interesting movie even if the story was completely fictitious, but knowing everything actually occurred in one form or another really added an extra ounce of gravity to the experience. In fact, the script was pieced together using real-life testimonies and court records, and Bigelow even invited living people from the incident as consultants on set during filming to ensure accuracy. End result is a movie that is not only entertaining, but also relevant and keeps you cognizant of issues in the real world.What I really like about Detroit is how it goes about its business in a very a matter of fact manner. Even though there are a lot of racist white characters in the movie, it certainly does not present the black individuals as completely innocent, which is heartening as reality is not always black or white, but instead shades of gray. The meat of the story is a hostage situation at the aforementioned motel, where three demonic white cops terrorize a group of people, trying to force a confession out of them for a crime they did not commit. The performances are all stellar, especially Will Poulter as the head of the racist cops and John Boyega as the security guard who witnesses the entire event. The acting in the film really helped ground the story in reality, making scenes of sudden violence all the more shocking.The film does drag a little bit outside of the motel confrontation. It could have removed the historically contextual, but cinematically irrelevant back stories of the characters and just drop us right in the middle of the main conflict at Algiers. I feel it would have made the movie tighter and less bogged down if it sans the onus of attempting to cover the entire riot. Regardless, Detroit is an enthralling, powerful, and at times hard to watch drama thriller that really stays with you after viewing. Even without knowledge of history, it is still a very enjoyable film in its own right that deserves your time at least once.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Fortunately that transitioned into better filmmaking and the movie was underway; my only other gripe being the insertion of real photographs throughout the movie instead of strictly at the end. This always disrupts the experience for me, but was thankfully not too much. Performances were unshakably solid throughout, particularly by the various ""victims,"" despite Boyega being first billed; he was great too, but overshadowed by the lesser named actors and actresses. Poulter was disturbingly convincing, too. While I knew of the '67 Detroit riots and the Algiers Hotel incident prior to the movie, I wasn't familiar with the details. They were handled and depicted with a raw grittiness to them that hit hard, as well it should.

"Deep, emotional and cruelly real","During one of the darkest nights in U.S. history in July 1967, a group of young black boys and a couple of white girls lived their worst nightmare at the Algier's motel in Detroit. The day ended up with three dead bodies lying on a bloody floor after being shot by ruthless police officers of Detroit Police Department. The DPD was by that time 90 percent white and most of them with anti-black prejuices. The Detroit riots terminated 47 lives during five obscure days of fires, looting, burglary and violent doubtful police reactions.
'Detroit' begins with the DPD intervening one of those unlicensed afterhours bars on the infamous 12th street, where a big group of black people are gathering to celebrate the safe return of two Vietnam veterans. While the police puts everyone under arrest in the back of several vans, a mob of furious neighbors starts to form, challenging the police and throwing stuff at their cars, which triggers the riot with a violent confrontation and the later burning of several business.
However, Director Katheryn Bigelow, in a successful attempt to put the feet of the audience in the shoes of the innocent people of Detroit (and pretty much everywhere you can find black communities), chooses to follow Larry (played by Algee Smith), the lead singer of an uprising music band named 'The Dramatics'. After a concert is cancelled due to dangerous conditions, two of the musicians take shelter in the peaceful and chill Algiers Motel, where a safe atmosphere will keep them out of any trouble. 
Before that, Bigelow already makes a statement that Detroit was a city at war, and police were not giving any break to anyone who looked suspicious and/or black. That is exactly how the movie works. By hand-holding the camera most of the movie with close-up shots appearing on the frame very often, the viewer can experience what was that night like and get immersed in the challenge of being black during the civil rights movement in America, where you could get shot under 'self defense' claims that usually no one could prove anyway.
This is a movie that reminds us that race has always been an issue in the American reality and that it has been closely tied to its history. There is no American history without slavery and race issues. Bigelow wants to make the viewer rethink and wonder how much have we really gone forward in terms of civil rights. How much can police brutality overpass the law and how far can 'self-defense' be believable as a reason to fire a gun to kill.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Atrocious Camera Work, Generally Bad Performances, Bad Writing, and Poor Pacing","Factually, I hear a ton of debate. Honestly, whether or not it's accurate makes little difference how I rate the film (though it dramatically affects my perception of the director and writers). In my honest opinion, it felt like a little bit of race baiting. Note though that I don't consider all movies about racial topics as race baiting. 12 Years a Slave is my prime example of a movie that was not race baiting, in my opinion.The camera in this film detracted so drastically from its impact. I get it that shaky cam can add to dramatic scenes, but I found it way over the top and extremely obnoxious. Many of the closeup face shots were utterly wasted, because they were used at poor times (sort of as filler) and when actors really weren't very convincing. This film was riddled with these. 
That leads into my second point. The performances. It was so disappointing to see a film with so much potential being dragged down by people that looked like they weren't even trying. There were moments with some great performances. But these felt like rare exceptions. 
One of my biggest issues with this film is the writing. Every time I felt myself feeling for the characters, I realized it was because I know they're human, not because the film earned it by building the characters. 
My last main complaint is with the pacing. There were some scenes that seemed to drag on, and at their end I found myself wondering why the film spent so much time on a particular aspect without a better payoff.",3.0,Anonymous,History
An intensity off the scale,"Detroit is hard to watch. But watch it, you must.Based around the riots of 1967, the film centres around the true life Algiers Motel involving the brutal beatings of a group of black men and white women along with the deaths of three black men, at the hands of the Detroit Police Department.The performances are outstanding, in particular those of Algee Smith as Larry, a singer caught up in the trouble, and John Boyega as Dismukes, a security guard desperately trying to keep himself and others safe from the violence.Will Poulter is disgustingly brilliant as Phillip Krauss, a police officer exacting his own form of sickening justice on those he should be protecting. The scenes in the motel are as intense as they are uneasy. There are times when watching, it is likely you will feel sick to your stomach, especially knowing that these were all true events.Detroit is one of those rare films that never lets up and even in moments of calm, director Kathryn Bigelow keeps the intensity hyped up, while trusting her audiences intelligence to see it through and gain an understanding of the atrocities of that summer.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A really good historical movie !,"In 1967 , in Detroit , a riot started because black people did not agree with racism they were victim of .Whathryn Bigelow produced a film about an incident during this moment. Two singers , after their concert, found a room for the night in the ""Algiers"" motel in Detroit where they meet two girls . They follow the women to their room where friends of them are cooking and listening to music . One of the guy plays with a fake gun and pretend to shoot a policeman in the street . After five minutes a police raid came in the hotel to find the guy bwith the gun .We really liked this movie because there are lots of beautiful film set like the hotel , the street and the theatre wihtch apparead real ! The persons who chose the costumes was really intelligent because they are appropriate for the period of the film. The motown music was cool and when we listen to it we want to dance and sing with them. The actors played really well, when you watch it you feel sad for the characters when they are tortured and policemen plays really well the role of mean persons. It is for that we give the grade of 8 on 10. We take off 2 points because we think the tortured scene in the hotel was a little bit too long .",8.0,Anonymous,History
An hour too long.,"'Detroit' is the latest from award-winning director Kathryn Bigelow. As the poster indicates she's helmed such films as 'Hurt Locker' and 'Zero Dark Thirty'. Which are pretty solid war flicks. So, naturally, this film had my interest. An Oscar-winning director taking on a film about the Detroit riots in the 60's? Count me in. However, this film is her sloppiest effort yet. If I was to go into this film unaware of who was behind the camera I would be shocked to learn that she has an Oscar to her name. This mainly stems from the structure and characters of the film. Because there really isn't any. But before I go to into that, I should say right off the bat that this is not about the Detroit riots.This is an isolated event that happened during the riots. Which is the most frustrating part of this movie. There is a solid, sharp, tension filled 90-minute film in this 150-minute exercise. This should have just been about the Algiers Hotel and what happened in it. Get rid of all the Detroit riot stuff, get rid of the fake character development, and focus on this hotel incident.Instead, it shoves in a near pointless opening act and a completely useless closing act. It opens showing the riots are in full swing. People are throwing cocktails, looting buildings, and setting fire to anything they can get their hands on. It conveys this with a bizarre back and forth cutting between the film and real footage. What's the point of that? If you're going to make a film, make a film. If you're going to make a documentary make a documentary.Cutting back and forth between real footage and ""dramatized"" action just makes for an incredibly confusing start to a film that is ultimately not even about this. So why include it at all? This is the very definition of filler and it's completely baffling. However, the confusion comes to a head in the films final act. There are roughly thirty minutes of character arcs that literally don't serve any purpose to the film.What's the point of learning that one of the black guys turned as racist as the cops that beat him? Why should we care about these characters that are hardly fleshed out? What's the literal point of pretending that anyone actually cares about these flat, boring plot devices? If this film opened and closed with the events that happen in the Algier Hotel you don't even need to try and give the characters arcs.Instead of giving this jumbled, sporadic view of the events focus on one character. Make John Boyega the main character and only show us what he see's. It's literally that easy to fix. Cut out all the unnecessary fat. Instead of making this about five people make it about one. If you do, the event suddenly feels more personal and tense. If all you know is what the main character does then there would be palpable tension because you wouldn't know who to trust either.Aside from these complaints, I can say that this film isn't bad. The 90 minutes in the Algier hotel are all great. The camera work, costumes, and acting is all pretty much great in this situation. If I were to simply judge the film based on this portion I would be coming across far more positive, but since there's another hour to this film I can't help but feel underwhelmed. The film isn't what it promises to be and has in an unnecessary amount of filler that makes a lot this film boring or uneven. It's not a film that I can call bad but I still don't like it.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Necessary Torture,"I didn't need to watch this movie. Obviously I can say that about every movie, but this one I really didn't need to watch. I really shouldn't have watched. I had to pause it no less than five times. It took me 12 hours to watch a two-hour and twenty-minute film.""Detroit"" was one of those movies that torment you. It's a form of torture that leaves you spent, speechless, and searching for answers. It's like ""Mississippi Burning,"" ""Rosewood,"" or ""Twelve Years a Slave."" The amount of racial injustice in those movies leave you full of pain.""Detroit"" centers around the riots that happened in that city from July 23rd to July 27th, 1967. It began with a macro view of the riots then it focused specifically on the events of the Algiers Motel. There, three young Black men were killed and others badly beaten. The three killed were Aubrey Pollard, 19; Fred Temple, 18; and Carl Cooper, 17. Three teenagers needlessly killed by police who were all but assured to escape justice.I have to say that Will Poulter and Ben O'Toole were too good. They played their roles so effectively I forgot I was watching a movie. They played two of the three officers who killed three of the six Black men and two white women who were physically and psychologically tortured.I never even heard of this specific case, yet I knew what the outcome would be. That says a lot. If I knew one thing, I knew that the officers would get off Scot free. Whether they were arrested and acquitted or never faced a single charge, I knew that their freedom was assured.So, then what's the point of this movie? To bring awareness to those who don't know-don't know about this specific case and/or don't know about police brutality in America in general. Of course, since the killing of George Floyd many people are aware of police brutality in this country, but this movie was released in 2017 while George Floyd was killed in 2020. ""Detroit"" was a necessary movie. And while it pained me to watch it, I'm glad I did.Free with Amazon Prime.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Turbulent 1967 America - A Rendition of the Algiers Motel Incident,"This film is based on the actual events of the Algiers Motel Incident in America in 1967. Released in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the incident, it tackles many unresolved elements, building its narrative through a combination of testimony and imagination. The inclusion of period photographs within the film adds a significant sense of realism to the story.Set against the backdrop of the Detroit riots, the main stage of the narrative is, however, set slightly apart from the epicenter of the turmoil. The movie critically examines the roles of the Detroit Police Department, the Michigan State Police, and the Michigan Army National Guard. Its conclusion leaves a lingering aftertaste, prompting deep reflection on what constitutes justice. The film emphasizes the impact of the era, especially highlighting issues of racial and gender discrimination.Due to its content, the movie is a series of tense scenes, one after the other. Will Poulter, known for 'The Maze Runner,' perfectly embodies the villain, contributing significantly to the film's intense atmosphere. The prolonged tension in certain scenes makes the story's progression feel slow, creating an almost unbearable anticipation for the ending. It leaves one to imagine how overwhelming it must have been for those who were actually involved.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A riveting drama that manages to capture the realistic experience of life during 1967 Detroit,"The riveting drama taking place in 1967 Detroit in the Algiers motel, this film stars various actors including John Boyega, Anthony Mackie, Will Poulter and even to my surprise, John Krasinski. This film takes place in the midst of racial tension and tension between the people and Detroit P.D. Depicting various scenes of violence, robbery and the city turning into a complete war zone, amongst the mess then focuses on the Algiers motel where all of the characters come together to set up the main story.The whole cast does a wonderful job depicting their individual characters, there is a backstory that can be seen through the dialogue, demeanor and expression of each character. The feeling that these people are real, genuine people and not characters in a movie. This strong sense of realism translates to this conflict amongst the characters which establishes the main drama of the film very well. The way that the film manages to have such great characters with individual story arcs makes them all the more sympathetic and their motives all the more clear and logical. Even in the case of Will Poulter's 'bad cop' you can understand where he is coming from and he shows certain levels of mercy and there is a very clear thought process that can be seen as an audience through the character's actions and dialogue.Detroit, manages to seem so real, almost to the extent of a documentary and that is precisely what makes the film so successful. Because it exuberates this sense of realism there are stakes that audiences can actually feel genuine emotions, dangers and intensity about. Detroit manages to retell a faithful tale of mistakes, fear, ignorance and pain in its 2 hours and 23 minutes runtime without ever feeling too long or dragged along.",8.0,Anonymous,History

a realistic and agressive movie,"This movie is about the riots in Detroit and the lives of black people in the 1960s. At this time, Detroit was divided: the black people lived downtown and white people in surburbs. The movie is based on true facts which happened in 1967 at the Algiers motel in 12th street. This is the story of the Dramatics, a Rand B group who came to Detroit to get a recording contract, they planned to give a concert but one night, the riot began. Later, one member, Larry, and his friend, Fred, rented a room at the local Algiers motel for a night. But after a joke with a fake gun, Carl, another friend, fired several blanks to police to frighten them. But the police caugh everyone in the motel to question them with violent methods.The story is believable because it is based on true facts I think the goal of this movie is to raise awarness people.

Detriot - An Unpleasant Revisitation,"Director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal's 'Detroit' is a gruelling watch, not just for the fact it's based on shockingly violent, and tragic events in modern USA history but because the screenplay interferes with certain facts for the sake of 'entertainment'. While it may be the screenwriters task to 'dress-up' the content of a movie it's not their task to pad it out with violent falsehoods till it begins to lose sight of its fact-based situation. Many scenes tend to play out as unnecessary, and often they are. The main story line focuses on the deadly 1967 race riots that already feature enough tension and brutality to sustain viewer concern.It's uncertain what moviemakers feel they can add to these terrible events decades later - within an artificial re-enactment (maybe a quality documentary would have been a better medium?) But, it's doubtful any good might come from this re-hashing of yesterday's hatreds - especially given the present climate of extreme 'identity politics' causing division between all races - this in itself, comes across as exploitative 'activism' pushing suspect negative agendas. Sometimes, revisiting certain ugly historical events can offer a moral compass - even giving us warnings signs if they are thoughtfully analysed (as with 'The Free State Of Jones' in '16) - While others, simply fuel more contempt and distrust, feeding increased hatred.

Story Great; Cinematics Just Okay; Theme Gets Confused,"A diehard fan of Bigelow, I really expected more here.The story, like so many others, tells a tale of true life back in a dark time in our history. It helps us not forget the evil which lies in man's soul, as well as brings us happiness knowing and observing how far we have come and evolved since that time.Bigelow does the story well, although there are partings here and there from fact. The musicians, for instance, are cleverly tweaked chronologically to play into the story. However, none of the departures from truth negatively (in my opinion) effect the overall story.The cinematics (and this is from a Bigelow fan) were not her best work. Recognizable landmarks placed into the script could have helped the viewer become closer to the story being told. Instead, it felt like stock footage instead of actual eyewitnessing.The theme is where it got very confusing. Although the purpose is obviously to tell a story which happened long ago, the viewer is left with wondering what the producer's purpose was here.In today's society, the public is overwhelmingly fatigued from the cries of wolf every time force is used against differing colors of men. The news media succinctly adds to this by mentioning races in use of force reports. Even the Black Lives Matter movement, whose byline of ""Hands Up Don't Shoot"" is founded and based on the Ferguson shooting, adds to this by continuing to use a byline and message found to be false by the Justice Department's investigation and the fifty-three independent witnesses in that incident. Continuing and never-ending screams, most often accompanied by violence, of mysterious ""systemic"" or ""institutional"" racism (aka ""ghost hunting"") is what kills any hope of the message being meaningful and fatigues society to ignore that one-in-a-million legitimate causes for complaint.So was the message from the producer to add to the pile of today's faux-outrage? If so, it was not clear. Or is the producer's purpose to draw a distinction between the TRUE racist behaviors and assaults and deaths of the 1960s, thereby highlighting in contrast to today's cries of racism with, if ever, little fact and at best circumstantial opinion used to levy such great claim. Again, it is not clear.For myself, I got the message that the producer was trying to highlight what it TRULY means to have racist cops compared to today's complaints of the same never coming close. As well, the message I saw was celebratory in how far we have evolved and how, minus a couple of drops in an ocean of policemen, we do not have that problem today. If this was truly the message, this movie would have been well done and truly a ""thinker"" - something to ponder - if the message was indeed as such and was strikingly clearer. For now, one must wonder because that message isn't clear enough to determine either way. The message you see may be completely different than mine.",4.0,Anonymous,History

During the summer of 1967 riots occured in Detroit: a lot of fights took place lasting around 5 days (approximately)with 40 dead and more than 1000 people got injured. The US army and the Detroit city police officers took over a motel and started suspecting and interrogating people in a vicious manner after hearing a gun shot.
