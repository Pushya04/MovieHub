refreshing first date,"American tourist Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets French student Celine (Julie Delpy) on the train. He talks her into getting off and walk around in Vienna. They walk the night away.I really love this movie when it first came out. There was no hint of the following sequels. It's just a great charming first date movie. The leads have great chemistry. They are both charming and lovely. This is a lot of first-date talk. It doesn't get tie down by artificial plot elements. There is nothing to drive the plot. There is no Holy Grail. There is no quest. There is no destination. There are just two people talking and trying to connect. It stops and starts. They meet two oddly funny Germans who invite them to their play. In a more conventional movie, they would actually go to this play. They forget to go and that's kind of the point. Their journey meanders without much direction. There are also great scenes of long continuous takes. Director Linklater just let the actors go on forever on the streetcar. The whole movie feels refreshing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Casablanca for the 1990's - pure cinematic gold,"Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation. Richard Linklater's romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people. The film depicts romance in all it's glory, but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples; and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem, the problem of time. While most relationships wind down with time, this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out. Before Sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental 'Hollywood romance', which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders. The story follows two people, Jesse; an American and Celine; a French girl that meet on a train into Vienna. They instantly connect, and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train, Jesse asks Celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of Vienna...Before Sunrise works principally for two reasons - realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life. This allows the characters to be free, and it's easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script. This also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are, and not merely because they're the protagonists. This kind of realism is hard to capture as, at the end of the day, we as the audience know that they're watching a film and not observing real life; but Before Sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen. A truly great script cannot work on it's own, and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice, and although I'm not a fan of either Julie Deply or Ethan Hawke; on viewing this film, there is nothing you can do but give them both respect. I don't know whether they were in character or just playing themselves, but when a film is this good; it hardly matters.In a film like this, it is the writing that's the most important thing, and contained within the script are several observations about life, most of which I personally could relate to. This represents what Richard Linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters, but it also manages to expose what true love is, along with several other aspects of life. The fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing. Everyone is different, and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people. There could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates; and that's the case with the musings in this script. Adding to the beauty of the film is the city of Vienna. The city itself isn't really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere - but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat, energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location.Before Sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating. Richard Linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema; a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. Before Sunrise is what it is. And what it is, is pure cinematic brilliance.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of those few movies that actually - ACTUALLY - feel like real life,"This movie is intelligent. That is, more than most other movies, it transcends the least common denominator - stupid people will probably not appreciate it. The story also relies heavily on dialogue. It has some parallels to Lost in Translation, although Before Sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract, and simply a lot better.The script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic. The actors play absolutely brilliantly. Rarely have I seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together.The dialogue moves into very personal issues, with the risk of becoming a little over the top. It does, however, stay on the right side almost all the time, although I found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing. Balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors. Sometimes, it yields great results, and overall this movie is simply stupendous! Only very, very rarely is ""love"" in films depicted in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic. Every time that is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect. She still looks stunning in this film, 12 years after.This is simply a gem of a movie that you can't miss. One of the best movies I have seen from the 1990s!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why we go the movies...,"What an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. I've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way Before Sunrise does. What a crime that neither Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy was nominated for any major acting awards, actually screw that! What a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that Richard Linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! Loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time), loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. Loved how the dialogue never wavers, never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language, facial expressions, and the dialogue, ooooohhh the dialogue. Every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. And respect to Linklater for keepin it real, the movie was rated R cause of a couple minor swear words? Could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. Screw you hollywood, your 'romantic comedies', your Freddie Prinze Jr.'s, your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. This is real romance! This is what I come to the movies for, to think, to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. Before Sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why I goto the movies......",,Anonymous,Romance
Love Still Exists.,"This has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy-meets-girl movies ever made. While ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Say Anything"" deliver nice portrayals, this movies strips down useless subplots and Hollywood divergences. This movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance. You never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people. You almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it. This movie is mostly all dialogue -based. But, every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing. What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is. How in all that conversation, while often having no real bearing on anything critical, you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other. This is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone. And what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe. This could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random. And what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of Vienna in which this film takes place. It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests. And no matter how many times I watch this film, I don't think I will ever tire of that.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Perfect Chemistry, In One of the Most Beautiful Romances I Have Ever Seen","While traveling by train through Europe, the American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and the French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet each other and decide to spend the night together in Austria. On the next morning, Jesse returns to United States of America, and Celine to Paris.""Before Sunrise"" is one of my favorite romances, indeed one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. It is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect, and the dialogs are stunning. The direction is amazing, transmitting the feelings of Celine and Jesse to the viewer. I have just completed my review number 1,000 in IMDb, and I choose ""Before Sunrise"" for this significant number because it is a very special film for me.

Wasn't all that,"This movie was good, but I can't say it was that great only good. And I can kind of see why people like this movie but I found it to be incredibly overrated. Ethan hawke and Julie delphy were both pretty good and both their characters were pretty enjoyable to be fair.Personally I couldn't get into this movie. It was really well written and some of the things that they discussed were pretty interesting but then some of it felt like drawl being used to fill time. The two main characters dynamic was interesting and I was quite surprised that they ended up together because they seemed to be polar opposites.

Wonderful love story,"""Before Sunrise"" is a wonderful love story and has to be among my Top 5 favorite movies ever. Dialog and acting are great. I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, the romantic Vienna, introduced in the movie does not exist (you won't find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night) and it isn't possible to get to all the places in only one night, either (especially if you're a stranger and it's your first night in Vienna). But that's not the point. The relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. Although, nothing ever really happens, the movie never gets boring. The ending is genuinely sad without being ""Titanic"" or something. Even if you don't like love stories you should watch this film! I'm a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer. The first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It Possesses A Very Natural Feeling, Wonderfully Romantic, And Stylistically A Bit Off The Beaten Path","Very Natural feeling and wonderfully romantic. If you wonder whether a movie can sustain interest by merely showing two people having conversation, while walking around Vienna, then Before Sunrise might be your answer. I personally found it enjoyable. It is true its main characters spout a lot of youthful pretentiousness, but that is rather the point of the movie, I believe. Whatever else, Linklater can hardly be faulted for attempting something a little off the beaten path, stylistically speaking.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Essentially, it's a hundred-minute conversation; it's loose and meandering but fairly enjoyable.","'Before Sunrise (1995)' essentially has no plot and, though that's the point as the intention is to be a romance with all the extraneous 'Hollywood' elements removed, this leads to an experience that feels loose, aimless and meandering. It's experimental and laid-back by design but isn't the most gripping of narrative pieces because of it. It certainly feels less a character-study of its two leads and more a vehicle for Linklater, Krizan, Delpy and Hawke (the latter two of whom contributed heavily to the script uncredited) to express some of their most unique of ideas. These come constantly, seeming like stories they've told to friends or theories they have about life, love and religion, and, while they can be interesting (genuinely thought-provoking in cases), they don't really develop the characters and seem sort of out of place within the story. It's difficult to explain why most of that stuff doesn't seem to work, but it just doesn't feel fully genuine in most cases. It doesn't feel like it comes from the characters or express their budding romance, though this sort of talk certainly forms the basis for most relationships. Still, it isn't all unsuccessful. There is certainly some charm to the picture, once it picks up steam. In the end, the experiment seems to have worked. It was creatively refreshing for all involved and evokes memories of wandering around a holiday destination talking about nothing for hours. There's even some impressive long takes and the 'unscripted' feel is admirable considering it was all scripted down to the letter. This all leads to a sort of inane, carefree and somewhat nostalgic - if limited - enjoyment of a hundred-minute conversation told with cinematic language. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely tedious,"It seems I am in the minority here but I found this movie over-calmingly tedious. It's starts well, the meeting on the train and the intriguing possibility of what may happen when two strangers meet by chance is alluring but once they start wandering around Vienna it's when it starts to get boring. The dialogue is just the kind of naive, wistful, cod-philosophical nonsense that young couples on their first date come up with to impress the other partner. Fine if you are trying to get laid but it makes for rather irritating viewing. After a while I was more interested in the scenery than what was going on with the main characters. By the end I just wished they'd shut up and get on the damn train! It's not that I don't have a romantic streak or appreciate dialogue based movies, there are many good examples of this type of film, it's just that I expect not to almost fall asleep during it.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
The beauty is the simplicity of magnificent human emotion.,"'Before Sunrise' is not a film to be scrutinised, nor studied. The absolute beauty of it lies in its perfection as a simple love story - of two lives suddenly thrown together in the midst of reality, and the ensuing night of simple love that follows. Every individual at some time in life dreams of the connection that is portrayed in this film between Jesse and Celine, and few ever find it. 'Before Sunrise' simply and elegantly demonstrates how the most fundamental passions of human emotion can envelope two complete strangers.  The beauty of this film is that the story is the most important element. The ending is both provocative and emotional - scenes of the night previously seen in darkness are now portrayed in lonely daylight as the sun rises and the story closes on these two characters.I saw this film by accident one night late on television. I have never forgotten it. So well is it made that the audience never question if this could ever really happen in life, reality being so absolutely characterised in it.'Before Sunrise' is simply the story of two strangers bound in Vienna's lonely night splendour - one night of love in all its glory, one superb piece of film making.",,Anonymous,Romance

"""Isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved a little more?""","Sweet and charming, funny and poignant, plot less but meaningful, ""Before Sunrise"" (1995), the third movie of Richard Linklater, is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love, is in love, or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it. It is one of the very rare movies that is/should/will be equally interesting to teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car chases, or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young people in their early 20s, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke who is returning home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend the classes in Sorbonne) meet on a train. They are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking, they hop off the train in Vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, that's the movie. It could've been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing (at least, for this viewer). High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is. Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticelli's angel, is great in portraying smart, independent, and incredibly attractive young woman.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best films of the 1990s,"I had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago, but its concept interested me when I heard it: an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night together talking. It sparked my interest, but I never expected it to be this great. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece, and it's also one of the most romantic films on record. To my surprise, it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s. It's impossible to really talk too much about it, since there is no real plot, so to speak (although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about; it is sort of like My Dinner With Andre, where there is a conversation, but it's not JUST the conversation that matters), but let me just say, see it.

Ok movie but that's all,"It's probably up to me and my weird taste regarding romantic movies in love movies, but I didn't like this movie. I appreciate the overall idea, the emphasis on exclusively the two main characters and the longer shots that were by no means easy to capture. There were also a couple of really good scenes. But overall, this is a film where two young people talk to each other all day (or ninety minutes from the viewer's perspective). They talk about anything and everything, serious topics and trivial nonsense. For me personally, the film was at times pretentious because of some topics of conversation and the way that conversation took place. The ending of the film is also nothing special.

still cuts deep after 10 years,"i watched this movie 10 years ago. and have watched it on video an average of once a year since. it's the type of movie that's timeless, because the themes are universal, yet the stories and conversation are so personal. it's also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll, despite the fact that there are, really, just two (very involving) characters. this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy, who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine. this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality TV, and now, the phenomenon is rampant! i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space, and makes you think, however jaded you may be, that you are one of those characters. it also made me want to ride the train around Europe! i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie. maybe that speaks about myself, my friends, or just the sheer genius of this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not really feeling it.....,"I don't think I've ever seen a romantic drama so devoid of....romance.The insipid dialogue dragged on and on and I never got the feeling that the characters felt anything more for one another than physical lust. How could ANYONE feel a mental spark with someone else based on such inane conversation? Every time Ethan Hawke opened his mouth and said something I couldn't help but think of what a douschebag his character was and marveled that any female would consider spending time with him as romantic.Truthfully, the time the two main characters spent together reminded me more of a few bad dates I've had with little chemistry rather of than two people falling in love. The only thing that was convincing was the actors' physical expressions, and I commend them for at least managing to deliver some sense of plausibility to this tale through their physical acting skills. When they weren't talking but were looking at each other or hugging each other, then I believed their was some love there. But again, that is the PHYSICAL, so I couldn't help but feel it was just hormonal lust at work. I certainly couldn't see their relationship going beyond 2 or 3 more dates.I think Linklater could've been a little more imaginative and romantic with the dialogue. I understand the need to not be sappy or clichéd, but c'mon, the thing with romance is that it NEEDS FANTASY and IMAGINATION, something the dialogue in this movie lacked. But the coolest part of the movie was the end when they revisited all the places they had hung out the night before, except this time the spots did not contain...them! Interesting look at how social relationships really add another dimension to physical spaces and locations.Strangely this movie did leave me with a strange feeling of unholiness, impurity, and debasement for any previous casual sexual encounters...Final Grade: C+",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"the kind of conversations we all have in reality, yet projected here in a purely cinematic fold","Before Sunrise has many remarkable things going on, almost too many to fit into one review like this, but it's suffice to say that it's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties, maybe even in all of contemporary cinema, to be observant not about love, per-say, so much as it's about a human connection. How does one fall in love at first sight? No one does, at least that's deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film. And *yet* there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time. Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie, a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna, and on the way there start to talking about things, at first arbitrary, then personal (Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather). Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town', in Vienna, until his plane the next morning.Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine, in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance, and in a sense is about the act of having conversations, of what it's like to watch people having one leading into another and another. Here it's often about relationships and commitments, as Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential, or seemingly so, and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities. We hear confessions of desires for other loves, or what weren't really loves, of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you'll love your life, of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form, or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul (I loved the bit about the quakers in the church), and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism. Jessie may be more responsible for that last part, but what's fascinating about the film is that it's never exactly cynical itself, just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives.Meanwhile, it's always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in these roles, where they're not incessantly annoying in that 90s Generation-X mode, but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film, which isn't a bad one at all but a necessary one, one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere. The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter, only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other, where sweet asides are actually acceptable (""I have to tell you a secret"", Jessie says, and then leans in for a kiss, ho-ho), or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way. I loved the scene with the poet, where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal, or with the palm reader and how the reactions from Jessie and Celine are that we might share, but really are seeing them do it first-hand. All the while Hawke and Delpy embody the roles interestingly- we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives- as it may lead off into the future...Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness, however self-contained, as it may lead into something more. Who's to say you can't suddenly be attached to someone, if only for less than 24 hours, and be that much more attached than a married couple? This is perhaps Linklater's thesis, but there's more to it than just that. It's a very dense film, and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly. One scene especially, which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking 'on the phone' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other's friend.

BEFORE Sunrise Please,"I'd both read and heard some really positive reviews of Before Sunrise and was looking forward to it. In large part I also feel there are some special elements to this film - the idea of meeting and being captivated by a stranger on a train and spending one magical, impactful night together, some really thoughtful and interesting dialogue, and an honesty of expression between the two main characters, all good and appreciated. However, I do have one major issue with this film, that it didn't know when to end. Unlike the two lead characters who at the films conclusion know not to force anything or attempt to take things too far, the director unfortunately extend things beyond their natural reaches to the film detriment. I sincerely think that with some prudent editing down this film could have been much stronger.

snooze fest,"In Before Sunrise, you simply watch two people go on an overnight date. Yippie. I've been on plenty of dates to know how they work, so I certainly don't need to waste my time watching other people do it. The two characters in the movie have extended conversations broken up about every ten minutes to change the scenery and give you a chance to wake up. The conversations are mundane and often pointless. It's like watching a reality TV show, only without all the drama that makes it interesting.The acting is sub-par. Ethan Hawke was okay, though his character was extremely annoying. Julie Delpy, on the other hand, delivered her lines devoid of any emotion. Her way of attempting emotion was to simply stare out the window.This movie appeared to be made simply because the writer wanted other people to hear his ideas about life. This is fine, as many movies have been made for this purpose. However, the flaw here is that this is the only point to the movie. There isn't any connecting plot at all, just a series of conversations. The movie ""Tape"" (also w/ Ethan Hawke) is also just a series of conversations, though the only setting is one hotel room and the movie is actually just one really long scene. However, ""Tape"" actually is entertaining in that the conversations have a point and actually move the characters to some sort of resolution or change - this is where ""Before Sunrise"" fails.To sum up, if you have insomnia, this ""film"" is your cure.

Am I the only one?,"Am I the only person that found this movie incredibly tedious, pretentious and badly acted?  Did I mention boring?  It took me 3 installments to get through this.  My mind kept wandering to thoughts like ""Why is Ethan Hawke's hair so greasy"" and Julie Delpy's teeth being disturbing.  Not good signs.Whoever said Ethan Hawke (was it Mrskunk?) had 2 expressions was exactly right.  Most of the time he smirked.  And the dialogue!  Were we supposed to find it interesting?  Amusing?  To me, it was the musings of immature adults, and why were their musings any more interesting than yours or mine? Maybe that was the point - maybe the director was parodying the self-importance of teenagers and those slightly older.  Was there any insight at all in all that talking?  I couldn't find any.  Not one single insight.  Did you happen to notice that the whole time they talked about themselves?  I include their philosophical comments, because they are about their own philosophy, not anyone else's.  As far as they (and those of us who were trapped in their universe) were concerned  the world did not exist. They wouldn't notice anything happening outside themselves.  Could you ask for a better example of solipsism?I can't believe people think this is one of the greatest films ever made, a great romance, etc.  If you want to see a great romance, rent ""Notorious"" or ""Live Flesh"" or, I could go on and on.  Just like the movie.  But I won't.I fear that this is a case of the ""Emperor's New Clothes.""

These once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don't meet these people anymore. We don't always even know their names, as we are never presented to each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are. It's funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such, because reuniting might spoil fond memories, or we don't know do they. We are too afraid to check that out.The movie 'Before Sunrise' just caught me watching it. I never had intention to watch it through, but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting, I gave a look for the rest of the film. I didn't know what to expect from it, but nor did the young couple. They had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate. I believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through. It makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An interesting experiment in film,"Before Sunrise is an interesting experiment in film. The whole movie hangs on the dialogue and the chemistry between the two leads. There isn't much to the story -- it's all about the conversation. It works, but it's not a film that I would watch over and over again. I'm glad I watched it, though, and I'm interested in seeing the sequels, as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A romantic masterpiece,"Before Sunrise is for sure one of the most important romances in the history of film. The Richard Linklater movie not only surpasses the expectation of its cheesy poster, the cliché tag line or the absurd simplicity of its premise (""A young man and woman meet on a train in Europe, and wind up spending one evening together in Vienna"", on IMDb), but actually does something remarkable: makes the audience believe in those people. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy star, and their performances make Jesse and Celine two of the most fleshed-out, three dimensional characters I've ever seen on film. Nowadays, we are used to the Nicholas Sparks formula, in which characters are defined only by one or two particular traits in their personality, and the way they act and speak and show their feelings is clearly dictated by the story. In Before Sunrise, the characters are the story and for that, they dictate the shortcomings of it, which makes for a much more pleasant watching experience, and one that feels a lot more genuine. Even the most ""movie moments"", like when the couple first meet on the train and Jesse asks Celine if she wants to join him on a tour across the Austrian city, are handled with a superb sincerity and spontaneity thanks to Linklater's minimal character-driven direction, Hawke' and Delpy's excellent performances and their chemistry with one another, which honestly made me think they were married in real life, and, of course, the magnificent screenplay by Kim Krizan and Linklater himself, that basically turns this run-of- the-mill romance into one masterpiece, taking its simple premise and turning it on its head, and just making something beautiful, something full of heart and, most of all, something unique.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Banal and contrived, yet intriguing","The plot throws a young couple together in a contrived situation with an arbitrarily short deadline, and we watch dutifully as the story (such as it is) trundles along to the inevitable conclusion ...... And yet, at the same time, there's something truly captivating in this tale. The passing scenery, the predictable story, the unlikely meeting and dissonance between the characters, the tedious, naive, pretentious drivel that passes for dialog, the cow act (yes, really) ... these are mere distractions, perhaps specifically and intentionally arranged to prevent us being totally swallowed up by the huge vortex consuming our two brave protagonists before our very eyes. Despite everything, despite everyone's best efforts, fleeting glimpses of reality, little gestures and entirely credible, honest, convincing reactions escape, giving the game away: turn out this is not a film after all, but a fly-on-the-wall documentary. We're mesmerised, and the vortex has us.This film is not for everyone but if you make it past the first 15 minutes, it's all downhill from there. Before you know it, you'll find yourself picked up and swept along on the same emotional roller- coaster that is taking the actors to places they hadn't anticipated going either.Just before the final credits roll, we're treated to a recap of the now empty scenery from key points in the film, reflecting on what we've just been through in the same way as the departing characters.

Not all it's cracked up to be,"I rented this after reading reviews for ""Before Sunset"" and got my hopes up for ""Before Sunrise."" However, the normally sexy Ethan Hawke was extremely annoying and did not have any chemistry with Julie Delpy. Delpy was interesting, beautiful, and smart. It didn't seem like she had any spark with Hawke's character, a naive, judgemental American tourist. Throughout the movie, Delpy seems to enjoy telling Hawke her various theories about life and such, but doesn't really seem interested in him romantically. He just comes off as a drooling adolescent. In this movie, chemistry would be the only way to pull this movie together, since its basically the two people trading ideas.Disappointing unless you're a die-hard fan.",,Anonymous,Romance
Beginning,"Who'd have thunk back then, that this would spawn a trilogy? My guess is nobody. But the first movie was strong enough to have followers and believers in it. Apart from the setting and the two magnificent actors, we get treated to some wonderful dialog. Some great scenery as well and the one subject that rules most of our lives -> Love.Represented not only by a male and female, but also two different cultures.

Before Sunrise: 7/10,"Romance is basically dead in movies. We get romantic comedies, but those usually involve calling people the wrong name in bed. But epic romances a la Gone with the Wind are basically, um, gone with the wind. That is, before Richard Linklater came along. I'm not calling his Before Sunrise an epic romance by any means, but it's a nice, small romance that actually has believable characters in a believable circumstance. You can't really get that from a recent ""romance"". What Linklater (and co-writer Kim Krizan) create is an engaging love story that, unfortunately, has never heard of ""too much of a good thing"".Taking a train through Europe, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) starts talking with Celine (Julie Delpy). He convinces her to get off of the train in Vienna to spend his last European night with him. They wander around the town, talking about life, the universe, and everything, as the clock winds down, because Jesse has to catch a plane.Before Sunset, the sequel to Sunrise, has basically the same format. The conversations in both are very interesting and entertaining, but I'd say that Sunrise's conversations were more varied. Some were more interesting, some were less interesting, and some were mediocre. But it's the conversations that make both Befores such great movies. They let you get inside of the characters, realize what they're thinking and how much like real people they are. And not only is the dialogue entertaining, but it's thought-provoking and all natural. It all seems ad libbed, which it isn't, which finalizes the humanity and the true-to-life qualities of these people.But where the second one succeeded, the first one failed. The second came in at a quick 80 minutes, which was 80 minutes of dialogue shown in real time, creating a very intimate bond between the audience and the characters. In Sunrise, it's not in real time (which is okay, but not up to par with the sequel), which allowed unnecessary establishing shots to be put in. But what was the worst about this movie was its inability to end. Instead of doing something like the short 'n sweet 80 minutes of the second film, after 80 minutes is up, Sunrise isn't over yet! You've had enough of these characters and you want the movie to end (in a good way), but the movie keeps on chugging along. It goes on for 20 more minutes, and it doesn't even have a successful climax. That's the worst part of the film-it keeps on going and going, but it really overstays its welcome and becomes too repetitive towards the end. Obviously, you should see this movie before the sequel, but I think it's safe to say that Sunset is the better movie overall.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A luminous Sunrise,"Richard Linklater's beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and Paris travelogue is one of the 90's best thinking person's romantic movies. Julie Delpy turns in one of the decade's most engaging performances as the Parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train Ethan Hawke.  The dialogue (and there is oodles of it) is sometimes meandering and overly precious, but this portrait of two young wannabe-lovers making a romantic, intellectual, and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing, touching and insightful moments.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Nope, it's still just another romantic drama","OK, but not great. Put off watching this because it looked a common-or- garden romantic drama. However the 8/10 average rating on IMDb made me think there is more to this than that. Turns out: not really.Is pretty much just another romantic drama. Better than most in that it has more depth of characters, has a fairly unique and beautiful setting, and direction and plot are more subtle and original than most. On the down side, some of the dialogue is incredibly pretentious, navel-gazing crap.Reasonably good performances from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, even though I found Hawke's character a bit irritating.For a much better crafting of a theme of strangers who become close friends yet know they must soon part, never to see each other again, see Lost in Translation.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"NOT ""My Dinner With Andre""","One of my all time favorite films ""My Dinner With Andre"" is also about a conversation between two people. I loved that film! I was fascinated and mesmerized by the stories Andre told and the pictures he painted with words. I was hoping ""Before Sunrise"" would be just as good, but I was disappointed.Maybe I just didn't ""get it."" Maybe I was not in the proper frame of mind when I viewed it. Maybe my expectations were too high. Whatever the reason, I did not have the same experience many of the other reviewers had. While I did enjoy watching, there were times it became tedious, and it seemed like they were saying lines rather than having a real conversation. I wished it had been more. The film is mostly about their conversations on a variety of subjects, but I never really felt any one topic was explored in much depth. It was no ""My Dinner with Andre."" Maybe that was because the characters were too young to possess the experience and wisdom to explore more esoteric topics. But since they were both college students I think they could have had some deeper discussions.The screenplay indicates that there is an attraction between the two. I guess there was, but I didn't feel there was any passion between them. At least I did not feel or see any sparks. I did feel they were enjoying each other's company, but I didn't feel any sexual tension.It's definitely not a bad movie and I did enjoy watching, but for me it was not a masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointment from an otherwise great director,"Disappointing to find that I don't like all of Richard Linklater's films. All of his others rock.I got the feeling from this that Celine could only have been interested in Jesse because of his looks, since he sure was a dead-end intellectual poser conversationally.  The conversations real people have in such situations are more interesting and much more entertaining.  If you buy this as ""real"", you haven't done much traveling.  If you made lame attempts at conversation like this with a foreign girl who took an interest to you, she would run for cover and not think twice.  At first Celine seems real enough, but since she seems to enjoy Jesse's inanity, you can only assume she must be as vacuous as him.  And this premise that he didn't have enough money for a hotel or even a bottle of wine... Maybe if he didn't blow his money eating in the friggin' dining car on an Austrian train.  If this was real life and real people, those two would have gone and seen the avant-garde play, their new-found Viennese actor friends would show them a great time afterwards, and then the couple would be invited to spend the night in someone's guest bedroom where Celine and Jesse would conjugate the French verb ""baiser"" all night long.  The plot is unrealistic and painfully boring, and the dialogue makes you want to dope slap both of them.  Julie Delpy, quit hanging out with twits just cuz their cute.  Ethan Hawke, go home.",,Anonymous,Romance

"Great setting, beautiful development","Well, I'm not a fan of romantic movies but this one is made very smart. Firstly, I loved they set the movie in Central Europe, in the typical European train and then in the beautiful city of Vienna. And it was well done, you can feel the real vibe of the city (I visited Vienna several times. It's so refreshing to see this in an American movie.Then the relationship development, and actually the character development as well, are one of the greatest I've ever seen in 90 minutes piece of film art. It goes very easy, you can feel the spontaneousness, it's really kind of realistic. It goes from a very simple topic, through the pretty deeper thoughts they share with each other, and finally to the feelings they are talking about. I think it shows how quickly can something develop when there is the connection between two souls.And this is it - in the end, actually, there is more than just a romantic story. Want to see another two parts.(And I really liked the reference to Dylan Thomas).",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simple and beautiful,I love this trilogy starting with this first encounter. It is one of the movies I always suggest to sensitive and romantic people. It is a walk through life. What I liked the most is how I got to discover a city that I knew and I have lived in from a different perspective. Both characters play naturally and they match perfectly. The movie will make you feel calm and also will help you make peace with some of your behavior as you will realize that nobody is perfect and that is exactly what makes life beautiful.

"I'm 14 and this is deep, The Movie. But it works!","An odd film very different to what usually makes a movie work. It's mostly nothing but two people talking as they walk around Vienna. They have very little conflict, they largely just give their opinions and musings on things. Then they depart, hoping to see each other again.Usually in a movie I look for drama, for conflict, for suspense. Before Sunrise has little of that. Jesse and Celine like each other from the beginning, kiss early on, and are almost always on the same page: the sexual tension is pretty much dissipated when they kiss on a Ferris Wheel early on. But the film keeps going successfully because it's not cynical, it's innocently romantic - it feels like an actual first date between two people attracted to each other.For the first two-thirds, I thought it was pretentious. Most of the dialogue is Jesse giving his thoughts on where souls come from if there's reincarnation, why our lives are still busy despite the march of technology, how one man can impregnate 99 women, etc. None of their conversation is particularly new or original, and for most of the film you think it's just the writers being pretentious and believing they're much better philosophers than they really are.But the last 20 minutes or so the couple express a real sadness that they're about to leave. Jesse admits he's been rather pseudo-intellectual, they make love, then depart promising to meet again. It's that declaration of love which really saves the movie, and makes the sometimes tedious discussions of the previous hour worth it.Really, the film portrays a first date. On a first date, don't you say whatever comes to your mind to impress your date? If you recorded it, might it sound less brilliant the day after than it hopefully did at the time? So the film is almost a realistic documentary of a first date. Of two people meeting by chance, having a chemistry (the actors portray this well), and saying whatever they think will keep the date's momentum up.Then they have to leave. It's not the most exciting film, but I went away from it feeling like innocent love was real, and had been captured in what I'd just seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The setting in the film is of course neat. And the acting is fantastic. Both actors did flawless making every reaction and the energy in the film feel exactly how I would imagine it feeling like.

It may change your way of life.,"First let me say that Before Sunrise, like all movies, is NOT a movie for all tastes. It appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact, but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people.  For me, like most folks here, Before Sunrise struck a deep chord in me, I was truly stunned, moved, inspired by it. This is  a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing. It creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine. It is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings I got from it.The movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other. It is very intelligent and inspiring, not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of Jesse and Celine's discussions, but rather the little nuances, the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other. It captures an honest, romantic, yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime Viennese milieu; it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world. And what happens after that night is open for debate, but I never doubt that they won't each other again.The facile comments by RockytheBear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie.See it and it may change your way of life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"This is not a 8+ film people, sorry","I have just re-watched this with my girlfriend as we are always hungry for good quality yet light / romantic movies. Having a romantic movie with an 8.1, Before Sunrise was a no brainer.But I was disappointed.I think there's definitely a genre or type or movie like this one. The one where you follow a couple attentively as they progress through their relationship and discuss many of life's big themes. I get that. But within that formula there are better movies in my view.I don't like Ethan Hawke here one bit. I don't think he is very believable as a cynic.Aside from the poem scene - which is a great one - I found myself eye-rolling more than once. That scene in the cafe where Jesse says ""come here, I have a secret"" and then kisses Natalie? Ugh. Dreadful.I'd think I would like it more if the story was self-contained. Knowing there are 2 more movies also ruins it a bit for me, because that was supposed to be the best part about the plot, they only had one night and that was it.It's a decent movie at best but within this type of movie there are much better ones - When Harry Met Sally and Annie Hall in particular come to mind.Those are 8 and above movies, not this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I mean the pseudo intelligent American boy just could not shut his mouth all over the movie together with a french girl speaking English who could not shut it up either. The conversation after while was getting so boring that only good thing was the sightseeing of Vienna. They both tried so hard to be deep that it was actually shallow and unreal.

A Painfully Realistic Story of Young Love,"After a chance encounter on the train, a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of Vienna, discussing life and love. The primary reason to see ""Before Sunrise,"" is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines. As ""Celine,"" this sexy, brainy, soulful brown-eyed blond is sort of a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Joni Mitchell as they were in their mid-twenties. Risking overstatement, Celine is practically the ideal woman, unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural, unpretentious, introspective, and selflessly loving. We can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak, for her sincere, intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating. Further, her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks English with a French accent that is very endearing.If there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie, it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar. Ethan Hawke as ""Jessie"" comes off like a vaguely appealing slob, sort of a Maynard G. Krebs of the nineties. Attempting to appear detached and nonchalant, he sort of drags himself through certain shots. His pants fit poorly, his tee shirt is coming untucked, his wavy dark hair (his most attractive feature) needs a good washing, and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee. Nevertheless, he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two-week train ride around Europe, so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine. His oft-cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic Celine, although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation. When he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence, we know he is getting somewhere.After blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes, bars, and silly diversions, they agree that because they may never see one another again, they should make the most of it. Jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass, looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up.Given his boundless luck in the romance department, it is especially irksome when Jessie, as the very definition of a naive jerk, foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp. He contents himself with a half-baked plan, quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu, to reunite at the same spot in half a year. When the appointed time comes, you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another, perhaps even married and pregnant. For whatever reason, she probably won't show, while Jesse, who ends up working at Target or (if he's lucky) the local library, will go back to Vienna, desperate to see her again, only to wind up alone.Despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion, ""Before Sunrise"" is a beautiful movie. I highly recommend both it and the sequel, ""Before Sunset.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simplicity at its elegant best,"Before Sunrise is the sort of movie that is very rarely made.

A romance film with a thinking brain,"Two young people are travelling in Europe. They happen to meet on a train and decide to get off at Vienna to spend a day together before travelling back to their individual homes. This movie is pretty much that one evening and night they spend together.Sounds like a pretty typical romantic drama or comedy, doesn't it? And yes, to a certain degree I agree. A few things set it apart from the rest, though. First, the age of the two leads. At least in my opinion these movies are usually about teenagers or about people in their thirties or late twenties. But these two are in their early twenties, barely at that. They're adults, but only just about. And that is reflected in their characters very well. I can easily imagine that I was just like this five to seven years ago. Being more comfortable in your skin than you were during your adolescence, but still unsure about the world and your place in it. Starting to get an idea about what you think about the world, what kind of a person you are, but still deep down very undecided about anything.Secondly, I do admire the fact that these two are most interested in the personalities of each other. The film is laden with dialogue for a reason. It's mostly them getting to know one another, talking just about anything. There are certainly romantic scenes, but even they're rather talkative. And these are good talks. Once again, their age is reflected very well in how they talk and what they talk about.Full compliments to Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as well. They play their characters beautifully. Sure, Hawke's character is a bit cocky for my taste, but he's not a bad kid by any means. Just a bit full of himself. Then again, I do have to admit that I probably was as well at that age.Before Sunrise is a nice breath of fresh air.

No cheesy romance type cheedar cheese conti,"Before Sunrise (1995) is a humanistic portrayal of romance, and the audience is presented with Jesse (Breaking Bad xD) and Celine (Dior) who are the ice cream of this movie.

We are able to experience the flow of love through artistic expression of Richard Linklater (sadly its not David Fincher). He must have had a good life but I have not experienced that yet so unlucky.The use of various cinematic shots that depict the visual perspective of romance has been used, unlike 21st century directors going AstroWorld New Legoland Park in Florida. My favourite scene was when Jesse and Celine are on the top of the building and we are presented with a birds eye of this clear establishing romance. This is very effective to the audience as it shows that yes, they are clearly in love but that there is vast emptyness in the future.

Sublime Poetry,"'Before Sunrise' is an example of cinema at its purest, simplest and most sincere form. How can I start describing it? Shall I start with the dazzling locations? The beautiful score? The stupendous screenplay? The breathtaking dialogues? The vivacious cinematography? The terrific direction? The excellent performances? Linklater is clearly a very versatile director. The way he's put everything in this film together is outstanding. Even though I'm familiar with Europe, the way he portrays the locations makes me want to visit those places. Throughout the film we see Jesse and Celine walk through the streets of Vienna and Linklater wonderfully returns to the same places in the end and even though both the characters have left for their respective current destinations the one feels their essence as if walking down memory lane.The development of the bond between Celine and Jesse is shown in a very subtle form. We can easily see how they are falling in love by noticing the way they look at each other, the way they talk to each other and the way they touch each other. The dialogues are sheer magic. The exceptional combination of humour, philosophy, spontaneity and subtlety brings a uniqueness about its treatment and yet it feels fascinatingly familiar. A charismatic Ethan Hawke and luminous Julie Delpy deliver natural performances. There is a sizzling chemistry and it is very easy to lose sight of the fact that they were acting. I feel both these two extraordinary actors are criminally underrated.The soundtrack marvelously stays in tune with the film. The cinematography guides us through the city as we walk along with Celine and Jesse, participating as silent observers without them being aware.'Before Sunrise' is sublime poetry. It is a must have for my DVD collection and the soundtrack for my CD collection. I will surely be revisiting it many more times as I know there will be something new to discover during each viewing.",,Anonymous,Romance

It's So Natural And Realistic,"I watched The Whole Before Trilogy For The First Time In Just One Sitting, i couldn't help but i was so invested into the characters that i wanted more and more, It's one of the most unique Cinematic Experiences I Ever Had, It's something I've never seen before, Those Long Conversation Really Were Deep to me. I could just sit there and watch them talking for days. I never got bored at any moment. I loved how realistic it is starting from a young love to the marriage it ended. It felt sooo natural. The little details were the best things, Jesse And Celine Are The Real Life Romeo And Juliet. It's totally different from the Hollywood depiction of Ideal Love and All Those Fairy Tales.

wonderful film - completely recommended!,"This is a wonderful film; warm, sincere and beautifully made with moments and images that stay with you long after the perfect ending.It was recommended to me by an old university mate who labelled it his favourite film ever and who insisted that I watched it too as it would 'make me cry, change my life and make me happy.'  I was instantly intrigued and he was absolutely right!  I've since watched it, bought it and included Vienna in a month's inter-railing around Europe. I could go on and on about so many of the scenes and how perfectly Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy capture the wonder and excitement which comes with the unexpected meeting of someone who touches you and steals your heart. Someone with whom the simple act of getting to know them becomes something magical and with whom a day spent chatting and sight-seeing can become other-worldly and never to be forgotten.  Timeless and universal insecurities, emotions and moments are naturally and effortlessly portrayed by the leads between whom there is a tangible chemistry which is a joy to watch. I could watch this film over and over again.  There is always something to savour as you immerse yourself totally in this captivating love story.

A short poetic love story of strangers,"Two wonderful actors - Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy - play young students who meet on a train in Europe and decide to get off at Vienna to spend the next 24 hours together. This is basically a road film but it develops like a one of those garden variety 24-hour real-life documentary. It could have been a cliche love story. Instead it brings out the culmination of subtlety and inspirational love story largely thanks to great plot and outstanding selection of actors. The film is depicting a process of two young people with different backgrounds gradually understanding and falling for each other: Ethan Hawke as a bit self-absorbed American student visiting a possible girlfriend in Spain only to leave broken-hearted and Julie Delpy as a  French student with rather political point of view on world affair - she resents the situation in former Yugo-slavia in the early scene. The two get closer as they walk through streets of Vienna encountering kind strangers in the city.Not distracted by strong supporting actings is what makes this love story engrossing and very focused and an ultimate flirting, you'd call it if you are a cynic, becomes a poetic love story by sometimes serious discussions on life and love and the beautiful city of Vienna.I'd say this film is the best romantic road film of the 90s. If you liked this one, you'd probably love 'The Surething' which in my opinion is the best romance film of the 80s. I strongly recommend both films if you are a romantic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Seen this many a time just to fall in love with it.,"Seen this many a time just to fall in love with it.It's easily one of the best romantic movies I have ever seen. Now romance need not be just physical but conversational, and this movie drives all way through in conversation between a couple, a pair. When I saw it first time my enthusiasm was only if the boy-girl be together or part. Once I saw if for first time, each time I was more in love with the conversation they had.The story, the plot is simple its a boy meets girl and we have got to see a romance budding like a blossoming flower that is gonna be so very beautiful the next dawn. Now, had the conversation be kiddish and childish as they happen in our marriage looks (typically Indian marriage looks) where the boy and girl as each other their interests, their likes and dislikes, this could have been a bore, the conversation is so very intriguing ranging from what pisses you off to how we dream our own world to be.It's all about Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) and what a day of a lifetime it was for them so it shall be for us, I promise for us if we care to watch such movies with a ear and a heart.Now, there are so many subdued underlying themes in this that can be found if we sit and just explore even a poem on milkshake seems to be saying something about a lifestyle. This movie is more about life than about anything else. It's a must watch for all those who just love the love we want to have or we are already having in our own lives. Just have time for this and get your ears for words seem like music all through.Just love it and will keep loving it. It's 5/5 for one of the best romances ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The unique thing about this film that I noticed right away,"was how it really seemed natural. It didn't seem like two people were speaking well rehearsed lines, more like it was real conversations so the whole thing came across very naturally and I liked that. It could almost have been a cameraman following two ordinary people except that the storyline wouldn't have been likely in real life. I liked this film, it went smoothly and was generally happy.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great,"Along with one other film, this film and its sequel have moved me more than any others. Many great comments have been posted here. I would add that repeated viewings of the film reveal to me that it's only Jesse who's ambivalent about turning the night into something lasting. He's from a divorce background and seems to want to keep an image of himself as a footloose kid. You can see it in the way he walks away jauntily and youthfully from the train station after they part. It's not so much a ""guy thing"" as personal psychology. Celine is from a happy home and has no ambivalence--she wants them to be together and stay together. It's almost too painful that they lose each other for nine years, and that Jesse comes back six months later but doesn't find her there. The film superbly uses imagery and music to evoke the deeply sacred nature of the love that they find. Yes it is ""romantic,"" but also realistic--sometimes people do meet who are wonderful matches for each other. In their youth and relative innocence and inexperience, they're swept into something mighty and profound. The film's exceptional blend of rapture and pain comes from the suspense of not knowing if they (Jesse) will be smart enough to make sure they hold onto this connection. Of course, this is what makes the ending of Sunset such an overpowering relief--at the very least they'll remain in touch and know where each other is. I think we're dealing here with rare works of art because of the balance and blending between the finest of detail on the surface and the deepest of profundity and poignancy in the background. After the predawn love in the park, we see the mundane, sun-drenched city, hear the harpsichord and the church bells, see them sitting at the base of the statue with her resting her head in his lap--all superb, beautiful, and exceptionally moving.It's a great moment when they're having ""the conversation"" about whether they'll stay in each other's lives, and they seem to reach a sad conclusion, and then the Strauss waltz starts playing in the background. This is ""risky"" and would be sentimental in a less-great movie. In this movie it works wonderfully. It's also wonderful that so soon after they meet, they start talking about death and visit a cemetery. This is because they both sense, intuitively, that they've met a person who deeply resonates for them, someone with whom they can talk about anything--they comprehend all of life and even death for each other. Watch the film more and you start to see how metaphysical it is. They sit in the church, they hear the church bells in the morning, they talk of the afterlife, birth, reincarnation, and all the metaphysical questions. They are ""everything"" to each other. In other words, simply and prosaically, they're people who could be life-partners and be happy with each other, with all that entails. Such things happen, after all. They almost lose all of it, but by the end of Sunset have regained at least part of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Boring...,"""Before Sunrise"" is the first movie of the ""Before"" trilogy and I think that it's the most boring from the three. And that's because I thought when I saw the title and the poster I was expecting something different from this, and I mean more than just a day.Although I liked very much Ethan Hawke in this role and I think the selection of Julie Delpy in the role of the girl was equally good. I also think that the selection of the city of Vienna it was really nice because it's a romantic city in which you have to see many beautiful sight seeings as we watch in this movie.Finally I want to tell you that when I saw the rest of this trilogy I reconsider how bad it was and I changed my opinion for such a movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cute and Charming Gem,"Before Sunrise (1995)*** 1/2 (out of 4)American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) strikes up a conversation with the French Celine (Julie Delpy) on board a train and soon asks if she'd like to walk around Vienna for a day. Richard Linklater's film was a modest hit when it was released but overtime it's grown into a cult favorite and it's easy to see why. I enjoyed the film when I originally saw it theatrically but revisiting it all these years later makes me realize why it's so special. Obviously you've got the terrific screenplay but you've also got two of the most charming and real performances you're ever going to see. What's so amazing about this movie is that it really comes across as a documentary that has no screenplay and doesn't feature actors. The film really does seem like something from life that has an invisible camera just following around two people who just met and we see where the talking leads them. It's pretty incredible to think that this film works as well as it does because there's really nothing that happens here. The two people walk around talking and every once in a while they sit down somewhere and talk. It took a lot of courage for a film like this but in the end it really pays off. Both Hawke and Delpy turn in some of the best work of their careers and without their chemistry there would be no film. Again, this thing shouldn't have worked for so many reasons but the two stars are so flawless that you can't help but believe the relationship as it blooms. I really liked the way both of them got to make complete characters who aren't alike but they still enjoy their time together. Hawks was the real stand out here because he perfectly brings that charm and laid back coolness to the character. The screenplay gives the two a lot of different stories to tell and while not all of them are interesting, even the less interesting ones still seem like a real conversation you'd have. Throughout a lot of the film I think Linklater makes it so easy to follow because the viewer can see themselves having these same types of conversations with someone in their own lives. BEFORE SUNRISE is a cute little film that manages to be very charming and leaves a smile on your face as the closing credits start.",,Anonymous,Romance

A beautifully honest take on human relationships,"Two strangers spending hours walking along Vienna conversing, that's basically the premise of the film and would make you think it's a borefest but it's actually the movie that you never forget, the one you keep visiting. Every conversation is a priceless gem. It ranges to everything from palmistry to relationships. Most of the movie is about human relationships, we get to see two perspectives on everything. Undoubtedly one of the best romances ever written, the way it touches upon emetions all of us have felt at least once in our lives and makes us see it in a different light, there is so much to learn from the movie, so much to love about it. The conversations are as real as it can get, nothing superficious about it, just raw human emotions. The conversations never get preachy.There's stunning chemistry between the leads, they make you fall in love with them instantly.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"There's nothing to it, yet there is so much","Here is cinema in its most simplified and most raw form. Before Sunrise is what you get when you strip away all of the flash, all the flare, and all the cluttering visual elements of a story and instead simply turn on the camera and allow two actors to be together and tell a story completely driven by poignant dialogue. Before Sunrise stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as Jesse and Celine, respectively. Jesse, an American traveling Europe for his own vague reasons, meets Celine, a French girl, on a train on the way to Vienna. The two immediately strike up conversation and wind up taking a spontaneous trip through Vienna together, where they slowly fall in love, despite their inevitable split the next day when they both must return to their respective home countries. It's a beautifully told tale of blossoming love, while tragedy looms in the background.Richard Linklater loves telling stories in unconventionally unique ways, and Before Sunrise is one of his earliest and most successful attempts at unique storytelling. Of course, the film's uniqueness stems from its simplicity. I feel like if you go into this movie expecting any more than talking you are doomed to hate it. But, if you go into it expecting rich dialogue and textured characters contemplating life, love, and the universe, you are bound to really enjoy this film.There really isn't a whole lot to say about this lovely little film, because all of its charm and beauty stems from its simplicity. There is so little to this movie, and yet so much to enjoy as you fall in love with these characters, subsequently just falling in love with the whole idea of love, because Hawke and Delpy make it look like such a naturally magnificent thing. You have here a film that essentially goes nowhere (it all does take place in one city in one night), yet takes you on such a journey into the psyche and the dynamics of these two fascinating characters who, along the way, meet a whole cast of other interesting and eccentric individuals who move the story along.If anything is wrong with this movie it's that you can see the slight inexperience in Linklater's writing, something he has obviously overcome because he has made a slew of other fantastic films since making what is only his third feature film. The script, albeit very well written, does walk the line between superficial and profound at times. And yet the conceited ideals our protagonists exude coincide with the youthful ignorance this film beautifully portrays in its characters.This film captures the spirit of its characters, and draws you into accepting all of the decisions which, in retrospect, might have been foolish. A girl getting off a train with a stranger she just met to visit a town she's never been to seems like a bad idea if you ask me, but Before Sunrise convinces us so genuinely that love is real and will conquer all.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Basic but beautiful,"It's a movie with the most basic of storylines and the most beautiful portrayal of the same! Now that's perhaps eaxctly how romantic movies should be- a few great lines and then just normal conversation between two love birds about their thoughts and ideas. And the best part, being honest to each other, and being a listener. It was amazing how they listened to each other everytime with so much interest , it looked natural.There are a lot of adorable scenes, like the one in which they mimic talking to a friend and infact confess their feelings for each other in the process. Then there is the discussion at church about how they perceive life. Every couple can take a note out of this movie!!!!

About as perfect as films come,"Have you ever just sat there stunned at the conclusion of a film over how good it was? That was my experience at the end of 'Before Sunrise'. What a mesmerising film. Everything about it, the acting, the dialogue, the direction, the cinematography, the creation of the relationship is just perfect.The film feels like it was highly improvised. However from what I read that was not the case. I think this is more a testament to the actor's performances and also how perfectly written the dialogue was. The film feels incredibly natural.I know there are two sequels to this film completing a trilogy. I can't wait to see them and I suspect they will be amazing in their own way. However a part of me wonders, when a film is this perfect, whether it should just be left as is. Mind you, if you have more story to tell, then tell it, right?I loved this film from minute one until the credits finished. It's proof that you can make a captivating masterpiece without any action or CGI or weapons or violence or even really any conflict at all for that matter. All you need is amazing characters and a story for them to tell. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is a film that makes me deeply long for love.,"Such a long day for them to discover themselves-every kiss, every touch, every moment they bare their hearts to each other. The intensity of fantasy and the fleeting beauty of youth consume me entirely.A pure and fleeting encounter, a love so real yet dreamlike-it's utterly intoxicating.It reminds me of my high school exchange program with Japan. At first, my exchange partner and I were a bit awkward around each other, but over time, we became inseparable, like soulmates who could talk about anything. Even though the program lasted only three days, it felt like we had known each other for three months. On the day he left, we promised to stay in touch forever. But in the end, we only chatted on Instagram for two weeks, and then... nothing.I completely understand the feeling of separation between Céline and Jesse. Even though I live in an era of instant communication, I still long for a world without it-a world where we can only imagine each other from afar, silently hoping for one another's growth. That kind of connection is the most beautiful of all.I haven't watched the second and third films yet, but honestly, I kind of wish there were no sequels. This ending is already perfect.

Actually I rated this 8,"So simple, yet so powerful... Yes, it's what it is. The realism is strong with the feeling of being on a journey. Who didn't go on a journey before? To make money, to get education, to holiday or just because of boredom. Everyone makes a journey. Mixture of fear, excitement, anxiety and awe of unknown, remember that feeling? At some point, we're on a journey in this world. This movie creates a connection (willingly or unwillingly) to this very emotion with a very simple trick and there you go. By close up before and afterwards to streets and places characters visit, cinematography reminds you places you go will continue to exist after you long gone. It feels like as if I am watching the places I've never returned and been only once from a CCTV or something. Then, you will suddenly feel like both a tourist who witnessed two people's love story, and seeing the vision of your never-ever-happened past as you really emphasize the happenings via extraordinary tool of journey. It's crazy but it works.Some movies stick around. Some don't. You know, this movie does. Actually I rated this 8 firstly but after couple of months I realized that it sticks with me.

moments gone by...,"My watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together...which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism... and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships! As a lot has been written about the movie already, it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved.I think the point where Jesse and Celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending 24 hrs... the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with...On the plot front , making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish..I believe in romantic flicks of such flavor , the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer's and director's mind. What the actors bring out is what becomes of them .. right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify... to become the character, the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story...here both the actors do just the RIGHT job!

Annoying frat boy hits on French girl. For 12 hours.,"Annoying frat boy hits on French girl. For 12 hours. But the worst part is that the French girl goes along with it. For 12 hours. And we are forced to go along with it. For 2 hours. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to smack someone.Perhaps it wouldn't have been so bad if there had been some sort of chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. I mean, after all, even annoying frat boys can fall in love. But no. The two are so incompatibly different that, despite what the script says, none of the flirtations are believable. I imagine the minute the director yelled ""cut"", Julie would spin around and head straight for her trailer. Ethan would go soak his head. The problem is that the director never yells ""cut"". Instead we are subjected to watching the awkward, contrived and stiff ramblings of these two people who have nothing in common except for the script.I saw what the director was trying to do. He was trying to capture the poetry of life through long, continuous shots and mundane dialogue. He was trying to show us how wonderful the simplicity of everyday life can be. But there is nothing artistic or poetic about the shots, the dialogue or the emotion on screen.

The authentic of love,"I have always wondered about the nature of love and our need for it-a mystery that has persisted throughout human history. One day, after watching the movie 'Before Sunrise,' I experienced an epiphany about the true essence of love. The film emphasizes 'authenticity,' encapsulating the entirety of love and only authenticity can define true love. True love offers a refuge, free from superficial adornments, allowing us to be our true selves without the need to hide.

Pleasantly surprised! Highly recommended,"With so many previous reviews already published about this absolute *gem* of a movie from 1995, I will keep my own comments purposefully short.I must confess that I had effectively ignored this film (and also it's two sequels) for many years, having made the classic mistake of ""Judging a book by it's cover"". Based on the title(s) and personnel involved, I had filed Before Sunrise as a sugar-sweet ""Romantic Comedy"" - and with not being a fan of such genres, chose to not bother with watching it. Big mistake!Of course, over the course of the film's (short) duration, there *is* romance and also some comedic scenes and lines of dialogue. However, both are handled in such an expert, ""low-key""/subtle manner by the cast, director and cinematographer that at no point did this film annoy me (when again I must concede I felt for certain that it would...).Another reason for previously giving this one a miss was Richard Linklater - a director who I have not encountered often, but I could recall struggling with the likes of ""Waking Life"" - and ""Tape"" in particular (I film that I should perhaps now revisit... but at the time felt highly irritated by - sorry, Richard...).Having now taken the plunge and watched all three of the ""Before..."" trilogy, I cannot recommend them highly enough! I think overall I would say the first part/""chapter"" is my favourite - but all three proved to be highly entertaining - mostly as a direct result of the amazing on-screen chemistry between Delpy and Hawke (quite how those two are not a real-life couple is beyond me - so natural are the performances that they give.In fact, at times I almost felt like a voyeur (of sorts) - hanging out with the couple as they meander the streets of Paris (without them being aware)! This is again due to Linklater's superb direction and ""up close"" involvement you end up having in each and every scene.Sorry for the ramble.. but I suppose the two main points I would like to end on would be:1) Never EVER judge a book (or in this case *film*) by it's cover - and:2) If (like me) you have previously avoided this series of films, GIVE THEM A TRY.

cuz,"R: Super romantic movie based on dialog between only two characters, Jesse was stereotypical American boi.K: A well directed dialog based movie and with differrent angles and cuts. What i like bout the movie is it randomness. 2 different characters meeting each other on coincidence and falling in love.

"When Disappointed in Love, I Come Back to This Masterpiece","I don't even remember how many times I have seen this movie. I seem to come back to it any time I go through a heartbreak, and this time is no different. It reminds me of what it's like to love someone when you're young - you don't think about the circumstances or how you're going to do it, you just love.This year, I discovered that the movie was based on a true story, that actually happened to the director! His story had a bitter ending though. He learned, as he was releasing 'Before Sunset', that the girl he had met had died in a motorcycle crash in 1994, even before 'Before Sunrise' was released. That really made a dent in my heart. How poignant. The fact that he still made 'Before Midnight', imagining their lives together, really made my heart whole. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
my thoughts,"i have been fooling around alone these days due to a week of national holidays, in which i was supposed to do some studies instead of taking a break, for i have to do some preparatory work for my vague future. this kind of life sucks. so i turn to movies, especially somethings about love, romance and the alike. my roommate recommends me to have a look at ""before sunrise"" which iss in his opinion so warm and worth seeing. i did give it a shot, and get unexpected feelings. seeing the familiar settings in Vienna(i have been to a country near to it and the city appearance there is so much similar to it),i get rekindled and recall those past days i spent abroad. it sorrowfully reminds me of being set up. i do not mean to pursue romantic relations,for which i do not think i am already well prepared. but whenever i got exposed to these sort of movies, they inevitably within me promote the same feeling that ask me to go in for love.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Incomprehensible,"I simply do not understand the ""10 star reviews"" on this film. A young man and woman meet on a train. They start talking and the man convinces the woman to get off the train and walk around Vienna with him until it's time to catch his plane back to America instead of her original plan, which was to take the train back to Paris.This initially somewhat charming ""inciting incident"" is then followed for what seems like 24 excruciating hours of babbling and rambling discourse that sounds like it was made up on the spot. I didn't care about either one of these people, although the female character initially seemed much, much more intelligent and balanced than the male character. And yet she too got into the blab-fest and started to drive me insane. The man was judgmental and critical and dismissive of almost everything and I did not find anything about him remotely likable.If you think it is interesting to watch people playing pinball machines, walking through cemeteries, drinking beer out of bottles, wandering up and down streets, all while making peculiarly mundane commentary and observations and comments about life, you'll have a blast. If that sounds like a cure for insomnia, you'll be sound asleep about 10 minutes in to it.Absolutely deadly.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Movie Not Married,"I think the memory of this is better than the movie itself.I recently saw the sequel. It was one of the most delicate and perfect things I know so far as that shell of romance which is outside of intimacy. That was because  I think  of the actors and and the lines they contributed. It makes the timing natural. It doesn't take geniuses for this because the two characters are acting and playing natural acting is easier than playing natural life.But a huge part of what made that work was the memory of this. So I went back and watched it. Its nice, I suppose, but far, far worse than ""Before Sunset."" It seems just like all the other Linklater movies: thin, effete, words with no edge. Corners with no walls.Delpy is radiant, of course, having just been through the school of Kieslowski.I think you'll just have to sit through this, probing it, looking for something that sticks and not finding it. You'll have to do this so that you can remember it sweetly. The memory matters, at least it did for me. I guess I was remembering the movie I wish it were, about the perfection never achieved.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Romance
Great,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I don't think I could ever get tired of it or not be moved by some part of it.  The story is so simple, but I've never seen or heard of another movie like it -- a document of two people meeting on a train in Europe, deciding to spend the day with each other and falling in love.  There's a line in the movie which goes:I believe if there's any kind of God, it wouldn't be in any of us.  Not you, or me... but just this little space in between. If there's any kind of magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone, sharing something. I know, its almost impossible to succeed, but... who cares, really? The answer must be in the attempt.The movie is filled with intelligent lines like this between two intelligent, likable, complicated, confused people, just contemplating life and each other, which just hit me with their truth and beauty.  It sounds cornball, I know.  Ultimately, Before Sunrise may be nothing if not a test of how sappily romantic you are.  But I think objectively it succeeds because it walks the line so artfully between realism and romanticism, and I think you have to be a little bit of both to like it:  knowing how unlikely it is for a stranger on a train to change your life, but allowing for the possibility, and rooting for people who take it when it comes.There's a voyeuristic element to the film, like My Dinner With Andres, or a documentary, where you're just listening to people talking, and it wouldn't be anything worth mentioning if it weren't so beautifully written, and completely believable.  I normally don't like Ethan Hawke, but he's very good in this.  And if you're a red-blooded male, you have no choice but to fall in love with Julie Delpy.  A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Everything they say and all their actions and reactions seem so genuine.

soulful drama of an idealized romance ..,"Why do we need twist and tales and stuff in romantic movies to keep it going when it can be kept simple & meaningful! Before Sunrise is such a masterpiece, very simple yet so sophisticated and one of the best romantic movies ever made - romcoms, scifiroms, noirroms and all those movies with romance as a subplot are categorized as pure romantic genre nowadays.What would you do with your girlfriend if you are given a day off! what would you talk about, where would you go to spend time! yea, its difficult, the world is no small compound to take her for a walk or tell her about stuff you want to, in a day. Well, the movie is all about two strangers finding something between them so soulful that they can spend only a day before they have to part ways.The movie voww, it is all like magic, the conversation, the walk and the night spent and the final departure which was so painful. Am not that fond of Ethan Hawke, but then its magic that works out when hes there with Julie Delpy. The final scene leaves a lump in your throat, so poignant when those places they visited are shown vacant in the end. The background score would only thicken your sore throat.A soulful Drama with nothing but pure romance, indeed one of the the best romantic movies ever made.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Before Sunrise,"Before Sunrise, while the story is really meant to be taken at face value, in combination with obvious film techniques such as shot composition, lighting, and the changes from ""real-time,"" to ""created-time,"" certainly creates this wandering aspect, representative of the ""Slacker genre,"" of film relating to Generation X.The story being a simple, open-ended love story is an effective means of breaking the conventional strategies of story-telling (Protagonist vs Antagonist, conflict, epiphany and a decisive conclusion). The film gives the viewer a sense of the wandering, loose, flimsy, and sometimes clumsy reality of a date (even though this would be an exceptional date between two people) between two people who share a sense of being overwhelmed by their post-modern condition, where they struggle to think of or do anything original or particularly substantial. through the film having very little conventionally shot scenes, and very normal dialogue (which is unconventional in Hollywood films), helps with that sense of realism.In any case, I was pleasantly surprised by this film, not thinking it will be all that interesting, but if you are a film-buff, it is not your run-of-the-mill Hollywood romance movie. It achieves a sense of realism with this ideal date scenario far more successfully than anything I've seen in the past 5 or so years, as trends are currently to create a fantasy that viewers can relate to, rather than realistic scenarios in any genre really (even the news is susceptible, nowadays).I would give this movie an 8, however I think of it as an, ""acquired taste,"" so I gave it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Irresistibly romantic.,"What a breath of fresh air. Watching this film makes me wonder why i put myself through watching so many empty, soulless blockbusters. Watching Before Sunrise is a great experience. You feel for the characters, you understand their awkwardness,their joy and their discovery. It's so familiar to so many of us, you also feel their pain and their melancholy toward the end and ultimately, its irresistibly romantic. From a story or narrative point of view, there is nothing, this is all about the human beings in the film and it's all the better for it. Credit must go to Richard Linkater for his unfussy direction, that just allows to film to breathe,unwind and gradually stretch it's legs. I loved Before Sunrise, and i can't wait to catch up with the characters nine years later in the 2004 sequel, Before Sunset.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best film you're likely to find with the most basic of plots and fewest characters,"Unless you're actually doing something such as watching a film or reading a book, train journeys can seem rather dull. This simple yet now effective fact is used to kick start one of the most underrated, unknown yet oddly attractive films of the 1990's and possibly of all time.The train has been used as a setting in film for decades and romance is never too far away when it is the setting; whether it features in 'Some Like it Hot' (1959) and Jack Lemmon's undeniable attraction to Sugar Kane or in this film: Before Sunrise; a simple yet effective romantic drama (not a comedy) revolving solely around a mere two people and their seemingly random conversations.A film like this one does not have to be glamorous. It does not need to draw the audience in with spectacular visuals or dramatic opening sequences nor does it need to introduce a number of different characters through dialogue or otherwise to prove its point. Instead it takes a 'fly on the wall' approach. Wherever our hero's go; we go. Whatever our hero's hear; we hear. Whatever our hero's talk about; we listen and this carries on throughout. The early portion of this film is fairly light-hearted, even fun. The two people obviously have never spoken to one another in their lives and the seemingly nervous banter early on is real ice-breaker stuff which reeks of originality. The dialogue is original and uses a technique only really exploited with any real mainstream purpose by Tarantino whom, himself, was still basking in the glory of 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) which had only been around for a solitary year when this was made and released. In fact, Ethan Hawke's character's acting and much of his dialogue will remind you of Tarantino himself in the way in which he delivers his lines early on!The nervousness which Celine (Delpy) gives off is counter acted with the rather disturbing confidence that Jesse (Hawke) has throughout the opening half an hour of this film and it creates a rather fascinating juxtaposition as the two counteract each other. Here we have two seemingly complete strangers sharing pretty personal information, pretty early on in the 'relationship' and you really have to watch as to what might happen next. Will Celine accept what this rough, tough looking American has to say? Or will the character slap him and get off at the next tram stop? Interesting stuff as any thing can happen given the fact everything is happening in real time and in a very simple/real environment  no strings attached. This creates a good atmosphere and is complimented by the long takes which stretch out our interest.Once off the train (or any other transport) the normal, familiar settings of a town/cityscape has never worked so well when in conjunction with a story as pleasant or as natural as this. The city; albeit with all its culture, beauty and so fourth - never seems too glamorous nor does it act as an arrogant, over the top setting for a story so subtle as this one yet at the same, it's more than just 'effective'.Given the simplicity of the film, there are flaws. One thing that really bothered me and seemed a little too convenient was that of the bilingual tramp/artist whom they both met during the evening. That seemed a little too forced and a little too coincidental for me, even though the whole premise is, in fact, coincidence as that's how they meet in the first place. Another thing is the certain arrogance the camera takes on. The long takes seem to drag on a little during the film, especially when we are not given any interesting background to catch a breather from. This includes the pinball machine scene in the club and should be compared to the tram scene from earlier on in the film. During these bad examples, the actors seem a little less bothered and the dialogue starts to grate a little which is not a pleasant experience. At least in 'Pulp Fiction', the characters are almost always moving on to the next setting, there's always a bit of colour or background activity and there's no annoying pinball machine noises to distract you!Overall, if you like to travel a lot or if you've visited mainland Europe before or maybe even gone through something like this yourself, you'll like this film. Don't expect anything fantastic, just a decent, well made romance which uses its settings and situation to good effect AND that leaves a fair bit of ambiguity in the air afterwards.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An exceptional movie.,"A very simple story, a dialogue between two complete strangers is the central theme of this story. The characters are very intelligently portrayed, and the topics of their discussion are so common, that you can sense the reality aspect of it very strongly.Never in the movie you get the feeling of it being a movie, it simply flows. The last effect of showing a contrast between the previous evenings places and how they are now empty is exceptional.This movie was an accidental watch for me on HBO.

Why is Before Sunrise my favorite film?,"Before Sunrise is my favorite film of all time.  The main characters, Jesse and Celine, share their thoughts and emotions with sincerity.  The film does a beautiful job of developing their characters and their relationship.  The fleeting nature of life (and the resulting preciousness of transitory moments) is an underlying theme throughout the film, and it is woven in through so many creative media including conversation, poetry, music, art, and cinematography. There is also an element of magic or spirituality running beneath the surface that shines brightest in (as Celine describes) the little space between these two young people.  I can't seem to get enough of this film, and it is sweet torture to wonder what happens next.  If you love it too please e-mail me and we can try to figure out why we appreciate it so intensely while some people find it unremarkable.'Later'",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best romance movies I've seen so far,"The story rolls out the big coincidence thing at the very beginning to develop into something cute. The togetherness depicted in the movie is maybe representative of the kind that many people crave. The kind that is less or even free of having to bind together into a commitment. I like the thing about this movie that the very attraction of the romance depicted in this movie is the conversations, of how thoughtful they are. They don't have to be all in agreement all the time, but they can be resolved in recognition of the different perspectives if thinking. I like how Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy acted out here. They seem to connect nicely. Their performance can depict the needed amount of connection considering the sheer coincidence and serendipity involved in the togetherness.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love should feel like watching this movie,"Once I'm in love, I'll show them this movie. I will use every argument, every word I have to convince them how phenomenal it is. I've never watched a movie that makes me feel the way this one does.This movie communicates love and belonging in a way I've never seen before. It's driven by dialogue and conversation, in which as they're getting to know each other, you're getting to know them.Whenever I watch this movie, I think about how love should be, what makes a great love; it's the vulnerability of expressing you're most secrets of thoughts. Your beliefs, interest, everything you've ever wondered about. Our thoughts and experiences are what makes us real humans, real people, different and unique. When we are brave enough to share these, we're free and open to listen to others, which minds often are as busy as ours.There are many arguments to why someone should watch this movie, but to me one is above all the others: you're watching two, imperfect, lost people fall in love. A spontaneous decision turned in to something memorable, this through great dialogue and simple scenes. A moment in time for two people, a precious moment. A moment you're invited to watch and experience.Simply, this movie made me think about how we should be more open, better listeners and better sharers. I cry every time, and I never cry.

Simple romance executed perfectly,"Nothing happens in ""Before Sunrise."" Two strangers, an American and a French woman, meet on a train and spend an evening together in Vienna -- end of story. Few combinations of script, director and talent could pull this off as a good movie, but Richard Linklater and stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy find a way.Filmmaking has never been this simplistic or difficult. You couldn't devise a film with a more generic premise, which is to say that you couldn't make it any harder on yourself as a filmmaker to make something from seemingly nothing. The characters have to not just be likable, but lovable, the romance has to suck us in and the dialogue has to shoulder the entire workload. Yet that's exactly what ""Before Sunrise"" does. The ceiling for the film is pretty low, but it presses right up against it.Maybe the best part about the characters of Jesse and Celine is that they're pretty normal- looking. They're both attractive, but subtly so, which is where Linklater's film and typical Hollywood fare differ. There's a layer of implicit sincerity there that we don't get from most love stories where beautiful people do things we could only fantasize about it on our best days. Jesse and Celine's connection is built on a natural chemistry and everything might conveniently ""work,"" but it feels real and natural.Hawke and Delpy sell us hard on being normal people. The discussions they're provided in Linklater and Kim Krizan's script helps this along nicely, but the moments they share, whether nervous and tentative, tender or humorous are felt on all levels. What's written is never good enough in a romance, but how the actors convince us of the truth to their words with body language and communicating a multitude of signals both to each other and to the camera. Their romance feels like the romance we not only want to have, but unlike Hollywood, we also feel like we can attain. That's what sets ""Sunrise"" apart.Hard to imagine how this film came from the same mind as the man behind ""Slackers"" and ""Dazed and Confused."" All good films, but the focus on two characters here makes the difference. The real strength of the script here lies in the creation of complex character backstory without the use of expository writing or flashbacks. By the end of the film, you know exactly the kind of people the two of them are, even though you've only seen it through their interactions with each other.""Before Sunrise"" should definitely be considered the benchmark for romance films. Literally no events occur in this film yet it stays interesting through lively and sincere conversation from two actors that have a knack for realism. Hundreds of films have and will be done better in the romance genre, but the structural bones of ""Before Sunrise"" are the most immaculate around. Even if a film doesn't put you on edge or do something special, you have to be able to recognize great intangibles and there's no arguing with those of ""Sunrise.""~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romanticism and philosophy.,"The perfect love story: two strangers, an American guy and a french girl, they both meet in a train and they decide to spend together one single night in Vienna (after that they'll have to split up forever). Walking around that monumental city, chats about anything, poetry, wine, sex under the light of the stars. Kind of a mix between ""Brief Encounter"" and Rohmer's ""Tales of the four seasons"". It is a simple movie, with such an existentialist touch, which leans on the naturalness of Delpi and Hawke, and the chemistry between them.

Gag them with a spoon,"One of the most difficult scenes in acting is when a fictitious character is to naturally recount an old memory.  Often in dramatics, an actor tells of some old memory with just a hint of averted eyes and awkward facial expressions.  It is difficult to act out the natural timing of facial expressions as a person taps their own memory.  In real life, we all do this with ease with our true memories.  But actors in a movie are dealing with make-believe, so there is nothing in their brains to be retrieved and it is very easy to see through the acting.From beginning to end, BEFORE SUNRISE is a movie with two main characters who do almost nothing but recount to each other happenings from their individual pasts.  Unfortunately, the actors are not up to this difficult task.Apparently, most of these many strolls down memory lane are meant to end with some clever insight on humanity.  About one in one hundred succeeds.There is no catchy music, no passion, and very little to maintain interest. The viewer's mind begins to ponder side items, such as the facial structure of the actors chosen for this movie.  The lead actor and actress have the same nose and chin and eyes.  They could be brother and sister.  And the palm reader looked to be the mother of the lead actress.Last, the script has some unmissable glitches.  The audience that was around me murmured much disapproval during the bar scene when the bar owner and the lead actor shake hands in a deal in which the bar owner would give the lead actor the mailing address to the bar so that the lead actor can later mail payment for wine given out.  Just when we expect the address to be given, the lead actor walks away and he and the bar tender act as if the deal never happened.The characters learn about each other in an impractical backwards manner in terms of the since of mating.  No digits are exchanged.  No addresses or details, ever.  Perhaps there is never enough time in BEFORE SUNRISE because the script gives highest priority to retelling of old memories -- old memories that are fake.  Unsatisfying.  Unentertaining.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Beautifully done, Must watch.","My wife and I (tragically) had never heard about the ""before"" trilogy up until this week, so we watched ""Before Sunrise"" yesterday. Clearly, then, this review is within the spectrum of the first movie alone, free of paradigms encompassing the scope of the entire trilogy. Truly romantic, though not filled with Hollywoodian cliché. Very Engaging, despite absence of plot twist intricacies, no external characters and the focus on casual dialogues. Tragic, but far from being over-dramaticThis film does not follow a well-labeled confrontation-climax-resolution narrative arc usually present in most romantic movies in the form of falling-fighting-reconciling. The story line is very simple. Even though Vienna sets an idyllic background to the plot, I'd argue that the magic rests on the incredible acting of both actors and the genuinity of their conversations and engagement. I felt the production made sure to make both leads look as ordinary as possible. The romance is never about feet-sweeping attraction or, as mentioned in the movie, ""romantic projections"" that tend to be platonic and unrealistic. It is a simple getting-to-know-you that slowly and tastefully develops into romance, aided by circumstantial factors but never exaggerated, focusing more on their interactions than character development. The tragedy is deep and emotional in nature, perfectly set up, without any slow-motion-running-free-tears scenes with super dramatic soundtrack. It is just so simple and real that it immerses you in a surreal-dream-like night in Vienna that brings back the sweet thrill of meeting your loved one in slightly awkward fashion. No white-horse prince or dashing cheerleader, just that weird person you happened to fall in love with.I believe this is a movie for various tastes. I balk to say, and dread the though of labeling it as such, but this film could easily make it into a chick-flick night. The cult public would highly appreciate the alternative techniques used in the film-making. And even those who don't really dig romantic movies could find themselves lost in a reverie about meeting a special one in a train to Vienna (or taking a trip to Europe with their companion, for that matter).Thumbs up to its cleanliness. The only thing that could worry a parent is the language (that I classify as mild, not strong). Most traditional families could play this on a family night no problem.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A charming and very engaging romance...,"Yesterday, I watched one of the best romance films I have ever seen (if not the best) Before Sunset, and as odd as I am I watched it before the original. Before Sunrise is a very charming and engaging romance, and along with Sunset fits in with the best and most engaging romance films I have ever seen.Maybe seeing Sunset first wasn't a good choice because he timeline is screwed. I know what's going to happen after this one, and I take in their events very differently. But it is still a very engaging work. Unlike Sunset, Sunrise takes the more known approach to romances. It's incredible how much the same sort of characteristics shine through here as in Sunset. If I had to choose I would choose Sunset because I did find he dialogue in that one better and execution of it more refreshing. It's definitely hard for me to separate them now, because together they make for a pair of a story that I will probably never forget.",,Anonymous,Romance
well more than a pleasant journey,"Before Sunrise is with out doubt one of the best in this genre i have seen.It actually feels nice to watch such a movie filled with human emotions and it indeed raises your energy levels.At all point of the movie it was never boring not for a single moment.The director has got the best and the powerful actors Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.With the entire movie revolving around just two characters it was very important to have the right actors in lead.Richard LInklater got that right. The director and the script writer have done a superb job. You know its not easy to move a story with two characters in it. All the conversations looks so natural.And it makes you feel like ""hey i have been in that situation!"".Through out the movie you will be swept off by the chemistry between them.Especially when Ethan asks Julie out in the train! wow! That was very natural.And typically his thoughts are like what every normal man will do. And it leaves everyone in a suspense in the end. All in all its more than just a movie!

"Mr Linklater, consider yourself redeemed!","I must first admit that one star is for the pleasant surprise this delight of a film produced after viewing it a month after surviving director Linklater's awful Waking Life, which was nail bitingly close to being the worst film I have ever witnessed. That said you must be warned, Before Sunrise is what I label a 'hit or miss' movie (no, not in the rhyming slang sense, tsk), in that the impact of the film will depend largely on the viewer, you will either love it or hate it. Also in the film not a lot happens, there is no real drama, conflict or action just 2 people who meet share a day together in Vienna and fall in love. It is a 'talky' film, it almost all dialogue, the dialogue will not always be easy to digest for everyone, I found the film to drag at points, but there are at least some things in here that I think everyone can relate to. What makes the film a success (to some, not all) is the way that this relationship unfolds, with sublime realism and tenderness. A very simple film on the surface it has intricacies that are open for the viewer to interpret in relation to their own lives and feelings.This story put me instantly in mind of Lost in Translation, except for the age gap, the other difference is we have no prior knowledge of the main characters when they meet. We have two young folk travelling home through Europe by train, Jesse, a typically sceptical American guy who has just split with his long distance girlfriend who he left behind in Madrid to go on a whirlwind tour of Europe and Celine, a young idealistic French student, a quiet daydreamer. After sitting opposite each other they get talking, initially about how relationships ware thin with time, which relates to the central theme of the film, and after some nervous stutters a chemistry begins to grow between them. This is pretty much how the film develops, the pair share each others views on the world around them, the after life and the little idiosyncrasies in American and European cultures as the train hurtles on. Not everyone will be able to cope with such a duologue based story, I took time adjusting but unlike Waking Life I managed to do so because the words were delivered by characters as conversation, not monologue by random folk, and it had a context which made the experience easier to relate to. Some of the discussions connected with me, others made me recoil. Some of the philosophising and conversation was elegant in a manner, such as the talk of visions of the dead other times it was grating like Jesse's awful TV idea, made me cringe. This is only to be expected when you are watching 2 characters talk for extended periods about a wide range of issues. Sure these are conversations you would rather engage in than watch but it is the context that really matters, this does not really take hold until later in the film. The characters were not the sort of people I would spend time with personally, they were sorta whiny youths who seem slightly rebellious and perhaps overly sure of the validity of their own views, however although I did not really relate to them (usually not a good thing) I began to enjoy the situation. This is the sort of situation you always hope will occur, you start a conversation with stranger and you get to know each other and find you have an instant connection. Watching these two connect just by talking, the most simple thing, was strangely captivating. I think because it is so believable a situation because the 2 actors who just play it like normal everyday folk having a chat, it made it easy to relate to.On the spur of the moment Jesse, who has to get off the train in Vienna, asks Celine to spend the day with him instead of continuing her journey. She accepts and off they go to talk some more against the backdrop of one of the world's most beautiful cities (after Edinburgh of course), the shots of Vienna really show it off accurately in all it's wonderfully intricate grandeur contrasting with that almost desolate, sleepy continental atmosphere. You start to see slight signs of conflict between the pair's views on life, Jesse dismisses the palm reader who pesters them and has a generally sceptical view on life while Celine (being European) has a very open mind about such things. These subtle differences seem to draw them closer together rather than push them apart, they gradually and visibly become more and more comfortable and relaxed with each other.The film does drag at times, especially in the section where they first get off the train, and it took it's time to work it's magic on me. As their evening wore on though I did finally begin to get absorbed, as I knew the two would soon have to part. That is the beauty of the film, in the fact that for the couple's time is very limited however this means that their relationship will not have the chance to be stretched and eroded by time. Time won't allow for them to grow tired of each others company as it is time itself that will simply dissipate, not their connection. They are able to let go before that bond grows old and fizzles out. That is what makes the film a success, you feel you have had an insight into something most people can only dream of occurring, yet one that is entirely possible if we have the will and desire to act on our instincts. As I said not a film for everyone but one that contains a rare hidden beauty for those that can connect and persevere with it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Lovely,"Before Sunrise (1995) is a poetic dance through the streets of Vienna, earning its 7/10 rating with its enchanting simplicity. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy deliver performances that feel like genuine moments stolen from the ephemeral magic of a chance encounter. The film editing crafts a narrative that unfolds like a serendipitous conversation, capturing the essence of fleeting connections. The strength of the film lies in its ability to transform ordinary moments into profound reflections on life and love. While the weakness may be the minimalistic plot, it's also the film's charm, allowing the audience to savor the beauty of the mundane. The music is a subtle companion, enhancing the emotional resonance of the moments shared between the characters. The cinematography captures the romantic allure of Vienna, providing a visual backdrop to the unfolding connection. Before Sunrise is a quiet masterpiece that, with its 7/10 rating, captures the magic of brief encounters and the enduring power of a single night in the embrace of a foreign city.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Most Overrated Movie I've Ever Seen,"I didn't know much about this movie before watching it. I enjoy romance movies and saw that this one was rated over 8 here on IMDB so I decided to watch it without looking at the reviews. That was definitely a mistake and regret wasting my time watching this.This has got to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. It is just a scene after scene of the two main actors talking about this most inane topics. I really don't care what the characters think about reincarnation or the Quakers. Watching this movie is like being the third wheel on another couple's first date. That isn't fun in real life, why would it be fun to watch it in a movie?To me this isn't really even much of a romance movie. The characters literally just met, this isn't really romance, it is more trying to impress the other person in order to get laid.I get that people like different types of movies so someone that likes an action movie may not like a mystery movie. But I honestly don't understand how anyone could like this movie, it is just so pointless and boring. If you like hearing random people's conversations you may as well just go ride public transit and eavesdrop on people. That would be cheaper and even more realistic.Rating it a 2 star because the scenery and actors are look nice.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Before Sunset and Sunrise are Masterpieces and reviewed together here.,"Before Sunrise is one of those films you stumble across by accident, and it this unexpected confrontation with excellence that causes the audience to experience that shakabookoo moment; that Swift Spiritual Kick to the Head That Alters Your Reality Forever. Before Sunset is life, it is experience. Anyone that has ever met someone they ""kind of like"" and wanted to find out more about them will know what this film is about. This is missed opportunity, this is chance, this is the roll of the dice and the one that got away. In this film a guy meets a girl on a train, they talk about nonsense as is the norm, but instead of saying goodbye and obsessing about what might have been the guy takes the leap of faith and convinces the girl to spend the next 14 hours exploring Vienna with him.Already we see perfection; already this movie is a masterpiece. Is it Ethan Hawke's scruffy American backpacker Jesse that reels us in, or the sexy Celine played by Julie Delpy? I say ""played by"" but there is no ""play"" in this film, there is no performance or representation. In this film the actors achieve such a level that this is nothing other than the ""real"", the dialogue is of a couple exploring one another, the action is the terrified adolescent that hides in every adult, terrified of saying the wrong thing that may cause a loved one to disappear out of their life forever.The beauty of this enchanting film is how the actors communicate what is often unsaid, suggesting that they are about to say something, or make a joke, but think better of it. Vulnerable glances are exchanged; tentative gestures of affection are made. This is the truest representation of a couple meeting, and through conversation realising that they have met their soul mate, ever committed to film.It is heartbreaking to watch the impetuousness of youth dictate that the exchanging of phone numbers is a waste of time, for in youth we wrongly feel that their will be many that we connect with on such a spiritual level. The final moments of the film leave the audience perplexed, with an overwhelming desire to KNOW what happens next. It is a stroke of luck to come across this film after the sequel has been released, for to wait the nine years for Before Sunset to be released would be an exquisite form of torture.In the sequel we see the couple bump onto each other once more, and quite rightly we soon see that both carry scars from their original encounter. The memories of that one perfect night have been encased in crystal and romanticised, so that no future encounter would ever live up to that experience. There is but one option for these playthings of Cupid, they have to explore a complete relationship with one another.As each scene unfolds we look to our watch, counting down the time in which these obvious soul mates have to discover they are made for one another. Early on we feel safe, they are re-acquainting themselves with what once was, playing poker for lovers, in which cards are held close to their chest. But this cannot be maintained, and it is in Jesses company limo that we are truly dragged back into the narrative, fully committed to their relationship when Celine breaks down, screaming about the repercussions that evening had for her; when you have experienced that true connection with another person, everything else is dull in comparison.Again we check our watch, what will happen? Can we endure another departure as in Before Sunrise? The characters are now more mature and world weary; life is taking its toll. Now in their thirties they have an appreciation for each other that was lost in Venice. They have seen more of the world and realised no comparison can be made to that one night they shared together. Priorities are quickly re-arranged. What is life for? What is important? The sequel is snatched moments, fighting against a clock that continuously haunts them. Sometimes we scream for them to be truly honest with each other, to throw off their responsibilities and engulf themselves in their love, other times we fear that their lives will pull them apart, locked into an existence of wondering what could have been.The ending of Before Sunset is perfection, and should be held up as a pinnacle of film making. A scene that is so unexpected and yet so correct, that if your reaction is a cheer, a tear or a jeer, you will know in your heart that it was right, and sit looking at the screen analysing and exploring all of the ""what ifs?"" that the characters will now face.The true charm of the film is not what the characters are experiencing, but the level to which every viewer will project their own life onto the screen, contemplating whether they are with the right partner, or whether at some point in the past they should have spoke up, or allowed time for that special someone. The universal response on viewing this film will be a deep down, soul aching desire to watch yet another sequel in another nine years time. Any film that can haunt its audience in this way is deserving of its title of Masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Extremely touching and moving,"To see this movie alone is not recommended. To see it with the person you love is highly recommended. Because, as someone said,""The only problem is, after a while you start thinking ""how come none of this ever happens to me?"", and you start getting beautifully depressed, and then just plain depressed, and at the end you leave the theatre feeling utterly miserable.""Now this is a feeling I had too(and a very strong one indeed!).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"lovely, engrossing","There was a fellow whose home videos invariably annoyed me.  One day I realized why; each time a conversation began -- something beyond ""Hi, mom!"" and waving -- the tape would cut and the next scene would begin.One begins to wonder -- does this person even LIKE people?  Apparently the stuff of real life seems too dull for some, and they need Entertainment; the amperage on that entertainment has to keep going up and up, also, because we develop immunity toward all of our fixes.  Thus, we wind up with ARMAGEDDON, GODZILLA, et al, or soap opera hysterics; everything pushing the envelope just so we can feel a little (and recognize a movie's cues to us).I thought BEFORE SUNRISE was great not as a reaction against that, but because it's so obvious Linklater and his actors give a hoot about human beings.  Yes, some of the dialogue -- which is very, very sharply observed -- is silly and pretentious; these are kids who want to impress each other, like each other, and enjoy ""deep thoughts.""  It reminded me so much of college: that thrill of ideas, possibilities, yearnings.The movie looks beautiful and is terribly romantic.  Thank God Linklater is savvy enough to play out some conversations in long takes; a cumulative effect and rapport is built between Delpy and Hawke, their pinball game, and us.  They're both movie-star beautiful, but for a while, they're just regular folk.Kubrick and Hitchcock may be better directors than say, Linklater or Levinson, but their cold formalism does make one wonder what grudge they hold against people.  The Coens seem to be warming as well -- FARGO and THE BIG LEBOWSKI bespeak a new affection in their clever hearts.  But, for my money, give me a director who loves people -- a Sturges, a Lubitsch, and, yes, Linklater -- and their works will shine in a way that some geniuses' never do.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Empty spiritedness,"By now you may know that this is about two people falling in love around Vienna and otherwise cinematically plain. Beautiful young faces, beautiful old Europe, in principle very much a European film such as Woody Allen has fantasized about it, if not in actual spirit. He is cynical and boyish, she is a dreamer, excited, open to the flows of life. They listen to music, talk, walk, have their palms read, a really dreamy summer night of sharing and intimacy.We stick it out because at dawn it expires, and the lives of mundane responsibilities are resumed. It is a parting like death of sorts, like someone is going out of life. How will they handle it? Will they fiercely cling at what they shared? Will they accept the memory of it?There is however a second movie that came out 10 years later, where we get to find out whatever happened between these two, or didn't. So for all intents and purposes, whether originally designed so or merely improvised along the way, this is only one half of a full movie - very much like Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for Love. The resolution is predictable, the heartbreak postponed for another sunrise. Oh, we get to know these two really well, whether we like it or not. They are full of opinions, dreams, rebellions, a lot of empty spiritedness like is common in youth discovering a larger world. We get to know them well enough to imagine some pain ahead of them, the bill for the good times enjoyed here.But unlike In the Mood for Love, this has none - perhaps one, the big ferris wheel at sunset - of the melancholy moods to wrap around us, that will allow us to permeate the silence behind words where love runs deeper, richer. It is not cinematically succulent in any ways that I am seeking out.Being from that slacker generation that gave us Tarantino and Kevin Smith, it's a film illustrating a screenplay. The effort is for quirky emotion and smartness. A romance and connection from words, instead of romance from the profoundness of rhythms and gestures. Forgettable work.",,Anonymous,Romance

Never does this wander into cliches, it sticks to its own pace and captures the magic between this couple. I have never felt so personally involved in a movie- when the sun rose I felt like crying. I was screaming, GET ON THE TRAIN JESSE!!! And yet it ends realistically, without fully satisfying the audience with the ""yay everything's perfect"" ending.

"Realistic portrayal of real romance.

The fact real life is not perfect, disagreement is not a fight. It's all very realistic, and way better than most romantic Hollywood movies.However, they are completely different people than me. They are a bit too ""everything I say needs to be super deep"", a bit too bohemian art types. So I couldn't relate, I would probably feel awkward with people like this IRL, not just in the beginning but next morning too.Not all intelligent conversations involve culture, poems or stuff like that. Some couple could both be into math or engineering, and talk passionately about that. Or rock music, sports, whatever. I couldn't relate to them that well.Doesn't make the movie bad, Ethan Hawke's character becomes a writer in the sequel, so it makes sense to be like that.

This seems to lack that and all the core basics a movie must have such as a beginning a middle and an end.Performances are great, the movie is visually appealing but that's as far as it personally goes for me.It's like 90 minutes of having a camera in the Big Brother house and just listening to them waffle on. Only difference is that here the subjects are capable of using words with more than 2 syllable's and aren't desperate Z list celebrity wannabes.Boring, lifeless and I simply don't see the appeal.

The dialogue and the acting are both so naturalistic that we feel as if we're listening in to a real-life conversation and my favourite scene is when each character in turn pretends to be calling a friend and talks about the person they've just encountered.

Simplistic and by design timeless romantic drama,"Simplistic and by design timeless romantic drama about an American man and a French woman, both in their early 20s, who meet by chance on a train from Budapest to Paris and decide to get off in Vienna to spend one evening and night getting to know each other. Director Richard Linklater may not have a naïve outlook on love and life, but his film is definitely a proponent for purity as his two protagonists wander around Vienna talking about life in general - often with a hint of existentialism - and now and then bump into various odd characters around the town. The film's simplistic form is both its strength and restriction, since it makes so much rely on the quality of the dialogue and acting. And Hawke and Delpy manage to get an earnestness across, complete with real-life insecurities and clumsiness, that elevates Before Sunrise above the run-of-the-mill romantic drama. Still, Linklater's writing has its moments of tackiness, and the film, for all its proposed ingenuity and truthfulness, feels a little too much like Brief Encounter's no. 1 fan to be a really authentic representative for Generation X.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Impossibly romantic,"Echoing what many others say here, this movie remains an all-time romantic classic. It far surpasses the follow-ups in the Linklater 'trilogy' which I found pretty underwhelming. I guess both actors are younger here (significantly), and while both are annoying in their own way, there's a real spontaneity and authenticity about their flirtation. Hawke is basically dodgy and untrustworthy; Delpy is vain and flighty, yet their conversations are a delight, possibly because they remind us all of our student days when we'd talk late into the evening about life, the universe and everything. And thus the reason so many return to this film every ten years or so is because it makes us feel young again; it probably even brings a tear to our rheumy eyes...",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Masterpiece.,"You may think this movie is just another boy and girl cliché but if you think so, you are sorely mistaken. Before Sunrise is one of those movies who you want to be one of the characters. From the beginning, you can already feel a chemistry between the characters and it only increases more and more throughout the film. You can feel the romance developing as they talk to each other in those well-written dialogues. Jesse and Celine aint just another romance movie couple, they are one of the best.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Brilliant, ethereal watch","The reason why most guys like me don't enjoy romance films is because oftentimes they degrade into melodramatic, soppy, cringey outbursts of emotion. Before sunrise is the opposite of this. It is founded on a simple plot and premise, of two people who have connected emotionally on a train exploring the city of Vienna. Much of the dialogue involves them walking and talking about everything under the sun(or stars), and it is absolutely enthralling and captivating. The locales in this film are superb, with Vienna and its unique characters offering more than just a pretty backdrop, and actually revealing character traits of Jesse and Celine.(Jesse is cynical, Celine an idealist). Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy also offer superlative performances here, their acting and dialogue delivering a realism that is sorely lacking in most films today.(case in point, the kiss on the Prater Ferris wheel, or them stealing glances at each other at the Vinyl record store) Before Sunrise is not a film that will make you cry, but it is the sort of film that will be stuck in your head weeks after you have seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Extraordinary Day in the Lives of Two Ordinary Strangers.,"Before Sunrise is a single day adventure in the lives of two strangers who meet on a train in Europe, begin a discussion, instantly connect with one another & slowly end up falling in love, all the while knowing that they have just this one evening to spend together & will be heading to their different directions the next day. From start to finish, there is no definite story or plot present in the film but only conversations about random things or each other and in the end, this chitchat between them turned out to be the only thing that mattered most because it told us everything there is to know about the characters, their views on life & love and even goes on to justify the existence of this story in the first place.Exquisitely directed by Richard Linklater, who came up with this story by taking a leaf out of his own life & refined the screenplay to a great length to give it a completely natural & instinctive appearance. The lush cinematography beautifully captures the dazzling locations of Vienna, the editing is brilliantly carried out and the performances by Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy as Jesse & Céline respectively is the core ingredient which provides this absolutely devouring dish its very own heart & soul. On an overall scale, Before Sunrise is one of the most intriguing, original & heartwarming romantic dramas I've had the pleasure to watch. Each frame here is as magical as love itself, and that's coming from a guy who isn't even very fond of this genre in the first place. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Romance
Troubled simplicity,"I was apprehensive going into this movie. I think the free flowing nature of this film is perfect. It's the uncertain beginning stages of meeting somebody and having a great connection with them, it's all the small intricacies that some films leave out... the awkward silences, not trying to overstep each others thoughts, the random conversations about anything and everything, the gradual process of getting to know somebody and all that comes with it. And I think this film hits that on the head perfectly. The reason for my review title is because love is never as ""simple"" as what it seems and perhaps should be at face value, it's usually more complicated and in this case it comes in the form of both Jesse and Celine living worlds apart but making the absolute most out of the time they have because they are both aware of the limited time they might share. Honestly, you should watch this movie, it's incredible.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A very simple but very human film, with very good feelings and dialogue.","Contrary to what I like to do, I saw this film after seeing its sequel, ""Before Sundown"". It's a very nice story about an American tourist who is enchanted by a French student he meets on the train on the way to Vienna, and invites her to spend some time with him. The rest of the film is an intense dialogue between the two through the streets of the city, as emotions and feelings develop.The best thing this film has to offer is the surprising and intensely credible interpretation of the main actors. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are both young, elegant and seem to make a nice couple (of course, the characters, not the actors). I don't know if I'm the only person to think this way, but it seems like the actors felt what the characters were feeling, to the extent that there was sympathy or mutual understanding between the two professionals, and a chemistry that permeated entirely to us. .Directed and written with great skill by Richard Linklater, the film can summarize the first meetings of many young couples out there, and I have no doubt that there are many people who will easily identify with the two characters. Who has never chatted with someone cute on a train or bus? There are friendships that start like this, and I myself have a similar case in my life: I have a friend that I value very much, who is blind and who I met by chance on the train, helping her to sit down on more than one occasion (we were both regular travelers due to work). It's a very human film, full of feelings, and full of good dialogues.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing - Ethan was good,"'Before Sunrise' is not a film to be scrutinised, nor studied. The absolute beauty of it lies in its perfection as a simple love story - of two lives suddenly thrown together in the midst of reality, and the ensuing night of simple love that follows. Every individual at some time in life dreams of the connection that is portrayed in this film between Jesse and Celine, and few ever find it. 'Before Sunrise' simply and elegantly demonstrates how the most fundamental passions of human emotion can envelope two complete strangers. The beauty of this film is that the story is the most important element. The ending is both provocative and emotional - scenes of the night previously seen in darkness are now portrayed in lonely daylight as the sun rises and the story closes on these two characters.I saw this film by accident one night late on television. I have never forgotten it. So well is it made that the audience never question if this could ever really happen in life, reality being so absolutely characterised in it.'Before Sunrise' is simply the story of two strangers bound in Vienna's lonely night splendour - one night of love in all its glory, one superb piece of film making.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Bring a pillow. You'll need it.,"I'm sure this movie looks good on the resumes of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. It's well acted. Basically a 2 person talkfest for 101 minutes. I'm sure the director and actors are very proud of it. Students of acting will appreciate it.But as entertainment for a wider audience, it has little value. It doesn't take long for the viewer to realize these never ending conversations for the sake of making a movie about conversations are all you're going to get. So if at any point you decide to tune out, you won't miss anything. And if you try to make it through to the end, you may have to fight sleep.It doesn't help that, at least in my opinion, Hawke, despite being a fine actor, lacks charm or charisma. He's always very believable in his roles but doesn't make you want to keep watching. It's as though he's always giving a good performance about a not very interesting character. I wouldn't be surprised if the most common response to his name is a shrug and ""He's okay.""I can't give this film higher than a ""2"" because I think it has value to acting students but little or no entertainment value to the general public.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

One night as one life,"Ah, man, here goes another deeply personal movie. I can't say I had specifically met a woman on a train with whom I spent a night walking the streets of an unfimilar city, but the feeling of the inevitable and imminent closure to the chapter I happened to share with this human being is so dear to my heart. If you really think about it, you will understand that closure of that chapter when you say goodbye to someone, to someone who was making you feel special, is like a little death - a death of the exact person that someone was making you feel like, a death of the best version of yourself.The movie made me feel the way movies rarely do. I completely dissolved myself in the story, I ceased to exist, there was no me - I was the main characters which were more alive on the dead surface of my screen than the majority of people I know.It is mind-boggling that something created on the opposite side of the planet, one year before I had a chance to see the light of the world, would be able to resonate with me with that strength 27 years later.

Romance genre redefined,"This movie ruins romance genre forever for me. when i heard the plot of the film, Two strangers talk over a night, i was like ""Tell me more"".
It is more better if you don't know anything. The movie starts with Jessi and Celine, strangers on the same train, while he asks her out
to visit Vinena together and rest is what follows. They talk about love, live, death but in the most romantic and natural way, I know it
sounds contradictory.
Richard Linklater creates a mood of love, of yearning. Nothing seems reheresed but everything is. That is the best compliment a director can
get. Earlier to this film, I used to laugh at people who said things like they fell in love with a character, i mean this is more suspension of
disbilief than asked for. Both actors personify perfection of each gender.

very good  in retrospect,"I started to truly appreciate Before Sunrise after the third installment of this ""series"", Before Midnight, filmed two decades later. Without this dimension, knowing that there were two more movies with the same characters and in the same vein, Before Sunrise would have been just another art-house movie.We follow the protagonists that meet accidentally on the train. They seem to be the ideal Western combination, French female polyglot and American male with artistic tendencies. They spend a night together in Vienna and discover their own landmarks of the city.What sets apart this movie with from all other similar features is the dialog. The whole movie is more or less one lengthy conversation with all advantages and disadvantages such an approach might bring with itself. Yet, they touch all possible topics interesting to the people of their age, presumably early twenties. They range from abstract thought on life, arts and passage of time to reference of the civil war in the former Yugoslavia, raging couple of hundreds of kilometers away.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful Storyline,"Inspired by personal experiences, Linklater collaborated with Krizan, who previously appeared in his films Slacker (1991) and Dazed and Confused (1993), to develop the screenplay. Casting was extensive; it took nine months for Hawke and Delpy to be cast with principal photography taking place entirely in Vienna.The plot is considered minimalistic, consisting mostly of monologues and casual conversation with extended dialogue as the characters navigate Vienna. Their contrasting ideas and perspectives on life and love are detailed, with Jesse a romantic disguised as a cynic, and Céline seemingly a romantic. Before Sunrise also explores time, death, and self-discovery.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

There's a good amount of romance movies out there, but I find that most of them seem to lack the realness because they do not contain awkward moments. In the first half of Before Sunrise, we found the characters fumbling over how to act. In one particular scene, the couple was traveling by tram when Jesse tried to put Celine's hair behind her ear but she moved too fast and he imminently had to cancel his act. And also the fact that they meet a couple of amateur actors who invites them to a play. The story is so incredibly real and believable.Dialoge is also interesting and seem very believable.

The germination of a fantastic love story,"Having finally seen the beginning of what turned out to be an extraordinary trilogy after watching it in a peculiar order (Sunset, Midnight, Sunrise), I have to say that it's probably one of the most rewarding cinematic experiences of our lifetime. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy light up the screen as two 20-something strangers who have a chance encounter and from there form a connection which builds over a summer night in Vienna.I was aware of the film when it was in came out, but at the time it was simply not for someone my age or gender, so naturally it passed me by. But having seen all three films now, watching this film in retrospect gives me a greater sense of time and how youth can be so fleeting. It also makes for a nice capsule in depicting the young perspective of Generation X, an age group that seemingly came and went so quickly in terms of being the movers and shakers in society.Seeing this film 25 years after it came out made me very nostalgic about the era it takes place in. That being said, I'm sure this film would have stood firmly as a classic even if it had not been followed by long-term sequels. Recommended to viewers of all ages.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I don't want to see that sunrise,"We'll just make tonight great.Bye
Goodbye
Au revoir
Later.Conversational cinema holds a special part for me. If done right, I could go through more emotions just by listening to people talking than watching any other movie genres.This philosophical yet beautifully romantic movie left me with feelings and yearning. Ethan Hawks and Julie Delpy were a match in heaven. It's weird how drawn in I was, watching a couple walking about Vienna and talking about life, death, reincarnation, morality, feminism, and more. I could listen for twice the movie runtime, and maybe I wouldn't even be bored.That fake telephone scene. Oh my, it's one of those few times that I catch so much feelings. The more they talked, the more I wanted the soon-to-be sunrise to never come.On one hand, I think that it didn't really matter whether I understood what they were discussing about or not, because the chemistry and seemingly genuine interest between the two characters are the real point.However, on the other hand, I think it's important that I comprehend the idea from each conversation. I had this thought that the movie isn't really realistic, because who would ever talked that much philosophy on a honeymoon? But then maybe it's not meant to be realistic. By discussing so many aspects of life yet included them inside one small but significant night, the director wanted me to be able to appreciate the wholeness of life while not forgetting the little moment that also makes life special. And that's exactly what I felt.Also to the point that the movie felt unrealistic and absurdly peaceful. What if, these two characters just recently died. Now they are in some kind of purgatory before going to heaven. That's why they talked about life and death, reflecting on their lives. And also why they can only meet each other for one night before going to heaven. It may not make sense.Overall, it's one of the most beautiful piece of cinema that immersed me from the moment the conversation started. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Uncommon completeness of an Incomplete Romance lacks the Concrete Vision but still makes a Super Film out of it.,"Before Sunrise (1995) :
Brief Review -Uncommon completeness of an Incomplete Romance lacks the Concrete Vision but still makes a Super Film out of it. I read some comments where some people called this Film as 'Casablanca of 90s'. Are your joking? Just go to hell for this comment. Don't you dare try and comparing any just good for sake movie with Legendary Casablanca. Anyways, lets move to Before Sunrise. Yes, it's a Superb Film no doubts. But the fact cannot be denied that it had a chance and potential of becoming a Cult Classic if there was a concrete vision and assertive characterisation. It is a story of 2 strangers who meet on a train and after having a small interesting conversation they decide to spend a night hanging out. They already knew that this is going to last till sunrise but throughout the journey none of them ever stays clear and strict on it. Thier thinking and original plan fluctuates unnecessarily because after having some out of brain ideas they are in mood of typical Romance. Well, it sucks when you begin it atypically and then turns back to typical stuff. Thier conversation and thoughts are very much interesting and innovative but sometimes very immature. The biggest problem with the film is it lacks a concrete theory from the beginning but then it goes even lower because it lacks unpredictability. Dialogues are sensible and engaging, cinematography is fantastic. Some shots are long and have been shot on real locations such as streets, hotels, train etc. Performances by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are fine. Richard Linklater's direction is very good and nothing much to bash for except some mistakes in the writing. Overall Before Sunrise makes a Super Uncommon Trip which is little common unfortunately but still a Fantastic Watch. A good change from 90s cliche Romance of Hollywood.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Minimalistic Masterpiece,I am amazed by this movie. That is surprising considering the fact that there is not much that occurs in this movie apart from talking. Before Sunrise is a romantic movie in which two people meet in a train and decide to spend a day together despite the fact that they just met and are unlikely to see each other ever again. The performances from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is real and not exaggerated like we see in a lot of movies. The entire film seems like it is taken from our lives and we can totally relate to the characters and the circumstances that they are in. The movie is filled with wonderful ideas about life and the meaning of it. Richard Linklater must be praised for making a movie like this and I would love to see movies that are similar. A good screenplay is the cornerstone of any great movie and Before Sunrise is no exception. An interesting aspect of this movie is that the entire film takes place in a 24-hour time span. This movie must be seen if you like sensible movies and a realistic story.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simple love is the most difficult.,"This is an extremely touching love film, but it is also an extremely simple love story: a pair of men and women met on the train and had a good impression, spending a night in Vienna together, that's all. There are no ups and downs and no memorable events that sublime the two people's simple feelings; just normal dating, eating, chatting and drinking. This is basically a love story with no plot.But in the middle of this simple plot, two of the most important themes of love are actually explored: the loss of love and the gain of love. The beauty and immortality of this story is first of all in the shortness of this love. But beautiful love must often be short-lived. As the two protagonists in the story said: we are often bored with ourselves, because we cannot escape from ourselves, we must endure ourselves all the time. If two people in love do n't know how to let love flow at the right time, then love will eventually die by itself, because if we ca n't even bear ourselves, how can we endure the other person all the time? What?The death of love (the death of love) and the loss of love (the loss of love) are two different things. When the flame of love is not extinguished, the initiative to lose love is actually to perpetuate love in a certain sense. Just like the 13-year-old girl in the unnamed cemetery: Ten years later, the 13-year-old heroine grew up 10 years old, but the little girl who lost her life is still only 13 years old. The lost life, on the contrary, made her thirteen-year-old become eternal; those who did not lose their life, let youth die slowly. The active distinction on the platform has made this love a classic eternity; before love has died naturally, actively squeezing the burning fire is actually lighting a candle that never extinguishes in the heart.Another reason why this love can be so touching and so beautiful is the perfect and natural beginning of this love. The two naturally talk, naturally feel good, naturally hold hands, naturally kiss, neither resist nor force, like is like, frank is. When you fall in love with those lovely lips, the lips are already on your tongue, because they know your desire for them, and they also desire your caress.Such a simple love start is actually the most difficult to get in real life-not because this love is too complicated to get, but just because it is too simple to get. Love in life often has too many strategic calculations, as the French actress in the movie said: too much thought, too much self-protection. How many boys dare to invite a girl who meets on the train to spend the night with him in an unfamiliar city, and how many girls will confess their love so actively? A kiss is just the beginning of a love, but we are afraid to fail only after we have discovered everything. You do n't know that too many things can never be discovered before love begins.The simplest love is the most rare, but the simplest love is also the most touching. Do n't let love turn into soap operas in Hong Kong and Taiwan; hold hands and hug love on the grass, and say goodbye to the active kiss on the train station platform",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Talk, talk, more talk, and then some talking","I bought this movie as a double feature with its sequel, ""Before Sunset"", because my sister told me that I'd like them.Not knowing what to expect, I put the disc in... and waited... and waited... and waited, as the actors did a lot of talking.The central characters met by chance on a train, and spent a night together in Vienna before each had to move on to separate destinations. From my perspective, it felt like a thousand and one nights.The character of Celine was what you'd expect a stereotypical young Parisienne to be - stars in her eyes, dreamily romantic, believing in things mystical, while he was the cynical American who shot down everything she found special. So what did she see in him, I ask? They talked about how they 'connected', but they didn't appear, to me, to be connected at all. I didn't see two characters into whom I could become immersed, or believe their developing passion. All I saw were two actors.As a general rule, I wouldn't go out of my way to watch romance movies. That is not to say that I am not capable of being moved by one that is well-cast and well-made. There are many that have stirred my emotions, some even to the point of tears (""An Affair to Remember"", for example, which this kind of takes a page from). But not this one. The Kleenex was left undisturbed in its little box, this time.Maybe the other users who've given this movie its high rating are hopeless romantics who'd cry over a sentimental TV commercial. I don't know. I don't mean to demean them in any way, but maybe some people have a lower 'romance' threshold than others...I simply could not get involved with the characters. They didn't do anything for me but leave me cold.The reason I gave this a 4 out of 10 instead of a 3, is for the Viennese scenery.Watch this if there's nothing else on, and if you're doing something else at the same time so that you're not too bored.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
opposites attract,"Jesse and Ceiline are brought together on a train when an old married couple have a very public fight in that way that only old married couples can manage. Two things become clear very quickly to the young couple - they have chemistry, and the time they can spend together is extremely limited. They set about making the most of mystical. magical, slightly unreal experience. They meander through Vienna, occasionally encountering some minor colourful characters, who despite being finely drawn, are always just a sideshow to the intense, fragile, painfully exposed musings of the young couple.Hawke and Delpy do a superb job of making an implausible situation seem all too natural and engrossing. Their dialogue could all too easily be self-absorbed and twee (My Blueberry Nights?), but here it is apt and at times incisive. ""I fee like I am taking notes, waiting for my real life to begin,"" says Jese. Much of the success of the film is down to how the observations of the two characters resonate so closely with our own existential concerns.I made the mistake of watching Before Sunset before watching this. I wish I had encountered them chronologically. Both films are recommended, but only for those who like a slower pace, wry observation, and sheer, unadulterated romance.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Thought-Provoking!,"Before Sunrise, the first film in the trilogy by Richard Linklater, is a very powerful, thought-provoking film that I never thought would be good. This film has no action and is merely conversation, so how can this movie be so good? Well, this movie is about as close to reality as you can get. What happens in this movie could happen to anybody out there. Secondly, the script is tight and well-written. I really loved all these meaningful, philosophical conversations. I'm usually bored at mostly talk films, but the way I was grabbed into these conversations really means the movie worked.Linklater's film is about a French girl on her way back to school and an American guy heading to Vienna to take a flight home and how they started a connection with each other when they met on the train.The acting is about as good as you can get. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have great chemistry and the way they delivered the dialog is just special. There is no need for supporting characters because the focus is on these two characters and their meanings of life.Overall, this is a very special, powerful film. I honestly didn't want to see this movie since I thought it would be a stupid romantic comedy, but it is really not. It's a drama that's thoughtful, funny, poignant, and just very sweet. I honestly don't get this ""R"" rating because the dialog would be very meaningful for teens. For those who love cinema, this is a great movie to watch. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

And they eventually get romantic during the process while walking through the streets of Vienna. Co-written and directed by Ricahrd Linklater, that is almost improvising, and while the Julie Delpy character seemed real, the Ethan Hawke character doesn't seem real enough, who some times tends to direct conversation away from himself, and that at times is not interesting at all.

Beautiful & Poetic....,"7.5/10I've had this film on my watchlist for quite some time and wasn't too sure when, or if, I'd ever get around to it, but I'm glad I finally did. Although it didn't reach the level of expectations I had set out. It was still a beautifully poetic film.The chemistry isn't in your face between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, but they definitely make it work. Their awkwardness bounces of each other perfectly, as they don't know each other of the bat, and it's not a snap of the fingers that their relationship reaches its pinnacle point. No, they have to reach it through the natural progression of the story that way it becomes ""true love"", and for me that was beautiful.If I was in a relationship. I could see this film being a date night movie maybe eight months or more into that relationship. The reason being is that the film takes place in one night, but a lot happens. So much so that it recalls the experience in such a way that you may sit there thinking with your significant other about how you became to be in a relationship, or the fun times you've had throughout it. So though this film sort of feels like a documentary of two peoples lives through one night. It still very personable.The last thing that impressed me about the film is that it is supposed to take place in Vienna. And that's exactly where it's filmed. So it gives a real environment to work with giving more life to the story.Overall, I truly enjoyed the film. I definitely think it's worth checking out more so if you're a couple. It's a beautiful representation of love that doesn't feel watered down, forced, or cheesy.Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helps you understand the film, and make a future decision on it.

I am one to regularly give films harsh reviews (even supposedly good ones).This was simply captivating cinema and I'm strangely annoyed that I hadn't seen it sooner.It's not about the story. It's about the people in it. The acting is brilliantly natural and I couldn't help by look back at my times of my early 20s, where your eyes are opening to the realities of life and the world, holding onto optimism, coming to grips with the concept of love, dealing with disappointment and resentment, social awkwardness; and contemplating ones own mortality.These things form the basis of many conversations throughout the film as two travelers almost ""suspend reality"" while they fall in love over night, then grapple with it all ending at sunrise. There is this magnificent line when Ethan Hawke said ""we're back in real time"" which evokes strong memories of magical European nights that you never wanted to end and time feels like it stops.It moved me deeply, but not in a depressing way. It simply stirred a lot of reflection on the past and the way we all were once upon a time. For those who have traveled to Europe and had many random nights, this provides so many snapshots that you will be able to related to.Best of all, it didn't fall into mushiness and become a sloppy Hollywood love film with a happy ending. It was a deep, but totally realistic, well made film, with great scenic contrast and mesmerizing direction. I can't recommend this enough and look forward to the sequels.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unique but still fantastical,"I thought this film was pretty unique - it has zero budget and is just walking around and talking. Yet still quite captivating as there is a growing emotional connection. It didn't seem genuine to me though. James was way too forward and I kept thinking ""how can he really get away with saying that?"" so the interactions sometimes appeared absurd and ironically it seemed like a ""male fantasy"".",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I barely survived.,"This is singularly the worst movie I have ever seen. With a complete lack in plot, the only redeeming facet is a shining moment of honesty on the train in which they blatantly tell you that this will be a horrible film. I managed to survive the full length on only the dire hope that SOMETHING would eventually happen. I was disappointed. If you are considering renting, I suggest you go for ice cream instead.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't miss it and allow yourself to be a version of Jesse or Celine for 90plus minutes,"My best friend had his student apartment in Spittelberg - in Viennas 7th district - in 1993, when he called me once, and told me, that they are shooting a film right in front of his door. We both couldn't care less. About a year later we went to the movies on a Wednesday, where surprise sneak previews were screened, not knowing what to expect of this particular movie night.The screening was Before sunrise. I movie that I loved right away and that still captivates me, every couple of years I see it.It's simple, it's full of cliches (I've never seen a palm reader nor a street poet in Vienna ever!), it's some random talks between 2 young adults who want to impress their counterparts with their (pseudo)intellectuality, and still it portrays life the way it often is. We all had those evenings and nights, were we felt super clever, were we fell for someone or just for the thought of it. And that's what Before Sunrise is. It's tale about us. It's a blueprint of 20somethings in the 90s. It's about falling in love or truely believing it's love. It's about the morning after, were the night before becomes a faded memory.Richard Linklater, the fantastic Ethan Hawke and July Delpy made it possible to create a movie, that mirrors our lifes, that allows us to see us through someone elses eyes. Films rarely do that and that's what makes Before sunrise a little treasure of filmmaking. Ethan Hawke once said in an interview about his movie ""First Reformed"" that a good movie starts after you have watched it (or something like that...). That's true with Before sunrise, because when the end credits have rolled, it makes you feel something. Almost 30 years ago it was the pain of lost love and the sadness of a great night passed for me. And it still does after watching it at the age of 50.Thanks for the movie and their great sequels.Btw, my friends entrance door was in the small alley, were Jesse and Celine sat down on some pallets, if anyone wonders.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful movie,I enjoyed this movie watching it for the first time in 2021 it still felt relatable. The cinematography was wonderful. For a story being about two people walking around Vienna it never got boring I felt the dialogue and acting in sequence with the events and places they were going to kept you in the movie it is quite wonderful.

The perfect romance,"This movie immediately felt special from the very first minutes. Everything about it felt romantic- the meeting on the train, the beautiful European cityscape, the casual, almost disheveled look of the characters- everything felt genuine and natural. I loved how the love blossomed between the characters and how apparent their chemistry was, I loved seeing them make a deep connection and get to know each other before even sharing a kiss. I found myself waiting for them to kiss, wishing for it, because their love felt so pure and palpable. And the ending was absolutely heart wrenching, and the not knowing what happened next (until I watched Before Sunset), even more so. This movie immediately became a favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The most beautiful romance I've seen,"I pulled out this DVD the other day from our library with mixed feelings mainly cos it was a 1995 movie. Guess what? It became the most frank, blunt, yet the most romantic movie I've ever come across. The romantic spark brewing between Jesse and Celine is so natural, you might feel that it is you who are in it! It is so brutally honest!! I loved every bit of it, from the start to the very end, frozen to my couch. It is so intense and engaging. Linklater takes us continuously through a 105 minute journey with those two awesome characters without a flicker of boredom or monotony. He uses very trivial dialogues that are quite common to intelligent conversations of post-modernist societies, but installs a sweet romanticism within each scene. I am really at a loss to understand as to why he was not given the best Director award in that year. The movie commands an absolute smooth rhythm, flows effortless and renders serenity at its best. One of the best movie gems created in our time!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great film,"Great film. There are tons of beautiful, memorable scenes which I would love to mention. The morning scene after the protagonists made out, the calm tone the director used, I don't no what magic he used, I could feel the exact morning freshness. The scene when they listened to Kath bloom's 'come here' inside a listening booth, that scene was one of my all time favorite movie scenes. Apart from that, there was train conversation, bus conversation, some random people's appearance and some other memorable scenes which will stay in my heart forever. I refer this film as a pure cinematic beauty. Great to see this movie finally made it to the top 250 list of IMDb.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Real as it can be,"Before Sunrise is an experience unlike most movies I've seen. At first, I wasn't sure how to feel about its slower pacing-it took me a moment to adjust. But as the story unfolded, I realized this wasn't just a movie; it was a deeply naturalistic masterpiece. The pacing, the conversations, the silences, it all felt so authentic.The dialogue is where this film truly shines. Jesse and Céline's interactions are brimming with awkward tension and raw, unpolished charm, like two real strangers trying to navigate an immediate attraction. The pauses, the overlapping chatter, the awkward jokes they're so beautifully real and human. It's rare to see a movie capture the spontaneity and imperfections of real conversations this well. At times, I forgot I was watching fiction cause it felt like peering into the lives of two actual people sharing a fleeting moment in time.Cinematically, it might not have extravagant visuals, but that simplicity works perfectly here. The lack of distraction allows the focus to remain on Jesse and Céline's dynamic, making their evolving connection feel even more profound. The depth of their discussions about life, love, dreams, and the passage of time is captivating and thought-provoking. It's incredible how the film uses just two characters and a simple story to explore such relatable themes.I loved it, and I'm excited to see the sequel. There's always a bit of hesitation... how do you follow something so perfectly understated without disrupting its magic? But I'm hopeful.Before Sunrise is a film that proves you don't need elaborate plots or flashy cinematography to create something truly meaningful.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
a nostalgic and beautiful love movie,"The movie gave me a lot of pleasure. The characters and their relationships with each other, I think, were very pleasant. Ethan Hawke is an actor I really like, and I think his acting in this movie was also beautiful. The same goes for Julie Delpy, of course. My favorite part of the movie is that it doesn't process the toxic and contrived loves in today's movies. Personally, I didn't characterize that kind of thing as love. It made me really happy to watch Jesse and Celine getting to know each other and being attracted to each other as the hours went by. And I think that's how true love should be, too. If you like romantic movies, you will probably like to watch this movie. I suggest .",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Beauty of Conversation,"This film is breathtaking. In the midst of all the remakes and shallow money-grabs, Before Sunrise is the perfect movie to watch and just marvel at how simple yet wonderful it is. Linklater's attentive direction combined with the heartfelt performances make this the type of film that you can't seem to look away from.Before Sunrise's screenplay delivers on every level -- it's authentic without being pretentious, and every bit of dialogue feels like it came from an honest place. The film is almost entirely conversation, yet it never lags or loses any of its spark because the script allows for Jesse and Céline to feel like real people. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as the two budding lovers at the film's center are absolutely brilliant. These two work so well together. Not only do they bring the writing to life, but they're also just so beautiful and charming to watch on screen that you can't help but fall in love along with them.Beyond the technical aspects, this movie is really special because it makes you rethink how you talk and converse with others. These two characters know that their time together is limited and that their future is not promised, thus all of their conversations are rooted with that in mind. Despite being total strangers in the beginning, Jesse and Céline enable themselves to be completely open and vulnerable throughout their one day together in Vienna because they know that they may never see each other again. As a viewer, you start to wonder how many meaningful conversations you could be having in your own life if you spoke to others like it was the last time you'd ever see them. For those of us who have built much stronger walls around what we consider deeply personal, Before Sunrise asks the question: what if you tore those walls down? Even more so, what if you invited someone you barely knew inside? Sure, it's intimidating and seemingly impossible to imagine, but that potential to form a genuine connection with another individual is irreplaceable, and Before Sunrise explores it beautifully.This movie is one of the most truthful portrayals of love that I've ever seen. It captures the boundless nature of all human relationships with such care and appreciation. Both sequels are excellent as well, but I have a soft spot for this one specifically. I can only fathom how amazing it would've been to see all three films in real time, each within the nine-year increments (I sadly was not alive when this film first released, and was far too young for the other two). But alas, I'm grateful to have finally seen them now. I'd recommend watching Before Sunrise if you haven't already -- it is well worth your time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Long Conversation,"This was nearly 101 minutes of a young man and woman, having a continuous conversation, through one day and night, after meeting as strangers on a train to Vienna, having both recently rebounded from a prior relationship.I do not remember ever having listened to a continuing conversation through an entire film. The conversation seemed to be an intellectualization of the emotive feeling of love. I surmise there was much wisdom to be discovered, most of which I missed as one might during a long lecture.There was awkwardness then gradually ensuing relaxation. There clearly was ongoing sexual tension. There came occasional annoyance, not turning to anger, as this was newness. Interesting, was the contrasting anger of an argument between an older married couple accompanying them on the train.Though both craved a permanent continuation of their relationship, they fought off the impulse, and held to a promise they would part in 24 hours, as they each had planned before they met. This was wise because most likely in 6-12 months the warm, addicting, experience of sudden love, would have sadly passed and reality brutally replaced it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful,"""Before Sunrise"" is a great example of a film that engages you with nothing but great writing and acting. There is no plot. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy meet on a European train and walk around Vienna. They talk. They go to old cathedrals. They talk some more. They go to cafes and bars and restaurants and talk and talk and talk. Boring, right? Nope, not at all.Richard Linklater's first film in the ""Before"" trilogy is as radical in its own way as Louis Malle's ""My Dinner With Andre"" in that it has no ""story"" and uses almost nonstop dialogue to entertain and enlighten. The characters in ""Before Sunrise"" are eloquent. They are articulate. They feel like real people. ""Before Sunrise"" is a film of beautiful moments, and it is a refreshing antidote to both the mindless Hollywood garbage and the cynical modern indie hipster trash that passes for art cinema these days.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Heartwarming Story!,"Before Sunrise is a film that captures the essence of love in its purest and simplest form. It tells the story of Jesse and Celine, two strangers who meet on a train and decide to spend one night together in Vienna, exploring the city and each other. The film is not about plot twists or dramatic conflicts, but about the conversations and connections that make us human. The film is realistic, natural, and charming, thanks to the brilliant performances of Hawke and Delpy, who improvise most of their dialogues and create a believable chemistry. The film is also beautifully shot, showcasing the scenic beauty of Vienna and its culture. The film is a rare gem that makes us feel the joy and pain of falling in love, and leaves us with a bittersweet ending that makes us wonder what will happen next.Before Sunrise is one of my favorite films, and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates romance, realism, and art. It is a film that will make you think, feel, and smile. It is a film that will stay with you long after it ends. It is a film that deserves a 10/10 rating.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Heady and Romantic, Hawke and Delpy's Twelve-Hour Fling is a Perfect Encapsulation of the Twenty-Something Ethos","A pair of young adults meet on a trans-European railway ride and impulsively agree to spend an evening in Venice, sightseeing their way through the town's coziest locales while getting to know each other. There's little to Before Sunrise's plot structure, just a lazy wander through a foreign metro with loose promises of a flight in the morning, but that's largely the point. These two had nowhere else to be, so they could afford to burn the evening on a whim. Their self-discovery as individuals, and as an unlikely would-be couple, is the real story. This day-long snapshot represents a moment of transition for the both of them, a chance to experience what it means to be a twenty-something in love with the proverbial open road before them. They're old enough to make pragmatic adult decisions, but still naïve enough to see the world through childish eyes. As Céline surmises in one penetrating confession, her overnight travel partner may bare his heart like an old poet, but he still kisses like an adolescent.Jesse and Céline's relaxed, directionless amble makes for refreshing, enchanting cinema; an example of going with the flow and taking life as it comes. The couple is clearly in deep with one another, or maybe with the allure of tasting an exotic fruit, and their mutual sense of inquisitive attraction is radiant. Although they operate on a fixed timer, there's no rush to the shared adventure. This night might just last forever.As far as romantic nostalgia goes, Before Sunrise is right on the mark. Costars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are a natural fit, starry-eyed enough to embrace the existential philosophies they plumb. To openly ponder life, love, self and spirituality, in an unfamiliar land, with someone they've only known for a few hours. The world is their oyster, and I'm envious, because I can remember being in a very similar head space at their age and was never able to consummate it in a moment half as perfect as this one. Nor, I'd imagine did a vast majority of other viewers. That's one beauty of cinema; risk-free idealization. And, as in life, we don't completely appreciate the magic of such moments until they've passed. This truth is made evident at the film's conclusion, when we quietly revisit the sites of many key scenes, now empty and bathed in morning light, and still feel the couple's presence. What a perfect sendoff.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

What could be more pure?I understand the appeal... and here it is: by the time the film rolls into Act III, all the women watching want to be Celine and all the men watching want to be Jesse. It's escapism in its most raw form. For 12-14 hours, I'll leave all my cares behind and get lovingly wrapped up in a beautiful stranger... with no agenda and little hope or concern for the future and what it may bring.

Dreadful dialog,"This film is 90% dialog. And the dialog is not at all convincing in the given situation. It is too contrived, too pseudo cleverly intellectual, it is irritating and not at all romantic. Whenever Linklater switches to body language (the looks between the couple in the music booth) and purely visual shots (the morning scenes without actors) one begins to feel the deeper emotions that would be present in the given situation. But these moments are way too few and they are drowned in the veritable deluge of ""adolescent"" conversation between the two main characters. Now I will go and see the next episode ""Before Sunset"", to see if the director himself has picked up on this grave shortcoming of ""Before Sunset"".

The impact and idea of time and the power of human connection explored in one beautiful package,"The kind of connection the two lead characters in Before Sunrise merit is the kind of connection I've only managed to achieve a few times in my life; it's the connection with someone who is a complete stranger, but as soon as you meet him, your wall of protection and tact almost completely crumbles. You feel compelled to share personal information with this stranger, deep thoughts that no one other than you have pondered or heard, and talk until your throat is raw about everything you can think of in that given moment. Your become verbally diuretic, and after it's over, you're upset that the conversation has ended, but you've achieved a state of personal tranquility thanks to a release of all that was on your mind that you are at a sort of bliss. It's a strange thing to articulate, and those who have had that kind of connection know precisely what I'm talking about. To those who can't pinpoint that kind of connection (if you have to think hard about it, you've probably never had one), you're in for one soon.Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, which kickstarted a trilogy that spanned the course of three separate decades and analyzed Linklater's favorite cinematic idea, time, is an ode to that kind of comfortable, life-affirming connection we all should experience. Linklater thankfully devotes an entire film to that kind of connection, making a film entirely focused on characters rather than the events, the location, or the supporting characters surrounding them. It's as if Linklater got fed up at watching interesting characters, their motivations and their potentials, in other films squandered so other, more trivial matters could be attended to. In Before Sunrise, he strips down everything to two central characters and their views on a variety of different issues, philosophical ideas, and past experiences.Those two characters are Jesse and Céline (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy), who, from the moment they meet on a train-car from Budapest heading to Vienna, they reveal personal details and personal opinions on love, romance, and just their general upbringings. When Jesse's stop at Vienna finally rolls around, he convinces Céline to hop off the train with him, to which she throws caution to the wind and obliges. The two divulge in a great deal of personal matters together; he is a romantic soul masquerading as a cynic after breaking up with his girlfriend, the whole reason he's in Vienna in the first place, and she has fallen before and is cautious about doing so again. The two, however, recognize their separate agendas and treat this night as their one and only encounter, leading them to get personal and loquacious with one-another while walking through the entire city.As stated, Linklater strips this film back a plethora of layers to simply being about these two characters. Linklater even limits pictorial distractions, as the two characters walking through the city of Vienna leaves for a great deal of possibility to stumble upon something distracting. That occurs, if I remember correctly, once in the film, and it's incorporated so well into the discussion and the flow that you're bound to miss it. It's no lie that Linklater has seriously found himself committed to making this project about this simple yet unbelievably affecting kind of connection, which, in this case, transcends personal bounds into becoming romantic, leading the characters to question how they feel and how they want to proceed.Hawke and Delpy, I feel, aren't doing much acting here; part of me feels they're conveying their own kind of presences to one another and that there's little effort required on their part to change who they are or become something they are not. The film also bears the necessary pacing element of being lax and carefree, never rushing these characters onto the next setup nor making them take detours for comedy's sake. This is Linklater driving the truck down a path that has many different routes and he chooses the most direct route, and simultaneously, the most beautiful and mystifying.Before Sunrise beautifully illustrates the power of human connection through two strong performers and a writer/director obsessed with the impact and idea of time and the realism and the aforementioned kind of connection. Here, he displays his affinity and talent for both through a film that is equal parts contemplative in a philosophical sense and also incredibly beautiful on a human scale. This is a romantic comedy for people who have grown sick and tired of falsified, picturesque romantic comedies and hunger for something genuine, real, and lasting, much like the impact of these characters' relationship with one another in the film.Starring: Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Directed by: Richard Linklater.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good,"The film is not as enthusiastic as the first, but its last half hour is enough for the purpose The film is a dialogue in a way that makes you excited to watch.

In a word: beautiful!,"There is something really great about Richard Linklater and his movies. Every film he does feels like a light being thrown on life and it's subtleties. He creates these heartwarming worlds using just the routine life.Before Sunrise is one of the most beautiful movies one can ever see, and yet it doesn't submits to any of the conventional beauty prerequisites. It's so good because it's so simple. The story follows an American boy and a French girl, traveling on the same train, who get engaged in a conversation and then decide to spend a night together walking around the beautiful city of Vienna. For a story that simple, the way the film builds up its romantic elements is truly blissful.It's also a wonderful character study and most of the times it uses dialogues to do so. Jesse and Celine converse their hearts out without ever being melodramatic or overly sentimental. Watching a completely natural looking talk unfold on the screen is endearing.The camera work, like the screenplay, is gentle. There's one scene in particular, when they both are listening to some record in a listening booth, looking at one another and trying not to be caught doing so, which shows the sexual attraction between the two in a calmest and the most delicate demeanor possible. The slight low angle and congestion of the space adds so much to the scene.This film truly captures romance in an entirely new perspective. It's like finding the romance in the tiny bits of the life bereft of the age old phony augmentations of the subtle emotion.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best realism Romance film,"The before trilogy is some of the best movie work surrounding romance, it doesn't hold back on different perspectives of love and doesn't spoon feed you nonsense that most romance movies hold today. The film is literally two people talking about love and other things in life and yet it's one of the most intellectual and entertaining pieces of media made. They have real conversations through the movie making them more connected to us and caring for the relationship the are building with one another. The writing must've been really strong as this film is so fantastic and real, aswell as great performances from the two protagonists. It's very relatable too which makes it even better, there is tons that you can relate to and they will discuss it in such a complex and intelligent way. The visuals in the film are also good showing off what the story is in subtle ways and showcasing the beautiful city of Vienna too. It talks about life a lot but the main thing is love and it shows and tells us what is love and what makes it real, it's different emotions surrounding love and most importantly is the complexity of what they talk about. It's difficult to express just how good the dialogue is as there is so much to dissect from it all but it's fantastic and a rare realism movie.

That's fine if you're a fan of big powerful speeches, and poetic language, but if you're waiting for a 'big moment' then you're going to be disappointed.I enjoyed this film, I thought it was without doubt a clever film, but I can't say it enticed me enough to make me watch it again, or to see the subsequent sequels.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Astonishingly Beautiful Love Story,"""Isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved a little more?""The movie was on my bucket list for a long time (the trilogy). At first I thought that it is one of those typical boy-meets-girl love stories but as it moves forward, it proved me wrong. At certain part you will realize that this isn't just a movie or a love story, rather a realization of life, of love, of how you see the world and the people from different aspects. It's like those never ending late night conversations that you always wanted to have with someone. Brilliant acting and direction, not to mention the precious dialogues. The chemistry between Ethan and Julie felt so real. A must watch for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delightful in every way.,"I seen this movie after experiencing my first real relationship ending, and man did it have a effect on me. The stages of developing intimacy between two strangers just felt so real while watching this film. It was not over exaggerated at all and never seemed phony in anyway, all I seemed to fell was that I was watching two young people enjoying each others company and in result forming some sort of a relationship. The chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is just breath taking, with the seemed to be improvised dialogue and the (seeming real at the time) sexual tension between the two characters just was honest in delivery. I can't see any faults in this movie and is, in my mind, the greatest romance film I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Before Sunrise,"A wonderful movie depicting Love, circumstances leading to love. What a miracle love is??? Love can only be related to Time. Love can happen at any destination be it a train, bus or road. Before Sunrise has some wonderful dialogues, two beautiful actors and a wonderful director Mr. Linklater. Before Sunrise also shows how much thinking of a Man and a Woman can differ with some wonderfully choreographed scenes. It inspires me to keep hoping and waiting for the right time. Lastly a picturesque location Vienna. A must watch for all Romantic movie lovers, Not only just this particular film but the whole Before series. Before Sunrise also depicts the mundane day to day life and how a single night with your most precious person is so much precious. I personally loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best romantic movie,"Even though I've mentioned it as the best romantic film, for me, it's simply the best film ever. It's also the only film I've ever rated 10/10. The magic of the Before series lies in the fact that the 9-year gaps between the films also happen in real life, which allows the audience to grow with it, take it in as part of their life, and be immersed in its flow. We witness three stages throughout the series. The first film has tones of romance and youth, where everything feels rosy, and we bask in the essence of life's joy, moving forward with a sense of carefree delight and excitement. In the second film, we face the harsh reality of life. Life's truths begin to intervene, showing that we aren't the only ones making plans. A sweet reunion brings out what has been left unsaid, but it's not enough. They are no longer young nor completely free. Yet, hope lingers, and romance ultimately triumphs. By the third film, concepts like romance, passion, and desire give way to love, effort, responsibility, sacrifice, and tolerance. Life has become tougher, but it is within these challenges that its beauty emerges. The final scene leaves us with a range of emotions and thoughts, as we too experience this brief display of life before it concludes. While a part of you may yearn for a fourth film, another part appreciates that its absence enhances the series' completeness and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. What needed to happen has happened.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
90's were better 🎬🍿,"I watched this today for the first time in years, I've always loved this film. It was one of my favourites as a movie obsessed kid at the video shop, sucker for a bit of whimsical-ness and romance. When they announced a second I was so excited, then the final one in the trilogy which is also a long time ago now. I just love the vibe of the film so great.Whenever I feel like I am missing the world and just everything before technology and the whole fake world of social media and over sharing took over, I refer to my feel good films growing up to take me back to those times! Which feels like I need to do a lot of lately. Best feeling.This totally hit the spot for me today, and of course you see things slightly differently again and again which is always the beauty of re-watching or re-reading your favs over the years.Hate to say it but it's before everyone seemingly turned crazy and the younger generations sadly will just never get that that's like, true authenticity. Living in the moment, not wasting their imaginations and potential stuck in dopamine phone and tech addictions. Filling their brains with just so much stimulation and stupid things. Just simply missing out on the real world. Before everyone looked like a freak show and the same as each other, with the beauty industry, they just don't realise they all look insane with their huge lips and their seeming perceived ideas of 'perfection' they are chasing and whatever.... Letting things happen without the need to share and ruining sacred special moments, real connections. Though in saying that, I do have faith in the younger generations to come with their open mindedness, they just need to watch their egos and put down their phones more often and not get carried away with too much rubbish and just be real. They all have a unique sense of humour which is a good thing.... I think why some of them are starting to gravitate and mimick now what they see in the 90's and other decades before and 90's coming back in to fashion is because they can feel the realness and they like it, because they are so used to the opposite and deep down they are realising how things are in the world now simply isn't okay, this review took a unexpected turn haha.90's were better 🎥🍿🎬Though I'm sure those from generations before me could say much the same, however 90's truely were the best. Woman had a say, things were just different, the last generation who came of age without all the smart phones and social media etcAnyhoo thats my random 2 cents worth of ramble!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Unfortunately, both know that this will probably be their only night together.Before Sunrise was the perfect movie for me to reconsider watching romance once again, this is how it should be made a perfect real romance a very refreshing one.It's about a first date, a fist night that can be the last and what can gather a man and a women on a single night besides having those beautiful spontaneous discussion about life, past and future .Sometimes talking about some philosophical matters and it's ridiculously funny and it does happen every time, talking about things the other one probably doesn't have to do with and it's still cool you're both having a great time .Before Sunrise is a great refreshing movie, Julie Delpy was beautiful and her chemistry with Ethan Hawke was beautiful too.I almost forgot to mention the writing that was absolutely well-made.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Before Sunrise is the romantic movie which we all wanted to see,"Before Sunrise is an romantic drama movie directed by Richard Linklater and stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.Two strangers from different parts of the world meets on a train journey and decides to spend a day together at Vienna. A great plot, great execution, perfect screenplay, natural and authentic acting and a great ending this is Before Sunrise all about is.There are many people whom we meets only once in a lifetime but how many of them we actually remembers. The movie portrays the relationship between two strangers who is now willing to spend some time together with great perfection and instead of showing them to going to a disco or some amusement park or doing party the director had put focus more on their informal talks about their likes and dislikes, their past, their family and friends which we all might do.Screenplay of the movie is great and gripping, the movie is a story of only a day so the movie might feel slow to some viewers but that's the real beauty and the movie is all about.Acting is supeb and both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy were very real and natural in their roles.

"Seen it before, once is enough!","Having seen this movie once before I was excited to watch it again. I remembered enjoying the dialogue, characters, and uniqueness of the plot. However, it is not good. It really isn't. This is a bad movie. It doesn't capture my attention, I'm bored, the dialogue though good, isn't enough. Perhaps this is the perfect movie for hopeless romantics who have nothing better to do than watch sappy movies. For a romantic comedy this movie leans far too much towards the romantic and far to little towards the comedy. The awkward interactions and revealing moments, the silences that say so much are all very real, but am I having a good time watching this? No. Will I come away from this with anything? No. The only reason I can understand someone watching this is because they have recently had their heart broken or are trying to get into a girls pants. As far as the former is concerned-this movie won't mend your broken heart. And for the latter-she decided before the movie started whether or not you were getting any, so don't waste your time or hers.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Before Sunrise, Perfect Romance!","Among all the romance movies I have seen, ""Before Sunrise"" remains the best. The plot is exotic in itself.

The story is about a young amateur American writer, Jesse, who meets a young French lady, Celine, on a train trip. The young couple decides to stop in Vienna to enjoy one exotic night. The beauty of the movie is not limited to the complexity of the plot; it extends to the performance and the chemistry that the two protagonists could perfectly achieve. The movie takes you through a wonderful journey in three dimensions: philosophy, culture, and geography. The choice of Vienna as a setting is so fortunate because it matches the atmosphere of the move: exotic romance. I highly recommend this movie for a journey in space and time!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interaction and connection under a magnifier,"I started off with the movie expecting not really that much, expected it to be another one of those romcoms that you can predict after 5 minutes of watching and you just end up texting through the whole thing just to see that in the end you were right. It wasn't. First I saw all the requirements for movie like this, and my thought were, okay here we go again. The longer I watched the more I started to love it. The way Linklater shows the interaction between the two is so spot-on. From the start all the details are just perfect. The way their interaction changes as they spend more time together is so subtle but again, spot-on. A great examination of human connection. So real it made me feel I was there, he really succeeds in transferred such intricate emotions. I have to be honest, the movie meets a lot of the requirements for romcom number 60239. But trust me, give it the benefit of the doubt and im sure the way these two are portrayed will draw you in and keep you fixated and interested till the end. (Was hoping for the same to happen in the next two movies in the series, but it didn't)

The chemistry between Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke is wonderful, and their relationship and conversations are so natural and spontaneous that they seem like improvisation. The film is so believable and life-like that I felt like a voyeur following two real lovers, spying from the sidelines.

Good film,"Good film. The movie portrays a day of two strangers' conversation. It started suddenly in a train and the conversation went on and on. The conversation turned to be the philosophies of two lives. The movie highlights the beautiful nature and night life of Vienna, Austria. There are tons of beautiful, memorable scenes which I would love to mention. The morning scene after the protagonists made out, the calm tone the director used, I don't no what magic he used, I could feel the exact morning freshness. The scene when they listened to Kath bloom's 'come here' inside a listening booth, that scene was one of my all time favorite movie scenes. Apart from that, there was train conversation, bus conversation, some random people's appearance and some other memorable scenes which will stay in my heart forever.

"Walk, talk and romance in Europe","Before Sunrise is a minimalist film which features Ethan Hawke and Julia Delpy as two young characters walking and talking.The film starts off in a train as a German couple argue and the two couple tentatively talk, enjoy each other's company and make an emotional connection.Both characters share their perspectives on life and love. The film takes place over the course of one day and night as they see shows, view buildings and gardens, drink in cafés and bars and become romantically entangled.They reveal maybe a little too much about themselves as believe they will never see one another again. Hawke has a plane to catch before sunrise as he returns to the USA while Delpy is going to Paris.The film has a charm with its Continental European setting but it's also easy to lose attention with all their talking.It does not quite fly for me although its a brave attempt by director and co-writer Richard Linklater to make an innovative, independent romantic film.However the film is intriguing because it has spawned two sequels so far.

before sunrise,"For the most part co writer and director Richard Linklater manages to avoid the twin traps of Rohmerish boredom and Lelouche like sappiness in this unabashedly romantic film about two young people falling in love in Europe, through conversation. How does he manage it? Well, by knowing when to shift the focus from Jesse and Celine talking which, let's face it, can be didactic, especially when Jesse indulges a tendency toward philosophizing, to the lovely city of Vienna and its oddball, boho inhabitants. Also, both Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke have the perfect mixture of star quality and acting skills that makes the viewer want both to gaze at them and be interested in them, as people. The result is a film that, while occasionally enervating, is funny, charming, touching and even, at times, poetic like when Delpy talks of the space between people where love and connections are either made or lost.

perfection in simplicity,"This movie isn't like a lot of other romantic comedies or dramas. It isn't overly cluttered with subplots and pointless turns. It is a pure and simple story of falling in love and creating a deep bond with a complete stranger. After watching most romance movies, single viewers are left feeling more lonely than before, but Before Sunrise offers something different. It gives the viewer almost the exact opposite, a hope that somewhere out there in the world, there is a person that can complete you and understand you, and maybe one day you will cross paths. Even though the plot line is not particularly action-packed, it is so emotionally engaging. The movie is so successful in portraying the feeling of falling in love, in longing, loneliness, and pain in having to say goodbye. The simple blooming relationship between strangers is a beautiful picture of love and the human desire to connect on a deeper level with others. Even if you aren't a huge romance fan, Before Sunrise is definitely worth the watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Realistic Film,"For me when I watch a film I want something that has depth, a message, a gripping climax, a great ending, colorful characters, and sweeping dialogue. This film had that, and something that a lot of films especially romance ones today don't have, charm. I really felt compelled into both of the characters because not only were they super charismatic but they were real. They had feelings, and they cracked jokes and made fun of one another. They bonded over stories, talking about their interests, what makes them get up in the morning and experience life. These are real conversations that I wish we had more of today. Nowadays the dating world is so tough and everyone is moving a mile a minute and one of the key themes in this film I think is to stop and smell the roses. Life is going on right in front of you. Another way it felt so realistic was the super long takes and some editing tricks to help it look like almost one continuous shot. It was almost as if we were facing the characters and experiencing their love begin to bud as we were walking backwards witnessing it. This film moved me and made me tear up.

I don't think I can make it this far.BEFORE SUNRISE is also discussing about love, whether it is love at first sight, being together forever or suddenly leaving at the most enchanted moment. The film also thinks that we can't keep love fresh in marriage, daily bread, salt, sauce, vinegar and tea will certainly wear love to a thousand holes, so the hero and heroine decided only at this time, right now, only to talk about love and not the future, only to leave a person in each other's heart in the future, leaving a period of the past.

Well, yes, you can. After half an hour I wanted to run out screaming. They may both be attractive young actors, but as time went on and I had to watch their faces FOREVER, without a break, without anything else breaking the focus, I couldn't stand seeing them any longer.

VERY UNIQUE ROMANTIC MOVIE,"To be honest, I've never heard of this film, that's why I'm so obsessed with the movie themed Streets through the city at night, until I came across because a movie called Before We Go, I really liked that movie.It turns out that there are many reviews that say that this film was inspired by the film entitled Before Sunrise, so I did a search on this kind of genre film and it turned out to be there.I feel very happy that I'm not the only one who likes this Walk-and-Talk genre film, it turns out that a lot of people like it too.Okay, moving on to the discussion of the film, many say that Before Sunrise has popularized this genre, I am even more excited to watch it, that's right, this film is very good at presenting this genre.The plot presented is fairly simple, there is no conflict where one of the characters looks more powerful and becomes the main star in this film.Celine and Jesee really look like two people who have just met, the shyness and hidden love can be seen on their faces.The conversations they have are also fairly good, they are able to provide background and problems that they are facing but make a real impression because they say it shyly.I admire the acting of Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply who are able to do a lot of long dialogues with one Take, Thanks to this moment this film really feels real.The camera angle does not change (especially on the Street Running Train), there is no music, the quiet sound of the surrounding environment is really able to make the audience as people who are watching a pair of lovers talking each other.I think this film is very beautiful, you will not find a film like this, Until Before We Go was release which was inspired by the film Before The Sunrise.Also the ending of this film is very beautiful, the ending gives clear information that this film will have a sequel. And even now this film has become a Trology.That's my little review of this film, I hope this can be an encouragement for you to watch this film (for those of you who haven't watched it but are looking for a review first.That's it from me, Bucek Alexsander.Cheers.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The dialogues are everything the movie is based on, and yet they are nothing more than ""pick-me"" quintessence. Additionally, calling them ""dialogues"" is an insult to what a proper dialogue actually is; the characters don't go as far as having an actual conversation, they simply say the most random things, almost as if they were not even listening to the other one. I sincerely suffered this movie and did not get anything positive (or even new) out of it.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Utterly charming,"""I believe if there's any kind of God it wouldn't be in any of us, not you or me but just this little space in between. If there's any kind of magic in this world it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something. I know, it's almost impossible to succeed but who cares really? The answer must be in the attempt.""Utterly charming. A brilliant script, touching on so many things about life and relationships, and acted so naturally by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy that it often seems like they're improvising.

A Poetic Journey of Connection and Conversation,"Before Sunrise is a beautifully understated exploration of love, connection, and the fleeting nature of time. Directed by Richard Linklater, this 1995 classic takes a simple premise-a chance meeting between two strangers-and transforms it into an unforgettable cinematic experience.The film follows Jesse (Ethan Hawke), an American, and Céline (Julie Delpy), a Frenchwoman, who meet on a train to Vienna. Deciding to spend one night together walking through the city before Jesse's flight the next morning, their time unfolds as a series of heartfelt and intellectual conversations about life, love, and their differing perspectives on the world. The chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is nothing short of electric, making their characters' connection feel deeply authentic and relatable.What sets Before Sunrise apart is its authenticity. The dialogue feels natural and unforced, capturing the spontaneity and vulnerability of two people getting to know each other. Linklater's direction allows the story to breathe, letting the characters' words and emotions take center stage. Every moment feels intimate, as if the audience is eavesdropping on something deeply personal and real.The setting of Vienna is another star of the film. The city's quiet streets, scenic parks, and atmospheric cafés provide a dreamlike backdrop for Jesse and Céline's budding romance. The cinematography is subtle yet stunning, capturing the beauty of their surroundings without overshadowing the story.At its core, Before Sunrise is about human connection. It's a film that resonates deeply, reminding viewers of the magic that can occur when two souls meet at the right moment in time. The movie doesn't rely on grand gestures or dramatic twists-instead, it finds its power in the small, meaningful exchanges that define relationships.Before Sunrise is a timeless masterpiece, celebrating the joy and melancholy of fleeting moments. It's a film that stays with you, not just for its story, but for how it makes you feel-hopeful, introspective, and profoundly moved.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best romantic movies ever ...,"There is not much that can be said about this movie that was not said before. Linklater has accomplished the impossible and has landed 2 of his movies (Dazed and Confused and Before Sunrise) in my Top 10 list of favorite movies.This movie is quite frankly one of the most overlooked gems of modern cinema. I am a guy, 32, and have seen this movie at least over a dozen times and has always left me with a teary eye. Julie Delpy is like and angel from heaven that has unsuspectedly landed in Ethan Hawke's life and ours. All the key scenes have been mentioned before, the record shop listening booth (this one had to be improvised, as I don't think this is possible to be pulled of by the most talented of actors), the imaginary phone calls, the kiss on top of the Prater, the talk about having/not having sex. The sadness of the empty spaces without them at the end ...Maybe it has more meaning for me than for others as my ex-girlfriend looked like Delpy somewhat and out last encounter was in an airport under similar circumstances and promises as the ending of the movie, but this is a definite recommendation for anyone that thrives on that great feeling when you have with someone that just invades your soul and you want to spend every waking moment with them. Kudos for Linklater for being able to capture this so faithfully and unpretentiously. A once in a lifetime achievement! One of the best films ever!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I fell in love with this film,"This is one of the most romantic movies I've ever watched. It's so real to me, the way the two characters, meet, talk, and fell in love with each other. It's very simply and sincere. It's like watching some special moments in time in the life of two people, who may or may not going to meet each other again. Some people say that a movie shouldn't base on dialog, but I think this one is an exception. The realistic dialog and acting really grips my attention and pull me in. I felt like I was watching two people falling in love.I know that people can view this differently. Some may say that it's impossible that such a thing can happen and two people are talking this way. But what I want to say is, this thing can happen and two people can talk this way.The film even reminds of some experience that I had in my real life.For me, the timing of this film is just perfect. The music used is just right and fit in with the mood of the film. The cinematography captures the romantic atmosphere of Vienna. I've got my favorite scenes and I can watch this movie over and over again. It will surely stay in my heart.Thanks to the director for creating such a unique and magnificent piece of work. Never watch anything like it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Engaging, charming, delightful, and real.","Linklater's film reminds me of a professional sports performance: he makes it look so easy! The sense of ease and delight, the languid pace and rich dialogue are not for everyone. These are largely intellectual charms we are offered as we sit at one remove, voyeurs after all, and watch romantic love spark and catch fire.This is a love story that sets us free to witness a very real world, slightly overwrought, charmingly self-conscious, and entirely engaging. It feels like a real-time record of a first meeting and the non-stop conversation that ensues, the kind every thinking person has enjoyed at some point and remembers with sweet nostalgia.The sex is all in the words, deeply embedded and all the more passionate for the energetic connection between the two main characters. Idealism, youth, and naiveté engage levels of honesty and courage rarely seen on film, expertly rendered by two actors willing to bring more of themselves into the frame.Relax and enjoy - this film will invoke your best memories of youthful idealism and the deep joy of sharing ideas, however briefly, with another person.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

How did I miss this movie the first time?,"I can't believe none of my friends told me about this wonderful movie back in 1995. OK, I'm not usually into romance/love stories (aside from Casablanca, Brief Encounter, and Now Voyager -- all right, maybe I *am* into them), but this one is different. You don't feel like you're watching a movie, the dialog rings so true. And the scene where they make their pretend phone calls -- top 10 movie scenes of all time. Next time you watch this movie, watch them watching each other. Their relationship grows so subtly that you don't realize how into each other they are becoming. What is it about trains and lovers and Europe? Linklater found the perfect story and location and actors. What more do you want? Please, give this one a chance.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
We are all stardust,"Everyone I've asked has maintained the sequel to Before Sunrise is superior. I disagree. Perhaps they related to Jesse and Celine later in their lives, or maybe they just prefer Paris to Vienna. In baseball, however, when the ball and the runner reach the base at the same time, the tie goes to the runner. In the case of originals and sequels, ceteras para bus, the tie should go to the original: without it, there would be no sequel. The characters, the tone and the structure were developed in Sunrise first. I suppose this is the place where I would review the film, but it seems unfair to divulge any of the lovely secrets embedded in almost each scene, lest the reader hasn't seen the film. You really ought to discover these things on your own. But for what they are  well-plotted, exceptionally well-written conversations perfectly synthesized by the actors and shot in a glorious cinematic style  these films are perfect. Frost once wrote that great art came from freedom within the reins. Linklater adheres to this, allowing his premise to guide him. THe result is his films never try to be too much, yet they build tension like no Michael Bay film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A well-done film,"This is an extremely well-done film about an experience everyone has -- or should have -- had in their lives. If you don't find a bit of yourself in either of these two people, you have a cold heart. The dialogue is intelligently written but it's the acting and the delivery of such realistic repartee between two people that makes this movie exceptional. Nothing is forced or stilted, everything true and situationally apropos, from the way they nervously play with the S&P shakers on the train to their discussion about whether or not to have sex. Many touching and poignant moments -- but never overly sentimental or trite.A bit slow in places, but that's its only downside and possibly serves to make it even more realistic, as life does have its slow moments. But if you like character studies about the self-conscious and intricate dances we perform with new relationships, like ""Lost in Translation"" or ""Sideways,"" you will find this movie extremely rewarding. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm on my way over to Netflix to order ""Before Sunset."" And if you have never had the bittersweet and life-altering experience of a fleeting romance with a total stranger, get yourself to Vienna. Pronto.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"yadda, yadda, yadda . . .","Before Sunrise is an exceptionally boring movie. It stars Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke as a couple people who meet on a train, spend the night wandering through Vienna, and then go their separate ways at sunrise. I have to admit that there are moments that feel very genuine, and it seems more realistic and heartfelt than most romance movies. The problem is that you have to hear these two people talk, and talk, and talk for an hour and forty-five minutes and neither of them has anything interesting to say. You get to hear Hawke's ideas about reincarnation and Delpy's story about going into therapy after breaking up from a boyfriend she didn't like that much anyway, and yadda, yadda, yadda, blah, blah, blah . . .

"Ordinary people, extraordinary emotions","I saw ""Before sunrise"" first time about five years ago in Finnish television. I watched it because it got really good review in a local newspaper. Thanks to reviewer for emphasizing the greatness of this movie - otherwise I may have never seen it.""Before sunrise"" really stamped its mark into my mind. As I said it has been something like five years now since I first saw it. During the years I forgot most of the films plot but still remembered how strongly it had touched me at one time.About a week ago I found a copy of ""Before sunrise"" in a shelf in library and lent it. I had tried to find it from video stores few times but hadn't succeed. I watched it three times during the weekend and I have to point out that this film is even greater than I remembered it to be. It's a little story about two quite ordinary people getting to know, like and love each other. It's about two everyday people - you or me, anyone of us - sitting in a train, walking in streets and doing basically nothing exceptional, and still it avoids being banal nor boring in any way. Its strength is in its realism; everything Celine and Jesse do and say is captured to a tape in so natural way. Identifying yourself with the characters is inevitable. Ending is perfect - it makes a watcher to continue the film in his/hers own mind as he/she likes and so the movie keeps one in tight grip long after it has ended. I suppose that experiencing a love bigger than life is a fantasy number 1 for most people and describing that fantasy is what this film does without doing a single mistake.I love ""Before sunrise"". It hasn't any special effects or unbelievable turns in a plot but it has touched my heart deeper than any other film before (sunrise, sunset or whatever, ha ha), and I think that it's all that matters in a subjective level. The stronger emotional experience a movie gives, the higher I rank it. I'm sure there's a lot of people out there who can enjoy ""Before sunrise"" as much as I did (and do) if they just give it a chance. On the other hand I'm afraid that people who are totally happy with their lives won't enjoy this film so much. It requires some kind of miserable mentality combined to hopes for better times.""Before sunrise"" is a film that uses little maneuvers in portraying big emotions. It makes me feel like it could be me on the screen. I hope that some day I have a chance to love some woman as much as I love this film.Fantastic piece of art.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the most thoughtful and honest romantic movies I've seen.,"I found Before Sunrise by chance when it was first released on video a few years ago.  Watching it then, I felt it was a well-written movie and an event that I would one day hope to experience myself.  Watching it now as a person in my young/mid twenties, I realize that I've experienced a feeling very similar to this movie: Being independent and actually falling in love.That experience was brief, honest, and fulfilling, leaving an impression on me that I'll always remember.  This film generates those same feelings for me, and watching this movie after my own experience, I can only see myself in Jesse's place, living out my own similar situations.This movie is one of the finest, most underappreciated (in my opinion) romantic stories of the '90's.  It's a very real movie, and it's an accurate portrayal of what it feels like to meet someone who you just instantly ""click"" with.  No gripping score, no dramatic good-bye only to be ""surprise"" reunited at the end.  Before Sunrise portrays all of its messages with the sincere awkwardness of a beginning relationship, a bit of insightful conversation, and two people with similar views and interests finding each other.Delpy and Hawke don't play stereotypes in this movie.  They play people, and that's what makes this film so interesting.  The pacing of the film is slow, yet time seems to rush by.  These are people you could actually meet.  These people could actually be you.When Before Sunrise ends, there's no contrived, cheesy good-bye, it just ends, which is how life works.  It leaves the possibilities open, but not in the way that you could see a sequel being made. If anyone has ever felt like this in a relationship, this movie will never ring truer than it does.  For those who have yet to find that bit of spontaneous adventure, Before Sunrise is a good guide of what to look for.I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  An intelligent, inspiring film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazingly involving,"This movie is about a short but strong relationship between 2 strangers. The location is unique and spectacular. The actors are amazing, both Hawke and Delpy are absolutely believable. The writing is sooooo damn natural and realistic you forget it's a movie - instead YOU will have a relationship with either Hawke or Delpy (depending on how you're inclined).This movie is a MUST for all hopeless romantics! Although most of it is just these 2 conversing among themselves, that for me was the BEST aspect of this movie. Movies like these show us once again (as many of us have forgotten) the raw power of a beautiful film. By the end you will have been through the relationship yourself and feel the same mixed feelings of contentment, sadness, exhaustion and whatever else the actors are supposed to be feeling.

10/10,"The Before trilogy is one of the best trilogies ever made in cinema. The only better trilogy is the LOTR trilogy. All movies present a one-day setting of the romance between Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy). Set in different locations and chapters of their relationship. This movie focuses on their first encounter in Vienna. Director Richard Linklater made sure each film was unique with its style of dialogue, cinematography, and locations. But what all movies have in common is the excellent dialogue that feels so real, almost at the same level as Noah Baumbach's writing.The film's dialogue focuses on them knowing each other and not sure where the conversation will lead them in the future. Like many opportunities are opened. This reflects the random locations throughout the film, showing how our two characters also explore their relationship. The two main casts in this film are purely natural with their roles. My other reviews for the sequels are mostly the same. The movie may have a simple premise of how they fall in love, but what makes the Before trilogy is the details of what can happen in one day. I have given you three recommendations if you want to watch a love movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Gag them with a spoon,"One of the most difficult scenes in acting is when a fictitious character is to naturally recount an old memory.  Often in dramatics, an actor tells of some old memory with just a hint of averted eyes and awkward facial expressions.  It is difficult to act out the natural timing of facial expressions as a person taps their own memory.  In real life, we all do this with ease with our true memories.  But actors in a movie are dealing with make-believe, so there is nothing in their brains to be retrieved and it is very easy to see through the acting.From beginning to end, BEFORE SUNRISE is a movie with two main characters who do almost nothing but recount to each other happenings from their individual pasts.  Unfortunately, the actors are not up to this difficult task.Apparently, most of these many strolls down memory lane are meant to end with some clever insight on humanity.  About one in one hundred succeeds.There is no catchy music, no passion, and very little to maintain interest. The viewer's mind begins to ponder side items, such as the facial structure of the actors chosen for this movie.  The lead actor and actress have the same nose and chin and eyes.  They could be brother and sister.  And the palm reader looked to be the mother of the lead actress.Last, the script has some unmissable glitches.  The audience that was around me murmured much disapproval during the bar scene when the bar owner and the lead actor shake hands on a deal in which the bar owner would give the lead actor the mailing address to the bar so that the lead actor can later mail payment for wine given out.  Just when we expect the address to be given, the lead actor walks away and he and the bar owner act as if the deal never happened.The characters learn about each other in an impractical backwards manner in terms of the science of mating.  No digits are exchanged.  No addresses or such personal data perhaps only because the script gives highest priority to the retelling of old memories -- old memories that are fake.  Unsatisfying. Unentertaining.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

But overall, this movie charmed the very essence of the romance genre to a whole level. Although the entire movie is one long, drawn-out conversation, it cites philosophical and universally deep material that makes the viewer question his/her own relationships and pursuits. From beginning to end, this film attempts and succeeds admirably in capturing the timeless ritual of fundamental human interaction and courtship. Decent acting, amazing scenery, and an illustrious script all cooperate to make this movie a revitalizing breath of fresh air to romance watchers tired of stale, overused plots and predictable characters and stories. From its mundane beginning to its unique and worthwhile ending, Before Sunrise will have its loyal viewers aching for more, and its disappointed viewers at least thinking, in the back of their minds, about the meanings of their own lives.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The best ""cinema"" of 1995","Out of 350 films that I had managed to see that year, ""Before Sunrise"" caught my attention, imagination and passion for the true cinematic art. It rose above the other entries of the year to stand out as my number one pick of 1995.The thought of finding oneself in a foreign country and discovering the country with a beautiful stranger is a fantasy I think many people can relate to and wish upon themselves. The exotic location of Vienna is a perfect setting for the adventures of two university students meeting up during the last days of their summer vacation. Their discovery of each other is matched beautifully with the sights and scenes of the city, getting wonderful vistas as the couple walks around discovering tings about themselves, each other, and the world that they have been born into.Obviously what makes this film work is the chemistry between the actors. Them seem genuinely interested in each other and throughout the film you want to learn more about them and hope that there is some foreshadowing of what might happen to them in the coming years. But, until 2004, all you had was the 105 mins of them together, walking and talking through the streets. Some might consider this to be a boring way to spend their time, but I think being within the age group of the actors I could relate to many of their conversations and ideals. SO very few films these days are dialogue driven so this was a very refreshing treat indeed.I have seen this film about 5 times and it was like rediscovering it each time. Only the last time did it seem to lose a bit of it's mystery when I knew that it's sequel ""Before Sunset"" was being released this summer. And as you may have already guessed it's sequel is currently in the running for my favorite picture of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

straight romance,"This movie is the purest form of romance. No comedy or drama, just straight boy-meets-girl. It's entertaining and occasionally quite funny, but it won't work for you unless you are a romantic at heart. The movie is very sweet, has no plot, and is the most gentle picture I can recall at the moment. Nothing even slightly scary happens, and other than a little mild necking, there isn't any sex in it, either. I guess that Ethan Hawke is cute (I'll ask my wife), Julie Delpy is quite beautiful in the movie, and both of the characters are extremely likable.This is a normal Linklater movie, which means that it's about people instead of plot, so if you like his other movies you really should give this one a try.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A romantic movie for the thinking man and woman,"I hadn't heard of ""Before Sunrise"", until the sequel ""Before Sunset"" was released. Because there was quite some hype around the sequel and the first one was broad-casted a few days later, I gave it a try. At first I wasn't too convinced about this movie's quality, but I kept watching it anyway and gradually I started to like it more and more. I guess this is the kind of movie that you have to see a couple of times before you can like it at its fullest.""Before Sunrise"" tells the story of a French graduate student named Celine (Julie Delpy) who meets a young American named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) on the Budapest-Vienna train. She is returning to Paris and he's making a trip through Europe. But instead of continuing their trip on their own, they decide to get of the train in Vienna, where they will spend the entire day and night together. During their stay of 14 hours, they get to know the city and each other, but when the night ends and another day begins, they have to say goodbye to each other, not knowing if they will ever meet again...This isn't yet another romantic movie based on the all too known concept of boy meets girl, boy and girl have a fight, boy and girl realize they love each other too much and live happily ever after. I guess you could call this a romantic movie for the thinking man and woman. This isn't just a corny flick, but a very intelligent and beautiful movie that will offer you the chance to really get to know its characters in a profound way.Overall this is a romantic movie with a well written story, interesting characters and of course a beautiful city as a setting. What more could you possibly expect? Not much, and that's why I give this movie at least a 7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Great movie, gets better every time I see it","This is a movie which to me brings out the best and worst in Film Making today. Actually it is truly more of a film than a movie.The best? That movies like this can be made.; The worst? Unfortunately very few people see it and it receives no award recognition. After seeing this movie, who would not say that it was not deserving of Oscar nominations (For Director, Film, Actor and Actress). But I know why: it is too intelligent and too sensitive.I think all of us can relate to Jesse and Celine. I think we all have had a similar experience (maybe not with Vienna as a background) in that we met somebody (not always as a love interest) we liked the person, we talked and then we move on. Our lives are changed just a little by the encounter/relationship and we often wondered what happened to the person.I have recommended this film to many people. For one exception (and even that person re-thought it afterwards and changed their mind)everyone has said WOW and really liked it. Alas, everybody sees the same thing in the ending as me: . But to me, that is what makes the movie so special. Jesse and Celine are changed forever by their time BEFORE SUNRISE but will never meet again. Sad but realistic; sad but true. You can see it in each of their final expressions in the movie. A smile and then they close their eyes; their time  together is already becoming a memory.Other than the ending, the scene in which they are in a bar and in which they have a telephone conversation with their friends is one of the most magical scenes I have ever seen in a movie. It was great and gets better each time I view the movie.This is a terrific film. We need more movies like this; but maybe what makes the movie so special is that we have too few movies like this - that is why I enjoy it so much. I read in one review that maybe a sequel would be in the works; I hope not as that would ruin the one thing about BEFORE SUNRISE that sets it apart: that Jesse and Celine will never meet again. And in all honesty, they never do.So, here's to Jesse and Celine; let's hope  they both have found happiness.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful Film,"Don't watch this film expecting any action (physical or mechanical). This is simple a film about two strangers on train who meet and take a chance on getting to know one and another. Most of the film involves this couples conversations as they spend one night together walking the streets of Paris. Well written, very involving.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
unforgettable,"I saw this movie on release and fell in love with it. It's a film with a lot of talking (but then, so are Tarantino's) yet never feels 'talky'. It's heartbreaking, though ultimately - because we have been party to a compassionate work of art - uplifting. Delpy & Hawke are perfect, and all in all this is a small, all too easily overlooked, gem. (Incidentally, I remember that Barry Norman, in his round-up of Best Of films for its year, completely ignored it - as he did that other modest pearl, Bagdad Cafe - which prompts me to wonder when British TV is going to get a film programme worthy of the name. Jonathan Ross? Huh! A better-dressed BN.)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sweet, but not cloying","Came across this while flipping cable channels, and, well, the channel-surfing stopped. It is a very sweet romantic film that continuously scoots along the surface of the ocean of cliches but somehow never manages to get wet. Even the ending manages to avoid that sickening cloyness that infects so many Hollywood ""romances"".I freely admit that the events in the film resonate with events in my own life and that is, no doubt, part of its charm. But then I hardly expect that I'm the only person who's lived through something like this.Highly recommended, unless you insist on your movies having explosions and formulaic endings.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Brilliant, Beautiful","I love small movies in perfect plausible settings.I love believable romances.My favorite feel-good movies are ""Running on Empty,"" ""Ruby in Paradise,"" and now ""Before Sunrise,"" which I just discovered, in time to watch it before seeing its 2004 sequel, ""Before Sunset."" Although now 9 years old, ""Before Sunrise"" still feels timely and brand new.All the essential elements came together: wonderful natural writing (the hardest kind to do), perfect casting, superb direction and performances, lovely photography, great use of unconventional locations in and around Vienna.This movie has little action, no violence, no explicit sex, no special effects, minimal supporting cast (just the two principal characters), and the whole story spans less than a day. This only goes to show how much 'stuff' is not needed for making a great movie, as long as the essential elements are all present. And no amount of 'stuff' can compensate if any of those elements are missing. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The reason is because the dialogue is realistic and the acting by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is very good.  The things that they talk about are the type of things that I like to talk about.  I still love the line that he uses to convince her to spend the day with him in Vienna.  If you haven't seen the film it is worthwhile just to hear this line.

"""Before Sunrise"": the progenitor of Delpy's rise to mainstream stardom ... maybe.","I saw the movie again yesterday, on VHS, and in full-screen. It was my third or fourth viewing, all on VHS. I didn't know of the movie's existence when it was in the movie houses in the mid-'90s, and I was ignorant of Ms. Delpy until I saw her in ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" in 1998. Like another poster, my last girlfriend somewhat/somehow resembled Ms. Delpy, and in the wake of that cataclysm, out of a veiled curiosity I began buying Julie's movies on ""eBay"". WOW! Not only was (is) she stunningly beautiful (and that sweet French-accented voice ... mon Dieu!), but she exuded a true depth of talent in the portrayal of her characters. Since ""Before Sunrise"" has now begotten ""Before Sunset"", my belief is that JD will now be looked at seriously for more parts in Hollywood, and perhaps a shot at a break-through major role. Still, I want her to continue to pick and choose her venues, her roles and her characters wisely. Bon chance, Julie! My fear is that in the current national (American) state of anti-French sentiment, her origin and accent might be seen as poison to casting agents and producers. In my heart, I hope that this is not so, but who knows? Anyway, think of what France has given to us: the Statue of Liberty, the croissant and Julie Delpy! Oh yeah, and the Reneault, that's true.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Movie.,"I've seen this movie many times, and every time it seems different. Maybe the most realistic movie about a summer relationship where nothing matters but the present. The actors where able to interact with each other like if they weren't acting, a great example of it is the club scene, where they had a very interesting conversation as they kept playing with the pinball machine;It was like they were dancing, so natural. The actors had this great chemistry, it is simply a great,soft and simple movie with no special effects, violence or anything that would of damage the message that it gave, to always keep hope.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"She's SO French, he's SO American","I loved the music (hey, where can I find that Kath Bloom song, Come Here ?). I loved the scene in the listening box of the music shop where their eyes both searched and avoided each other, and almost but actually never met.And I loved the dialogues. She's SO French ! He's SO American ! Having grown up in France and having spent the last 5 years studying in the US, I realize how their conversation was incredibly real: the right tone, the right attitude, the right topics. You may say that their conversation is lengthy at times, but I think it's exactly how it would be. She dresses and talks and thinks exactly like a French student at the Sorbonne. He looks and thinks and expresses himself exactly like a US college student. I wonder who wrote the script ? I may sound a little over-enthusiastic but there were times when I was so much into the movie that it felt like I was sitting next to them in the train or in a restaurant, overhearing their conversation. And I almost wanted to interrupt them, in order to explain to her what he really means or to tell him what she had in mind. I am so glad to see that other people did also enjoy this movie. I had been wondering if anyone else ever watched this unknown film ... I bumped into it by chance when I turned my cable box on late at night.

Greatest Love Story,"Why on Earth didn't someone tell me Linklater created what may possibly be the greatest love story ever filmed?I started seeing rave reviews of Before Sunset.  So I thought it might be prudent to see Before Sunrise.  Having just watched it, I'm uncertain how it is that the vast majority of reviewers believe Before Sunset tops Before Sunrise.  I hope that when I venture into a theatre in the next few days, I'll be pleasantly surprised.Before Sunrise is, as I'm sure the ""plot summary"" tells you, the story of a Parisian and an American wandering around Vienna.  Of course, the backdrop is wonderful.  Vienna is a beautiful city.  I loved it in The Third Man, and I love it here.  Including what appears to be the very same ferris wheel.But what is fascinating about Before Sunrise is the riveting dialogue. Rather than the typical one-liners or silence, Linklater follows the lead of his earlier self (see, e.g., Slacker) and comes up with some very listenable words.  While Waking Life tops Sunrise on philosophical depth by a slim margin, Sunrise follows our leads closely, which makes for somehow more impactful audio.  These characters are more real than most I've seen in most films.  Especially romances, which tend strongly toward cliches and other assorted love songs, already documented.  Before Sunrise develops our leads into humans.  Not an unheard of feat, but unusual.  But then it develops our leads into humans with insight.  Very unusual.Magical, beautiful, insightful into the human condition, and entertaining. 10/10.  On par with Amelie.  Rent it now.  [Update on Before Sunset soon.]",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful!,"Not many films like this exist, which is a pity. The simplicity of this film greatly enhances the beauty of the background surroundings, which incidently are based in Vienna, Austria. The film has hardly any background music, no special effects, but Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have acted so well, that the film doesn't need any. It is a pity that films like these hardly do well at the box office. This is a very romantic film and romantics will really like it. It leaves a very big impression on you. I kept thinking about it long after it had finished. I saw it late at night, and this film was just starting and I started watching and finally slept at about 8am because i couldnt sleep till it finished.The ending is very sad, and its probably the ending that leaves such an impression in your heart.The  simplicity of true love, which is the most beautiful thing in this world, is very well pronounced in this film. The passion felt for the other, the urge to give, the simplicity of verbal communication, are acted out beautifully.I only say that there should be more beautiful movies like this one. Great Expectations was one, also starring Ethan Hawke, and I think that was simply the best movie ever made(though now I may have to change my opinion to two best movies).But then, as someone has mentioned on this page, if there are too many movies like these, the value of these movies would diminish.This movie has given me an incentive to visit Vienna, one of the few places I haven't visited. I would like to go there at least once.See this movie with an open heart and no disturbances and you will surely like it. See it with an action oriented mind, and you will hate it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

They talk about such mundane things which suddenly seems to make sense.I think everyone goes through the cycle of emotions just like Celine and Jesse.Well, for anyone about to fall in love or anyone who has fallen in love or anyone just looking to rekindle the romance in their life , this is just the movie you may want to watch with your loved one on a rainy,cozy Sunday afternoon.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Lyrical, romantic, moving and real","""Before Sunrise"" touched me very deeply.  Jesse and Celine seem so real because Richard Linklater gives us the time to get to know them.  And because they seem so real to us, we become more emotionally involved in the story and what happens to these two people.The shots near the end of the film (of places Jesse and Celine were the night before) are lovely and elegiac.  Have you ever driven or walked by a place where something significant once happened to you?  To anyone else, that place might seem like a drab alleyway or commonplace bench, but to you it holds a special memory.  These shots capture that feeling perfectly.This entire movie plays like a beautiful memory...wonderful.If you enjoyed ""Before Sunrise"", I highly recommend ""The Clock"", a 1945 film with Judy Garland and Robert Walker.  Walker is a soldier on leave who (literally) runs into Garland at New York's Penn Station, and they only have two days to get to know each other.  While different in tone from ""Before Sunrise"", it is definitely of the same spirit.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Before Sunrise (1995),"Parting is such sweet sorrow.I think it's always heartbreaking to say the least, when you have to part ways with someone whom you feel an immense connection with. Be it after a single date of the evening, and definitely when the separation is going to be longer. And Richard Linklater has encapsulated this feeling in Before Sunrise perfectly.11 years is a long time, and that's exactly how old this movie is, but it never felt dated as I watched it for the very first time today. I too have heard about the premise, and wondered whether it would be possible to try and do what they did. No such luck :P But romanticism doesn't die, and I think I'm still holding on to that sliver of hope to be swept and sweep someone off their feet in the same manner, under mutually attractive circumstances, exploring a new city without any plan whatsoever on what will happen. Junk plans, order, and processes, and just welcome and embrace the unknown, together with a special someone.It's all about moments, and the seizing of chances as they come along. This movie is dialogue laden, but it doesn't bore. The characters discuss a vast range of topics, from their fears, family, their past relationships, and of course, love. They flirt with each other through an overnight stay in Vienna, Austria, all the while conscious that their impromptu and spontaneous decision to join each other in a night about town, will have to end come the next morning, with each going about their separate ways.It's easy to exploit the film and turn it into a ""Visit Austria"" commercial, and I'm glad that it didn't. Rather, having it serve as a backdrop to an intense, short relationship worked wonders both ways. The performances by Ethan Hawke (as the American Jesse) and Julie Delpjy (as French student Celine) are top notch, and would have you believe right away that these are two lovebirds falling in love with each other in the early stages of their relationship. I believed.However, despite the upbeat premise about love, the movie somehow had this sense of gloom hanging over it, and it is uncomfortable, though the feeling's made lighter by the lovers having great conversation, and having a great time hanging out. They don't skirt unhappy issues either, as past relationships which didn't worked were discussed, and that too struck a chord within me, especially Jesse's recollection of what happened just before he boarded the train, the bit about how little others have thought about you. Definite ouch in my direction.There are many beautiful moments in the movie, but my absolute love is the one where the couple enters a listening booth to sample a vinyl. Everything there is to say about love, just happened to be captured so succinctly. Despite being a talkie movie, there is totally no need for any dialogue. The stealing of glances of each other, is done to perfection, it just brings back any memories you have of yourself stealing glances at your other half. Everything about this scene is perfect, and I can rave about it till the cows come home. Simply amazing, and you have to see it to believe! This scene alone will justify watching the movie!This movie is so damn good, I just wanna watch it again, before I pop the sequel into the DVD player. Watch this! And it goes into my list of all time favourites!Warner Bros Code 3 DVD contains no extras, save for the theatrical trailer. Which is kind of disappointing. Visual and audio transfers are great though, with 4 different subtitles to choose from, and scene selection features.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Goodnight, Vienna","There is, in England, a venerable joke based on the schmaltzy musical show, 'Goodnight, Vienna' that was a mega hit way back in the twenties/thirties. After cleaning up in the West End the producer put out several Road companies and anxious to see how they were doing he visited each theatre in turn. Arriving in Stockton he made his way to the theatre and asked the manager how the show was doing. 'About as well as ""Goodnight, Stockton"" would do in Vienna', came the answer. I find that that story can be adapted to accommodate this terrific movie. Ask one of the Godard pseuds how this movie would do at the LSE and the answer would be about as well as Breathless at a Fred Astaire retrospective. I saw this film on its initial release and marvelled at its lack of pretension and the way it delivered PURE entertainment. Because of a self-imposed rule (I have seen, like most people who visit this site, literally thousands of movies but I won't rely on my memory alone so I wait til I see them again on TV or at a festival or they become available on DVD before posting a comment) I was unable to comment at the time but now, in its wisdom and probably not least because Before Sunset is doing so well, a cinema in London has seen fit to screen Before Sunrise and so I was able to see it again and make the happy discovery that is is just as good as I remember. One of the most impressive things about it is the fact that it is shot in very long takes so that, by definition, the actors have been obliged to learn large chunks of dialogue as opposed to the average film where they may need to learn a couple of sentences at most. Ethan Hawke and the gorgeous Julie Delpy are totally relaxed with each other and give the impression that they're just winging it, saying whatever comes into their heads and occasionally it does sound gauche but mostly it hits exactly the right note. This is a very 'continental' film inasmuch as virtually nothing happens, there are no computer graphics, no sex, no violence, no severed limbs, no peurile jokes, just two people clearly attracted to each other and slowly falling in love as we stop just short of feeling voyeuristic. Impossible to praise too highly and wonder of wonders, the sequel, nine years down the line is just as wonderful. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Believable and captivating,"Admittedly I'm not a big sucker for romantic movies. However, as I recently became familiar with the works of Linklater through the mesmerizing rotoscope-animations of ""Waking Life"" and the film adaption of Philip K. Dick's ""A Scanner Darkly"", the first in which the main-characters of this piece appear, I decided to give ""Before Sunrise"" a shot.First and most importantly should be said, that this movie effortlessly manages to dodge every cliché-filled pitfall of your typical, superficial Hollywood-love-fest. As with most of Linklater's work, this movie is extremely driven by it's dialogue, here to the point where you, on few occasions, almost find it to much. Fortunately, Linklater has a rare ability to write characters and dialogue with an unusual feel of honesty and depth, which is really what keeps this movie as captivating as it is.And this is where ""Before Sunrise"" truly separates itself from all it's pretentious, dreamworld love-flick-imitators. Because, as the common love-flick tends to focus on a ridiculous plot, a highly unrealistic yet still very predictable storyline, all usually disguised well in silly humor and poor acting, which never really seems to try and connect with it's viewer on anything but a hollow, dream-world level. ""Before Sunset"" steers clear of all that, by simply telling a story of two people connecting, and delivered in a way that enables most viewers to reflect their own experiences in the story. Granted, the romance unfolding in this picture is of the rare kind, but every piece of it is believable and never attempts to be more than it is.Combined with some fine and credible performances by the two main characters and a director who almost constantly manages to balance the story and the atmosphere just right, so it never ever gets mushy or uninteresting, this is definitely one romance-movie that is worth the watch. It is not packed with big allusive incidents, nor does it pretend to preach any real deeper meanings, but it does provide a compelling story of two people connecting, and does so in a way that most people will be able to relate to on an emotional level, and be able to appreciate on an intellectual one for the very well-written story, dialogue and directing.Hopefully the sequel which is next on the list will be as rewarding.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Contrived chemistry,"Perhaps I missed something. Too trite conversation and contrived chemistry. I did not for one moment believe these two we're falling in love, just acting like they were. Perhaps it was just the actors falling in love with their own performances.I rented this movie with then hopes that I'd be enthralled as so many others claimed to be, and the eventually move forward through the trilogy. Maybe I expect too much, but this seemed a shallow little movie. For perspective, I thought both Shrek and Moonstruck were wonderful love stories but thought the Titanic was hopelessly unappealing. I would be interested to know the general demographic for whom it held such broad appeal.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
A perfect little gem of a film,"I had never heard of this film until I went to a review site and it was on my favorite online critic's top 20 films of the decade.  About a week later I watched it and it surpassed all my expectations. It is a genuine depiction of love and emotion. It's also a film that shows us how fun it is to listen to conversation as long as it's interesting. The premise may sound boring and dull, and maybe it is, but the set up and execution are flawless.The acting is perfect. Ethan Hawke gives his greatest performance ever, and Julie Deply is exceptional. They both capture the essence of their characters so vividly that you start to believe their feelings from their first spoken word.Richard Linklater is the king at making movies that are set over the course of one day. This is a big step forward for him as a writer.The film is one of the best romantic comedies ever. It makes you feel good about love, life, and the future. It doesn't resort to sentimentality or cliched lines to fix your emotions. All it does is allow you to observe, absorb, and feel.The film is nothing short of brilliant.

Even Better after a Great Sequel,"I bought the DVD of Before Sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago. Having saw it twice, I couldn't help but missing Before Sunrise, not because the sequel was not as great, but I felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did, every time I finished watching one of them, I feel the need and yearning to see the other. So, I ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly, I will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly. The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other. It sounds so simple, the growing of the chemistry, I think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development, but to me - who doesn't believe in Nora Ephron - Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it. When I saw it for the first time, about 8 year ago when I was 20, I already liked it. But, I didn't rate it as a ""great film"", it still seemed to me like another thinking persons' feel good movie, Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic, it was 10 minutes too long, the characters was too well fabricated, I thought I liked it because it was like a dream and because I enjoyed their conversations, etc. etc.. But now, thanks to Before Sunset, I feel that's more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before. I saw the elements more clearly: Jesse, Celine, Vienna, their conversations, everything. How each of them are separated element by itself, and they have a chance to mix, the story is just a frame of time, I am no longer feel manipulated. And the freedom that every scene has, as well as its refusal to be overly efficient, how blind I was that those qualities didn't strike me as exceptional when I first saw it! Now, 8 year have passed, the more movies I've seen, the more I realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending, even movies like Pulp Fiction or Linklaters's own Slackers included. The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that, maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case, but Before Sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time, not a destination, every single scene has its own life. I don't know whether Linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made Before Sunrise, but to me, one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other. Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes, seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine, the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it. Meanwhile, I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset, and Celine's first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile I've seen in a beginning of a film, and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place I don't know with a sadness in me, no matter how beautiful Paris is, and no matter how happy I am that they meet again. I'm sorry that I go on this long with my limited English, Before Sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts, and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of Cinema's most believable romances!,"Linklater's 'Before Sunrise' is an important film which released during the American Independent Film Renaissance of the 1990s; creating Cinema's one of the most believable romances.I have watched this movie over 5 times till now. People may ask why someone would want to watch two people just walking around and talking with each other, within the span of 24 hours? It's the content of the intellectual and honest conversations Jesse and Celine share, and how they achieve self-fulfillment and self-discovery through one another. The topics and opinions covered in their conversations keep you intrigued and amused throughout the movie. The attraction between them is not just pure lust; it's moreover on an intellectual level. It's the kind of connection we dream of, but we rarely achieve or let it slip away.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy so skillfully and amazingly get into the shoes of these amazing characters; they have a sensational chemistry.Though the movie contains many memorable scenes of Jesse & Celine conversing and exploring the beautiful city of Vienna, there are a few which stand out and make an impression. - The one in which the two of them play a song in a music shop. They stand and try to listen to the song silently, when sexual tension is clearly lingering between them. - The one in which a struggling street poet writes, and recites a beautiful & moving poem with a word which Jesse & Celine randomly gave him. - The climax scene where Jesse and Celine woefully depart and promise to meet each other again on a decided date.The movie is timeless!(If y'all like this movie, be sure to watch 'Before Sunset' too; which tells the story of Jesse & Celine's meeting, 9 years after their first meet.)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Romance in youth seen through the eyes of an older man,"To be honest, I'm not one for romance, be it in the streets, in books or on screen. However, I like to consider myself as an open-minded person an very much looked forward to watching this film from a director whose work I have sometimes loved (dazed and confused).The story is simple, two people meet on a train, somehow manage to like each others' company in very short time and then spend a night walking the streets of Vienna, handing money to every beggar they meet and sucking up to the Austrian counter-culture.I really did not like this film. Firstly, the characters are uninteresting. Hawke's Jesse appears to be mentally challenged and Delpy's Céline is a pretentious intellectual snob. Anyway, these guys spend a night talking about their half-cooked philosophy of the world and their idea of true, perfect love. You'll get the usual: rebel against your parents, true love never lasts, capitalism is bad, youth is good.It seems obvious that the idea of this movie is to show two young people falling in true love. A type of love that everyone should wish for because it is pure. The viewer is supposed to be moved by the honesty and maybe naivety of these guys. And this is what seriously bothers me. This is a relationship seen through the eyes of an older person, nostalgic of the innocence of his youth. The result is that Jesse and Céline aren't authentic, they are not convincing, rather clichés, they are just somebody else's fantasies.I did however enjoy the simplicity of this movie. The plot, the pace, etc.Enough said.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ethan gives a good performance as the somewhat pessimistic American and, Julie gives a great performance as the destiny starved French girl going home. They have great conversations and it almost plays like a documentary. I hope everyone one in life can have one night as great as this. Lastly, I think the best thing about this movie is the ending. It is realistic not a Hollywood contrived.",,Anonymous,Romance
A gem of human acting,"If you ever look at someone acting, ask yourself the question if the character is real enough to meet in true life. This is something you rarely see in a movie and this movie is one of those rare occasions. The characters draw you in; sometimes wishing you could join their conversations. This also because the writers and director give the actors the chance to portray the moods of the situations (which is something you also rarely see) So this movie is not about dolly shots, love at first site or ""Oeh, I did not expect that ending!"" but it is about human honesty. All in all, a perfect example how a good movie can be made without the standard hollywood necessity to add commercially viable elements. Great work!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Simple, beautiful and passionate.","Simple, beautiful and passionate. Three words that suitably sum up this lovely little gem of a movie.Like all Linklater scripts, it's over-talkey at the best of times, but Delpy and Hawke balance this out nicely; and would reprise their roles almost seven years later in a scene in Linklater's ""Waking Life"" (2001/2).",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Seize The Day,"Do you ever wonder how many people we meet in our lifetime? Not just the people whom we converse with, enjoy their company, absolutely loathe, and even the ones you wish you never knew. But the people we walk by, take a glance at, and stay on our path.What if by some chance you stopped and actually struck up a conversation with one of them? Where would it lead you? It could be a dead end conversation that last no more than 30 seconds. It could encourage a heated conversation, argument, or just spontaneous chatter going off in all directions.It could lead to a whirlwind romance that will change your life forever.A man and a woman meet on a train for the first time and without even exchanging each others names they decide to spend the day together. Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise is that time spent by Jesse and Celine in Vienna. A chance meeting that would alter their lives in such a drastic way.Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is finishing up his tour of Europe and is a day away from a flight back home to the states leaving from Vienna. On the train to the city, he sees Celine (Julie Delpy) who is returning to Paris from visiting her Grandmother. Once ""chit-chat"" develops into a heartfelt conversation, the two realize that this is more than what it seems. There is a vibration between them that is more than the train car.Jesse pops the question. Not ""the question"", but asking her if she would like to spend the day with him in Vienna. She thinks, and thinks, and grabs her things and the two walk off the train not knowing where they would end up going.These two complete strangers decide to break off from their paths and go off into uncharted territory. They don't even ask each others names until they have stepped off the train. Those words passed down from parent to child through the generations forbidding children to talk to strangers must have slipped passed these two.What is so radical and provocative is that they have no idea about the others background or intentions let alone their name. This train sequence could have been over dramatic and had the two linked somehow by a distant relative or were in the same high school and didn't even know it. Two different countries, one train car, two lives that would never be the same.Linklater showcases the beauty and seduction of Vienna using a number of angles and techniques depending on the area. Fountains, bridges, river ways, and even the train cars have a romantic essence about them. It is the perfect setting for two strangers to go gallivanting about for a day to get a taste of a new foreign city, but more importantly to build up an everlasting friendship.At first their day starts off awkward and almost turns into a big mistake. They overcome this through snappy and intelligent dialogue that isn't just about past memories of friendship and relationships. Linklater delves into the realm of how things work on a grander scale. God, dreams, love, and family all are thrown into perspective.Can a relationship last a day? No. It can take place in a day but it lasts a lifetime. Jesse and Celine are forever together no matter what continent they live on. Before Sunrise is the time they have together until their departure. One day can fill up a lifetime of memories. Are you willing to try?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Reflection,"I was about the same age as the portrayed characters when this movie came out in 1995 and I really identify with the them. I had a similar experience in January 1991 with a wonderful girl that I met on a 3 day pass from the Navy. I was 19, she was 17. I went home from boot camp to visit my family and I met this girl a friend of mine set me up. It was an amazing date and I have never forgotten Michelle. I haven't seen her since June 1991. When I saw this movie it really moved me and made me think of the lost opportunity I had with her.I don't think of this movie as a chick flick at all even though it emotionally stirred me. Ethan and Julias performances were so natural and real that I just could't believe that there was a script to it, I thought that the camera man was just following them around and recording their night. Wonderfully written, directed, and performed. Excellent all around. It's follow up, Before Sunset, amazing as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I don't usually like these films but...,"If there's one film of this type to watch with your girlfriend or romantic friend this is the one. I'm on a mission to watch all of the imdb top 250 and I was over 50% done when I came to this title. I put it on and expected to have it playing on the side while I was browsing the web but after the first couple minutes I knew I stumbled upon something special. It really is a romantic suspense film. You want them to be together but at the same time it sends a message to let yourself live in the moment and be happy with what is going on now, without trying to extend it. It's really a film you can think about and discuss for a long time. The exceptional dialog drives the film and you can tell the chemistry between the actors is something special or else it wouldn't work.

Overhyped Romance,"I watched this film with very high expectations due to its online hype and glowing reviews, but after finishing it, I felt thoroughly underwhelmed.I fail to understand the widespread romanticization of this kind of story. Yes, most of us have experienced being young, pretentious, and experimental at some point, but let's not pretend Before Sunrise is the pinnacle of romantic storytelling that many claim it to be.Sure, the idea of meeting a stranger and forming an instant connection, despite its naive and almost silly premise, has a certain charm. However, I struggle to take this ""romance"" seriously or see it as something profound.The film delves into the spontaneity of this connection, but it doesn't leave you with anything truly meaningful. Many argue that the story's strength lies in its realism. Fine-but what's the point, then? There's no real payoff at the end. No matter how much you try to romanticize it, Jesse's intentions seem transparently shallow-he just wants to hook up.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A night every guy dreams about,"This movie has to be seen to be believed. It is simply the most romantic movie ever made. Because it does not impose a tragic incident to enhance its romantic theme it puts An Affair to Remember to shame. I don't believe any guy wouldn't wish for a night like the one in this Flin. The characters, Jesse and Celine, are so real it's unnerving. This is a must see movie for anyone who still believes in romantic love. In contrast to most viewers who prefer the sequel Before Sunset to Before Sunrise, I prefer Before Sunrise for its hopeful dialogue, its beautiful scenery of Vienna, its great music, its enchanting episodes, and the youthful innocence of Celine and Jesse before life's realities set in in the years that follow.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a masterpiece,"We start off with a great shot of what reminded me of a waterfall, a blurry torrent of color, which metamorphoses into moving train-tracks seen from above. This opening shot already had me hooked. On the train, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, the best screen couple that I have seen, meet by chance, and a fantastic, intelligent and also very sad love story evolves.What I love about this film is that it does not try to be Hollywood style in its dealing with love. There are no dumb subplots going on, no comic relief - a welcome relief from the mass of romantic comedies being pumped out these days - and no Hollywood ending. The story is stripped bare, and in its simplicity is uncannily real. This stark, real-life story is brilliantly portrayed by hugely long scenes done on just one shot - I don't want to think how many takes some must have taken.The plot is basically that an American boy meets a French girl on a train, they talk, get off together, talk a lot more, and fall in love. I won't even try to summarize it more than that: the plot is not important in this film. The dialog and the characters are what it focuses on. The actors portray them beautifully with some really sweet scenes, and the dialog is stunning.All in all, I was blown away when I saw this film. It put me in a very reflective mood, and left me stunned by its frank and realistic approach.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"But then the morning comes, and we turn back into pumpkins, right?","I must admit that at the beginning, I was sort of reticent about watching this movie. I thought it was this stupid, little, romantic film about a French woman who meets in the train an American and decides to visit Vienna with him. I was not actually enchanted about this kind of script, since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie. Still, I watched it! And I was amazed...""Before Sunrise"" is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way, wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth, we are sentenced to death, or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity, or that, we, humans, can afford sometimes to live in fairy-tales.The ending was wonderfully chosen (we do not know if they will meet again in six months, at six o'clock, in Vienna's station) -in our optimism, we sincerely hope so. The actors acted in a very good manner, so, that, I began to believe that I, myself could live a love-story just like this.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved a little more?,"I would like to stress again that the chemistry between Hawke and Delpy was near to nothing. I saw no sparks, no interest, and no bond. It was as if Hawke hated everything that Delpy did (see the poet and the fortuneteller), while Delpy just was looking for an American man to spend the day with. I felt as if she was trying to create that special moment from nothing, as if it was her goal for the entire evening with Hawke. She wanted to have one of those romantic evening for two in Vienna, and I caught from her character that anyone with half-a-brain would do well for the adventure. That person, in this case, happened to be Ethan Hawke. So, they attempt to have these moments, forcibly interrupted by Hawke trying to throw a kiss in there every once in awhile that wasn't scripted (to seem more ""real"") that only made Delpy seem disgusted. I just felt that when these two did kiss, they didn't really enjoy it as much as they should have. As I think about this point, I can't help but think of a line that Celine uses in this film. She states,""No, then it sounds like a male fantasy. Meet a French girl on the train, have her, and never see her again.""What if this was reversed on Celine, perhaps she was trying to find a man on a train, have him, then never sees him again. When I first met these characters, that was my initial thought. I did not see them together for the long haul, but after they talked for an hour and a half, I guess they had to fall in love. This was a totally mismatched pair by director Richard Linklater, and when you only have two main focuses in the film, I would have to say that should be your only job  ensuring that you have two people that actually build chemistry on the scene. Hawke and Delpy did not.Speaking of Richard Linklater (director of School of Rock), I do not think that he had a good grasp of this film from the beginning. I think he was attempting to show, without too much of a script, if two people could fall in love after a chance meeting on a train. What would be the ""real"" reactions, and how would it ultimately end? Sorry to say that Linklater does a poor job with this film, especially the ending where it doesn't even have a successful climax. That's the worst part of the film-it keeps on going and going, but it really overstays its welcome and becomes too repetitive towards the end. That was not helping him at all by having this slow ending.I have heard people quote this film as the ""greatest love story"" ever. I would have to differ with them because of the characterization and portrayal of our Jesse and Celine. Both were uncomfortable, unstructured, and fractured in their parts and it was obvious through the screen. I have seen better love stories, and better stories will continue to be released!Grade: ** out of *****",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"This movie is intelligent, witty, gorgeous, uncomfortable, real and yet fantastic all at the same time.","""Before Sunrise"" is not one of my favorite movies because of the beautiful cast,the hopelessly romantic theme, or even the stunning scenery. It goes deeper than that and resonates with me in ways when I least expect it. This movie is intelligent, witty, gorgeous, uncomfortable, real and yet fantastic all at the same time. Some people may get bored with all the dialogue, but to me that is what the greatest movies are about. It's about truth and honesty, people sharing and experiencing together. The conversations between Jesse and Celine are not contrived, and on the contrary are some of the most sincere and refreshing I've ever heard. One of the most poignant scenes is in the record store, where they share the listening booth to hear a record she loves. It is in the beginning of their relationship and Linklater does nothing to disguise the discomfort and awkwardness they both feel. She looks away but enjoys him staring at her, while Jesse's desire just to touch her is almost too much to resist. But he does, as anyone would have done if they were him. That's what makes this movie so powerful. Not that the story is too good to be true but that it's so easy to relate to and yet it makes you feel as if you are experiencing it with them. Linklater pays very close attention to the details, and in doing so he creates a wonderfully layered and vital backdrop. Vienna is not so much gorgeous as it is rich in character. But yet, using old Europe as a backdrop also allows the film to appear timeless and not easy to date. Its characters take on lives of their own, creating substories that you know continue long after the camera has moved on. Everyone from the actors in the play to the poet on the bank to the foreigners in the cafe all give a sense of time and place, that even though Celine and Jesse are living in a moment of stopped time, things are alive and happening around them.  Although it almost seems as if it is also happening for them, as their environment is as important as their adventure together. I have seen this movie countless times, and every time I see it I discover something new. I am drawn to these two characters and the vulnerability their share with each other. The stories they tell may seem inconsequential, but they are no more inconsequential to the stories we tell each other, stories that make up a person's life, each explaining in a tiny way why a person is who he or she is. They are of utmost importance, and yet it is these very things that can get brushed aside, seemingly irrelevant. Linklater is extraordinary at capturing this in such a way that this film makes me feel reminiscent of something I'm not sure of. I can be sitting in a dark wooded bar, and the faintest sound of a conversation in a foreign accent can transport me to a scene in this movie, as if I've lived it myself. In a movie that could easily be filled with cliches and uninspired conversation, Linklater has instead created a truly beautiful, intelligent, passionate, and honest love story.",,Anonymous,Romance
All about young minds' architecture,"Today I watched my second moving movie of my life. Could you imagine how great a day it is for me? Some years ago, when I watched the movie ""the Dead Poets Society"" I was all WOW and I was like: This is how I am going to pass through all these confusion of teen years. This is all I need for now, all I can wish for. And you know, it did help me a lot. But I always thought I would never find another movie so close to my thoughts and my feelings, like it was made specially for me. And today, just about becoming officially a youth (my 20th birthday!), I watched ""Before Sunrise"" and I was all WOW again. It was everything a 20 year old could want from a movie: Long conversations about everything, from love to childhood memories, from sex to feminism and everything you have ever thought about.

Every happening, moment by moment is so perfect and on the right place that you can just sit there and be busy sensing lots of fantastic feelings and thinking and letting that thankful smile spread on your face.

Strangers meet on a train and spend a day in each others company, maybe fall in love, but then do the decent thing = say goodbye?

Absolutely Wonderful!,"Believe in love at first site? Well Richard Linklater's 1995 sleeper hit may make you say yes. ""Before Sunrise"" is about the chance encounter of love, one-in-a million. Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply are on a train in Vienna where Deply changes seats to avoid an arguing couple, ending up across the aisle from Hawke. They converse and they get off the train together. They go sightseeing and talk about everything under the sun. It is the best day of their lives. Unfortunately, it is likely the only day they will ever see each other.The main thing that this hit has going for it is the dialogue. The greatness of what they say is at the same level of ""My Dinner With Andre."" But while the Louis Malle hit takes place entirely at a dinner table, Linklater's hit takes us site seeing while the dynamic dialogue becomes music to our ears.While the romance is captivating and the premise of good and the dialogue is awe-inspiring, the movie just consists of them walking at talking. Nothing unfolds and nothing gets anywhere. We know they have to get back home, so they are stuck being victims of the writing. What would have made it better would be if there was more contemplation and none of them really had to catch a ride home. But what's done is done. The ending does give us hope for a sequel. Just sucks we have to wait nine years every time we want a sequel. We want them sooner!As someone who loves all aspects of cinema, I dearly love the lines. The romance is great too.

No plot,"Barely after a few minutes have passed, you begin to realise what mess you have put yourself into.Indeed, Before Sunrise is just a succession of ultra verbose, conceptual or pseudo-psychological discussions (or even monologues) between these two characters that are Céline and Jesse. There is, so to speak, no real plot, and that is what makes this movie boring and uninteresting. Piling up soporific dialogues about anything and everything, without any specific purpose, can't make a good film.As for the direction, it is flat and uninteresting as the scenario.

BEST ROMANCE FILM OF ALL TIME,"SPOILER-FREELet me get this straight out of the way. THIS IS NOT A ROMANTIC COMEDY MOVIE. There's nothing really that interesting happening in the movie. That said, the dialogues and conversations are top notch. I can't imagine anyone else playing Jesse and Celine other than Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. The greatest compliment I can give to this movie is; watching this movie will feel like you witnessing that perfect first date you had once again.The movie perfectly captures the essence and warmth of a new love. The movie is worth for the conversations alone. Both characters feel like a real person. Each has their own view on any topic, both has some quality and a few things you might not agree with. They don't need each other as badly as say, Romeo and Juliet. They'll even might be happy without each other until the end of their lives. But the subtle way they talk makes you certain that they definitely enjoy each other's company, and might even entertain the idea of living together.Jesse is the penultimate average Joe. He doesn't have the quality of any action star. He's slender build. However, he's quite a spontaneous guy. So to me he's the guy you can relate to. Not perfect, but have this deep thought on things and have the quantity to do something wonderfully right if given the chance. Meanwhile, Celine is just the original European girl you'd imagined. Sure a little clichéd, but just enough vivid background to make you be interested in her. She's a feminist, have strong views on something, and have the pleasant outspoken personality nailed down.Some would argue that this movie is merely a character study. And to that extent, it's kinda true. However there's more to it than just that. The movie itself is beautiful. Richard Linklater and cinematographer Lee Daniel's shot-for-shot is gorgeous. Watching it feels like a live painting. They perfectly encapsulates the beauty of Vienna. It feels like the perfect getaway for anyone. Some might even consider traveling there in the near future because of this movie.The only downside of this movie is for anyone hoping this is a romantic comedy movie. It's not. It doesn't have unrealistic settings, unrealistic plot, unrealistic confrontation, and unrealistic ending. It feels real. The dialogues, the characters, the settings, and the sense of optimism you feel after watching the movie. A highly reccommendable movie for young couples. Or a lonely guy. Or anyone. One of the perfect romantic movies of all time.END OF REVIEW.

Slacker for romantics,"Before Sunrise is a quiet gem from Richard Linklater, the director of such quirky, era-defining films such as Slacker and Dazed and Confused. His film could be described as a post-slacker romance with heart as two twenty-somethings meet on a train headed for Vienna, and develop an instant attraction and rapport, so much so that both decide to spend the next day together in Vienna until sunrise marks their departure. French actress Julie Delpy, best known for her contribution to Three Colours White, plays Celine, a Sorbonne student; while Ethan Hawke plays Jesse, an American who has just split with his girlfriend in Spain and decides to euro-rail his way back to some sense of normality. What follows is a delightful use of off-the-wall dialog and picturesque locations, but rather than show us the tourist Vienna, Linklater opts for less-likely haunts: an eerie cemetery for unknown people; small side streets; slightly seedy bars. Along the way both meet a a variety of Slacker-like types, from a theatrical duo with a wry sense of humor to a Viennese poet-in-demand. Such exchanges feel like Linklater's insistence on brining the arbitrary exchanges of Slacker to his first romantic feature and although the scenes have an eccentric edge, some feel forced and contrived as if Linklater was too fond of Slacker to let its influence wane in this work.The performance of both leads is excellent. Delpy has a natural presence in front of the camera and has iconic looks to grace many a cineaste critique in year's to come; while Hawke plays against type as the sensitive, poetic American so alien to the teen trash peddled by Hollywood. The film demands the viewer's patience at times but the journey is well worth the ticket price. This is probably one of the most engaging romances in recent times ad one which paved the way for the equally brilliant sequel, Before Sunset.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nonetheless, he's directed a number of very intriguing films over the last two decades, though what's rare about him (and perhaps is the reason why his name isn't quite as well known) is that almost no two of his films are alike. Those moviegoers who pay attention (like me) would notice that what connects all his films, from ""Slacker"" (1991) and ""Dazed and Confused"" (1993) to ""A Scanner Darkly"" (2006) and ""Waking Life"" (2001), is Linklater's knack for character developing by way of believable and profound dialogue. The words of these characters are not only well-written, but the actors playing them almost never sound as though they are actually acting when speaking them.That's why I was surprised that all of the words spoken by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in ""Before Sunrise"" were actually written, and not by the two actors themselves. Hawke and Delpy are not playing themselves, either. Hawke is Jesse, an American tourist in his late 20's who is on a trip across Europe to find himself, if you will. On his way to Vienna, Austria, where he plans to take a plane back to the States the next day, he meets Celine (Delpy), a French student around his age who is on her way back to France on the same train. As Jesse is about to get off in Austria, he persuades Celine to accompany him through Vienna, and they get to know each other as they travel the city, and are well aware it will be their only night together, if not their last for a long time.The chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is incredible, and through very long shots of them talking, you never see them look at cue cards or try any trick to make them remember their lines. I felt as though I was eavesdropping on an actual conversation. Remarkably enough, Linklater and Kim Krizan wrote all their dialogue. There may have been moments of improvisation here and there, but the dialogue evenly flowed throughout the film regardless of the source.A good 90% of the film involved Hawke and Delpy talking, but by no means was the film boring for many reasons. First of all, the city of Vienna, where the film was shot on location, seemed to serve as a third character the same way Chicago did for ""The Blues Brothers"" (1980), or Idaho did for ""Napoleon Dynamite"" (2004). Somehow the places that Jesse and Celine spontaneously walked to were all interesting despite there being no panoramic shots (except at the end, in a unique montage showing the places where the two characters had gone). Regardless of Linklater's intentions of choosing Vienna as the film's location, the city held its own with its particular attributes that differentiated it from anywhere else in the world, let alone Europe.Second, the main characters were not only likable, but had that undeniable charisma that made their dialogue worth listening to. Each character also revealed enough about their background to keep audiences intrigued, and Linklater was wise not to cut to B-roll footage when these characters were telling their stories. Such a move would have insulted the intelligence of the audience, but other modern directors underestimate the attention spans of their intended audiences unfortunately.Third, throughout the film until its conclusion, I wondered if these characters would actually meet again, and in what circumstances. Of course, that question is officially answered in the sequel that would be released nine years later, ""Before Sunset"". Not taking that film into account, you want these characters to meet again, but you also know that they're making the most of time they know is limited. That level of intrigue is enough to sustain any attention span, and makes for one of the most unique romantic movies ever made (even still).",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Most Romantic Movie I've ever seen,"I'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good. I was stunned. Easily the most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. Stunning. Brilliant, sweet, funny and full of heart. The chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they're a couple.The movies grabs you right away and doesn't let go.

"Linklater, the Manipulator of the Everyday Moment","Richard Linklater is a great director, and great directors are able to show their style with success, allowing movies to still become what they want to be but with that special ""touch"" director's have. For Linklater, it's taking everyday moments and routine things and making them raw or magical. The fact that you can see something that could be so average in a different light means that he has indeed succeeded at what he planned on doing all along.""Before Sunrise"" is the third film I have seen from his repertoire. One could say he has even changed the romantic drama genre with this film.The relationship that develops between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is truly mesmerizing and one of a kind. The thing is, I can see where some people may dislike this film. It focuses solely on their character attributes and what their beliefs are. There is also heavy focus on dialog. It may also seem like a true slow-burn kind of film to many, but I think it paces itself rather well. It is a true testament to character development and the loving relationship we all wish to have; the reason why many of us go to the movies, adoring the celebrity folk on screen, wishing we could sometimes fall in love with the real-life versions of the characters they play. The performances that Hawke and Delpy turn in are memorable and you can't help but feel a part of their conversation as the movie goes on.Linklater's sequel ""Before Sunset"" does the entire story justice too. It is even more amazing how they made it work to such an open-ended conclusion to ""Before Sunrise.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Romantic Splendor....,"I really wanted to see a good romantic movie after a long time. This time i chose to go for Before Sunrise, after reading a review in a newspaper that it was a very good movie. And i was in for a really great time. This isn't just a romantic drama, mind you, it is one of the most meaningful movies i have ever watched (and that is very far few and between).Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy display a great chemistry in this romantic drama that highlights the glorious European splendor. The best part about this movie are the dialogs that holds true to so much that goes on in our life. Its great to see both of them arguing about daily life matters in such a way that u won't get bored no matter how many times you hear it.And, i'd like to end this review saying that, whenever i watch this movie, i always imagine that this is the way i'd like my romantic life to be. When you are going through this movie, the most probable thought that will be on your mind is that you'll be wishing that you and your girlfriend can experience such a beautiful night. But mind it, this movie isn't for everyone. Because if you are just impatient and plain lame (a fanboy expecting some fast paced action), then this isn't for you. But i definitely recommend it to everyone. This is by far one of the best ""Romantic"" and ""Meaningful"" movie i have watched in a long time.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Contemporary romance at it's best....,"""Think of this as time travel"" Jessie (played by Ethan Hawke) says to Celine (Julie Delpy). After spending moments on a train with a beautiful French student, an inclined cocky young American utters these words in a proposition, which sees two people embark on an impulsive journey around Vienna, where romance slowly flourishes.I've seen Before Sunrise several times now, for the first time a year after its release, and years later when I revisited the film after buying it on DVD. Still years later, the film maintains it's independent glow, and beautifully eloquent dialogue. Jessie and Celine walk the streets of Vienna, visiting cafés, shops, and parks like a pair of tourists on an ignorant quest to discover the real Vienna as well as themselves. The two discuss situations, and exchange thoughts and ideas in an articulate skillful approach that accompanies their yearning to learn more about each other. The film works because the director clearly spent blood and tears painting such complex characters. Their discussions are so private and truthful you have to feel almost ashamed that we cant allow them share their moments on their own, and yet we feel so blessed that we are able to witness these situations. Before Sunrise is above all an honest perception of modern relationships and social interaction. It is a film that carefully expresses its need to believe in love, as it exists today through the eyes of two total strangers who derive from different worlds. This truly is one of director Richard Linklater's most personal films, and it adopts a very European independent style of film-making, which embodies everything that defines Linklater as one of the leading indie masters of our time. It raises questions through its ambiguity and forces the audience to question their own beliefs and approaches to our own unsettling need to find a connection with someone, just like the characters. There are clearly very few films like it, and it successfully raises the bar for which other contemporary drama/romance films will find it difficulty to reach within its depth, intelligence and warmth.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
DO NOT WATCH,"The only positive thing in the film is the introduction of the life of an ordinary couple to us and we feel a romantic atmosphere throughout the movie. For example the seperation scene at the end is so emotional. If you want to watch this with your girlfriend, you can find a lovely movie. That's it, no more positive thing so we can come to the cinematic features now.We instantly watch the meeting scene as soon as the start and I think this movie is about falling in love. But I couldn't find any conflict. Conflict is base of the movie. If the scriptwriter do not produce a conflict, movie cannot progress, also you don't understand the inner world of the character.When we arrive at the 20. minute Jesse asks a sexual question to the Celine. At rare bat... He recently met with this girl at the train, the script is not rational for me.They converse with each other continously. If I want to watch this, I can go out and observe people at the street.Progress of the story or introduction of the inner world of the character... Dialog scenes must contain one of these two things but we cannot find any of these things at that movie. The most important issue is movie is not attracting me. Okey we can find a dramatic premise ""mutual love""... But where is the aim. There is no dramatic need which is basis of the movie. I dont have a reason for watching thisIf we can find a beautiful cinematography with this meaninglessness maybe I can understand this situation at that time. But this thing is also absent.Approx. at 35. minute we watch a kissing scene. If the dramatic need is that thing (falling in love and obtaining affection), movie is finished now??Apart from all these, movie contains bloopers and editing errors apparently.Also we have a fortuneteller scene... Terrible acting and common comments about the girl (like a real fortuneteller tales lol)Movie is told with the pictures. Cinema is visuality. We don't find a slightest thing about this issue in this movie. This is not a novel. We have to watch an action, mimic or expression of the emotions... There is no need for spending money. They could record a podcast and we could listen thisAlthough I didn't find it romantic, the Jesse. Appox. 3 different scenes made me feel a horny guy. As if only purpose of the Jesse is having sex.Throughout the movie I want to escape as soon as possible. I push myself constantly to finish it.DO NOT WATCH",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hello. How do you do? Can I sleep with you?,"Richard Linklater is obsessed with strangers. He wants to connect with strangers. Is it some kind of coincidence they all happen to be female and attractive? In fact, this exact same theme is re-visited in Waking Life, a more creative Linklater production made after Before Sunrise. In one Waking Life scene, the protagonist walked past a stranger, their eyes met for a fleeting moment and then walked away. He, perhaps overcome by her attractiveness, ran back to her, and uttered these spontaneous musings: ""I know we haven't met, but I don't want to be an ant, like some living thing going through life on ant autopilot, with nothing really human required of us. I want to see you. I want you to see me."" And the girl actually goes, ""Yeah! Me too!"". Ahh...if only flirtation can be so easy.....What Linklater has done so successfully in Before Sunrise is to package a simple boy-girl romance story, sprinkle lots of random philosophical musings, and actually manages to churn out a romance full of bittersweet and wistfulness. The idea of this spontaneous combustion of two souls in the vast solitude of the universe is a beautiful idea. It could very well have worked but for some reasons.....What didn't work for me was how Jesse kept gushing about how he felt this connectedness with Celine. Any full-blooded male would, what with her quirky French accent, her pale white skin, her sensitive blue eyes and her ravishing blonde locks. The scene in the music booth seemed contrived. It was as if Linklater already had this idea and decided to do Before Sunrise just to accommodate this little game of darting nervous eyes. And the people all seemed so friendly and accommodating. Poetry-spouting beggar, honour-serving bartender.. who else are there in dear old Vienna? Lastly, while I won't condemn the script as pseudo-intellectual crap, I just can't help that there is this overwhelming physical attraction between Jesse and Celine which relegates the attraction of the minds to a secondary level.I just wonder that if this were a ghost story, a story of two faceless discarnates without the earthly bound of the human body, would the same combustion have happened?Rating : 6.9",,Anonymous,Romance
"Even though you cannot say it's love, the firm is a love story.","I like it because of my recent personal experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite. The characters in the firm did not really enjoy their ""real"" lives, but they did enjoy themselves, i.e. what they were. The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory. A good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life. Many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those. Before Sunrise dealt with it in a nice way, which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film. Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head. It just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities. This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas. You would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story. The end was not quite important after all. You could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. Movies are supposed to be enjoyable. This is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it. I am on a journey too. The movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

S10 Reviews: Before Sunrise (1995),"Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are two strangers on a European train. The two come from widely different backgrounds, he's American and she's French, after they talk a bit on the train Jesse manages to get Celine to get off the train and explore Vienna with him. During the next several hours the two wander Vienna taking in all that the city has to offer and become madly infatuated with each other. But will this newfound relationship last past sunrise.This wonderful romantic-comedy is a breath of fresh air to a genre that has been in decline. Written and directed by Richard (Dazed and Confused) Linklater, ""Before Sunrise"" never bores because of its' small cast. In fact it flourishes due to the leads that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two. Smart dialogue makes this a must for romance fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
beautifully captures the fleeting,"i'm not even sure what to say about this film. it's one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic. to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa ""like dancing about architecture"". it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again. this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie Adaptation wanted to write. the ending is left open and ambiguous, no happy ending here, just mystery. no profound life lessons, just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings...... romantic love.10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger................",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
made me believe in soul-mates !!!,"wow!.. well i am not a critic or regular writer here, but i love movies a lot. recently came across this title ""Before Sunrise"". so decide to watch it, and i am glad i made that decision.Now about the movie... It's a masterpiece indeed, the way it starts in the beginning and ends at the same place, their endless conversations on very different topics (which actually are very unromantic in real ), people they met, places they went... everything gives more details about their characters sparing us from the cliché flashbacks . As the film progresses like the leads even you don't want the night to end. but After the Sunrise , when they reach the station to keep up with their rational adult vow - that scene is worth really touched me. its definitely the greatest romantic movie of 90's. do watch this once in a lifetime.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"well, coming from the director of Dazed and Confuse, what would you expect?","The bottom line is whether or not the film was entertaining or not. Yes and no. The story depicts two people falling in love for the evening. But did the viewer become attached to their situation by the end? No, at the end of the film, the two forget the idea o never seeing each other again and decide to meet there exactly six months from that date, no matter the circumstances. At times the realness of the characters sort of turns a part of the audience off by giving away too much of the character's personalities. The part of the audience that could identify with particular traits of the characters was pleased, but the other became a bit alienated by doing this. This latter part of the audience, the part that was not so swayed by the character's identities, must have been thankful that the 18 plus hours of the adventure were not actually shot in real-time, or more relationships would have been weakened rather than strengthened due to one of the two leaving the movie theater out of pure boredom. The point is that the story was not maximized to its full potential. The characters were lacking traits that could have made them dynamic. Although Linklater was playing off of the realistic atmosphere he was trying to create, often this does not describe the reason people go to the movies: to fulfill a fantasy; to enter a new, entertaining world for a ninety minute time span. If the viewer is not entranced by the artificial world created within the movie, then viewers will not be inspired. And if there exists no inspiration, then life would get, well, boring.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Travelogue to love,"BEFORE SUNRISE (1995) ***1/2  Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy.  Filmmaker Richard Linklater's winning and intelligent meet-cute/strangers-on-a-train romantic comedy set in Europe with American slacker Hawke picking up sultry French student Delpy, falling in love and disregarding the fact they only have one magical night together.  Clever dialogue (talk, talk, talk) and some truly innocent comic moments make for a valentine to those who believe in the power of love.  Endearingly captivating brilliance.",,Anonymous,Romance
"A dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of Vienna, and a well told classical romantic rendezvous","I managed to catch a late night double feature last night of ""Before Sunrise"" (1995) and ""Before Sunset"" (2004), and saw both films in a row, without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately. After sleeping it over, I have to say that I largely prefer the former over the latter, and I shall explain why.Before Sunrise introduces us with then young actors, Ethan Hawke (Reality Bites, Dead Poets Society), only 25 at the time of the film's release; and Julie Delpy (the Three Colors trilogy), then 26 (although looking much younger). He is a promiscuous American writer, touring Europe after breaking up with his girlfriend; She is a young French student, on her way home to Paris. They meet on the Budapest-Vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together. The two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of Vienna, exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love.The film has 1990's written all over it: back then, technology was leaping rapidly, the new millennium with all it's hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner, and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future. The characters of Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy), with all their flaws and inconsistencies (Celine's accent, if by mistake or on purpose, was half American-half French, and it swinged from one spectrum to the other, breaking the character's credibility), were a mirror of the time. Watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement, acting all clichéd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well, is what really made this movie work for me. The fact that the director doesn't let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while.All in all, Sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of Vienna, a well told classical romantic rendezvous, and a film I will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Still stuck in my head days afterward,"Amazing movie that, in theory, should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that I have long despaired of ever finding. Instead of relying on clichés and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. The lead characters are not perfect, and so relating to them as people you could know is easy. The movie is not trying to pull laughs, or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance.I am now restless waiting for the weekend so I can see the sequel. A moving, thought provoking, funny look at love that I think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffany's. Will soften even the hardiest heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Finally when I did see it, I fell in love with it. The very next day, I rented the sequel to watch it. What characters! Beautiful! Jesse and Celine reflect every man and woman. They are so real and touching. Hiding who they really are, believing what they would like to believe, accepting who they are to themselves and trusting the other person enough to let them know who they are... Just shows beauty in life. I was lucky to see this movie. Everyone has to watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A very nice movie,"An extremely simple movie, all about speech and the relationship people can develop over a day. It's good!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
a romantic film for romantic idealists,"Linklater's simple yet highly enjoyable film where the two main performers are the key to the films success. Before Sunrise is another one of Richard Linklater's experimental films where the dialogue and performances are the main focus and the usual filmic techniques (like multiple edits, shots and angles) are abandoned for a more free form and relaxing capture of what genuinely feels like a blossoming relationship.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are two strangers who meet on a eurorail heading towards Vienna. An argument between a German couple provides the excuse/reason for Celine (Delpy) to sit adjacent to Jesse (Hawke). Jesse takes this opportunity to talk to Celine. They sit together and start a conversation where the spark of a budding relationship begins to form. When the train finally stops at Vienna, Jesse plans to get off whereas Celine is suppose to be heading on. Jesse decides to take a chance and invites Celine to spend a day in Vienna with him as he has no money for a hotel/accommodation. They both feel like they could talk for hours and didn't want the conversation to stop so Celine gets off on the same stop and we follow them, getting to know one another on the streets of Vienna.For those of you expecting anything dramatic in terms of action or dialogue you are watching the wrong film. It's just goes on from one conversation to another. It's set at a very leisurely pace as the two of them walk the streets of Vienna where they discuss things that come to mind. One scene has them being tracked through the streets in one continual shot which is marvellous done as both leads talk so naturally it feels like we are listening in on a private conversation, though what they talk about is not at all pompous or overly intellectual but of amusing observations, anecdotes and quirky ideas (like reincarnation and monkeys!)There is one particular scene in the music store where they stand in a booth and listen to some music, quickly glancing at one another hoping for the other not to catch them looking. It's all too cute, touching and refreshingly genuine. A romantic tale where a boy meets girl and actually talk to one another from past experience, ideals and opinions on everything no matter how insignificant, or obscure. It's these little things that gives this film it's beauty and enjoyment. As their relationship unfolds it becomes more and more naturalistic and believable. Can two strangers meet and fall in love in one night? For those of you who hold some romantic notion/ideal then the answer would be yes, but for those cynics out there, you will probably think this is all too convenient.Not a film which will be suited for those looking for something more than just two people discovering each others personality and a film where dialogue is the main driving force of the plot. The two leads are extremely likable and very easy on the eyes, with a completely believable and very genuine look at two people falling for one another and with the film finishing with both characters promising to come back and reconnect, the film is left for us to imagine whether their love can truly blossom such is the way of the spirit of the film, very invigorating, imaginative and joyful to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A wonderful delight!,"Saw Before Sunset accidentally as i was surfing channels on TV. I was hooked to the screen 2 min into the movie. I then looked it up on IMDb and found it was a sequel to Before Sunrise and both had good ratings so i got them and saw them many times.Before Sunrise is a wonderful movie about two random persons making genuine interesting conversations throughout the movie roaming in Vienna. Both Celine and Jesse are smart people with their own philosophies of life. The viewer can connect with the natural chemistry between the two lead actors. The writing part of the movie is done very well. The conversations are made to look very real, yet very deep and thoughtful. The acting is natural too and so is the direction. Richard Linklater always chooses deep, thought provoking subjects in his movies.At the end of the movie you feel the pain of the pair departing. You would wish the pair had more time with each other. The sequel is like a gift to the fans. It is wonderful too. Now eagerly waiting for the 3rd installment.Its almost impossible to describe the essence of this movie to someone who has not seen it. Because one has to experience it. So if you have not seen it and if you like romantic, heart touching movies then go for it you will be delighted.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quirky Screenplay Romance: The Motion Picture,"Linklater relies entirely on the screenplay for the success of Before Sunrise. Any other filmmaking techniques, such as shot composition, music, editing, are all minimalised or abandoned in favor of the dialogue between the two protagonists. In any case, this would infer that his intention is to trap them in a void together, surrounding them entirely and hinging the viewer's experience on the characters'. In essence, Linklater banks on you to accept Jesse and Celine as genuine, and indulges entirely on the chemistry between the actors and the kinetic ability of the script. As a supplement, he includes an ever changing roulette of background environments, of which are responsible for much of the characters' dialogue. It's a wholly reactionary experience, and in framing the story in such a singular matter as to entrap Jesse and Celine in their own world is the mistake Linklater makes in attempt to force the film's romance. The movie enacts itself like a test reading between two actors testing the script for its energy. It's not as much a complete cinematic experience as it is a manifestation of the dialogue written on the paper, and the actors not so much characters as they are the actors reading who the characters are supposed to be. The movie feels void of the people it's trying to create and instead representative of the efforts an actor reaches to try and form their character, but the script refusing to comply with this action as it believes so entirely in its characters as people that it insists upon it to the point that any performer involved ends up just that; a performer. The screenplay and the actors and the production all are at odds with each other, with the actors acting a screenplay that simultaneously begs to be acted and yet is incompatible with acting because its nature revolves around the existence of an actor acting, not for the sake of realism or performance but because of insistence. The world around the characters is forgotten in this clash of creator and creation, and the result is a sterile experience, the audience lost in this unruly amalgamation of confused enactment. By isolating him and her in a world of their own, it's clear that there is no place for a third party in it. Any interruption to their world in-universe is quickly dismissed, but not without being acknowledged. The audience is never acknowledged, not beyond the character's intentionally snappy dialogue that functions more as an indulgent conversation by Linklater between himself and himself as though challenged to write the most screenplay screenplay possible. In the end, it's nothing but an exercise in dialogue training that a high school junior would write for his fifty dollar film class at the local studio.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Probably the smartest contemporary romantic flick,"There are three types of Romance. First you have those with Sex and no Brains (Titanic is the best movie in this category) Then you have Brains but No sex. Third is no sex and no brains, a category which gives you rubbish like twilight. The best Romance films are those which fall into the second category. Most folks immediately name Gone with the Wind or Casablanca as the smartest romance, but how about something more contemporary for a change. Before Sunrise could rival either of these pictures as the most intelligent romance of the 20th century, and while it doesn't actually amount to much of a story, It gets the viewer involved emotionally and intellectually.Two folks meet on a train, an American boy going to Vienna and a French girl heading for Paris, they have a long talk over lunch, and in about five minutes they becomes friends. Before long the train arrives at Vienna station, but before getting off, the boy asks if this girl wants to spend the day with him touring the city. She agrees. They have the time of their life.Before Sunrise is pretty much all talk. The two discuss many things while they wander the cobblestone streets, but the most interesting thing they discuss is Romance. This is the brilliance of Richard Linklater's script. Not only is being brilliantly self reflexive, but in a way he is poking fun at the films in the other two categories of Romance. The two discuss how cheesy relationships can be. These are clearly not dumb people, and the film is clearly not a dumb, Hollywood formula driven piece. Ergo, do not miss this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beauty of a movie,"""Poetry in the form of a movie"", this is how I would like to describe the beautiful movie. I have oft heard that this is a very romantic movie but romance aside, I was just blown away by the beauty of the talks they have between themselves. The story of how two complete stranger meet on a train and fall in love but the only thing they don't have is time, which is the only thing in short supply in their otherwise rich romance.Sure you have two poems being thrown with all the dialogs to further beautify the screenplay but the main strength of the movie is the conversation they have, intellectual at times, romantic at others but all just expression of beauty coming from their mouths.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Awkward silences and unabashed laughter. It was unacknowledged love-at-first-sight.Have you walked the streets? Have you seen the people and talked to them? Have you looked at your new-found lover and just known they were as lost in love as you? Did you kiss?At first you count the days. Then you miss a day. And another.

I wouldn't go that far but will say this was way better than I expected. This movie is pure romantic fantasy but the kind we don't see anymore.  It is mostly dialouge exchanged between the American boy and French girl who meet and decide to spend one day together.  They get to know eachother and discuss life, sex, relationships, etc.  I'd say it's a giant step forward for Richard Linklater, more mature than Dazed and Confused or especially Suburbia.  One other thing, even though this was all in English and an American movie, at times it didn't feel like one.  Personal favorite scene is in the listening booth, that's just like real life.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"As with the characters there is profoundness, as well as simplicity.","You really can't rate Before Sunrise properly without including Before Sunset.Before Sunrise is actually the first part of a two part set, the second part being Before Sunset. I thought that movie might be a sequel, as sequels go. It is not. It is the other essential part of the whole. I will critique them as an essential pair.The movies are difficult to rate. This is because if they mean something to you they should mean a lot. If they do not mean anything in particular, then you probably didn't like them at all - and probably didn't bother with the sequel. Without going into any details (I don't need to - you can get the official storyline from the general critic's reviews), here is how I rate them.Before seeing Before Sunset, I gave Before Sunrise a 3 out of 4. But the two together rate a 4, or more precisely an 8.5 out of 10. I have to leave room for such masterpieces as Hotel Rwanda and films in that class - totally different. It is also interesting that these movies are played out in real time. But I won't elaborate in order not to spoil the plot of the movies as a pair. We are lucky that as of now, we can see them together, or even better, one night apart, as I did.As with the characters there is profoundness, as well as simplicity to these movies and a nagging question which is resolved at the end (of Sunset).What do you think?

"Maybe you DON'T need to love,even like chatty movies to appreciate this...","...but it might improve your enjoyment.HAving said that,I think that this is a film for anyone who appreciates character over plot and wants a film to respect his or her ability to follow a story.Jesse(Ethan Hawke in a roll where,to me,he became A LOT more likable),a college student on vacation(more of a wanderlust)in Europe meets,via chance encounter,Celine(Julie Delpy,ethereal,beautiful and bright),a French student also on roam. They hit it off instantly,stop off in Vienna on wait for each others' trains taking them in different directions,and spend a thoughtful,chatty evening-into-overnight-into-morning together,taking in the aged,beautiful scenery of the old German city. As they bond over their conversation,an attraction builds,but then a dilemma ensues:should they indulge in a physical relationship,fully aware of the fact that once they part they may never see each other again? Decisions,decisions...Director Richard Linklater,to the best of my knowledge,had never filmed a movie outside of his home state of Texas(and mostly Austin)prior to this offering,but his slow-moving,attentive camera and sound are able to capture much of the beauty and warmth of old Europe and the people who roam the streets as well as the central characters. Some may dismiss this as a ""Date movie"" or a ""Chick flick"",but to me,this film is FAR above either of these genres:this is a romance that's made around real,human character,that has no easy answers and no clean lines of plot denouement. I have,I must confess,some fond memories of seeing this. I was back in college,and my school's arts,entertainment and activities organization(I think most colleges have one)had agreed,through its films department,to screen films not yet released to local(read:mostly students)audiences,with the admission to the screenings being free. Previously,we'd screened films like ""Trapped in Paradise""(bad)and ""Mixed Nuts""(very bad)and I felt like we'd gotten what we'd paid for. This was next up,and it was like a revelation: a free,thoughtfully,well-made large studio production that I(and about two hundred other lucky sorts)got to see for free!I can say that whether you pay for it(And as a twelve-year old movie,it can't be more than a cheap rent anymore)or see it for(almost)free on cable,you'll be getting high quality.

Painful and mind numbingly boring! Avoid at all cost.,"I don't understand the good ratings. I was on a quest to watch the top 10 realistic love movies from a post, and this one was ranked 3rd. The list has movies like 'Blue Valentine's' and 'The big sick' to give you an idea of what this top 10 list is about.But Before Sunrise was such a disappointment. This movie is claimed because of its dialogues, which I really find them useless and dull. It's just 100 minutes of conversation. Nothing else. No context. No story. Just two people hanging out with Vienna on the background. I can't believe this is a 'trilogy'.I don't think I'm spoiling the movie to anyone... Because there is nothing to be spoiled.
I'm pretty sure there's an audience for this movie, maybe they have insomnia.I wish I could rate with ZERO stars.

"Unpretentious, and romantic","The idea: Two people meet on a train, spend about 24 hours in Vienna together, and fall in love.This idea is somewhat daring because it is not a ""big"" movie, and it isn't plot driven, which could be horrible.  But instead, this movie is a thoughtful, moving romance.   Dialogue driven, the conversations Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have aren't necessarily brilliant, but they're real.  They discuss things anyone would discuss (family, friends, etc).  The conversations are intriguing, however, and this draws us deeper into the film.Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke are completely natural in there roles.  There is no acting her.  They present these fictional characters honestly and openly.The thing I enjoyed most about this movie was how real it seemed.

"Who needs Special Effects, when a movie like this exists?","Simple, Original, and Romantic. ""Before Sunrise"" is about Chemistry. The casting of the two lead actors: Hawke, and Delpy was a master stroke. Sure, at times it looks like they are just saying their lines, but most times their reactions to each other are spontaneous. The scene in the listening booth, conveys so much while saying so little. The magical first meeting was also majestic, as two strangers meet as if they'd known each other for their whole lives. The scene in which they pretend to talk to their friend over the phone describing their meeting of each other, is a fascinating way of telling one another, how they feel.It'd be nice just once in life to have an encounter like the one depicted in this movie. The setting is also very romantic and adds to the genuine ""magic"" of the film. The conversation is interesting and not overwhelming. Most of all the pleasantness conveyed by both lead characters makes you wish for more. (Rating: 9.5/10)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's so dazzlingly true to life that I feel everyone will be able to get something out of it and make a connection to his/her own life. Although not very well known,  this film is bound to become a romantic classic of the 90s, a film young people of now will put on again in ten or twenty years time to remember their youth by and to contemplate about what their life turned out to be. Nowhere is this, although very romantic, tale sugar-sweet or overdone. Nowhere is it boring, even though there isnt a big story-line.

Young love.,"After seeing Richard Linklater's ""Before Sunset"", and loving every minute of it, I resolved to find the film that ""Sunset"" was a followup to: 1995's ""Before Sunset"". Both films star Ethan Hawke (""Dead Poets Society"") and Julie Delpy (""White"") as Jesse and Celine, two star-crossed lovers who have a penchant for engaging in long conversations on a wide variety of topics. In ""Sunrise"", Jesse and Celine meet while on a train to Vienna. Jesse is sightseeing in Europe, having been dumped by his girlfriend who he had originally intended to spend his vacation with. Celine is on her way back from a visit to her grandmother. Jesse is going to catch a plane in Vienna back to the United States, and convinces Celine to get off with him. The two wander around Vienna, talking, encountering the locals, and, of course, falling in love. The plot of ""Before Sunrise"" is minimalist; the film depends on the strength of the two lead actors, and the dialogue they are given. Fortunately, both are very strong. I prefer ""Sunset"" to ""Sunrise"", but both are excellent productions. I give ""Sunrise"" an 8, compared to the 10 I gave ""Sunset"".",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quite moving,"""Before Sunrise"" left me with the feeling of ""I'd really like to know if they met again."" And my personal pessimism of course says they didn't. Okay, just my own life experience. But on the other hand the ending leaves room for imagination, so pick your own choice.The ending and actually the whole movie is unusual for an American made production and this courage should be honored. The actors were overall convincing, the camera staying realistic, not too much softtoning of a not so soft Vienna. I especially liked the look back in the morning on the places the two visited and the feeling of emptiness, at least for me, that now vibrated from them. Quite a fresh breeze after having watched kitsched romanticism in movies like ""Titanic.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

And of course,every attractive female I saw all that day I thought we'd suddenly fall in love with each other.--Too bad--it did not happen!I was in Europe with my girlfriend one summer quite a few years back, and I've had to travel alone on bus, trains and even via thumb through the US over the years.

Intelligent Romance,"The test on whether or not you'll like this movie comes in the first 10 minutes of the film.  Jesse (Ethan Hawk) is a young American touring Europe by train.  Celine (Julie Delpy) is a French student returning to Paris on the same train.  When Jesse breaks the ice and speaks to  Celine, we share with him that awkward moment of anticipation that follows after you find the courage to ""hit"" on someone you find attractive.  Is she interested or will she brush him off?  For the film to work his ""line"" has to work on the audience as well as Celine.  Luckily Jesse avoids lines like ""What's your sign"" or ""Do you ride this train often"".  Their conversation seems to flow naturally and we don't gasp with disbelief when she agrees to join him in the dining car.What follows is basically a twenty-something, romantic version of ""My Dinner With Andre"", with the beautiful city of Vienna subbing for the restaurant. The elements that make this film work are 1) Intelligent, believable conversation, 2) Palpable chemistry between the leads, and 3) The gorgeous Vienna locations.  Hawk's Jesse exposes enough of his insecurities and is charming enough (not to mention good-looking enough) that you believe the bright, rational Celine would get off the train to spend some time with this intriguing American.  They are not a mindless Ken and Barbie couple.  They are both flawed.  During their wandering Jesse can't help but let his over-analytical, immature side peek through his boyish charm.  Celine admits to a rebellious urge, though she's unsure what windmills she's trying to topple.  Their conversations are revealing and insightful without seeming forced, and they become the basis for an understandably intense affection. They're smart enough to realize they shouldn't be falling for each other this quickly, and idealistic enough to enjoy letting it happen.""Before Sunrise"" is sort of a thinking man's romance, but it's still messy and dangerous and exhilarating.  It's a challenging love story with a wistful, bittersweet quality that makes it a great anti-dote to all the fluffy, brainless, teen-heartthrob flicks Hollywood normally  churns out.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

One is now married with a child one is dating but both are unhappy as memories of their one night keep either of them from successfully pursuing happiness with anyone else.Their dialog is enchanting, honest and brilliant and you can imagine saying exactly what they are saying to one another if you were in their shoes.Their interaction with one another is so natural and unrehearsed and you feel as though you are part of their very intimate conversation.

And they fell in love,"'Before Sunrise' is a love story like no other. To classify it as a 'rom com' would be to do it signal disservice. It is an exquisite montage of beautiful moments, over the course of a single evening and night, involving just two people, over which ... it cannot really be said that they 'fall in love'. They are in love from the very first scene; that's apparent, but, over that unforgettable night, they realize what it means to both of them. Their love, as it were, acquires form and takes shape. Which is why I say that this is a love story like no other - I have not seen another film which, instead of relating how the lead characters FALL in love, relates, instead, how they understand what their love means to each of them.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, she as beautiful as he is handsome, essay these characters (Jesse and Celine) with warmth and empathy. The film is bound to remind you of Audrey Hepburn-Gregory Peck's unforgettable day in Rome, and is, in a way, a modern take on that classic. There is, however, a lot more conversation here - meaningful and poignant in equal measure, dealing with everything from reincarnation to relationships, to love and childbirth, to politics and poverty. We immediately relate to it and, over the course of said conversation, the relationship between Jesse and Celine acquires contour and colour. There are ever so many scenes which you take home with you and which cannot be forgotten, of which my two personal favourites take place in a music hearing room in a record shop, somewhere during the first twenty minutes or so, when they listen to a record (and during which, as admitted by Delpy in an interview, she almost fell in love with Hawke), and later, when they declare their love for each other, in a telephonic conversation ACROSS a dinner table (you have to see the film to know how THAT happens).Rewardingly, the film ends on a note which, though bittersweet, is more sweet than bitter, and closes with a smile.One of the most incisive studies of first love (though Jesse and Celine both confess to having been in earlier 'relationships') possibly filmed, 'Before Sunrise' is a film made clearly with the heart, rather than the head. Richard Linklater handles each scene in the film with the delicacy of a Ming vase, allowing, even while his lead characters prattle on, so much to remain unspoken between them. These unspoken feelings are, I suppose, what we know as 'love'.Or so 'Before Sunrise' would have us believe. And I, for one, am persuaded to.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

He comes across Celine(Delpy) on a train to Vienna. She is supposed to get off at Paris but their chance meeting leads to the formation of a natural connection and conversation begins. Listening to them talk is the only thing you have to do in order to feel their chemistry. Trust me, it's done in such a casual and realistic manner, you actually begin to relate to their characters. Jesse asks her to get down at Vienna for the short time(around 24 hours think) he will be there before he catches his flight to America, so they can spend some time together and get to know each other better. Then that's how it all starts. They walk the beautiful streets of the town and talk, listen and understand each other. Their feelings are not rushed or exaggerated. Director Linklater has done a great job with portraying the two strangers, the gradual growth of feelings for each other, and their simple yet intellectual conversations.

The whole movie is just one big dialogue from start to finish. And it isn't funny or original dialogue, it's mainly clichès about love and lame anecdotes.It gets so pretentious I laughed during some scenes. The characters try too hard to be emotionally deep and intellectually different, and it gets to a point where it's just plain boring.The acting is good in some points and horrible in others, some lines are delivered with so little conviction you start to wonder whether some of it is supposed to be sarcasm.Anyways I still give it 5 stars for the idea but I would definitely not watch it again.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pleasantly surprised,"Very believable, enjoyable movie.  I thought both actors (Hawke and Delpy) did a great job and had great chemistry.  They made the characters come to life and seem like actual people.  Not many like this out there.  My only complaint was that they didnt show enough of Vienna.  Then again, that probably added to the realism of the picture.  It was enjoyable to sit back and watch two strangers get to know each other and discuss some rather deep subjects.",,Anonymous,Romance
Authentic romance on a big screen,"It had been a long time that I hadn't watched a movie that moved me so much. Before Sunrise is simply one of the best romance I've ever watched. Not being a fan of the genre, I appreciated that this story doesn't rely on romantic and dramatic clichés and really feels authentic, spontaneous and subtle. It also feels like every part of this movie has been thoroughly thought of and has a meaning: the intense eye contact, the awkward pauses, the arguments, even the locations in Vienna. The style is very simple and structured. Besides the amazing writing, the actors carry outstanding performances. I could just rewatch Before Sunrise over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A complete and genuine romantic story,"The movies gives leads us into an incredibly romantic story, the dialogues were amazing, thoughtful and genuine, it shows us the real connection between two souls that is rarely seen in other romance movies. There isn't a big plot line but watching them fall in love, watching their souls connect, it is everything I want in a romance movie and everything that shows how two people fall in love. I never thought I would enjoy this so much but it's just beautiful and conforting to watch again. The whole setting of an inevitable end to this story. It casts a dark light to all the beautiful and sparkling moments, but isn't that what makes it more memorable and even more romanticised? The chemistry between the leads are amazing and I have to emphasise, the dialogues, are brilliant. This is the perfect fantasy of romance.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A beautiful film about complex people in love,"When we think of 'epic' trilogies what comes to mind? We think of fantasy; action epics like The Lord of the Rings or Sci-Fi classics like the original Star Wars films (we do not speak of the other three films shh!) and gangster mafia films like The Godfather. All of those seem to be action films however, ones that have been financially successful and well known. In my opinion however, one of the best trilogy of films of all time, are the Before movies.You all might be thinking what kind of movies these films are. The three films are Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight. These films are some of the most romantic movies ever made with quite possibly two of the most interesting lead couple. Actually you know what? How about I talk in depth of all three of these movies. Sounds nerdy as hell, but its about time someone talked about these masterpieces. 
 
The first film in this trilogy is Before Sunrise. Here in this story we have two seemingly ordinary people, Jesse and Celine, as they meet in train going to Vienna. Their very first conversation starts when a German couple are arguing in the train. Little did they know that the moment they spoke they'd be in for some of the most in depth discussions. Hands down the best aspects of this movie is the characters and the dialogue. The conversations that Jesse and Celine (the main characters) are probably the most complex and interesting pieces of dialogue that I have heard in a romance film. They don't just talk about how much they love each other or anything pointless, every conversation is a reflection of who they are as people. It is a reflection of how these two connect.The topics they discuss range from love, death, ambition, religion, to every idea that comes from these two. All with the beautiful backdrop of Vienna.The problems that I have with this film is the pace of the film as it goes on for a little too long and some of the conversations aren't as interesting as others or the dialogue just doesn't deliver. Only a few times however.The film is beautifully made not just in its setting but in its dialogue. There's a game that the two of them play in one scene when they are pretending to have a conversation with one of their friends talking about each other and it is one of these most romantic scenes in the movie. I know it might be a slight spoil of the movie but I just couldn't help talking about it! (*fan girls just a little*)Sorry guys but I think I am going to end this blog. Its getting way too long but I will post the other too movies too.Score: 8/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I don't think most people realise this ..,During the Q and A scene on the train it was one shot. That takes a lot of talent to keep the dialogue going for that long without cutting. Great job.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"In a word, boring","We were suckered into watching this film by the name positive reviews. It's your time, but understand what you're getting into. One long drawn-out conversation between two strangers. Nothing ever happens in this movie. There isn't one single moment of excitement or exhileration. The dialogue isn't even particularly interesting. The acting is pretty good. For that I'll give it 4 stars. It's a journey to nowhere.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Noble, romantic and full of life.","Still holding up nearly twenty years later, Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise is a mesmerizing film documenting a day in the life of two people with vastly different backgrounds who form some sort of connection on a train and explore that connection in Vienna. Though some plot contrivance is required for certain scenes to take place, this is more or less one of the most thoroughly realistic and relatable love stories ever put on celluloid.The key to this success lays of course in the dialog and the acting. At times it is hard to believe much of this was written, though by whom is a matter of contention. It has been reported that actors Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke contributed significantly to this screenplay though remained uncredited. Whoever did write this script clearly has insight and understanding into the human condition regarding feelings of isolation, loneliness, love, parental relationships and overall outlooks on life.Seeing this film nearly twenty years after its release, one cannot help but think about the countless films which have been influenced by its charm, grace and idealistic view of the possibility of connections people can make. It is a noble and enthralling work, an experience that certainly becomes richer and more understandable through multiple viewings. Even in this post-post-modern society we inhabit, which seems to become increasingly cynical and technologically obsessed, here is a film that acknowledges the romantic in all of us; a desire to remain innocent, in love and fully aware of one's deep connection with another human being, preferably of the opposite gender.",,Anonymous,Romance
Love is as short as this movie,"I have never been one to watch romantic movies, although I am a frustrated romantic, and I realized while watching this movie, because I really fell in love with the story of Jesse and Celine, and I wanted them to really end up together.At first I thought it was boring, there were no scenes of jealousy, they didn't worry about work, and it seemed that their lives were only summarized between the two of them and that night, and I realized that that's what the story is about; It is a frozen moment where the two escaped from their realities, put aside all kinds of worries and only thought about spending their night together in the most natural way possible, even Jesse himself says it at some point in the film; Love is an escape for 2 people who don't know how to be alone.After 100 minutes of constant dialogue, I realized that Jesse and Celine were communicating in the purest way, they were talking about topics so real and human that sometimes we feel ashamed to talk but that this is how you really get to know another person.We see a real connection, beyond the physical, Jesse and Celine's minds connected through strange and random conversations, just like those conversations you have at 3 in the morning.The most depressing and real thing about Before Sunrise is that love lasts as little as this movie, the protagonists themselves make it clear that in order not to ruin the magic of a ""Perfect Night"" they must leave everything up to that point, not meet again, not even call, or search, a very difficult decision that I would not have chosen.The philosophy behind this decision is that the more you get to know people, the more unbearable they become. Relationships are not immune to these patterns of behavior. In fact, the film begins with an argument between an adult couple, and changes to the First conversation between Jesse and Celine, it seemed to me to be something very similar to the cycle of life, but in this case it would be the cycle of relationships.We have all felt ""in love"" and we all know that this feeling dies only with disappointment and pain, we have felt helpless and alone, finding a real connection is so complicated, and although the movie does not answer most of the questions about relationships and Modern love, being in love or the false illusion of loving someone and feeling loved is one of the best things in life, and although my heart is hurt and my mind has a block towards everything that has to do with love, I would like to relive this emotion once again in my life.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
