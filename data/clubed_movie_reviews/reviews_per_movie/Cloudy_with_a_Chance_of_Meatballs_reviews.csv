"Surprisingly imaginative, original and very funny","Living in the UK, I had never heard of the children's book Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and to be honest, I thought it sounded a little too peculiar and odd for my tastes going by the title and trailers. However, being a big fan of animated movies, I decided to take the risk and judge the movie for myself; and I'm so glad I did.Not only does Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs have a quirky, thoughtful and imaginative storyline, it also exudes humour through its likable characters, discerning messages and vivid visual style. Telling the tale of a young man's quest to become an inventor, the film shies away from numerous Disney clichés creating a unique and original world full of colour and inspired characters. Unlike most Dreamworks animations, the characters are fully developed and rounded without the need for countless A-list celebrity voice-overs. The screenplay is similarly outstanding in terms of humour with countless laugh-out-loud moments that will appeal to both adults and children alike.The animation and visual style of the film isn't up to the stunning beauty of the latest Pixar movies such as Ratatouille or WALL-E but it certainly exudes a similar level of ingeniousness, creativity and originality as seen in such movies. Albeit, amongst the wild plot and genuinely hilarious dialogue lies a subtle moral tale of parental recognition, portion sizes and personal confidence.Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs took me by surprise, I went into the cinema expecting an average computer generated movie incomparable with today's best of the genre and came out astonished by the sheer creativity oozing from every aspect of the film.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not only does justice to the book but takes its own sweep of originality and charm,"Anyone involved with the elementary school world as at least heard of the Barret classic ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."" As a teacher, I was thrilled to learn it was to be made a movie. As usual, however, that leads to the problem of whether it would stick too much to the book to be entertaining for the screen or a Hollywood catastrophe that steals only the title?I know it's irritating to read from those book loyalists, but it's only a fair comparison. I felt this movie found a perfect balance of big-screen awesomeness and the charm of the book.For book enthusiasts, they pretty much had everything right. This film does indeed follow the plot of the book. Entire illustrations are recreated for the movie with stunning nods to Ron Barret's artwork. Then again, one must keep in mind that the book was an extremely general plot. The movie goes into detail, very much into detail, of what was going on in the town.We have the classic nerd, Flint Lockwood, a lovable and goofy character who embodies the wannabe coolness and social awkwardness and desperation of every social outcast. He's almost painful to watch, but I think it's what makes him so likable--you feel sorry for him. Anywho, in a desperate attempt to prove his worth to his father, he invents a machine that turns water into food. And hence the coming of the trademark weather of Swallow Falls (later renamed to Barrets' Chewandswallow).Honestly, I was surprised at the plot they got going out of this--while still maintaining the basics of the book. It had an ADHD spirit with wonderfully over-the-top characters. This will probably annoy many a soul, but I thought it a winning combination for those who can put up with it all. Really, you need the heart and mind of a child for this, but if you can summon those up, you will be impressed.I saw it in the normal format, but I'm sure it was an intense hoot in 3D. That might have been a bit much for me, but I'm sure the kids loved food flying at them. Regardless, the animation was stunning, combining a tribute to Ron Barret's amazing illustrations in background with pleasantly cartoony characters.This was much better than expected. It was creative, extremely fun, and paid reference to everything from ""Independence Day"" to ""The Twilight Zone"". You may need the heart and mind of a child for this, but if you can summon those up, you will be impressed.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sublimely Ridiculous,"From the title through every character right to the end this film is a roller-coaster ride of absolutely ridiculous fun that will have kids and adults alike doubled over with laughter. I personally nearly choked from laughing so hard at one particular point.What makes this movie so great is the characters...you can't go wrong with Bill Hader ever and Anna Faris I wouldn't be a fan of at all but she is cast completely out of character here and you would never guess it is her. The real entertainment lies in the support cast though. James Caan is outstanding as the father and Mr. T as the loving father and over enthusiastic local cop will have you in tears. Benjamin Bratt and Neil Patrick Harris didn't have much work to do with their characters but even with so few lines they are stars, particularly Steve the 'talking' monkey. There was one bit character that I found highly entertaining who had the best line in the whole thing when referring to hamburgers as tasting ""significantly better than sardines"".I would consider myself a bit of a movie buff and my leaning is very much toward the art-house. On a recent Saturday afternoon, I choose to take a risk and cross the sticky floor, trying to avoid stepping on one of the many screaming kids running around, my heart beating fast and hard with nervousness and anxiety that maybe this was a mistake. When the time came I casually donned my 3D glasses and 90minutes later with a pain in my side I wanted to go again... It's been an long time since that has happened!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Silly for Adults but also Funny and Entertaining,"In the small island of Swallow Falls, the outcast boy Flint Lockwood is a clumsy inventor encouraged by his mother. When the island is not capable of exporting the production of sardine, the fish becomes the basis of the alimentation of the locals that have to consume it all the times. Years later, Flint's mother dies and his skeptical father Tim Lockwood, who is an old fisherman that has a store that sells sardine, gives a partnership in his store and invites Flint to work with him. But Flint has just invented a food processor that converts water into food and decides to test the piece of equipment. However, he accidentally launches it to the space and begins to rain hamburgers and other food in the island. A television sends the trainee of the weather department Sam Sparks to cover the phenomenon and Flint becomes famous. However, the greedy and glutton Mayor Shelbourne overworks the machine and the food becomes a menace to the human race.""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is an animation silly for adults but also funny and entertaining. The satire with the world of destructive fast food loses the opportunity to give a message to children about the wrong type of food and prefers a naive and foolish story with a beautiful visual. But children will certainly love this movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Tá Chovendo Hamburguer"" (""It Is Raining Hamburguer"")",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A film by a lot of people,"An exuberant and quite entertaining little feature- Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs can feel a little too safe at times- but does anage to be quite an enjoyable ride. First off, the animation is very well developed, very original, and very easy to look at. From its popping colors and cartoon like expressions, it's a refreshing take on the often mimicked-like animation style so many people want to copy from brands like Pixar- and truly feels like its own thing. As for the plot and story of the film- it can be interesting- but it never really feels like it takes any leaps. Yes, it has some bold ideas, but even those ideas tend to play it safe from time to time. Its sense of humor also feels the same way, pure wackiness- which is very enjoyable to watch- but never made me laugh out loud like many other animated films i've come to love. Its soundtrack is very bright and cheery, and its score is surprisingly epic- and I would be lying if I said some of the themes used in this film wouldn't be stuck in my head until the next day. The voice cast is impressive and everyone does a really good job- my personal favorites being James Caan as Tim Lockwood and Bruce Campbell as the Mayor. It does seem to follow quite a few animated cliches, which i've honestly come to expect with these films, but nothing that ever truly weighs it down. In the end, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a fun and solid animated flick. It never wows or amazes like Toy Story or makes me crack up like Shrek, but it manages to be a decent watch and be pretty sweet in the end- and that is completely fine with me.My Rating: 6.8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic!,"It may be because I had insanely high expectations for this movie, but I thought it was GREAT. I admit, I had been excited for it since I saw the first trailer a few months ago. I went and saw it the day it came out in IMAX 3D, which was cooler in itself, with my sister. I'm fifteen and she's twenty: we were both cracking up the whole time. There were no 'filler' jokes, as many kid's films do today. No jokes with 'potty humor'. All jokes were in good taste and all genuinely funny. The whole script was insanely well written. Timing, pacing, everything was great. The animation was fantastic and really fit the film. The character designs were all original and cute. You could tell how much effort was put into this movie. And the cast! I watched the (adorable!) credits and was surprised! I'd thought I'd recognized that fool pitying officer. (: The whole cast did a terrific job. No complaints there.This is a fun, lighthearted film. I walked out of the theater feeling the best I'd felt in a long time. Great family film, great film to see with your friends, great film to see by yourself, great film all together. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Normally I love animated movies........,"I am a huge fan of animated movies. From 'Wall-E' to 'How to train your dragon' from 'Toy Story' to 'Finding Nemo' to (yes) 'Frozen'. I just love them. 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' is definitely not an animated movie I love or even like. One cliché after another. The absolutely unintelligent, stupid 'villains' there to hate without a real purpose (I'm not even sure how that is possible) just like the 'heroes' (who are not likable and couldn't produce an intelligent thought at all). In the middle of the movie I gave up and pressed 'forward' because at least I wanted to find out how the movie ended. The ending was just as useless as the rest of the movie. I did not enjoy the movie.",,Anonymous,Animation
It was crazier than I expected.,"In a small island, a protagnist invented a machine made it rain of food. At first, everyone seemed to be happy. But it went out of control and happened a large disaster!It was just happy kids movie, but was a bit terrible and crazy for me because I'm definitely an adult. In the first half, I smiled at pretty setting like rain of donuts and ice creams! But I didn't feel good like overstuffing myself! The reason was that I know how oily they are!
Pancakes, hotdogs, meatballs, cheeses, donuts and spaghetti. I feel like even only these scripts make my blood thick. So those images were tougher for me!
If I would exchange them to Japanese food, they might be chased by large rice balls, enjoy the pools made by soy soups, a castle of rice dumplings in a sweet sauce. Maybe the rain made by fermented soybeans and hijiki seaweed falls. It seems to be salty!I thought kids would enjoy watching it definitely because of overreaction. Particularly the long sequence a protagnist went toward his laboratory in the last was amazing!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"blown away, visually stunning and hilarious","I'm not a huge fan of animated features, or children's movies. My tastes usually gravitate towards (good) horror films, foreign films, and more artsy independent features. I saw Up, thought it was a really great animated feature, but would I see it again? Maybe if i was babysitting. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, however, blew me away! It had such vivid, sometimes surreal, almost PSYCHEDELIC qualities, that I found myself awestruck at what the creators of this film had come up with! There was so much color, and such an imaginative design quality to the film that I couldn't help being thrilled. I'd probably give this 8/10 for those qualities alone, but in my opinion, the best part of all were the characters! The comedy was seriously non-stop, and so over the top ridiculous at times I was completely laughing out loud. Mr. T as the security guard. Very entertaining and fun character. The talking monkey. The Guatemalan weather assistant/doctor/pilot/whatever else... HILARIOUS. baby brett? Oh man. The list goes on. I'm 28 years old, and while I often enjoy kind of sick, off the wall humor, I really found this to be a VERY funny movie. It's personally very refreshing to know that humor doesn't have to be R rated to be hilarious. It sounds ridiculous, but this is probably going up there on my favorite movies list, right next to the films of polanski, kubrick, argento, hennenlotter, and the coen brothers.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable Watch with a fun concept and colorful visuals.,"Fun visuals and an original concept makes it a fun watch for kids, comedy is a hit or miss. Some is great, some feels forced.

A Surprisenly Tasty Film,"Sony Pictures Animation have had mixed success in comparison to the more established studios like Pixar, Dreamworks and Blue Sky with their films coming out at the wrong time with Open Season opening after the glut of talking animal films and Surf's Up which opened after Happy Feet but with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, SPA has finally found a hit film, the animation is stunning especially the water and the food weather and unlike say, Shrek the look is cartoony but works in its favour, the voice actors are equally as good with Bill Hader as Flint, Mr T as Earl and Anna Faris as Sam but it's Steve the Monkey who steals the film. The story itself works very well expanding on the original book and while the second half lags a bit, overall I left the cinema both with a smile and hungry.If The Smurfs and Hotel Transylvania are half as good as Cloudy then Sony Pictures Animation will continue to thrive.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
As action packed as any more adult action movie,"There seems to be a trend in children's movies to borrow the intense action scenes from ""grown up"" action flicks and animate them. This film keeps up a frenetic pace. This is good for today's under 14 viewers who have been exposed in equal doses to blockbusters like Spiderman, Transformers, X-Men, and even the Die Hard movies as they are to ""cartoons"". The field has grown so that it's not only Pixar as the only game in town.My daughter wanted to see it because she remembered it as one of her favorite books that my mother read to her. But also, as she said, ""How can you make a feature length movie out a slim little book?"" I'm glad, actually, that I hadn't read the book first. I'm glad I didn't really see the trailers first. I'm glad because then I would have had preconceived notions. I did think, however, that it was going to be a silly movie that appealed to my daughter but was slight torture for me. I was pleasantly surprised that it was entertaining enough for me. What kept it from being rated higher for me were some, ""Ew, gross"" moments and some things I was surprised made it into a children's movie. It wasn't quite non-stop hilarious like ""Over the Hedge"", but I think they did make a true effort to appeal both to the kids and to the adults that would be bringing them.One thing the Barretts can be thanking this movie for is that, hopefully, their classic book will be flying off the shelves now. I know I went to the bookstore right after the movie to seek out and read the book the movie was based on. What is pleasant is that, surprisingly, a lot of the elements were retained in the movie, even the clever in-jokes that the book had, like the stores' names. Of course, A LOT of elements were added to flesh out the story but there were some elements I wish they would have added in like the followup story in the second book, in which they found a good use for all that food and the fantastical grandfather narrator.These days, all that matters is that at least one of us enjoys the movie. I hate when we sit through a turkey that neither of us enjoys.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Mediocre, sometimes just annoying","(Warning: This Review May Contain Spoilers) (It may also contain comments about the movie ) 5 out of 10 because while this movie is watchable, I will avoid watching it again.Most of the movie felt forced, like an amateur stand up comedian who's act is slowly dieing on stage. The movie was basically just a flashy tribute to the book on which it is based and the only things that draw's the viewers attention is the ability to see classic children's story come to life, and to see what it would be like for the weather to be made of food. Many of the jokes were repetitive to the point of annoyance, including the ""saying what I'm doing"" montages. The first one got a chuckle from me, but I thought ""well, that was okay, but I hope they don't try to do it again"". Unfortunately, they did. Most of the characters were unlovable, except for possibly the dad, who's inability to use technology or to express his emotions will inevitable get some sympathy from the audience. The main character and his 'love interest' were both shallow and annoying and showed no depth nor development of character. The only thing genuinely funny was hearing the monkey's thought-comments occasionally throughout the movie. The effect was somewhat reminiscent of GIR from Invader Zim, in the cute brainless robot monkey sort of way. Overall, it seems the only point of the plot was as excuse to visualize different forms of food-weather such as an Ice-cream Christmas and Spaghetti Tornado. Of course you might say this is the only point of the original book as well. I must admit, I am being a bit harsh as I was looking forward to this movie and was quite unimpressed. But this seems to be the trend with movies these days. Movies are a business and good writing doesn't sell tickets as well as flashy CGI.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
I want a Meatball...,"Based on the popular children's book Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Sony Pictures takes a stab at the Pixar dominated world of CGI animation. Despite some flaws in the narrative, it's a solid hit for the company.With the voice talents of Bill Hader, Anna Faris, and James Caan, this light-hearted comedy is well worth the watch. Perhaps it's too light. There's no deep powerful message to be learned that you haven't heard before. It's very aesthetically pleasing as some of the other animated films this year. The land of ice cream scene was especially appetizing. And there is a terrific love story at the core of the film. Flint (Hader) and Sam (Faris) are the cutest of cute in terms of geeks in love. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller were very clever in the execution in the beauty of their relationship despite being based on the book.Is this the Oscar frontrunner for Animated Feature film? Absolutely not. With Up, Coraline, and Ponyo so far ahead of the game, the film is quite forgettable when placed amongst other contenders. Give it a taste however, it'll satisfy the craving.***/****",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Kiddies will want to go back for seconds and thirds, parents will  find this first sitting just enough.","Sony Pictures Animation is slowly building up its resume. First there was surprise hit Monster House followed by the mediocre Open Season, then the solid Surf's Up and the straight-to-DVD Open Season 2. A couple of decent outings but definitely not much to boast about. Meatballs goes a small way in changing that for this new animation production company, but not as much as it should have.Raining food: what a wonderful premise. And it's made to order no less. Adapted from the novel of the same name, the first half of the movie opens up a terrific world that looks like ours but actually has limitless potential whilst the second half makes you wish the filmmakers exercised more control over the endless possibilities that were clearly available to them. There is a fairly consistent string of laughs across the 90 minutes however when it transitions from the little-movie-that-could to near superhero proportions at the hour mark it feels unnecessary, subsequently detracting from the end result.Flint is a likable protagonist thanks to Bill Hader's skillful voicing. At times when he could have easily become sooky or self-loathing, Hader's charisma ensures you never forget who you are rooting for. There are a range of hit-and-miss supporting players: Flint's love-interest Sam Sparks (Faris) is delightful, Mr T's energetic copper and Samberg's adult-baby are both humorous whilst Flint's father is over-dramatic, Campbell's Mayor is tedious and the pet monkey that can talk, Steve (Harris), outstays his welcome in a hurry.Thanks to the vibrancy of the animation and the high-concept story kiddies will surely want to go back for seconds and thirds, although parents will probably find this first sitting just enough.3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Possibly the funniest animated movie I've ever seen,"Just to set the record straight, I'm not a fan of most non-Disney Animation, non-Pixar animated films being released these days, and even my faith in the former was just recently renewed with last year's Bolt (which has topped Pulp Fiction as my personal favorite movie of all time). Sure, every once in a while, a brilliant piece such as Coraline will come along, but honestly, I find that to be one of the relatively few exceptions from this decade. So, with that said, I initially wasn't looking forward to seeing Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs. What further detracted from my excitement were the trailers, which led me to believe that the film was going to be strictly targeted towards children. Having just seen the film, though, I am happy to say that all of my fears were put to rest.Visually, this is perhaps one of the most spectacular animated movies I've ever seen, with literally every frame being a feast for the eyes. There were moments, especially throughout the movie's undeniably thrilling climax, in which my jaw just dropped in amazement. Not to throw in so much hyperbole, but this truly is one of the best animated films in terms of pure eye candy. While there's so much else in this movie to enjoy, the visuals alone make it worth the price of admission.The vocal performances in Cloudy are some of the most impressive ones I've heard in quite some time. Both Bill Hader and Anna Faris as Flint and Sam, respectively, capture the essence of these two socially-awkward, smarter-than-you-might-think type of characters perfectly. Overall, I felt these two characters had some real chemistry, and as a result, I thoroughly enjoyed watching their relationship evolve throughout the course of the film. Mr. T is also terrific as the city cop, Earl, delivering some of the most gut-bustingly hilarious lines in the entire film. With that said, this is quite possibly the funniest animated movie that I've ever seen. To put it simply, there were a couple of moments in which I literally thought that I was going to be ill.I walked out of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs with very much the same feeling as I did with '08's aforementioned Bolt: astonished by how mediocre I initially expected the film to be, and how enjoyable it actually ended up being. The only thing keeping this film from getting a 10/10 in my book is – even with the few scenes that managed to tug at my heartstrings - the lack of an emotional punch powerful enough to get me choked up. However, given the film's quirky nature, I view that as a mild complaint at best. Go see it, folks.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun and Well-Written,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was (thankfully) one of those films that both parents and children can enjoy. It contains both slapstick humour and more subtle satirical jokes. The writing is superb as is the directing. The animation, on the other hand is unremarkable and the voice-work was mediocre, as well. This is, however, overshadowed by a fantastic plot and great jokes.First of all, just because the people who do the voices are famous, does not mean they are necessarily good voice actors. With the exception of Mr. T, the acting ranges from mediocre to weak. This is really my only complaint and I think it's time we get back to actually hiring real voice-actors as opposed to random celebrities. Bill Hader did a rather poor job, I'm afraid.The story, however, is excellent, brilliantly expanding on the original book. The dialogue is funny and often very witty as well. There are very well-done dramatic scenes and also some very humorous ones. The film starts out strong and keeps the viewer interested. Slowly, as the problem with the food escalates, the film becomes darker and more emotional. The main romantic story is handled very well for a children's film and has a great (albeit not very original) theme of individuality. The film also incorporates Flint's conflict with his father in a clash of technology and old-fashioned values.The animation I am divided on. Unlike most films viewers, the visuals are of secondary importance to me. The directing was excellent and most of the animation was actually really good- that is, the setting, the background, the food etc. The only part of it that I disliked were the characters- I'm not sure why, but.... meh.I definitely recommend this film for both children and adults as it contains plenty of entertainment for both. Its flaws are steamrolled by an excellent script and great humour.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Prepare to get served,"Inspired by Ron and Judi Barrett's beloved children's book of the same name, CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS follows inventor Flint Lockwood and brainy weathergirl Sam Sparks as they attempt to discover why the rain in their small town has stopped while food is falling in its place. Meanwhile, lifelong bully Brent relishes in tormenting Flint just as he did when they were kids, and Mayor Shelbourne schemes to use Flint's latest invention--a device designed to improve everyone's lives--for his own personal gain.OK, I admit it. The trailer for this film looked average, compared to other animated flicks, especially the films from Pixar. I thought the film would be too kiddy for me and that the storyline was beyond lame. I mean, food falling from the sky doesn't draw people in, does it? Oh, how wrong I was. I think we just found the third contender for the best animated movie section in the Academy Awards, people! Not only is this much better than non-Pixar animated films that has been released in SOME time (I think the last was HAPPY FEET?), but it's also one of the most visceral, inventive, entertaining, ingenious, silly movies that I've seen this year! Oh, wait. This is the only one.I felt like a kid again when I put my 3D glasses on. Things popped out in a flashy fashion and the movie told in a quick pace with zippy dialogue! I wanted to grab the delicious-looking foods on the screen, from hotdogs to ice cream! It's like being a kid in a candy store! There's so much craziness here that I can't even dare to describe! When was it the first time that you saw a talking monkey that ripped a heart out from a live gummy bear?! When was it the first time that you saw a live turkey eating a human being?! Everything in this film is so ridiculous and preposterous that you have no choice but to go along with the rideThis is also a very, very funny film with a laugh per minute with some really clever jokes scattered throughout the film. But don't worry. There's a story in here too. It's been quite a while since I've seen a good father-and-son film (the last was FINDING NEMO?), but this film succeeded in that department as well. The message is by no means blatant and preachy at all. The cast is also a splendid delight, Mr. T standing out as one of the top characters because you can never really escape his noticeable voice. Bill Hader and Anna Faris did a wonderful job in their roles as well.Oh, and did I mention the film was a visual feast (no pun intended)? You will see things in here that you have NEVER seen and probably will never see again in any other film. This should automatically get you a ticket to the theaters because when are you ever going to see a talking monkey grabbing a heart out of a live gummy bear?! WHEN?! The 3D technology is near flawless. It's probably the best looking 3D I've ever seen, the image looking very sharp from background to foreground. I also found the score by Mark Mothersbaugh to be amazing and exceptionally memorable.If there's one bad thing I have to say about the movie, it isn't as good as Pixar's storytelling. However, CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS should be a movie you should watch in theaters because it's unlike any movie you have ever seen. There's a lot of ingenuity and inventiveness and cleverness that is warped around the movie. The film is entertaining for both the kids and the adults to enjoy, so there's no need to worry. But wow, was this film a spectacle. If you have the chance to see this in 3D, see it but I'm sure the 2D version works just as well. If you're iffy about the trailer, I guess that's a good thing because the movie surpasses the trailer by ten times. Prepare to get served...literally.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A hilarious and imaginatively entertaining animated movie.,"Although - as many people do - I generally prefer Pixar films to the animated fare created by other companies, I can't deny that a film like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is very hard not to love. Although it isn't particularly complex, thought-provoking, beautiful or masterful, it's a very entertaining, funny, cute-as-hell and effective animated film. Children with definitely love it, and adults... well, that actually depends on the adult in question. Although I certainly enjoy all kinds of movies, there's always - for me - some satisfaction to be had when watching something so obviously goofy and kiddy. Meatballs is kiddy, and that's precisely what I loved about it. It may not be this year's best animated movie - that honour goes to Pixar's Up - but it certainly is better than the likes of Monsters vs. Aliens.The film tells the story of Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader), a young inventor who dreams of, someday, creating something that will be loved by everyone and make him more popular and, most importantly, improve the lives of everyone in town. Unfortunately, he hasn't been able to do so, and his technofobic father (voice of James Caan) doesn't really help at all. One day, though, he manages to invent something that will change the lives of everyone in town forever: a machine that makes food fall from the sky. Everybody seems to be happy with him now - including mayor Shelbourne (Bruce Campbell) and the by-the-book police offer, Earl (Mr. T) - but, predictably enough, something goes wrong: excess amounts of food start to overload the island where the town is located, and now Flint, along with TV reporter Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) has to try to solve their problem.Yes, the plot is pretty predictable, and it certainly won't make anyone above the age of 5 be shocked with surprise or anything of the sort, but it certainly is very imaginative, and it should work in a very ""oh, it's sort of nice"" kind of way. I liked the way Flint was portrayed - Hader's wacky and not-so-recognizable voice is perfect for the character - and the fact that, although most characters are either archetypes or stereotypes - consider, for the example, Bruce Campbell's greedy and - eventually - obese mayor - they are all voice so professionally and characterized in such an naive and cute kind of way, that one just doesn't care. I rooted for Flint the whole way, and I actually thought that the romantic sub-plot between him and Sam was cute and funny.Visually, I don't think the movie is on par to the likes of Wall-E or Up, but I think that comparing it to those productions would be a bit unfair. Wall-E had a sort-of realistic kind of look, and Up, while a little more cartoonish, had a very realistic flair to it. On the other hand, there's something very old-fashioned in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' look and the way it is animated. Characters behave and move the way old TV cartoons behaved forty or more years ago, and I like that. They jump a lot, are very ""agile"" and are just... cartoonish. Clearly, the animators didn't want the movie to give a palpable sense of realism; in a way, they were trying to craft an old-fashioned cartoon with the latest technological tools, and they have done it very successfully.What else can I say about the movie? It certainly is very naive, and it doesn't explore any deep themes or moral problems, but that's just OK. While this year's mediocre Monsters vs. Aliens was terribly simplistic, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is just simple, and there's nothing wrong with that. Of course, there's nothing wrong with movies like Wall-E having very significant messages and complex love stories and such, but if a parent wants to go with their toddler to see a movie that isn't very complicated but that isn't stupid or boring either, then Meatballs is an excellent choice. After all, even if there isn't much beneath the surface, I can't imagine a single adult maintaining a straight face throughout the film's runningtime. The movie is hilarious, - just remember Flint's father's eyebrows! -, it's inventive, it's imaginative; it's also pretty gorgeous and it features some effective voice acting and interesting, wacky characters. It's not dumb and it doesn't pander to the least common denominator. Most interestingly, though, it made me hungry. That's not a quality many movies posses.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not just for kids,"Flint Lockwood lives on the island of Swallow Falls in the Atlantic Ocean. Swallow Falls relies on its sardine industry for survival but globally people are eating less sardines, shrinking the island's economy and forcing the inhabitants to live entirely off their sardine catch. Flint invents a machine that can manufacture food from water. After some teething problems it seems like it could be a winner. There are still some glitches though...A good animated comedy-drama. While it is clearly more a kids movie, it has its adult appeal too. Sweet, unpretentious and well written with some good adventures to keep the audience enthralled.Gets a bit too silly near the end, but that would be the only major negative.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A zany film with unbelievable characters,"There's nothing wrong with the animation, art design or production values of this animated feature. Nothing wrong with the arc of the main story either (structurally or morally), or with the voice acting.The reason I couldn't really get into it is that nobody acts like a real person; all the characters act like Hollywood stereotypes imagined by someone who doesn't actually have friends. It never feels like a single character in the film is actually real or has a soul, so it's hard to care about what's going on, aside from admiring it in the sense one might admire a roller coaster ride. A few days before I saw this, I watched the animated ""A Christmas Carol"" which came out the same year, and it is a great contrast; I could actually believe that the people in ""Christmas Carol"" were real and care about what happened to them, despite the ridiculous roller-coaster action sequences (which both films have).The other thing which bugged me is that nobody in ""Meatballs"" has to work hard to make something they want happen; they just have to really want it and then suddenly they can easily do it. Inventor builds multi-million dollar lab and inventions effortlessly (the complete polar opposite of what actual work in science is like). Fat guy (near the end) suddenly becomes martial arts master just because he really, really wants to and the plot requires it.It gives the wrong lesson about the value of work and discipline (namely, that one doesn't need them, that just to have a good idea is enough), but the primary fault is that it just made it hard for me to care about what was going on in the movie, particularly as none of the characters even felt relatable in the first place.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Likable Animated Film!,"This family friendly film is about an inventor who creates a machine to distribute food instead of water around the world. When the machine gets out of control, the world could be destroyed by an abundance of food. I did enjoy the film's super animation with its realistic people and settings. The colorfulness in the environment is well received. Anna Faris plays a likable weather forecaster. Bill Hader plays the voice of the inventor. The story is unrealistic but the film does manage to pull it off. I found the film weakest in the storyline and character development. I rarely recognized the voices of notable actors and actresses in their characters. Their characters were developed and their voices weren't necessary needed by A-list actors and actresses. The only two voices that mattered were Hader and Faris who did a stunning job in their roles. Their characters weren't developed enough though and the film's storyline is overshadowed by its poor development. For a family film, it is enjoyable all around. The effects are just stunning and the visuals are brilliant with colors.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A World Of Unlimited Fast Food,"What a wonderful movie to watch with your children. Based on a famous children's book 'Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs' is a charming and funny little film. For me its main strength was the characters. The characters are easy to relate to because all of them have their own insecurities and issues.They are portrayed as flawed humans rather than the perfect heroes. For example, Flint Lockwood lying about his peanut allergy to impress the girl, Sam Sparks dumbing herself down to make herself more likable, Tim Lockwood limiting his son's dream because he thinks Flint would have a more secure future if he worked at the store. At the same time the humour is plentiful to keep the viewer laughing. I liked the 'message' that the film tries to bring to kids: That too much of anything (in this case tasty food) is bad and to always be yourself (things that even some adults ought to apply). Perhaps in a subtle way, this film also portrays how fast-food is abundantly consumed in America and how the culture today is obsessed about it.The animation is vivacious and pleasantly colourful. The voice acting that includes Bill Hader, Anna Faris, James Caan, Benjamin Bratt and Lauren Graham is solid. I also enjoyed the references it made to other sci-fi movies and series like 'Independence Day', Armageddon', 'Men In Black' (these three are lesser movies in my opinion), 'The Twilight Zone' etc. 'Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs' is the sort of film that makes you become a child (in a good way) for 90 minutes. It's imaginative, it's hilarious, it's good eye candy, what's not to like?",,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, light, best seen in 3D","As a film, Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs is merely 90 minutes of harmless escapism. The animation is simple and most of the jokes are aimed at the 12-and-under crowd. Still, in IMAX 3D it's a fun ride. While most of the jokes are for kids, there are a handful aimed at tickling adults and there are some really silly sight-gags (enhanced by the 3D) anyone will enjoy. While the animation never reaches far, there is one spectacular scene involving a spaghetti-tornado that stand outs, especially in 3D. The thing that surprised me the most about this was the voice acting. Sure you've got known stars such as James Caan, Neil Patrick Harris, Andy Samdberg, Lauren Graham, Will Forte and Bruce Campbell lending their voices, but only Caan and Campbell really have characters with any substantial amount of dialog (I couldn't even tell you who Graham and Forte played). Mr. T, however, has some fine lines and his celebrity is used effectively as a throwaway joke. As for Bill Hader and Anna Faris, I was pleasantly surprised at how well their voices lend to animation. Hader has a nerdy-goofy voice that makes his character sound anywhere between 16 and 30 years old and he can twist it around between completely silly to awkward and sincere in a way that feels natural (for a cartoon at least). Faris, who to me has a more recognizable voice, is able to transcend that crutch that most celebrity-voice-overs have: she is able to make the character own the voice. Her ""Sam Sparks"" character looks and sounds like her own character. I rarely, if ever, had that nagging image in the back of my head of Anna Faris acting this role because her voice lends it self so wonderfully to the film. Faris' comedy relies heavily on her physical performance, and she doesn't hesitate in contorting her face in all manner of outrageous and silly expressions, yet her voice is also a major element in her work. Here, we get that beautiful voice but a character that doesn't act the same way physically. Sam Sparks' physicality is toned-down here, but Faris delivers silly, bizarre and delightfully off-center lines that keep her character unique and enjoyable.Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs isn't a must-see film by any means. If you do see it, see it in 3D, and enjoy Hader's and particularly Faris' voices.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as good as I had hoped,"I really wanted to see this movie. I really thought it would be cute and that my grandson would love it. But after seeing it all I can say is that it was okay. If started out extremely promising and the animation is really great. I really enjoyed the character of Flint, Steve and Flint's father. I really didn't get into the weather lady, Sam that much. I was enjoying the film until the last 30 minutes. Somewhere it got stupid and really slow. All I kept thinking was let's just get this over with, how much longer can they stretch this out. My grandson was getting as fidgety as I was. Then finally it redeemed itself partly with a okay ending. Too bad it was so uneven.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Superb animation, wonderful story","Truly great animation, with the expressions of the eyes reminiscent of anime. A story that is about the child within each of us, yet all the while considering the risks involved during the whole of life. This is a story about innocence, in the true meaning of ""knowing oneself completely"" and all that this implies. It is also a story very much about the importance of imagination and creativity.I am a child and an adult. What I've been taught, not entirely by just my fellow human beings, is that judgment is never productive. At its best, it is a desire to share with others something we do or do not appreciate. At its worst, it is a shutting down of the connection we have with each other. Perhaps a more productive way of sharing opinions about anything might be making distinctions between what is appreciated about the thing, and what is not, and the reasons for both aspects of these thoughts/feelings. This story actually addresses this tough issue, while entertaining us with a romp and a grand adventure.My appreciation of this film is that it inspires me to laugh at myself (it's quite funny), at us, and my culture. And all the while, it is kind. The story and animation are tremendously imaginative, a quality I've found missing in many stories, animated or not. One of the themes, if not the main thread of the story, is that we humans are creative beings, and that, while this involves risks, we must express our imagination or take the greater risk of becoming stuck, stale and static, living only in the past tense.The greatest compliment I can give this film is that I want my 2-year-old granddaughter to see it, for I am absolutely sure she will enjoy it almost as much as I have at age 61.Greg Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tasty,"'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' was a popular children's book in the 1970's. It has been adapted to the big screen in this animation feature.Swallow Falls, a small island in the Atlantic has only one thing to boast of: Sardines. With time, exports die out, people get bored of eating sardines all day long and despair settles on the town.Enter Flint Lockwood, a regular nerd with big dreams in his eyes, who has been trying to invent something useful since his childhood. He finally succeeds, inventing a machine that starts raining food from the sky. What happens after wards forms the crux of the story. The screenplay continues on the innovative theme in the story and bombards us with delectable food items falling from the sky, until greed settles in. How Flint resolves the situation that arises from this is handled pretty funnily.The visuals of 'Cloudy...' are different, unlike what we normally see in a Pixar movie. The food looks delicious, but that's just about it. The cast, led by Bill Hader and Anna Faris, does a good job. James Caan as Flint's father, and Bruce Campbell as the mayor are excellent.Final Verdict: 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' is a simple movie, uncomplicated by the regular 'deeper meaning of life' fundas of Pixar. Good for a home viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sunny with a chance of entertainment.,"'Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs' may as well be called the funniest animated film of the year, because I have never laughed as much as I did at an animated movie.Parents, I guarantee you that if you go see this movie with your kids, you will be in for one hilarious and exciting ride that makes this film almost as good as 'Up'.Flint Lockwood has been an inventor ever since he was a kid, but most of his inventions have been failures.He has made a walking television set, a lotion that can give you hair, and rat birds, which I claim to be rats and birds combined together.It then hits him.The whole town has been forced to eat nothing but sardines.Of course, nobody in the town of Swallow Falls enjoy sardines.There's also a heading in the newspaper that says sardines are gross.What if Flint can fix all of that? What if he can invent a machine that converts water into food? Well, he tries it and it actually works.Soon, everyone in Swallow Falls love Flint's invention.What's even better is that it will give you any food you want.Pizza, french fries, mashed potatoes, jello, ice cream, bacon, cheeseburgers, eggs, cheese, steak, olives, toast, donuts, and so on.Unfortantly for Swallow Falls, things get much worse.The food starts to get bigger and causes the town and everyone else in the world nothing but destruction and chaos.It's now up to Flint to save the day from what may be a food apocalypse.Me and my friend sat in our seats, laughed endlessly, and couldn't wait until the DVD came out.When it does, I'll be sure to get it on the first day.If not the first day, I'll be sure to get it and watch it over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs - 3.5 Stars,"""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is a treat for children and a torture for diabetics. There is so much food in this movie that the characters literally had to build a dam just to contain all of it. And that was just the leftovers.Flint Lockwood wants to become an inventor. He knows that the small island that he lives in needs his genius. But nobody wants to listen to his ideas because everything he creates either breaks something, or someone. But then, the island's economy fails, and its citizens are forced to eat nothing but slimy sardines. Flint becomes inspired, and he decides to construct a food-making machine whose name is never successfully pronounced in the entire film.This is where the fun begins. Flint's machine works! Literally, it is raining food. That one sentence is basically enough to describe ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs."" When that first cheeseburger fell from the sky, I knew that I was about to see things I have never seen before in a movie.

At 90 G-rated minutes, it's a wearisome barrage of clichés. The nerdy teen who triumphs after all is beyond shopworn. The hopeful but incompetent young lady might not be sexist if she weren't also such an embarrassing cliché.Animation: positive proof that full-scale computer animation doesn't add value by itself. Not an original image in the lot. The town cop is the only character drawing with wit. Hey: even Ice Age had the squirrel!Performances: routine Saturday morning level.

Condiment Complement,"This comment is on the IMAX 3D version.This is superficially another lame morality play, with a childishly simple set of coordinated arcs: temptations, love and family. It features inventiveness as the talent, and I suppose we should be thankful it isn't sports.But I found two things to really like about this, like enough to recommend it.The first is that of the IMAX 3d animated films, it is the first I recall that used the expanded dimensionality in a way that was natural. It expanded the cinematic vocabulary and wasn't gimmicky. A word about the balance: when you have something new, the first goal is to make it seem as if it were always there, I think. Only then can you start to exploit what it offers in communicative power. It has taken us years to get here. Pixar couldn't. WETA couldn't, nor any of the SKG projects. It took Sony, who may actually be developing some skills.I was impressed by how they handled space as a narrative device in their first production: ""Monster House."" Here, they simply enfold space as if you naturally were there, including emulating shots from many, many other movies — the ones we have seen so many times that we accept them as natural. Star Wars space navigation for instance.That takes me to the second really wonderful thing. The people who made this know and love movies. There are scores of direct references: obvious ones from space and alien movies of course. Nice, esoteric ones as well, like the passing reference to ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman."" There were as many of those as my mind could collect, probably one every couple minutes, every setup. But it seemed as well that even framing, lighting, color balance and movements of different kinds were references as well.We will have to wait for some clever entrepreneur to make a movie annotation site where you can enter a scene's framing and search the corpus of movies to see where it came from, possibly intuitively. But they are there. This is a cinephile's cartoon.The ""girl"" is a redhead of course. Of passing interest is the way that the acceptable shape of female bodies has evolved in this sort of manufactured world. Characters are an engineered mix of suppressing and exaggerating in some coordinated way, so that the backstory of the person can be read from the form of their body shape.In films made with living actresses, the form is in the motion, carriage, dance. Here it can literally be in the shape, those subtle movements still being beyond the technology. Here, she is all pelvis and thighs. Now this is no small matter because these simple forms will affect a whole generation of desires and the pattern of caresses. These forms matter, and it is remarkable that Sony has these skills.Watch them. Its exciting to see spatially cinematic competence. The jello scene must have been the first conceived. It is transcendent.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Animation
Pie from the Sky,"Positively hyperactive disaster movie parody with an unusually creepy underside to it. The gags and puns fly by faster than one can say ""giant banana"" and the excellent voice work is the icing on the cake.Unlike the best animated movies, the pic lacks a certain transcending magical quality - despite a few well-made tranquil moments, but the pace never flags and the predictably formulaic storyline is enhanced by the sheer exuberance of the whole likable enterprise that offers some wonderfully inventive moments.An immensely entertaining if not too memorable culinary roller-coaster ride.7 out of 10 spray-on shoes",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cloudy With A Chance Of Awesomness,"Firstly I have been more a fan of animated movies more recently probably due to having a child (saw Aliens Vs Monsters 100+ Times). So when I saw the trailer for this movie my daughter was instantly hooked so we took ourselves to the 3D version at our local cinema.Now to the movie, it has everything you would expect from an animation, great characters, great story and plenty of laughs. The stand out from this movie is the story itself, the idea a machine invented by a quirky inventor to produce mass food from the sky is highly imaginative. Mix that with a host of excellent and funny characters played by a talented cast (Mr T being the scene stealer for me) and you have an excellent animation that can compete with the likes of Pixars UP.I would highly recommend even if you don't have kids, there is a mix of humour that would appeal to both adults & children. It gets my vote any day.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ordinary Fun,"I've been always impressed how animated films spent their bucks and efforts having those fingertips work and mind squeezed with ideas that would induce viewers to new level of sensation. Since I saw recently Up, Kung Fu Panda, Ratatouille, Wall-E and Bolt, I got fascinated how animated films nowadays revolutionize compared to early ones (such us Finding Nemo, A Bugs Life, Shark's Tale and more). Films such as these are at the outset, being fit for anyone of any age. Too much with the intro the film is full of creativity. However I guess the original creativity wasn't materialized with such extent when it was materialized into an animated film. The storyline was thin, easily understandable but the characters were somewhat fascinatingly mediocre. I don't find it absolutely amusing how the characters developed and interact with each one. Take the case of Lock Flintwood with other characters such as the police guy, the weather girl and his father. It seems his existence is a joke, but I guess anyone watching this wouldn't feel that deeply because the film in the first place is meant to be like this. At any rate probably my mood wasn't at full scale to appreciate the film well. Nevertheless their creativity was fun and considerably ingenious. You got to see giant pancakes whalloping the whole school topped with butter and drizzled with syrup. The characters also just funnily, whimsically or unimaginably coast through the scene with less regard to how they actually did it. Like Flintwood for example, hopping and flying unscathed when he got sucked in the spaghetti whirlwind. But you wouldn't bother anyway how he did that, because this is in the first place an animated film not meant to crush reality just to flaunt entertainment. But I guess the film fails to clearly deliver its inner layer of lessons and values (to children specially) even to adults (because the rest of the film, I believe disinterests them to appreciate what the film is all about, you get amused by the food, the characters' odd characters). The bottom line its totally ordinary fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very funny,"No seriously, it is very funny. There might be quite a few flaws with the script/idea behind it all, but the movie is moving along so quick you won't even notice them. And the voice cast assembled here? Just amazing! And getting ""Mr. T"" of A-Team fame doing the voice of a cop, is just one of the greatest ideas ever!It's also very well written (within its premise that is of course) and has quite a few great moments. It's target audience is the younger audience (which is especially apparent when love comes into play), but does have quite some treats for the ""older"" audience members too.

Raining food quirky guy romcom,"This is a fun movie based on a kids book that I read before the movie actually was even thought of as a thing. It's a very unique concept, I love the world building they did and how they rationalize some of the incredibly unreal things that happen that could easily trick a kid.The execution of this concept was done really well, there is great comedy pieces and the pacing is very nice. They definitely had to rush some parts and make a whole month feel like 5 minutes, but other than that they did a tremendous job.Who did a good job acting wise? So many of the characters in this movie are just straight memes, like manny, and baby Brent, and earl but personally the person that I think did a really good job is Mr Lockwood, Flints dad. He does his part so well and there is a perfect balance of father and fisherman/boring guy.The only emotional part that comes to Mind is how much flint is made fun of, it's sad but that's about it, there is also some awe factor throughout the movie that's really cool.Cinematography and music is great, my favorite shot is gonna have to be when they look at the clouds the first time around. Also the part with the ice cream on people's houses is really cool. The editing is good as well, I loved the different aspect ratios for old things and anytime it showed the ""weather"" channel thing. Super cool.The main themes of this movie is selfishness and a need of fame in a negative light, I think it's a very good thing, you let fame get in the way of your morals. Cool that this movie hits of that.Watching this movie more than once won't change anything but it will still be very funny.Super fun movie!

I wonder what title a foodie would give it,"I remember reading ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" when I was little. Obviously it was impossible not to find cool the idea of a place where food rains from the sky (at the very least, no one would ever go hungry).The movie version is a loose adaptation, the same way that the movie version of ""Jumanji"" is. On the one hand, the animation's a little over-the-top (a hyperactive zigzag). Even so, it has a clever plot; it reminded me a bit of Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and one scene even looked like a famous episode of ""The Twilight Zone"".Not a masterpiece but worth seeing. With a cast of Anna Faris, James Caan, Bruce Campbell, Neil Patrick Harris, Mr. T, Lauren Graham, Bill Hader, Andy Samberg, Will Forte, Benjamin Bratt and Ariel Winter, the movie is a link between ""Scary Movie"", ""The Godfather"", ""Evil Dead"", ""Doogie Howser"", ""The A-Team"", ""Gilmore Girls"", ""Saturday Night Live"" (thrice) and ""Modern Family"" (twice).As for the title that a foodie would give the movie, it would probably be something like ""Cloudy with a Chance of Hummus/Injera/Sag Paneer/Tamales"".",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Funny and imaginative with incredible visuals,"As a huge fan of animated films, I actually really enjoyed this film, same with the rest of my family, and this is coming from someone who has no knowledge of the book really. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is funny and imaginative with a lot going for it.The animation itself is absolutely incredible. The colours are superb, the backgrounds are lush and the characters are well-modelled. The best of the visuals is the one with the spaghetti tornado, utterly jaw-dropping in every sense of the word. The score is quirky and fun, with a nice end credits song, while the story is very original and imaginative. The script is another strength, so many funny moments without feeling too much.The voice acting is wonderful, bringing to life characters that are appealing, charming and quirky. Bill Hader does a great job as the eccentric Flint, while Anna Farris is wonderful as bubbly Sam. James Caan is good also as Flint's father and Bruce Campbell is a great surprise as the mayor who swells as a consequence of eating the falling food. My only complaints are the pacing;some scenes felt rushed so we weren't given as much time as we would've liked to breathe while some towards the end dragged, and the repetition of ""I love you son"" and such got a tad too mushy.

Who would've thought that food falling from the sky would be such a conflict when malnutrition is alive and well?,"Family-fantasy flick (with touches of science-fiction) about a wannabe-inventor's (Hader) successful creation of converting water into food and being on an island where sardines is the base of the economy, the clumsy protagonist quickly becomes a hero until the gluttonous and egotistical mayor (Campbell) takes advantage of the device. Lots of laughs for all members of the family; very visual, with a few moments of pretty computer-animated scenery; never a dull moment; and great casting. Mr. T, as the town's athletic cop (with an exact opposite hairstyle as the actor), couldn't have been voiced better by anyone else.

Pretty funny and entertaining movie,Plus it has Mr T in it sooooo it's got that going for it. I was happy with this movie as the animation style made it look like it was going to be lower quality than what I was expecting but there were some decent actors doing voice work on this that it pulled it together nicely.The plot is wacky and something I don't think I have seen before so that was cool to see. The humor was great it was so crazy that kids won't get it but funny enough that adults wouldn't have a problem sitting through this movie and actually enjoying it.I would recommend this one for family watching or if you just like animated movies.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs deliciously makes for a three-course animated meal.,"Sitting. Thinking. Noting. Researching. Motivating. Reviewing! Lettuce take the thyme to digest the cheesy grate-ness that sub-lime-ly makes time fries at an up-beet pace. Tackling two relation-chip dynamics with clumsy scientist Flint Lockwood, an un-raisin-able son wanting to become an inventor and his less than grilled father who wants him to relish in assisting at the family tackle shop, with the other being two friendly loafers whom share the same loaf for celery-brating all things science. Leaving plenty of mushroom for Flint's latest invention, a diatonic super mutating dynamic food replicator, going bananas and dipping the townsfolk of Swallow Falls in a weathering pickle. ""You have seen a meteor shower, but you have never seen a shower meatier than this"", meteorologist Sam Sparks, and main love interest, reports as juicy hamburgers descend from the sky. Flint must savour the world before it's caked with viscous syrup. Bon appetite! Orange you glad corny food puns were used to desc-rye-be the feature's plot? It was hard wok!Anyway, Lord and Miller's directorial debut, an adaptation of Barrett's children's book, is a colourfully inventive animation that balances its diet of fast-paced action, witty sight humour and heartfelt familial reconciliation. The screenplay on offer showcases the energetic buoyancy that cements Lord and Miller's talent as capable screenwriters. Not all the jokes land with grace. For example the constant inclusion of ""Baby"" Brent, the town's former mascot for sardines, was nothing more than dim-witted slapstick humour. Conversely, the characterisations and mannerisms of Lockwood, his sugar-addicted pet monkey Steve, Sparks, athletic officer Earl and the greedy mayor, all host a wide array of memorability to them. Whether it be participating in an ice cream snowball fight, literally obliterating all of the neighbours on a rampage, or Flint frustratingly trying to navigate his technophobic dad around a desktop to send a simple email with an attachment.The vast majority of scenes, whilst moderately zestful as children slowly develop diabetes as they constantly digest jelly beans and chocolate cake, impact towards the central character development of Flint and the fractured relationship with his father. As unsuccessful as Flint's inventions are, he believes he owes it to his deceased mother to pursue his lifelong ambition, forever determined to become the best of the best. His fisherman father, concerned about change and the welfare of his son, never expresses his belief. Therefore, there's a communicative breakdown that is only emphasised by Earl's eternal love for his son Cal. Putting aside the gigantic steaks and mustard-covered hot dogs falling from the suspiciously ominous clouds above, this story is about familial appreciation. No matter the end result. Lord and Miller consistently revert to this central theme through several scenes of sincerity. The barrage of fishing puns to accentuate that malfunction in communication between them. Transforming a relatively inevitable conclusion into a transcendental explosion of love.Spaghetti tornados launching meatballs and a colossal avalanche of leftovers could not replace that poignant sentiment. Naturally, the food meteorology acts as an exercise in creative animation, granting the feature a personality of its own. Its style incredibly digestible, yet pleasantly tasty to glance at. Whilst the character models were somewhat simplistic in comparison, the animation remained vividly colourful and fluid throughout, with plenty of attentive detail for the backdrops. Food is constantly raining down, subconsciously forcing viewers to examine the entire frame to see what tasty item has descended onto the town.Voice acting was appetising, with Hader and Faris commanding the cast through precise dialogue execution. Faris especially, digesting a burger and exclaiming ""I love it"", challenging such method actors including Bale and Day-Lewis. In all seriousness, she was succulent. Mr. T shouting ""Flint Lockwood"" never fails to conjure smiles, as does Bratt's Guatemalan committed line ""he is in...a food coma"". Samberg was the rotten egg of the bunch, shouting the vast majority of his dialogue with no expression or range.The anchoring father relationship powers the narrative, unfortunately Flint's love interest with Sam, more often than not, overwhelms the former bond with forced development that diminishes the fragility with his father. The jelly castle distraction being an acute example of this. Removing the adoration between them would've centralised Lord and Miller's direction with Flint's father, creating a banquet rather than a main course.Still, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs digests its source material and spits out an inventive animation boasting with aesthetic originality and developed characters that will have you screaming for more ice cream. The chest hairs weren't always tingling, but the sumptuous aftertaste was worth it, leaving you hungry for more.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Soufflé of a Film,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (PG, 1:30) — SF, 2nd string, original, OSIT romanticsAs Edmund Gwenn, best known for his role as Kris Kringle in Miracle on 34th Street, lay on his deathbed, a sorrowing visitor sympathized that dying must be hard. ""No,"" replied Gwenn, ""dying is easy; comedy is hard!""So too with trying to get any respect for comedy in movies. Take Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, for instance. It's a constant delight, chock-full of visual and verbal humor, but because it's (a) animated, (b) skiffy, and (c) not intended to be a (here lower voice an octave) ""serious work"", nobody will take it seriously. Too dang bad! A soufflé may be light, fluffy, and not very filling, but it too is tasty and requires careful attention to keep it from being ruined.The plot premise (based on the book by Judi and Ron Barrett) is slight: wacky tinkerer invents machine that makes food from water vapor. That would be Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader), and the food-making machine with the unpronounceable acronym is just the latest in a long line of gadgets, gimmicks, and goo he's been dreaming up since he was a little kid with a wall full of Tesla posters and a supportive mom.The movie starts with the question ""Have you ever felt that you were a little different?"", ostensibly referring to Flint but inescapably hooking all the guy geeks in the audience. Not long afterward, the gal geeks get their role model in the form of Sam Sparks (Anna Faris, world's best sport from the various Scary Movies), intern for the Weather News Network who's been hiding her brains beneath a bimbette facade. In a conventional movie, the mousy little office assistant would take off her glasses, let down her hair, be transformed into, say, Maureen O'Hara, and win the heart of the guy. Here it's done in reverse, as Sam puts on big googly glasses, does her hair up in a ponytail, and lets her intellect shine thru, thereby winning the hearts of Flint and all the nerds like me.The island community of Swallow Falls (hidden behind the ""A"" in Atlantic) has fallen on hard times, as demand for its primary product, sardines, has fallen off with global realization that sardines are, well, gross. The town, led by ambitious and semi-scrupulous Mayor Shelbourne (Bruce Campbell), is trying to reinvent itself as a destination for sardine tourism and has enlisted its poster boy, Baby Brent, the Gerber's icon of sardines, to help cut the ribbon on Sardine Land — except that Brent (Andy Samberg) is now a hulking, narcissistic playboy. Nonetheless, things are going OK until Flint takes advantage of the occasion to plug his foodmaker into the town's bazillion-gigajoule power station and ends up rocketing thru the festivities, trailing calamity and disapproval in his wake, until the machine shoots off into the stratosphere, leaving Flint nervously facing a galaxy of lowered eyebrows.His gruff dad, Tim (James Caan), suggests that maybe the inventor thing isn't working out all that well and that Flint should settle in as the junior partner in the family sardine bait and tackle business. And our lad seems resigned to that fate ... until food starts falling from the sky and he becomes (temporarily) the town hero. But the food keeps falling. And it's getting bigger. Oh-oh.OK, some quick stuff. There are ratbirds. Steve the monkey speaks English but thinks only monkey thots, particularly about Gummi Bears. Flint has the world's best-developed treehouse. It contains the master control for the foodmaker, including a seldom-consulted Dangeometer. Sam has a serious peanut allergy. Manny the Guatemalan surgeon/pilot/engineer is humble and taciturn but the most competent immigrant in world history. Unwarranted optimism abounds, as embodied in the phrase ""This probably won't explode."" Mr. T gets a paycheck. And I haven't even touched on the solution to the world's greatest problem: untied shoelaces.It's in Imax and 3-D. Are they worth the extra price? For something as much fun as this, why stint? (I'm sure Mayor Shelbourne would agree.) Comedy may be hard, but when it really works, enjoying it is easy.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie is very strange,Very strange movie because of its whole plot and it is unusual for animated movies .

Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs: A Fun and Quirky Movie with Some Shortcomings,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was a movie I watched as a child in 2009, and I remember finding it enjoyable. The movie had a unique concept of food raining from the sky and delivered some excellent laughs through its quirky characters and their antics. The animation was bright and colorful, which added to the movie's overall appeal. However, looking back on it years later, it wasn't the most memorable movie I've seen. It lacked a certain depth and emotional resonance that some of my favorite movies have had. While it had moments of humor and charm, it could have lived up to my expectations regarding storytelling. It was a decent movie for its target audience but didn't have the lasting impact that some other films have had on me.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

He finally got a break when he invented a machine that turned water into food. This was like manna from the heavens to the town of Swallow Falls who's only commodity was sardines. Like sardines, the town was gray and distasteful. When older Flint (voiced by Bill Hader) stumbled upon his food machine it transformed the entire town.""Cloud"" was funny and creative.

What's even better is that it will give you any food you want. Pizza, french fries, mashed potatoes, jello, ice cream, bacon, cheeseburgers, eggs, cheese, steak, olives, toast, donuts, and so on. Unfortantly for Swallow Falls, things get much worse. The food starts to get bigger and causes the town and everyone else in the world nothing but destruction and chaos.

"Exceptionally clever, goofy, food-falling fun","""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is about the closest any major CGI animation studio has come to a classic cartoon done in a modern style. It would appear that somewhere between ""Looney Tunes"" and Pixar's ""Up"" that animation has lost a bit of its rule-bending nature. Phil Lord and Chris Miller, co-executive producers of CBS comedy ""How I Met Your Mother"" and the short-lived cult favorite ""Clone High"" have restored that sense of abstract physical humor in Judi and Ron Barrett's book while infusing it with a modern sense of humor.You know what I'm talking about: the old cartoons where a TNT explosion or a gunshot would would merely blow all the fur or feathers off (temporarily) of a character. ""Meatballs"" isn't that old school, but at one point, our narrator, the fearlessly crazy inventor Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader of ""SNL"") is hiding off the side of a dock after ruining his hometown's big celebration with a presumably failed invention meant to turn water into food. His eventual love interest Sam (Anna Faris) walks to the pier, sits down and accidentally slams her heels into his mega-sized eyeballs. It's the good old concept of animated films being aware of their fictional fantasy world and not being so transfixed on creating realism, which many animated features have in this computer age.Sony Pictures Animation has only continued to get better, with their last film, ""Surf's Up,"" being on the more fun and wacky side for animated features as well. ""Meatballs"" continues that idea with exaggerated characteristics like bug-eyes on all the characters and general silliness, but the writing is what ties it all together and really nicely.When we're first introduced to Flint, we get to see his many inventions that have gone wrong. But rather than make it just a fun one-minute bit, it's a recurring joke throughout the film. The flying ratbirds that he invents pop up countless times throughout the film and his monkey sidekick named Steve with a thought translator strapped onto his chest gets laughs 80 percent of the time, partly thanks to ""How I Met Your Mother"" friend Neil Patrick Harris.The story is an important one too, of a wild inventor chasing his dreams, trying to make a difference so that people will love him and dealing with the fame of being a town hero once his machine manages to suck atmospheric moisture and cause it to rain any food imaginable. But also, as we see early but the kiddies will learn later, he's really out to earn the approval of his sardine-grinding father (James Caan) who we tell cares but can't say it in any way other than elaborate fishing metaphors. Then there's that being true to who you are stuff, represented by Sam's shame at growing up a meteorology dork with glasses and a scrunchy.Like every kids film, the shenanigans have a wear-down point, but ""Meatballs"" is layered with subtle jokes kids won't catch (but that aren't inappropriate either -- a real surprise) that teenagers and adults will really appreciate. In terms of humor, the writing compares favorably with the ""Up"" script from earlier in 2009 though certainly as a story ""Meatballs"" is much more cartoon-traditional.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""I've never been in a snowball fight before. Like, is there a point system or... a fight to the death."" - Flint","When his town is devoid of any food other than sardines, a young inventor creates a device that makes food rain from the skies.I have seen Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 and didn't think much of it so when sitting down to watch the original I wasn't expecting much. However, I am happy to report this is a much better film that its sequel. In saying that, it is very similar to the sequel (surprise) but there is so much more focus on character development and plot. That's what really sets the two apart for me - the sequel is much more focused on humour and fancy CGI at the expense of everything else. I was surprised at how much emotion is in this film, it's not the most heart wrenching I've seen but it does well highlighting the struggle of seeking parental approval (from both sides) and the importance of being yourself. The voice cast assembled here is great, Bill Hader, Andy Samberg, Anna Faris, Bruce Campbell and my personal favourite as I wasn't expecting him - Mr. T! One of my favourite scenes is the giant jello castle - it's very original, great use of colour and the entire sequence features some funny, poignant dialouge between the two lead characters, although it's not that noticeable to start with so you really have to pay attention to get all the little jokes both visually and spoken.Final Verdict: I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I am not familiar with the book yet i still I enjoyed it's bright colors, simple to follow story, terrific voice acting, decent 3D and surprisingly emotional relationships between characters. The humour isn't laugh out loud but it's original and plenty fun enough for both adults and kids to enjoy. Highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was another fine computer animated treat,"As many of you reading my comments can attest, I love animation. So with that said, you probably won't be surprised when I say I loved Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs! What a wonderful premise of having a town called Swallow Falls, which mostly has been left behind with just sardines as food for the townspeople, and having the inventor who previously was mocked invent something that provides alternative food choices at a drop from the sky. Good voice is provided by such ""SNL"" cast members as Andy Samberg, Will Forte, and as the inventor, Bill Hader. Anna Faris voices the weatherperson who follows the town's progress. And, in a wonderful surprise, Mr. T is the policeman whose son gets a special gift from Hader's scientist. Also cast are Neil Patrick Harris, Benjamin Bratt, and as Hader's father, James Caan. Gags flow smoothly from sequence to sequence with no distracting pop culture references, like that of the last Shrek movie. While hilarious, it's also touching near the end. Oh, and it's always a treat when the Columbia Torch Lady gets a humorous treatment at the beginning...",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Keeps the core appeal of the original book, while expanding in all the right areas.","In the obscure Atlantic Island town of Swallow Falls, the town exists in a grey flavorless slump having once been an exporter of Sardines before the entire world decided they hated them leaving the town of Swallow Falls with a glut of unsellable sardines that are now their primary food source. Struggling inventor, Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), tries to bring life to the dour town through an invention that turns water into any food imaginable. While the plan initially backfires damaging a pricy Sardine based tourist trap and ruining what was supposed to be the big break for Weather Network intern turned reporter Sam Sparks (Anna Faris), Flint's machine eventually becomes stuck in the stratosphere fueling itself on water vapor from clouds and causing food related weather patterns. The food weather turns Swallow Falls into an international sensation with Swallow Falls' power hungry mayor (Bruce Campbell) capitalizing on the attention and remaining the town to Chewandswallow. While the town's denizen's are excited at the prospects, Flint's father, Tim (James Caan), is more reserved with concern towards the increasing larger pieces of food falling to Earth. With more and more food requests coming through things eventually spiral out of control and now Flint must find a way to turn off the machine before it unleashes a food hurricane upon the world.Based on the 1978 children's book of the same name by Ron and Judi Barrett, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs had been in development since 2003 announced as part of Sony Pictures Animation initial slate. The movie's development cycle was rather tumultuous with original directors, Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi dropping out of the production, and replacements Phil Lord and Christopher Miller being hired, fired, hired again, and nearly re-fired following disappointment from Sony Pictures head Amy Pascal's disappointment with the story in the animatics. Luckily, the experience ended well for all concerned with Lord and Miller jump starting their careers to bona fide success after only achieving niche appeal with the short lived animated series Clone High, and the experience with Amy Pascal helped the duo refine their work becoming creative forces they are today. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs takes a fairly thin children's book and does a good job brining the world of Chew and Swallow to life, keeping the book's iconic charms while adding the duo's comedic style and delivery.Bill Hader is fantastic in his first outing in a lead role and show's he has the charisma and energy to carry a feature film. Hader had made a name for himself showing up in supporting roles in Judd Apatow comedies like Superbad and Forgetting Sarah Marshall and he brings his comic energy to voice acting creating a quirky inventor character we love to root for. Anna Faris is also a lot of fun playing aspiring Weather reporter Sam Sparks and both Faris and Hader have a natural comic energy that comes through quite well and works well at playing the two off each other. Aside from our leads, the movie also provides us an eclectic supporting cast with the most seemingly random collection of actors you could think of. James Caan plays Flint's father, Tim, an old fashioned technophobe who speaks primarily in fishing metaphors and wants to have a relationship with his son despite a gap in understanding and/or interests, Bruce Campbell has fun playing a gluttonous greedy mayor who's basically like an even more irresponsible version of Murray Hamilton's mayor from Jaws, but the standout by far is Mr. T as Earl: Chewandswallow/Swallow Falls' one and only police officer who takes his job overly serious with even crimes such as jaywalking or littering resulting in an unleashing of Mr. T's longwinded verbal takedowns.The film's story is pretty close to the book (save for the bedtime story framing device) and incorporates several moments from the book such as a pancake forcing a school closure, or a spaghetti and meatball tornado. The movie provides an original story for the food weather with Flint's invention serving as the impetus, and then the movie runs with this approach basically turning into a parody of disaster film's such as Day After Tomorrow, Dante's Peak, and many others. It's a really clever way of expanding the book's narrative, keeping the same overall structure but adding more meat to the proceedings. The plot while simple still has a lot on its mind as it builds itself upon its characters and humor and luckily it has both of those to spare. Lord and Miller are well known for their humor with lots of rapid fire pacing and longform payoff jokes that start as simple gags but build upon themselves as they go about in the background. One gag involving a walking TV in particular is incredibly well done with a gag that had me rolling with laughter. The movie's third act does get a bit more bombastic than I would have liked in the third act with some developments in the food device that seemed almost like they came out of nowhere and felt like an excuse to play up the 3D aspects, but aside from an overly busy final act The movie keeps the humor rolling with good pacing and delivery with plenty of heart and humor to spare.Miller and Lord make a strong debut in their first feature film brining to life the book's original premise and using it as a foundation to build upon rather than fitting a square peg in a round hole. The movie's cast is very well directed and comes through with lovable defined personalities and the creativity on display with the humor and visuals brings the absurd concept to life with a sense of fun. The movie works well as a riff on disaster movie tropes without going overboard, and while the third act gets a bit messy for my taste it's still a very strong film firing on all cylinders.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

On Par With Pixar,"I feel I need to make a comment, simply to dispute FordPrefect-42's completely inaccurate portrayal of this film. I can't imagine what pedestal of animation quality he holds to other films and what films those are if he considers CWACOM only ""simple"" animation? I saw the film with about 20 animators, all from major studios, in their 20's and 30's and everyone absolutely loved the film and raved about it. I've worked in animation for 12 years and I'm happy to see that someone else is finally making films equally as good as any Pixar movies. The film was engrossing from beginning to end. The script was excellent, the voice acting was fantastic, the animation was great, and it was highly inventive and creative. It was clever, all the characters were highly likable, and I laughed out loud at least 3 times, which, I almost never do. I absolutely love this movie and rank it up there with my Pixar faves, along with Iron Giant. You can tell that a lot of love and care went into this film as opposed to the typical studio, churn out, beat something to death and market the crap out of something. And very few studios do that anymore, other than Pixar and some smaller indie productions. It's all about the big money machine rather than letting artists and creatives do what they do best, which is sad and a shame. There is a reason why Pixar and TV animation studios like Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon deliver over and over again. And that is because they trust the artists and animation professionals to do their job that they're trained to do and don't try to tamper with the creative process by throwing executives with zero creative or animation experience into the mix. Their is no better way to kill a film or show than let a team of creative execs. with no writing experience write the outline for the project. Cough...Disney. Get a clue people. Having a studio exec. with a law degree tell an animator with $150,000 animation education what he should be doing is a recipe for a heartless pile of crud. Hopefully, with success like Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs, execs will finally realize that animators other than Pixar actually know what they're doing and release their choke hold that has been killing the life out of any good animation for the past 15 years.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A fair cut above the average animated family flick,","""Sony Pictures Animation Presents A Film By... A Lot Of People""That's all the opening credits of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs say. And for me, it forebodes that the next 90 minutes won't be bland, cheesy schmaltz that's all the rage in animated films nowadays, both CGI and non-CGI. It predicts a movie which will be fairly witty, which, despite being nothing new in animated films, is a far more refreshing approach than the company's earlier films Open Season and Monster House.Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), is a young mad scientist who lives in a small island, famous for its sardines and lack of any other food, which makes a bit of money off tourism. Flint is aching to invent some sort of scientific breakthrough that will save his town. He manages to create a machine that converts water into food, but once he accidentally flies the machine into the sky, it begins sucking water from the clouds and produces... well, raining cheeseburgers. From then on, Flint becomes a sensation is his town (thanks to the greedy town mayor, voiced by Bruce Campbell), but cracks begin to show when the food starts getting bigger...Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs turns out to be not only witty, but also intelligent and self-aware, and at times rather touching. There are some predictable jokes and degrading factors (like the pet monkey Steve, who has no purpose to the film other than standing around and being cute), but on the whole the jokes are very well thought out and cleverly executed, and the characters mostly come off as likable too. There are some nice choices for the voice actors (Mr. T has a refreshing turn as the over-the-top police officer and Bruce Campbell is amusing as the horrid mayor), and the characters themselves are pretty likable too.The animation is great; the huge food really does look good enough to eat; they really do get all the textures right. It's impossible to leave the film without your mouth watering. Anyone who has just finished eating a full all-you-can-eat buffet I'd advise not to watch. Chances are you'll either vomit or force yourself to eat more... and then vomit.The voice acting is very good too. There are some nice choices (Mr. T has a refreshing turn as the over-the-top police officer and Bruce Campbell is amusing as the horrid mayor), and each actor gives a full amount of enthusiasm and effort into the voices of their characters.Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a very entertaining animated film which, in my opinion, has enough charm and clever jokes to be one of the best animated films of 2009 (probably second to Up). It's not quite up there with Pixar, but it definitely beats most DreamWorks animated films. I'm astonished it wasn't even nominated for an Oscar.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cloudy with sheer boredom,"Cloudy with a chance of meatballs is not a complete failure. The print I saw was very well made, as was the box it shipped in, I'm sure. As for all other aspects of this stinker, the word FAIL applies unfailingly. I will not reveal any of the exciting story elements, since it would be too much a shock to my system to replay the stream of boredom. In fact, it could harm me in some way.Where to begin: Meandering, charmless score. HUGE orchestration of what sounds like random cut and paste music from 20 different composers. Whoever 'composed' this 800 pound slug of a score was a bit too enthusiastic in the 'lets honor the film composers of the past!' department.Thin to non-existent character development. you don't CARE about the characters in this little picture, since you are almost killed by boredom by the wooden dialog. Ghastly demonstration of how to make an audience not care one little bit.Clever animation techniques marred by amateur-hour art-school reject textures. A look that keeps wandering back and forth between photo-realism and 60's surrealistic animation styles. Jarring inconsistencies and amateur animation style management.VERY sloppy dialog track so poorly mixed you could hardly detect where the character voices were supposed originate from. Overall, a cheapy-quickie little picture on huge (squandered) budget, mismanaged and mangled into the record books of bad film-making. Shameful. Wasteful.The story seals the fate of this stinker: I have not read the book, but it must have been more developed than this horror. This film could put a 7 year old on triple sugar rations asleep in 4 minutes. This thing is filled with undeveloped plot devices, paper thin back stories, pretentious 'Father/Son' conflict element that remains lifeless and dull throughout the entire picture. In short: brightly colored pap for 3 year olds. Could have saved a fortune shooting a puppet show at the local carnival.Poor Sony - nothing, and I mean NOTHING is working anymore. This should be the final tombstone for Sony Animation. Put it down, Mr. Stringer, for it is dead and hanging off the diseased studio like a gangrenous foot. Better to chop the blackened fetid limb that allow it to kill the entire sickly studio.Avoid this film unless you are studying catastrophe theory, or need to place young ones into a catatonic stupor.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fine First Instalment,"This is an alright first instalment film for all viewers to watch. The storyline of this film was real imaginative and creative. The crew did an alright job in creating this first instalment film. The cast selection was great enough. They committed and connected well to the storyline and to their respective characters. The chemistry between the cast members could have been stronger. This first instalment film reveals to viewers the importance of trying to do the right thing and getting noticed.

"Original story, OK animation","An animated feature film based on the original children's book of the same title. It is the story of Flint, a geek and crazy inventor who invents a machine that turns water into any food. It is also the story of his fellow-citizens in a town surviving on the herring industry, and the story of Sam, a weather woman turned into a reported by accident.What I liked most is the script, which is very original and crazy. Despite being so, the movie script is well presented, developed and resolved; still, the script might be difficult for small children, but the visual imagination of the film is overflowing and will captivate them anyway. What interested me most in the film was just the food theme, how food abundance is depicted with its good and bad consequences.The film lacks of intelligent adult humor, the animation style is somewhat ""chunky"" and unrefined (a retro look or a more contemporary one would have suited the story better) and it is not engaging enough in general.Is a good and enjoyable movie of the whole family.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hands Down.. best new age cartoon movie! RATING = 9.1,"First, my personal favorites are the lion king and the little mermaid (and the lady and the tramp).. that was the old this is the new! cool story line and fantasy for kids growing up these days. if i was a kid today, i would absolutely be fantasizing about food falling from the sky. I don't usually enjoy kids' movies but this one is a must see. i found myself falling in love with the characters and the story.The voice over is brilliant. i can see that the cast was focused and into the making of this film. Nothing will ever be perfect but this is about as close to a perfect kids' movie there is going to be. Enjoyable for the whole family. (even old grumpy over there ;)Favorite moments = the visuals, the violence, and the visually violent dialog. it was like watching old popeye and bugs bunny cartoons again. but in 3D. loved it!down sides = none really. (maybe the big head characters.. it's not as elegant ""looking"" as a Disney flick but who cares! enjoyy :)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
I should have liked it more but it has too many issues for my taste,"I really wanted to like it more than this. The animation is very well done, the dialogues are well written and acted.
I can usually turn my ""adult"" brain off when confronted to any form of entertainment that's ""for the whole family"" but for some reason here I couldn't. I definitely had an issue with the topic itself and felt uncomfortable with a movie revolving around the ""problem"" of having too much food because there are in fact too many problems in the World with hunger. It's a silly thing and I usually don't over analyze this type of movie, but something in the way this movie was made/written just made it happen.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Gummibears!""","This was the most enjoyable film of the year, besides Up. Though it may look like a cheesy kids movie, this movie is entertaining for all ages! The story was simple, sweet, and easy to understand. The writers didn't overwhelm us with thousands of disconnected subplots, which is something more movies nowadays need to work on. I liked how they tweaked the story a little from the book, but it also stuck to the idea very well.The characters were very enjoyable. Flint was funny, smart, and lovable. He was the perfect main character. His chemistry with Sam was flawless. And who could forget Steve, Flint's pet monkey with the Thought Translater strapped to him. I loved him! He was hilarious and cute, saying random things all the time.The animation was incredible. The people were a bit cartoony, but well done. The food looked so real, and the clouds and landscapes were amazing! The action was adrenaline- pounding. I was fixed on the screen the whole time. Even all the little kids in the crowded theater didn't distract me from the movie.I say, if you have kids, take them to see it! If you don't have kids, still, GO SEE IT!

A Nutshell Review: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Don't watch this on an empty stomach, or in 3D if you're hungry, otherwise you're likely to find yourself reaching out at the screen to want to touch those food products that get constantly rained down from the screen. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is extremely delightful, and could give Pixar's Up a run for its money in both the storyline and the visuals department. And given Sony Pictures Animation's not too bloated filmography with memorable offerings such as Monster House, Open Season and Surf's Up, this film proved that their formula is gaining traction, and we should be in for more treats in future.Bill Hader voices Flint Lockwood, an eccentric inventor who just loves to loudly describe what he's doing in his lab, if he's not talking to his pet monkey Steve who is fitted with a thought- translator. Flint is extremely innovative, but almost always comes up with things that don't work as they were intended to, creating even some of the strangest wildlife for the small fictional Pacific Island with a one-product economy - sardines.It has a perfect saccharine sweet story about Flint's search for love and acceptance by society, who sees him as nothing more than a nerd whom they can make fun of, especially when his experiments go awry. Add to that, his relationship with his father Tim (James Caan) is breaking down no thanks to the latter's taciturn demeanour, while a rookie weather news reporter Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) happens to be in town to cover an event overshadowed by Flint's contraption, which actually works and sends the entire township into a frenzy with its food on demand, falling from the skies. In no time he becomes Mr Popular at the expense of the town's iconic ""Baby"" Brent (Andy Samberg), and displays the usual syndrome of greed no thanks to a conniving Mayor (Bruce Campbell). There's also some time set aside for a budding romance too.But what actually worked for the movie, is the strength of the story, packing in plenty in a wildly charged kinetic pace that would simply leave you breathless, and in stitches, all the time. That is no mean feat, especially when the directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller steered very clear of the very tired pop cultural references which animation/comedy tend to trod themselves into. Based on a book by Judi and Ron Barrett, the film has numerous carefully crafted sequences and comedy where the visuals just get chock loaded full of gags, that it requires repeated viewings just to catch them all. Quality of the animation is top notch, while the 3D effects aren't too overwhelming to distract you from the story or characters.Amongst the subplots, I simply adored and appreciated the father and son story, especially with the episode at its climax because I can clearly relate to it, and I think those who of us who have technologically-phobic parents, would likely be able to identify with that too. That too me was most touching, and somehow emotionally anchored myself to the film, as well as serving as a reminder to lighten up, and be patient.At the expense of sounding blasphemous, I dare say this film ranks up there with any Pixar offering, as it comes with quality on both the storytelling fronts, as well as the animation, appealing to a wide spectrum of audiences young and old, and especially to the glutton in some of us! The fantastic voice talent lineup provided that extra bit of ingredient to spice up the entire offering, and who can complain when Mr T lends his voice to the town cop Earl Devereaux?This is definitely a must watch, as it finds itself into my shortlist of films of the year. Do yourself a favour, get a ticket, and be prepared to be served with a charming, entertaining course of comedy, drama, and fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Example of a Bad Animation movie...,"to make one thing clear: I am a big fan of animated movies. Starting with toy story i loved nearly every movies of this genre. Unfortunately not this one. I absolutely lacks everything movies like despicable me, monster vs. aliens, Shrek the incredibles etc.: A decent sense of humor! Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is just a line of flat and uninspired jokes. At the end it even gets worse: The movie becomes disgusting (the absolutely unfunny baby-guy turns into a fried chicken!?).Sorry, but this movie just is not funny and i regret having watched it. Don't waste your time on this and rather watch one of the other animated movies. There are so many good ones out there.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A bit disappointed!,"I saw a trailer for the film and it's idea captivated me at once, however it's the only interesting thing in the film. I also can't get over the animation outside Disney and Pixar easily which made me wondering why they can make a wonderful animation of the food and incidents but can't make admirable animated characters. I really didn't like his father and what they did with his eyes as a comedy sort of thing and felt it was really disturbing or irritating. Also the animation of the rest of the characters isn't quite good for me. The incidents became overrated with no sense with a scientific cover to hide it's naiveness. Even the feelings between the characters wasn't good enough and didn't feel most of it and it's that kind of emotions that feel it's just a standard in any animation film that had to be in there fill the time of the film. I don't recommend it and you won't miss much 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cloudy with a Chance of Tastiness,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs never fails to put a smile on my face. It has some clever jokes with some sweet messages about being yourself and solving world hunger. It's a very silly, over-the-top film but unlike most films like this, it actually has a lot of quiet moments like with the father-son dynamic, a few touching scenes, and a lot of development to the characters as well.While the story may start off as cliched, it has a unique concept about an inventor who uses water to create food to help his impoverished town. I also loved his relationship with his father, even if the whole ""parent doesn't want child to follow his dreams"" thing is common in films, the child here is around young adult age, the age where people should be allowed to be independent and free and the relationship with his dad shows that some adults can be restricted in what they want to do. This happened with me and my mom so I found that relatable.I also didn't mind the misunderstood inventor who keeps failing story. Yes, it's cliched but it goes along with the theme about being yourself, embracing your creativity, and keep trying even if you fail. A few things I didn't like about the story were the romance and third act. I thought Flint's repetitive attempts at kissing Sam were absurdly forced and at awkward moments that came out of nowhere since they just met each other and people aren't usually that brave enough to kiss their crush without built-up romantic tension. I love the Jello House scene though, I wish that was an actual attraction. I also didn't like the third act, I thought the whole thing about getting the kill code kind of dragged and the whole third act was very anticlimatic.The voice cast from Bill Hader to Anna Faris to Mr. T really made the characters. I thought almost all of the characters were well-rounded. There were some that we enjoyed and some that we love to hate such as the mayor and Baby Brent. Flint is such a positive guy, he's altruistic, excitable, creative, intelligent, and passionate. I liked how Sam goes from being a dumb blonde to a girl who learns to embrace her intelligence and her passion for science. Earl is funny, he's serious about his job and I like how they used a more doting relationship between him and his son to contrast Flint and Tim's more estranged relationship. Even Tim, who disapproves of our protagonist's dream, means well and just cares about his son but has trouble expressing his feelings. He finds inventing harmful to Flint and I find that sympathetic. I didn't understand how people initially liked Brent being in his underwear as an adult but even if he was a hateful character, gets some major character development by the end, becomes useful to the plot, and becomes a more likeable character.The only character that I couldn't care for was Steve, I thought he was the least developed character. He's static and added very little to the plot other than to be comic relief. He, like most monkeys is an annoying little troublemaker and I'm also against monkeys being kept as pets which is a cliche as well. He likes ripping off mustaches for some reason that they never explained and he has no backstory. I don't think he has any appeal for anyone over the age of 7 considering that I watched the movie when I was 11 and didn't like him then.I didn't care for the looney tunes style animation and the ridiculous designs on Flint and Tim. It would've looked okay on a nickelodeon tv show but not on a CGI feature film.I also wasn't a fan of the end credits scene, I thought it was really weird but just listen to Raining Sunshine, it's very catchy and really shows how happy the film is.I give this movie a 7/10. I would've gave it an 8/10 if Steve hadn't overstayed his welcome. Just make sure you eat while you watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fun animated movie but I doubt it will be remembered,"Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs was a book I owned when I was younger, and those of you who are older adults probably recognize it as well. The book was a simple picture book and trying to get a movie out of seemed... well... hard. But somehow the makers of this movie figured it out. They actually created an entire movie out of a simple picture book... though that's not to say that there weren't some dramatic changes.The only thing that is the same between the book and the movie is the premise. It rains food. That's it. The atmosphere of the movie is very quirky and light-hearted. It doesn't take itself seriously at all which was a smart decision. From the very beginning the movie purposely establishes how absurd the movie is going to be. The jokes are relatively good though keep in mind this movie is aimed more towards kids and there aren't any hidden jokes or anything to keep older audiences really amused.The animation is very bright and flashy and is pretty good. It's not going to be remember for outstanding animation but that's only a minor detail. The downside with the movie is that it feels more like a giant joke in itself. Since the movie isn't taking itself seriously that means it isn't being serious about telling a story that is bigger than joke. The final action sequence is visual gag after visual gag and pretty much is just a set up for jokes. It's funny but it makes the movie feel more like a roller coaster of jokes and excitement instead of being anything more than just ""entertainment"".To sum it up, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs is an entertaining movie and children will probably find the characters funny (particularly the talking monkey) however the movie isn't really memorable and doesn't stand out as a big achievement in film making. It's just a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Whether you've read it or not, go see it! And then buy the book.","When I was little, my mother used to read to me before bed. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs was one of our favorites. So when we heard it was being made into a movie, we absolutely had to go. I will admit to being hesitant - it was such a short book, and more pictures than words. I found myself without the slightest idea what to expect. We walked into the theatre in a state of moderate trepidation.We couldn't have been more wrong. This was one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It had elements from the book that stimulated our memories, and plenty of new and exciting moments to keep us guessing. I can't say for sure, as both of us had read the book many times, but I believe this would be a fun movie whether you've read it or not. Probably 85~90% of the content was fabricated for the movie. I say this in the nicest way possible. I really enjoyed that they were able to flesh out such a short, basic story into something so full and satisfying, while managing to keep true to the spirit of the original work.

Averagely entertaining overly-cartoonised animated movie. A little dumbed down for veteran animation fans,"As with every movie, it's inevitable to compare it to the quality set by its own genre giants like Disney PIXAR and Dreamworks. And back then they knew no better so the movie is average, it provides an easy-going fun story with quirky characters and heartwarming messages. In a way it checks all the boxes an animated feature should have in order to be considered good. It has outstanding animation a staple now of Sony Animation, just like Hotel Transylvania, and it looks really good. Compared to the rest of its titles at the time, this was the best they had done, the most engaging and cohesive but it can be considered for the top tier in animation today.However, now Sony Animation is finding its voice and its recent productions not only have brought an academy award for best animated picture in ""Spiderverse"", but it has had succesful franchises like ""Hotel Transylvania"" and now a new entry with ""Connected"" which looks just as funny and entertaining.I've watched all sort of animated movies, from stop-motion to computer animated to traditionally animated, from all decades and styles including non-Disney like Studio Ghibli and even other gems from Sony Animation like Hotel Transylvania and Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse. I believe Sony Pictures Animation has a lot of potential and incredibly talented professionals working there. They have fresh and original ideas but unfortunately their track record is not very fortuitous I'm afraid.They keep hitting and missing interchangeably non-stop and compared to other of its released titles, this one is one of the best. It's fun, incredibly well animated and aesthetically pleasing with great character designs and gags. But, as like with every movie, it has to be compared within its genre in order to establish a bar. Disney Pictures and Disney/PIXAR set the bar really high but other studios have met it in several occasions and so has Sony Animation winning the academy award for best animated feature Spiderverse. It seems as if Sony Animation is now realising its true potential and new releases are coming soon that look just as promising like ""Connected"" (let's hope it's a win)IN CONCLUSION, the movie is harmless kids entertainment, unfortunately it'd speak little to more mature audiences as it doesn't get any deeper. It's too ridiculous and over-the-top to be taken seriously many times and due to its charicaturization the people don't seem real as they sometimes behave awkwardly and inconsistently and not in a charmful way. It doesn't have much rewatchability unless you are into ridiculous food puns and very basic plots with dumb down messages.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fascinating story and probably the funniest animated movie I've ever seen . . .,"Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs: a fun movie, even the second time around.This film created one of those rare instances when, during the closing credits, I thought to myself ""Wow, I really enjoyed that movie"". At a first glance that was entirely based on the trailer, it seemed like one of those movies where I wasn't convinced that the story would be strong enough to last the entire film. Even after viewing the first 5 minutes, I was still a little uneasy about how the rest of the film would entertain. I shouldn't have been. After the next 10 minutes, I was deeply into the characters and the plot, and I remained this way until the end.The animation suited the movie very well. Each character was so distinctively different from the other and the voice acting was phenomenal. It was humorous throughout with a lot of original comedy but it didn't overdue it to the degree of 'slapstick'. It provided a good amount of laughter for both the young children and the older, more mature ones in the audience. It's story was both funny and serious at the same time...'a perfect combination'.You really have to see this movie for yourself to appreciate it. You have to be willing to give it a chance and NOT subconsciously assume that it is ""just another movie for kids"". Those people who aren't willing to do that will probably not enjoy this movie to its full and will miss the big picture...which is really a shame.So go ahead and give this movie a watching if you think it's your type of film. I did, and consequently gave it two!...you gotta love the theatreJimmy,",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs captivates by the unusual of the proposal, while disappointing by the lack of originality in its development and conclusion","There are two major film studios specializing in animation in Hollywood: Pixar / Disney and Dreamworks. Whenever any other competitor decides to take a risk in this genre, the results are controversial. This time, Sony's animation division is betting on one of those big-budget cartoons that seem too funny and weird to have gotten space in the big studios, always dealing with formulas and safe return on investment. Based on the eponymous children's book by Judi Barrett and Ron Barrett, published in 1978, the studio presents us Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) is a young scientist who dreams of creating something that will make him recognized by the population of Boca Grande, a small island in the Atlantic. One day he manages to find a way to turn water into food, only he needs a lot of electricity to get it up and running. When he tries to use the energy of the local generator, he loses control of the invention and it heads for the sky. To make matters worse, the confusion he creates destroys an amusement park, Mayor Shelbourne (Bruce Campbell) 's greatest asset in improving the local economy. Flint believes he lost the machine, but suddenly hamburgers start raining all over the city. With the support of Sam Sparks (Anna Farris), a journalism intern who was sent to the island to be the new ""weather girl"", Flint soon became a local celebrity.Turning the sky into a great fast food seems to be a typical American dream and what to do with leftovers is a nightmare for the rest of the world. At first, 3D animation seems like a response to the excellent documentary Super-Size Me (USA, 2004) by director Morgan Spurlock, who criticizes fast foods with their unbearably caloric food. While the documentary warns of care with food, the drawing seems to suggest the opposite, with food as a goal in search of happiness. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs makes it unclear whether it is an ode or a criticism of gluttony. Not even if, when it becomes alive, this food is a transformative alert or a mere effect of animation in search of easy laughter. On the small island, only one character with overeating problems is punished, but not for that very reason.It is amazing how children's stories in general and feature-length cartoons in particular have explored the basic theme of Ugly Duckling. If we take some random examples - A Bug's Life, Ratatouille, Dumbo, Antz, Chicken Little, Monsters SA and now Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, you can see how all of them - and many more that don't occur to me at the moment - start from the same premise: the protagonist who seems totally devoid of talent is ridiculed and segregated in the social environment where he lives because he is ""different"", marginalizes himself so that later a greater force reveals that he does have a special gift, a particularity that will transform him a hero both within his social life and outside him. The formula is again used in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Which is not a demerit, since the film has enough qualities to please adults and children.However, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs starts as a ""nerd movie"", going through the Back to the Light future, copies a little bit of Almighty here, a lot of catastrophe films there, threatens to criticize the human posture in a certain part, as if turn WALL · E, until arriving in Armageddon and staying there for almost the entire third act (with hints of Indiana Jones and other adventures of the genre). In this way, it becomes a film without an identity, with nothing to say even though it tries to say everything, shooting all over the place. When you have the possibility to discuss the effects of excess, whatever it may be, you should not waste time playing with a bizarre construction of gelatin (nor with the light romance between Flint and the nerd / meteorologist Sam, who besides being evil developed, it's perfectly disposable) or stacking sequences for identical purposes, changing only the food from the previous scene.Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs sins precisely because it is not able to stand out in the face of its origin. In other words, the plot of the mad scientist who manages to rain food even has its beautiful and fun moments, but it is too much aimed at children. And that simple conclusion already falls short of other true recent classics, such as Wall-E and Up (from Pixar / Disney) and Kung Fu Panda and the Shrek trilogy (from Dreamworks). These are brilliant works, masterfully combining a liveliness and a dynamism that irrevocably captures the attention of the little ones, at the same time that it attracts the more adult eye with well-elaborated dialogues, convincing characters and absurdly original plots. Basically, everything is missing here.But this also does not mean that Sony Animation's first 3D feature film (which had previously ventured with the mediums Open Season and Surf's Up, both interesting, but which ended up failing in one aspect or another) is one complete waste. In fact, quite the opposite. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs starts in a very lyrical, curious way, but little by little it shows that what seemed to be innovative was, in fact, just another way of reaching the same goal: transmitting simple messages that reach the viewer without major problems. . And if on this path you get a smile or two, in addition to some signs of admiration, even better.Lord and Miller clog the screen all the time, with crowds and tons of food on the scene. The jokes also pile up. Recurring, they make you laugh at repetition. Notice how the monkey Steve gets funnier with each appearance, or how the bird-rats conquer the audience a few pictures at a time. Everything is very well tied, with relevance to the story without making it seem forced or predictable. There is a concern of the directors to create satisfactory action scenes, so that the audience that sees the film projected in 3D from this jump on the chairs. At times this is even possible, but nothing that justifies the sloppy narrative and overlapping of ideas. The success of the film at the American box office can be justified by the casting of the original voice actors, formed by Bill Hader, Anna Faris and Andy Samberg, all important names in the current generation of American comedy.The trait, the quality of the animation itself, is surprising, and can even be compared to what is best in the genre. Read Pixar. The 3-D film does not make the Disney line cute, nor does it seek the style of a Pixar or the bold sets of Dreamworks Animation. The economic traits, both of characters and objects and scenarios, seem more like something out of an episode of The Muppets. It is in volume that production stands out.But the merits of the lineup prove that the focus of production was completely distorted from its real possibilities. Even the political and social content that could be embedded in the original idea (if it rains food from heaven, world hunger would end) is practically ignored, having an effect contrary to the galaxy of themes that could have been explored. For this, the film complains of being what it is, gets lost in any of its directions and returns to the commonplace, which in his case is nowhere. The acceptance that Flint so much desired is given to him as a gift, but not necessarily due to the awareness of the attempt, but much more due to the error and failure of others. If this is a message that is worthwhile, Sony should really give Pixar films an assist.Pointed basically as a beautiful example of family entertainment, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs captivates by the unusual of the proposal, while disappointing by the lack of originality in its development and conclusion. Really seeing food rain is kind of fun, who hasn't been enchanted by Robin Williams' noodle pool in Patch Adams? Well, in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs this goes much further and the fun is guaranteed. I am very creative and well done. But that's it, stop there. There comes a point in the movie that we can't take food anymore!! The script stops at that and doesn't go any further, doesn't take advantage of any situation, doesn't bring us any messages (okay, okay... whoever you are, regardless of what others say! Or rather, ""follow your dream even when everyone doesn't believe you !!""). Ok, I will stop here ....From the beginning to the middle, incredible, fun and creative. From half to the end, boring, falls into sameness, does not innovate anything, does not bring surprises, the characters are linear and do not bring us anything useful. Then they go, try to save the world ... enough! Even so, you should make the joy of minors who are after just a carefree diversion. As for the others, who seek a quality laugh and an intelligent mood, the best thing is to cool their spirits and wait.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Seems nice in theory but I'm sure it would be pretty sticky and smell quite bad.Because it's so imaginative it makes up for the one-dimensional characters. They may not have a lot of personality but they certainly have a lot of heart. It's just one aspect but they don't make the movie for me.It's the animation that makes it a memorable classic family film. It's beautifully colourful and has a nice amount of intricate details. They have really made the effort to create a wonderful world that enchants you.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A lot to savour,"Based on the 1978 novel of the same name by Judi and Ron Barrett, directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller took the foundation of the literature and created a sort of 'origin' story. The book told of a fantastical town where it rained the inhabitant's daily meals until the portions span out of control, creating gigantic food storms and oversized grub. The film imagines this phenomena is caused by science- nut Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), who after witnessing his small town getting shut off from the world and forced to eat nothing but sardines, thinks he can win the hearts of the townsfolk by creating a machine that turns water in the food of your choice.At the opening of Sardine Land, hosted by Mayor Shelbourne (Bruce Campbell), Flint's contraption goes haywire and shoots off into the sky. Soon enough, pickles, buns and cheese are raining from the sky, which soon become full cheeseburgers. The townsfolk lap it up, plying Flint with requests, and even the intern reporter Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) starts to enjoy her pun-filled reports. That is until the machine starts to lose control and begins spewing out giant spaghetti tornado's and giant steaks.Similar in a way to the Belgian madcap comedy A Town Called Panic, released the same year, Cloud With a Chance of Meatballs find most of it's charm in its relentless and hyperactive approach. Jokes litter both the foreground and background of the movie, producing some inventive, old-fashioned slapstick alongside some modern, more neurotic humour. It's an insane film at times, but there's a lot of genuine wit here. In a montage of Flint's failed inventions, we see televisions that walk to you on legs so you can change the channel, spray-on shoes that never come off, and ratbirds. The inventions are then seen throughout the film, either taking an active role in the plot or, in the television's case, looting the town's electronics store for an enjoyable throwaway gag.But beneath all the frenetic energy, there's some heartfelt moments involving Flint's father (voiced by a gruff James Caan) who can't quite communicate with the son he doesn't understand. There is also some subtle commentary on humanity's wastefulness and penchant for greed. All the uneaten food gets flung miles over a hill so it can rot away out of sight, and as the dollar signs increase in size in Mayor Shelbourne's eyes, so does his waste size. The ending takes the disappointing route of continuing the current trend of animated films having overblown, action-packed climaxes, but if you can put that aside, there is a lot to savour here.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A very filling movie!,"Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs is the story of Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) an inventor who has yet to invent a successful invention. All this changes when his invention that goes haywire at a big event in the island town of Chew and Swallow causes it to rain any kind of food that a person could think of. This also brings weather girl Sam Sparks (Anna Farris) to Chew and Swallow to cover the raining food. We also are treated to great voice performances from the following people: James Caan as the father and voice reason to Flint, Mr. T as the town's only policeman and Bruce Campbell in an hilarious role as the town's mayor. As the food begins to fall the story becomes a tiny bit predictable but the writing is brilliant with lots of bits that tie up nicely by the end of the film and the ending I related to somewhat and nearly had a tear in my eye because of it.Animation wise Cloudy is amazing and I really think it'll help in giving it a shot to ""Upset"" ""Up!"" this year at the academy awards. I've read in a couple other reviews that the 3D version of Cloudy is even more amazing animation wise so if you have a theater with 3D projection defiantly check out Cloudy in 3D.All in all I have to say I enjoyed Cloudy a lot and while I didn't give it a full 10 out of 10 or 4 out of 4 stars on IMDb.Com and FlimCrave.com I still think that it has a really good chance to upset Pixar's run of Academy Awards for best animated film based mainly on two simple facts: Great story with lots of brilliantly written bits and amazing animation that I look forward to watching on Blu-Ray when it's released. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs a very filling movie appetite wise.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
It brightened up my day.,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a vague title. So much so that its almost off-putting. My first though after seeing the trailer was that this film is strictly for the youngsters; something you might leave them at while the parents go see something considerably more adult. Truthfully, this couldn't be any further from the truth. Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs is no only one of the most entertaining animated movies thus far but it's one of the best movies I've seen all year. Now i know what you're thinking. This guy has lost all credibility, there's no way this could be on par with Pixar's outing. You know what; if I were you I wouldn't believe me either. Honestly though. The film has masterfully written material and production values to die for. Each scene is crafted with care and a keen eye for the obscure.Inspired by Ron and Judi Barrett's beloved children's book of the same name, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs follows inventor Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader) and a brainy weathergirl Sam Sparks (voice of Anna Faris) as they attempt to discover why the rain in their small town has stopped, and food is falling in its place. Meanwhile, lifelong bully Brent (voice of Adam Samberg) relishes in tormenting Flint like he did when they were kids, and Mayor Shelbourne (voice of Bruce Campbell) schemes to use Flint's latest invention -- a device designed to improve everyone's lives -- for his own personal gain. Mr. T. voices by-the-books cop Earl Devereaux, and James Caan voices Flint's technophobe father Tim.Cloudy managed to get its fundamentals out of the way rather quickly. While most animated features these day will rely on the cliché, Cloudy braches out in to the vague and at times downright obscure. Don't get me wrong there is a lot for children to enjoy here. The artistry is astounding and the sight gags are constantly amusing but the real hilarity comes from the jokes aimed at adults. Its perplexing but magnificent when 9/10 of every joke told hits dead on. This is an outright guarantee, you'll be laughing throughout 50% of the film. The other 50% you'll be spent in outright awe of the visuals which are unmatched by today's standards. Much like the graphic kids books its based off ""Cloudy"" certainly has its own art style, whether or not you like it is all down to taste.""Cloudy"" looks phenomenal. Every inch of the film is innovative, and jaw dropping. Though not for everybody. The animation style is extremely over the top and eccentric. If your sensitive to flashing colour, or you though ""Speed Racer"" was an ugly film your likely to have a similar problem here. No matter your taster there no denying the outright beauty of the final act which sees several unbelievable set pieces made cleverly out of food. It's this innovation that makes me so positive towards this, one of the best films of the year.Verdict: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is one of the funniest films of the year - a hugely enjoyable, superbly written and brilliantly animated comedy that'll send you out of the cinema grinning from ear to ear. Unmissable entertainment. Modestly, Meatballs opens with the dedication: ""A film by . . . a lot of people."" Well done, a lot of people. You've made a lot of other people very happy. And hungry. 5/5.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cloudy is Sunny,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was extremely entertaining. I caught myself laughing a lot.The dialog was original and good.Lately, animated movies that have came out in the past year just didn't have good dialog so it wasn't funny. That was my main problem. But this movie was worth seeing.The only problem I had with it was the timing.It just felt like it was too short. When I wanted it to keep going it didn't and I was kind of angry with that.Some scenes could have been longer, too.The voices matched perfectly. Bill Hader and Anna Faris did great jobs as the main characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Cute story, not rendered as well as it could have been","Execution is awkward. There's a cute story here, somewhere. But the presentation is so random, so rushed, that it's hard to follow what these people are supposed to be doing. And why. Adults will be annoyed with the off-kilter delivery, kids will be lost.There are some decent visuals and sight gags. The outhouse lab entrance is very clever, for example. But, like so many other things: when it's introduced, it zooms by like a blur. Characters come out of nowhere; perform a scene; disappear. I liked how the story brought together a shy couple with parallel back stories, but even this wasn't developed very well. Many times there's unbridled action with vivid colors, but what's going on? Pivotal characters like the bushy eyebrow dad could have been explained to the audience better. Many characters like the cop and the mayor are just stereotypes that never change, even though the story needs them to. And the guy in the chicken suit? Talk about random; what was up with that?On the plus side, it's certainly got enough slapstick, silliness, and wild action for younger kids. They probably won't follow half of what's happening, but they may not care, anyway. The inventor, the weather reporter, and the sardine store owner are likable heroes. The animation technology is handled pretty well.Good enough for a rental, but you'll probably want to watch it only once.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Lesson in creativity,"In all honesty I wasn't expecting much when going to see this movie. My lack of anticipation was most probably due to the movies trailer and how storyless it presented this movie as being. I was perhaps expecting something along the lines of 'Bee movie' with a messy plot and a directionless outcome. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised.The inventiveness of this movie was what won me over. Countless times I was amazed by the sheer novelty of ideas and their perfect execution. Additionally, once you've adjusted to the protagonists voice (which I initially perceived as being a bit miscast), the characters were mostly endearing creating a strongly fuelled interest in the outcome of the film.'Meatball's' structure also deserves a mention. In general, animated movies seem to follow the tried and tested 'Hero vs villain' model which to any film veteran fast becomes tiresome. The development of this film's plot took a somewhat different approach and was considerably uniquely structured and paced very well. The lack of story in the trailer is guessedly due to the desire of the producers to keep the plot developments as unanticipated turns (and rightly so).Many many times throughout I found myself laughing loudly in unison with the rest of the audience who seemed to be having as much fun as the crowd I was with. Most of the jokes worked and the repeating comedy themes (the hilarious 'rat-birds' to name one) never failed to bring out a fit of laughter.My only complaint is that at some points there was perhaps an excess of originality creating the feeling that they were trying to cram as many ideas into the space of an hour and a half as conceivably possible. I sporadically found myself overwhelmed and desiring some filler scenes to give the movie more of a flow.Well, if the trailer hasn't won you over and you're deliberating as to whether or not you think you'll enjoy, take my advice, forget the trailer and go and watch the most inventive and hysterical movie you'll see in quite some time...",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome!!!!!,"I've always been a fan of kids CGI movies and this one didn't let me down! I LOVED this book as a kid and when I saw that a movie was coming out, i figured it was going to be lame and boring. But upon renting it, I realized how great this movie really is. Obviously I'm older and I know it is more towards kids but this has to be one of the best ""kids"" movies ever. I had no clue how they were going to pull this one off. This movie makes me laugh every time and it is really just a silly fun movie to watch. It's just one of those movies that's ""fun for the whole family"" type of thing. this movie definitely should be given a chance.

A great example of how adaptations do not need to be like their source material,"The book was one of my favorites growing up. I must have read it dozens of times. So one would think that a loose adaptation would annoy me. I mean the film mostly just take the central concept and a few of the visual motifs from the book. It switches genres from fantasy/fairy tale to science fiction. It introduces every character in the film as a new character, Yet for all that this is one of the best adaptations I have seen. It takes the concept into a different direction and builds a rather touching father-son story around it. The humor is daft. The characters are utterly vivid. And they stick the landing on the emotional story beats.The animation is a lot more cartoony than a lot of animated films. It makes sense that the same two guys that made this would go to make the Lego Movie and Spiderverse. There is a striking style to the animation that makes it a lot more particular than photorealism that too much of CGI goes for. This is a really great family film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Highly original and fun animation,"This has to be one of the most original and fun movies that I have seen in a long time.The film is in 2D and 3D. I saw it in 2D, as my friend is not keen on 3D. This film is still excellent and engrossing in 2D. I am sure it will be even more awesome in 3D.There are some underlying messages in the film about over indulgence and social responsibility, but it does not feel like you are being preached to.The movie will appeal to adults and children alike. Unlike some other films that appeal to all ages, this is not because it has innuendo that kids won't get, but because it is a great and enjoyable film.The animation is not up to Pixar's standard, but this does not affect the film at all. It is unique and original and does not try to imitate anyone else. It left me with a great feeling when I left the cinema.One of the characters is voiced by an 80's TV cult TV favourite, which I thought was great (you'll know who when you hear them).All in all, my favourite film of 2009 so far (I would say of 2009 in total, but Avatar is coming soon, so let's see).I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fun and enjoyable but not quite a masterpiece,"""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is a unique and entertaining animated film that tells the story of a young inventor named Flint Lockwood who creates a machine that can turn water into food. The visuals in this film are truly impressive, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring the world of the film to life. The story is also well-written, with plenty of humor and heart.However, it's not without its flaws. The pacing of the film is a bit uneven, and some of the humor falls flat. The characters are likable but not particularly well-developed.Overall, it's a fun and enjoyable experience, but it's not quite a masterpiece. As a side note I have to mention that the animation is really well done and the characters are very likable. The story is a bit predictable but it's still worth watching. If you're looking for a lighthearted and enjoyable animated film, ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is definitely worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A LOT better than I thought it would be.,"When I saw the advert on TV I thought this would be another lame CGI film that's just for kids. But I was VERY wrong.

The CGI was pretty incredible, a lot of the details looked very realistic, and I got a few laughs in the first 5 minutes of the film. As the film rolled on it got funnier, and in the end my sides hurt from laughing! The set of characters were very well done, and they captured a perfect personality for each character.

Yawn,"The animation for this film is really very well done. The characters have a certain amount of reality about them. The story is just plain ridiculous. Fine, and this should be the basis of a good kids film. This isn't, oddly enough. I was bored very quickly, and the young audience I was sharing the film with were equally unenthralled. Several kids continued to play up throughout the presentation - a rather telling symptom of disinterest. This contrasted very sharply with the audience for UP who were very attentive as soon as the action started. I suspect the problem with Cloudy is the adult, relationship based story. Ideal for girls and Guardian reading adults. I wouldn't recommend this film and don't want to see it again, unlike much superior animations like Shrek, Up etc .",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Delightfully charming, with surprising depth too.","I was not sure what to expect going in to this movie, but found it to be delightfully funny and particularly refreshing, given the current state of non-Pixar animated films. While the plot is fairly simple at first glance, the story of would-be inventor Flint Lockwood and his quest to create a food generating machine contains some surprisingly deep messages and social commentary. His machine eventually goes out of control, raining food of gargantuan proportions down from the heavens onto the tiny Atlantic island nation of Swallow Falls and even the rest of the world. Meanwhile, weathergirl Sam Sparks is sent to Swallow Falls to investigate the culinary curiosity, and Lockwood must eventually find a way from saving the world from certain doom at the hands of his seemingly magical creation. The voice acting is top notch, and includes some outstanding work by talented individuals such as James Caan, Bruce Campbell, and even Mr. T himself. The movie does not take itself too seriously, but also takes care not to fall into the trap of pop-culture parody or crude scatological humor. An excellent movie all around.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

This is the best movie I've ever seen,"I have never seen a movie as good as this. The story is unlike any other, with every joke having me on the floor laughing, and every emotional scene having tears gush down my face. The story hit close to home, and left me wanting more after the credits roll. The protagonist, Flint Lockwood, grows over his pride and becomes a new man at the end of the movie. Words can. Barely begin how much I love the animation. It is more perfect than every animated movie combined, with many scenes reducing me to tears just because of how gorgeous the animation quality is. The goofy artstyle brings an otherwise mature movie to a younger audience, making it more accessible so an even larger amount of people can enjoy it.

Great visuals but lacking in story,"Cloudy with a chance of meatballs is an animated comedy. This movie was pretty boring and plain ridiculous (even for an animated film). I know its a kid movie but the plot was so weird and not realistic. Because most of the time, they are missing the heart and inspiration that Pixar has. Cloudy with a chance of meatballs is one of those animated films. It's missing the heart and there isn't much inspiration put into the film. Its pretty predictable and very easy to tell what will happen and how the film will end. This is the story of a scientist named Flint (Bill Hader). He is a likable character. The problem with his inventions are that none of them actually work. He also works at his dad's(James Caan) work. His inventions blow until he invents a machine that causes food to rain from the sky.Flint meets a newscaster(voiced by Anna Farris) who he soon falls for. The film is funny at sometimes but in general its really not. And the movie keeps your attention for the most part. But in the last half hour, the film gets awfully stupid. There is a scene in which Flint, Sam, the newscaster, and a retarded Sardine's representative (Andy Samburg)are going into a huge ball of food. Eventually, pizza slices try to blow them up. And once they get in the cave, these creepy looking turkeys come alive and try to kill them. That is how stupid the movie is.I thought the movie could have added more and could have used Mr. T's character and his son more. Some of the other characters were just boring and not that great.

3(D) Times The Fun,"Hey Mom & Dad. Are you dealing with a rainy day,with the kiddies driving you crackers with ""I'm so bored...There's nothing to do,today"" every five minutes? Then by gum,pack the whole gang in the car & drive on over to your local multiplex & treat the little ones to a screening of 'Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs' (and even if you have no little ones,still go to check it out---you'll be glad you did). This is Columbia/Sony Pictures contribution to the ever growing array of 3D-CGI (three dimension,computer generated images)animation. The screenplay,adapted from the beloved book by the authors themselves (Judi Barrett & Ron Barrett)doles out the fun factor a whopping 10+. The direction is handled well by Phil Lord & Chris Miller (both known for their work in television). The story:a little island township,mainly known for it's contribution to fishing is starving for tourism (there is literally nothing to eat but fish there). Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader,of Saturday Night Live,fame)is a failed inventor,who is trying to invent a machine that turns water into food, which goes bananas (ouch---bad pun!)& turns into a satellite that does manage to turn rain clouds into food that rains upon the island. Sam Sparks (voiced by Anna Faris,of the Scary Movie series)is the perky weather anchor of the local 'Weather News Channel' (obviously a double edged pun on the Weather Channel,as well as Cable News Network)is there to report on the proceedings (and perhaps forge a friendship with the nerdy,introverted Flint). Other familiar voices that turn up for good measure include,James Caan (as Flint's skeptical father,Tim), Bruce Campbell (as the rather shady Mayor Shelbourn),Mr. T (as a well meaning,but overly macho policeman,Earl Deveraux),and even Al Roker (from NBC's Today Show),as Patrick Patrickson,Benjamin Bratt & Neil Patrick Harris turn up to supply voices for some minor characters. This film is being released in both 3D Digital,as well as standard 2D versions (check your local newspaper for whatever cinemas are screening which version---although I would recommend the 3D edition). At the screening that I attended,both youngsters,as well as parents had a good old time with this one (as did I). Now, it's your turn. Rated PG by the MPAA,for some thematic element (although I would guess that it's being released as a PG,just to guarantee wider distribution,as I really didn't find anything that a parent would object to).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Bill Hader and Anna Faris were wonderful together, as was the supporting cast including Mr T who was brilliant as the over-protective cop! The best thing about this film was that it was never boring! When there wasn't any comedy, there was action scenes that were awesome. There were also some family moments, but they're really short. It's a great film with great comedy and action, and the 3D works great as well. I definitely recommend this animated classic. It's a hilarious film!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I found it to be very funny. A movie as imaginative as this one is hard to find, and combined to make it good and fun is a great thing. Also enhanced with 3D effects, the action was closer, the adventure more lively and the food tastier. However, this looks like a family film, but note the PG rating. It has many bloody and rude humor, that is not meant for younger viewers. This movie is more for preteens.

This is right up there as one of the best animated films this year, along with ""Up"" & ""Coraline"". This film also has as much action as it does humor, sure to please both action fans and people who love a good comedy.

A hilarious and surreal ride! One of the best modern animated features!,"This was a film I didn't have high expectations for. But I'm a fan of Bruce Campbell and I also like Anna Faris, and heard a review which made me want to see it immediately, so I decided to go and see it. And I loved it!Most comedy films coming out today have many jokes, but unfortunately all bad ones, because the problem is that they try too hard to be funny, and it just doesn't work. In 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' the humour is natural. They have a hilariously absurd situation (food falling from sky) and some lovely characters, great voice-overs which help to bring some great jokes, and shows that they are still people around in the film industry who have a good sense of humour.The visuals are stunning, surrealistic and sometimes even dark, especially if you think about the fact that it's an animated kids film. The animators sure did a great job. This is one the few animated newer animated films which actually has an atmosphere ('Wall-E' being another example). The film has a variety of things such as walking roasted chickens, a guy with a macaroni on his head, multicoloured clouds which increases this absurd surrealistic feel that the film has.Over nearly 2 hours you regularly see different foods falling from the sky, but interestingly enough, it never bores you, because every time a good joke is added, and you can enjoy the visuals. This means the film is working.I think this film might be one of the year's best if not the best. Clearly it has an intention of being memorable, and not just one of those little animated film you see once with your children, and then forget about it a week after. This is a film that males/females, adults/children can enjoy from beginning to end. It's a film that succeeds on many levels. I've seen it in 3D, which I do not believe in, and I am sure that a 2D experience is as good, and enjoyable for everyone. So don't let 3D fool you, just sit back in any dimension and enjoy this wonderful modern animated feature.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great Premise, First 50 Minutes......And Then","I really enjoyed the first 50 minutes of this film but the last 30-some are so silly and overdone that it dampened my enthusiasm for the movie. I wouldn't watch it again, especially not with all the other much-better animated films in recent years.What happens in the end is the problem that occurs in many modern-day action movies: too much. Things get so frenetic here, so loud and crazy that it simply becomes too much. Action can get boring when it's non-stop and over 10 straight minutes of it. Here, it's like the last 30 and by then, you no longer care what happens.....just get the darn movie over.Too bad, because this had a great premise and a couple of characters you cared about, like ""Flint"" and ""Steve."" A third man character, the weather girl, ""Sam,"" was okay but much like the film: interesting and likable at first, but slowly less so. She didn't really add a lot to the film with the lame romance and PC angle. Speaking of the latter, ""Mr. T.'s,"" cop character ""Earl"" was over-the-top and insulting in its stereotypical PC mode.Overall, a film which could have super but carried away and wound up just a big, giant mess, just like all the food splattering on the people.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The Classic base movie that could & that can teach ""Igor"" a thing or 2.","I'll say this right at the start just to get so I don't forget, the animation looks Jack-Jack (Baby from Incredibles) like style, make it worth your while. It can be really funny and the voice actors are pretty good (I especially like Steve's voice, because it's such a fast voice, but I love it for some reason) Kids will definitely love this show for it's zaniness and funny characters.I usually Adore Sony Pictures Animation's CGI movies, but I think this one is a pretty good by far, it doesn't nearly hold up to the Pixar or Dreamworks films, not by a long shot. But for rating it as a 3D animated films it's pretty good (much better than that horrible movie about the Lab Assistant with a big hump).Well, thats about it for this movie, maybe you should watch it & give it a decent chance, like me I was comparing it to 2008 CGI movie, can you guess what movie it was :D",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Bowlful Of 3D Fun!,"Computer-generated animation flicks are six to the penny these days - some good, some bad, and some downright ugly - but I'm pleased to say that Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs really does hit the spot.So - Sony unveil their all-singing, all-dancing, 'powerful enough to rival the mighty Pixar' animation kit - but the question is... is it?On this evidence, the answer is... perhaps. Bear in mind there are TWO versions of this film - namely 2D and 3D. I, perhaps like yourself, had read and watched frankly average reviews based on the 2D version, as many theatres will not be showing the 3D version - and to be perfectly honest, this DOES matter.As a standalone 2D film, not much stands out from the crowd here - the animation is good, perhaps as good as Pixar in parts, but that isn't enough to warrant whooping and cheering from the aisles. The story itself is a little thin, the voice overs do enough to make it work - but again, nothing to write home about. BUT......Don those 3D glasses, take a seat (preferably one of those expensive leather ones at the back) and prepare to be truly DAZZLED. What looks ordinary and laboured at times in 2D transforms into something straight out of a bag of multi-coloured candy, kaleidoscopic and fresh. I don't think I've ever seen so much depth and colour on the big screen ever. At times the film is truly jaw-dropping - talk about shock and awe.OK, So what's the deal? Sony showcase their new kit, but neglect the plot and acting talent in order to show off it's real jewel in the crown, namely the 3D capacity? You got it.It's been attempted on many occasions, and has rarely worked - Pixar themselves enjoyed a little fame with the 10 minute Shrek short - albeit in anaglyph format - but apart from a few moments, it looked as if they were trying too hard. Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs has taken the 3D guideline book, ripped it up and thrown it out of the building - looking silly in a pair of geeky 3D specs will never be the same again.And it seems Pixar, THE genuine animation article for what seems like time out of mind now, have decided to run with the ball too. A genuine 'anything you can do' battle seems inevitable with the re-release of Toy Story in 3D imminent. Can they pull it off? Only time will tell.Back to Sony. While the animation hardware looks more than capable of giving Pixar a run for it's money in years to come - it's not quite there yet. But forget all that, if you have kids, you are a kid or you're a kid in an adult's body that secretly wished 3D would finally get the chance to grow up - your dreams, all of them, have been fulfilled.Fantastic, spellbinding stuff - look for a theatre that is showing the 3D version, and get there today!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Hilarious, imaginative and leaves you w/ a happy feeling","This movie has got to be one of the most hilarious animated films ever. And the best thing is that the humor didn't seem forced or out of place. The humor that was incorporated in the movie, actually went with the plot, but it wasn't that strong to overpower the movie and the plot itself.When I first saw the trailer for this, I didn't think it was anything special. I thought it would just be another mediocre movie targeted for children. I mean, food falling from the sky? Really? Really? I had no plans of seeing it, but when my dad showed up with tickets to the IMAX movie, I didn't fight it either. ""Oh, he's already bought the tickets! Might as well watch it!"" So I went into the movie theater, not expecting anything great from this movie. Wow, was I surprised. I found myself getting sucked into the story. The characters were lovable, goofy and realistic. The animation was great and the 3D helped! I think this is one of the best animated films put into 3D. If I could watch it again in the IMAX theater, I would.Flint Lockwood is an aspiring scientist. Ever since he was a little boy, he has dreamed of creating big things. Over the years, as he has been growing, all he's ever experienced was disappointment. His inventions have all failed miserably, until one day, Flint decides to try his latest invention- a machine that creates food out of water! However, lots of things go on and somehow, the machine ends up in the sky. Flint's lost hope of ever seeing the machine again, until later, it starts raining food. And that is when things get messy.I learned, after first watching the movie, that this was adapted from a children's book. I've never read the book, but after watching this movie, I'm planning on reading it soon. Judging from some of the reviews, most people say that they were first fans of the children's book and this movie lived up to it, even if it added its own twist on things. I guess that's a good thing, then!'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' is a happy film that will surely leave people smiling. This isn't only a movie for children! I'm sure teenagers and adults will enjoy it. In my opinion, this film could rival Dreamworks and actually be a product of Pixar.Viewed on: April 6, 2011",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009),"A complete and utter surprise. It's so easy to get lazy with animated films, even more so when those films are designed for 3D. It's with a great big smile as ridiculous as the film itself, that I can announce Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, to be one of the most hilarious films in recent memory. For laugh out loud moments it beats such brilliance as Up!, even if it does rely on it's ridiculous plot to see us through. The voice cast is fantastic, with Neil Patrick Harris excelling as a monkey that just shouts a few words. Luckily, each of those words has the comical impact of a meteorite. It was fun, entertaining and even left me having to catch up with the jokes at certain parts.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I'm Hungry,"Although - as many people do - I generally prefer Pixar films to the animated fare created by other companies, I can't deny that a film like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is very hard not to love. Although it isn't particularly complex, thought-provoking, beautiful or masterful, it's a very entertaining, funny, cute-as-hell and effective animated film. Children with definitely love it, and adults... well, that actually depends on the adult in question. Although I certainly enjoy all kinds of movies, there's always - for me - some satisfaction to be had when watching something so obviously goofy and kiddo. Meatballs is kiddo, and that's precisely what I loved about it. It may not be this year's best animated movie - that hon our goes to Pixar's Up - but it certainly is better than the likes of Monsters vs. Aliens.The film tells the story of Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader), a young inventor who dreams of, someday, creating something that will be loved by everyone and make him more popular and, most importantly, improve the lives of everyone in town. Unfortunately, he hasn't been able to do so, and his technophobia father (voice of James Caan) doesn't really help at all. One day, though, he manages to invent something that will change the lives of everyone in town forever: a machine that makes food fall from the sky. Everybody seems to be happy with him now - including mayor Shelbourne (Bruce Campbell) and the by-the-book police offer, Earl (Mr. T) - but, predictably enough, something goes wrong: excess amounts of food start to overload the island where the town is located, and now Flint, along with TV reporter Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) has to try to solve their problem.Yes, the plot is pretty predictable, and it certainly won't make anyone above the age of 5 be shocked with surprise or anything of the sort, but it certainly is very imaginative, and it should work in a very ""oh, it's sort of nice"" kind of way. I liked the way Flint was portrayed - Hader's wacky and not-so-recognizable voice is perfect for the character - and the fact that, although most characters are either archetypes or stereotypes - consider, for the example, Bruce Campbell's greedy and - eventually - obese mayor - they are all voice so professionally and characterized in such an naive and cute kind of way, that one just doesn't care. I rooted for Flint the whole way, and I actually thought that the romantic sub-plot between him and Sam was cute and funny.Visually, I don't think the movie is on par to the likes of Wall-E or Up, but I think that comparing it to those productions would be a bit unfair. Wall-E had a sort-of realistic kind of look, and Up, while a little more cartoon's, had a very realistic flair to it. On the other hand, there's something very old-fashioned in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' look and the way it is animated. Characters behave and move the way old TV cartoons behaved forty or more years ago, and I like that. They jump a lot, are very ""agile"" and are just... cartoon's. Clearly, the animators didn't want the movie to give a palpable sense of realism; in a way, they were trying to craft an old-fashioned cartoon with the latest technological tools, and they have done it very successfully.What else can I say about the movie? It certainly is very naive, and it doesn't explore any deep themes or moral problems, but that's just OK. While this year's mediocre Monsters vs. Aliens was terribly simplistic, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is just simple, and there's nothing wrong with that. Of course, there's nothing wrong with movies like Wall-E having very significant messages and complex love stories and such, but if a parent wants to go with their toddler to see a movie that isn't very complicated but that isn't stupid or boring either, then Meatballs is an excellent choice. After all, even if there isn't much beneath the surface, I can't imagine a single adult maintaining a straight face throughout the film's running-time. The movie is hilarious, - just remember Flint's father's eyebrows! -, it's inventive, it's imaginative; it's also pretty gorgeous and it features some effective voice acting and interesting, wacky characters. It's not dumb and it doesn't pander to the least common denominator. Most interestingly, though, it made me hungry. That's not a quality many movies posses.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
FINALLY! A masterpiece that shows Sony Pictures Animation's true identity!,"Since 2006, Sony Pictures Animation had been trying to rank with Pixar and Dreamworks, particularly in storytelling. Its first film, ""Open Season"", wasn't well-received, mostly because it's a ripoff of ""Madagascar"". In 2007, on the other hand, Sony released ""Surf Up"" as the first documentary film in animated feature. That showed the studio's true potential in storytelling. But above all, it's ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"", the first animated disaster film, that shined Sony's true identity the most.Not only CWACOM has the spirit of the original children's authors, it has managed to stay away from the storytelling styles of Disney, Pixar and Dreamworks, too. The film-making team did an excellent job on replicating stylized animation in CGI (check out the mouth shapes of Flint Lockwood, for instance). Most importantly, its humor is sophisticated and its heart can be apparent (such as Flint Lockwood longing for Tim Lockwood's love).Now that CWACOM has ranked among the best animated features of 2009 (The Princess and the Frog, Up, Coraline), Sony Pictures Animation should keep up the good work, mostly in its own storytelling style and even its experimentation on stylized animation and genres (such as reality TV show).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Now, there are a lot of studios but they stock stinker after stinker.Sure, the animation is bright, colored, full of details but the characters are rather ugly: the heroes are realistic and cute while the others are caricatures: short legs, explosive belly, enormous eyebrows. Worst, the story is dumb: it's about a food storm! Where do they find their ideas? Maybe it's better than a poop tempest but falling steaks, swimming in cream is finally disgusting.

Sarcasm on fast food!,"Love the whole wild, weird imagination of having fast food falling out of the sky, that would solve the half the world's problems. But then it is still an imagination. Simply, the the story of Cloudy with a chance of meatballs is a scientist solves world's hunger problem, and the food starts falling from the sky, only to realise that things are not going as planned.It is a very well written movie, well done animation, even thought it would have been Pixar's idea at first, but then it isn't. Love the characters, all big eyed, there are some with no eyes, but then only at the time of surprise their eyes would be popping out. Love the father-son relationship, it is not saying I told you so. Even enjoyed the sarcasm towards consuming fast food as to how it would lead to health problems.

a big mega-hit blockbuster... and other things,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs took me by surprise. I went in on a near-whim - or, in other words, very positive critical buzz and the word of some specific critics I trust. As it turns out, it's got nowhere near the mastery of storytelling of Pixar's Up, nor the kind of cult-movie ambition of the sleeper 9 by Shane Acker. No, but it is by far the funniest animated movie to come out this year, maybe just as funny as Kung-fu Panda from last year. The directors, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, treat the source material as a pure jumping off point (a 10 page short story for kids done in a captivating and unusual style for a children's book), and it just get completely crazy from about five minutes (or just minute-one) on. And while it is probably more for kids, if you're an adult- or just a dude in his 20's with fond memories of Rocko's Modern Life and Animaniacs, it will do more than just make you smile. You'll be laughing, a lot.It just takes absurdism to heights that can't be topped, at least this week. The main idea is that Flint Lockwood is an inventor, usually of stuff that works but not on a grand enough scale (like spray-on shoes and a voice-defibrillator or something that is able to make his monkey Steve express his thoughts like ""HUNGRY HUNGRY!""), and he one day invents a device that can use radiation and water to make up any food programmed in the system. It needs energy though, so after a (botched?) attempt at a power station, Flint's machine get launched up in the air to the clouds, and from there weather and purely unnatural events cause perfectly edible Cheeseburgers to rain down everywhere. From there, Flint's semi-career takes off, as well as the courting of a weather-girl, Sam Sparks, who secretly was one (gasp) a nerd.Oh there's so much craziness here that one can't describe it. That is, unless, you are already on a high of candy or soda and can relate to a scene like when a frustrated policeman (Mr. T - yes, Mr. T) wants Flint to do something special for his son's birthday, and the next day it's an entire neighborhood of ice cream - which then goes into a snow-fight of ice cream, and snow angels of ice cream, and Flint's first ever participation in a snow-fight where he practically slaughters the kids with his hard-hitting ice-cream-ball accuracy. Or that monkey, Steve, or those rat-birds Flint invented years ago that roam the beaches and town like Hitchcock-Bird parodies, or the Mayor (voiced wonderfully by Bruce Campbell, didn't recognize him at all), or just little things like Flint's dad's bushy eyebrows and mustache (""Look in my eyes when you say that,"" he says at one point). Did I mention the romantic jello mold or the bad puns like when chicken drumsticks rain to with Sam replies, ""Poultry in motion!""There's much more to get into, not least of which the big big BIG climax of the movie, which starts to roll into Godzilla territory with how insane it gets. And, more often than not, the jokes are more sophisticated than one might expect, and flew over more than a few of the kid's heads (not to say some jokes are more squared right at kids specifically, which is fine). One of these, ""Let's Diem that Carpe,"" work almost a few seconds after the joke is told, but a lot of them are just purely visual gags. And even more than Up, which had its share of laughs, 'Meatballs' cashes in on the whole visual cache of raining food, and all of the varieties, and the truly original idea of having a monkey on a flying car fighting evil gummi bears. Oh yes, it's one of those movies, and if you're just after ridiculously hungry imagery, this is the place to go. It's a vibrant and imaginative cartoon, loaded with gags, a little bit of heart, and some predictability. If I had a kid I'd make him/her see it with me twice - even if they were fine with just the once.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"The best Sony Pictures Animation movie ever, period.","Based on the book of the same name by Judi & Ron Barrett, this underrated gem is the most tastingly delicious, zany, fast-paced food movie ever. I know Sony Pictures Animation isn't that great of a studio (well, that can't be said anymore thanks to Spidey-Man: Into The Spidey Verse), but here they just proved that they can be as great as both Disney & Pixar (in terms of storytelling, character development, emotional depth, and almost everything). The idea of food falling down from the sky like rain is EXTREMELY wonderful, the characters are lovable (and yes, I also think Flint & Sam are the cutest nerd couple), the animation & visuals are gorgeous, the soundtrack's vibrant, the film's wry humor is off-the-wall hillarious (like the part where Baby Brent shows himself after Filnt became popular: he's like ""uh oh"" and the townspeople tell him ""put your clothes back on!"" and boo at him), the emotional moments are well rounded out, the food storm scenes (such as the spaghetti tornado scene) are very entertaining to watch, the characters' movements are highly expressive (seriously, this movie's like if you're watching Looney Tunes in CG and like, how did Sony come up with the idea of cartoony CG animation? That's what I love about Sony's animated features- that marvelous, zany, cartoony CG), the jello castle & ice cream snowball fight scenes are memorable, and almost everything about this film is great. The film also has plenty of excellent themes: like the pros & cons of technology, why greed & gluttony is wrong, how climate change affects the environment we live in, how manipulation can lead to problems, etc. I also just noticed that this film kind of relates to Biblical times (like when food falls from the sky = manna & quail falls from heaven, and when the food storms come = Armageddon). The film could've been better if Flint's mom (along with her husband Tim) were to see their son's invention work, and both would be really proud of him at the film's ending. And, speaking of the ending, it was a sweet one. I also like how the film pokes fun at disaster movies- it's excellente, and yes, another good thing about this movie would be Steve. Considering this to be my favorite Sony animated movie (besides The Angry Birds Movie 2 & possibly Spider-Verse), this film gets a very deliciously tasty reward...",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Flint Lockwood is NOT a cowboy - just a kid in a cool food-rain film.,"Flint Lockwood is not a cowboy - I repeat NOT a cowboy - even if his name practically demands it. He is actually a young kid inventor (at the start of the film), whose curiosity and idealism leads him to endure public ridicule, as early inventions are a little less than earth shattering. His Mum and Dad stick by him all the same and provide support for his aspirations, even if they don't fully understand them.Flint is a citizen of Swallow Falls, a small seaside town famous for its sardine industry, though in recent years the area is slumping as sardines are a little less popular, anyone who has sat in a lunchroom when someone cooks then can attest why.They stink.Fast forward to young adulthood, and the 18ish Flint has continued inventing, with his biggest sorta success being a talking monkey named Steve, and apparently a new invention that converts ordinary water into food. Don't ask how, it's a movie.Other things at home aren't so rosy, Mum has passed on, Dad isn't too happy and on top of that the continued decline in sardine PR has meant his sardine shop is running on fumes.The mayor of Swallow Falls hatches a scheme to bring the town back, he changes tack and decides to set up ""Sardineland"" and market Swallow Falls as a tourist destination. Now before you get online to buy your tix to Sardineland I must assure you it is made up and doesn't exist.As expected Sardineland blows, and Flint skips the unveiling to continue work on his water/food converter, and as this is a movie things go haywire and the converter is inadvertently sent into the atmosphere, ruining the grand opening of Sardineland in the process and drawing the ire of the Mayor and the locals, including Dad.Now the poster, previews and even the title tells us to expect culinary precipitation, and golly-bob-howdy if that isn't exactly what we get. After Flint learns to control his invention people actually start putting in advance orders for birthdays, anniversaries etc.Initially the townspeople are exceedingly grateful, because as well as having something unfishy to eat they are also immediately put on the map and draw in crowds of visitors. Down the track however things go awry, and Flint and his new pals must step in to save the day.What makes CWACOM a success is the characters, although some, if not most of the characters are voiced by actors it doesn't distract from the action, also, more than anything the creators were smart enough to put in actual jokes to keep you amused. I laughed often through the movie, and while I haven't put this to the test yet I think this will be a movie with high re-watchability.Back to the characters, Flint (voiced by Bill Hader) is actually quite low key and likable, as is the love interest Sam, an intern weather channel reporter who stumbles upon a career-making story from the sky. Their fledgling relationship comes along slowly and believably, as they realize they have far more in common than they thought.As always it is the bit-parts in animated movies that are given the longest leashes, the Mayor is a bit of the bad guy stereotype, but he does get some of the best lines, and his overindulgence once the chubby-rain begins leads to some sight gags. An advertising kid, formerly named Baby Brent but now grown up and more than a little pathetic is also welcome, but the show stealer is Mr T, in his best (only?) role since Rocky III, as an overzealous cop hellbent on preserving law and order and looking after his young son.The rain effects are amazing and awesome looking, especially a spaghetti-twister and a food-o-lanche later in proceedings. Apparently food related natural disasters lend themselves to an animated setting with the vibrant colour and movement. The second half of the film moves at breakneck speed but the pace never goes too fast that the story is hard to follow, there are a few jokes that will fly over say a 6 year old's head, but enough other stuff to keep everyone from 5 through 13 amused.The ending is also gloriously over the top and insane, who can say ""no thanks"" to scenes with mutated angry, protective food? There could have been a few more ""fat American"" jokes aside from the mayor, but perhaps the creators feared the inevitable backlash that honest commentary often brings. (As an Australian I can't distance our culture from the US too much either, though on my one trip to the US earlier this decade, myself and my wife had a ""fat person"" of the day photo, which turned into an eye-opening collection once we arrived home. Can't say I ever felt impelled to do that here.) CWACOM has some great set-pieces and action, some snappy dialogue and amusing sight-gags, it also effectively straddles the line without being too kiddy nor too adult-oriented. I recommend this for anyone who watched Horton Hears a Who and liked it, but this is definitely funnier.Final Rating – 8 / 10. I may be wrong but I don't think I have enjoyed a kid's movie this much since Monster House, (Up and Wall-E are better, Monster House more enjoyable). This is a kid's movie that justifies a trip to the cinema.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cloudy With A Chance Is A Great Fun Time,"Failure after failure after failure after failure, Flint decides to solve a certain sardine problem his town has, by converting water into food. He invents a machine, which then goes a bit haywire and launches itself into the sky. Fortunately for him, it worked, and food begins falling out of the sky. Unfortunately it eventually gets a mind of it's own and tries to destroy to town with over-sized food.Look at the pretty colours. Those were the words from my girlfriend when we saw the trailer for this film, which we sadly did not see in the theatres. Yes, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs is a great animated kids film with more than enough comedy for the older crowd. Although it wasn't the best animated film last year, it was the funniest in my opinion.The animation fit the story perfectly and the food falling all over were great visuals. You can tell the animators had a lot of fun with this film. Sony Pictures Animation haven't really had a film in their roster to stand out and to me, this one is their golden ticket. It's a shame it wasn't recognized at the Oscars, as I think it deserved a place on the nomination list.The kids learn valuable lessons about responsibility and being yourself, while getting to have fun with the images of ice cream snowball fights, a building made out of jello and a school covered by a giant pancake. The adults get the comedy of Bill Hader from SNL, recognizable voices of Mr. T, Neil Patrick Harris and the man, the myth, the legend himself, Bruce Campbell. Each role fit their voice actor perfectly. Usually Anna Faris annoys me, here she made me like her character more because of her unique voice. James Caan as the dad is the added cherry on the top of the cake. Gummi Bear Twilight Zone reference? Brilliant.The film is really funny and hits every note it has to. The climax works perfectly and the vibrant colours will keep the kids watching the screen. The disaster film has been given the animated kids film treatment and it works wonderfully. I highly recommend Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs for the entire family.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Also, apart from the Ice Age trilogy, the visuals aren't usually cute. But I was pleasantly surprised by this sweet & funny effort. Flint is a sympathetic lead. His enthusiasm leads to trouble for the whole town, but backed by some loyal & eccentric companions, he is determined to set things right. Bruce Campbell enjoys his role as the mayor, as does Mr T as the police chief. Steve the monkey has scene stealing moments too. Visual and spoken jokes work well.

Fun!,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meat Balls is a really fun movie that the whole family can enjoy. There are a lot of jokes for the adults to like but the kids will also be glued to the screen for the whole thing, which is great.It's not something adults will love from start to finish but there are pretty much zero movies like that around any more, Frozen is probably the best example of that that I can come up with or a few of the best Pixar movies.The voice acting is really good and there is just a lot of great, zany, wacky fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

'Cloudy With A Chance Of MeatBalls' Movie Review,"If you are a weather girl, your biggest break would be to deliver a forecast citing 'Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs... with spaghetti on the side'.Who knew whether or not I would like this film at all. It could have swung both ways. After all we have seen the typical hero complex storyline and the falling slowly in love theme, but oddly enough this was surely a different way to tell a story, especially for the younger generation.'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' had a slight twist to it which resembled a slight brilliance tangled in the storyline. A forlorn scientist who finally gets his big break only to be used and abused to the point where world domination comes to play and of course there must be a love interest poked somewhere in between the mayhem.This movie stroke out all other new coming movies to the top and there were the occasional echoes of anchor showcased upon the closing act and overall good feedback, so I knew I had to give my view on this show's excitement in ratings.To set my enjoyment aside for this one, I would tell you that you've probably seen this one already, if not something like it, but you would have a good laugh and there's no doubt the writers found a way to give it a new spin so much that it would not disappoint. Ratings can be misleading at times, but I know when a movie is good, it definitely winds up being in my top ten this year.Lexa Reviewshttp://lexabuti.blogspot.com______________________Four and a Half StarsGrade A-______________________",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

No.It's about some guy making it rain meatballs for a girl to like him.The animation was okay, the character designs are the goofy kind. Sound track was pleasent.

"Different, Quirky, Fun, Humorous & Delightful","This film will delight all of any age, fun humour and delightful characters. The effects are not pixel perfect but then again this film is not supposed to be. Definitely either the best or one of the best of Sony Pictures Animation's films. It's a nice laid back film, doesn't have an in depth or full bodied story line as in Pixar films, emotive and the cast do a good job. The plot is simple enough but it's all the small things that make this film brilliant. I would recommend this film for everyone who likes a laugh, connectible characters and a boy and girl who save the world and live happy ever after. Do not compare this animation film to Pixar or Dreamworks or Bluesky, this is its own style and that makes this film interesting.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Meatier Shower!,"With an awesome cast, an ambitious ""lot of people"" at Sony-animation and two great directors who make sure the ride is real and original. Not only give us a great film experience but do justice to the book as well. I'm surprised The Academy did not nominate this as the 6th movie in the best animated feature category. It was nominated for the Annie's as well. This is not just a funny, family comedy. But, a strange movie on the whole. You don't know if its sarcasm or not, but in the end, even the sarcasm scores a tear drop from you. That's the best way to describe this awesome movie. That's how great it is.

"""Prepare to get served""","The most delicious event since macaroni met cheese. Inspired by the beloved children's book, the film focuses on a town where food falls from the sky like rain.I saw this film by accident... Standing in line, highly expecting to see a new action-thriller, the tickets ran out. I was mad, especially how I drove an hour up the road to the theater. The only thought in my head was how I wasted my time, and how bad I wanted to see the movie. So instead of staying with the grudge, I went to see this. Animations are hated, due to their kid-like nature, but I'm surprisingly a fan. Pixar hits me the most, and most likely will be the only animation I'll love, but Dreamworks has some memorable stuff too, so I had SOME expectations. I sat down, expecting a clichéd and fun movie, and came out BLOWN AWAY! The animation has improved since Dreamwork's beginning. They have some good stuff, but their animation has died down since Shrek. But this movie is most possibly one of the best animations with witty antics, stunning animation, and an intelligent plot. The movie, for one, is based off a book. It was a short book, but instead of keeping with the book, they went all out and created an altered universe of the story. The story is great; who wouldn't love food falling from the sky? The only thing I would suspect is bad reviews because of it's child-like ways of presenting things. I believe some people forget that this movie is actually labeled as a KID'S FILM and get a bit carried away. Nevertheless, if you avoid the kid's presentations and their ways of doing some stuff, you'll be fine. I saw this film 3D... The animation is absolutely brilliant, comparing with Pixar's Walle. The characters look amazingly real and you can actually read their lips; a recent discovery in technology. The voice acting was great, unexpectedly, and I was overall shocked of how much I liked it. If you like animations, see it. If you don't, of course I would suggest not. It's a love it or hate it film, but I surely loved it. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best animated movies I have ever seen!,"Recently, I had yet to see a children's animated movie that wasn't by Disney or DreamWorks that was just a pure joy to watch since Spirited Away and I'm very happy to say that Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is one of the greatest animated children's movies I have ever seen. Based on a children's book, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is about a young inventor called Flint who has invented a brilliant machine that turns water into food and Sam Sparks, a weathergirl with a secret. As Flint tries his new invention, the machine goes horribly wrong and starts to manipulate the weather. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is very colourful and beautifully animated from start to finish with everything very detailed and looking visually gorgeous and mouth-watering, I can imagine how good this would look in 3D. The animation isn't exactly Disney Pixar quality but it could rival DreamWorks very easily. The story is very imaginative and original and it reminds you of children's movies you watched back in the eighties and nineties with some great comical slapstick thrown in for good measure. Also added to the story is humour thanks to the messages the story provides, the style of the animation and the quirky and lovable characters. The main thing about an animation that can either make you love it more or not is the casting. I feel that a voice actor must have the perfect voice that matches the character in the movie otherwise it can be rather distracting from the movie. Fortunately, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs not only has a brilliant cast but all of their voices matches the characters perfectly.Some of the cast include Anna Faris, James Caan, Bruce Campbell, Mr. T and Neil Patrick Harris and all do a magnificent job in lending their voices to their characters. The writing is quite smart as, even though this is a children's animated movie, it's so much more than that. In the imaginative, bright story lies a subtle message about confidence and parental guidance and surely enough, the audience will see that message shine through in the movie. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is something that is not only original but absolutely funny as well and very memorable. I have never heard of the book before (in fact, I didn't even know it was a book until I saw the credits at the end of the movie) but if you want to see a children's movie that makes you laugh as well as charms you, then look no further than Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.The movie is something that both adults and children will enjoy and is a prime example of what is a perfect family movie. With the voices adding to the characters and the brilliantly colourful animation, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is something that you will not forget in a hurry. The movie may not be the same quality as Disney or Pixar but it's close enough so well done to Sony. The only regret I have about this movie is that I did not go to see it in 3D because I could imagine it being fantastic, however the movie itself is brilliant. Also, I might add, Steve is probably one of the best animated characters I have ever watched! To the people who have a soft spot for animation, you do not want to miss this feast.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"We could live underground, and use bacon for clothes.","In 2009, two of the best cartoons ever made were released. One is Up, the other is Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. This movie was just amazing.Animation - I have never seen a cartoon so detailed, even in a Pixar film. Sony went all out to create a level of quality that has to be watched more than once to appreciate. From the reflection in characters eyes, to the movement of their hair and clothing to the simulation of falling food, the production team spared no effort to make everything as realistic as possible. And if you mute the sound, you can actually read lips when someone is talking.Voice Acting - A superb performance was given by every actor, especially Bill Hader. Although most cartoons have gotten really good at this, it is still worth mentioning here.Humor - This is without a doubt the funniest animated film I have ever seen. A lot of slapstick coupled with hilarious lines and comical facial expressions. Again, more than one viewing will reveal something that you may have missed the first time around.Story - A lot of people were disappointed that the story was so far off from the book. And although I respect that point of view, it shouldn't distract from what is a great story in it's own right. It had some good messages, such as the effects of over indulgence, being who you are despite your appearance and keeping your goals in life simple. And it does it without coming across the least bit preachy.But as no movie is perfect, so it is the same with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. I think it could of done with a little less of the Baby Brent character and the end wasn't quite as funny as the rest of the movie. But maybe the biggest disappointment was the use of mild foul language. I am not sure why they had to include the phrase ""Holy crap balls"" or even ""hell hole"" when making a movie that has kids as it's target audience. It cheapens the movie a little for lines that could have easily been omitted.Regardless of it's minor drawbacks, I still highly recommend seeing this movie. And then seeing it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs: Gonna Need an Anti-acid Too,"I remember when I was five-years-old, going down to my local library with all of the other little children on a class field-trip to get the average gander of what exactly happen in a library. To start off the trip, a stooped and arthritic little figure read us this magical book, where food and drink fell from the sky every day. The idea was glorious, and for all of the little kids around, we were mesmerized. Little did I know that this one story would help spur my way into writing (and being slightly overweight as a child), but it would also help create an interesting little movie some thirty years after it was publishedThe movie, directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, takes the simple concept of food falling from the sky and pushes it to the next level with Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader). Flint is an amateur inventor whose projects just don't seem to work out right in their dying town. Yet when his invention that turns water into food is propelled into the upper atmosphere, Flint becomes the hero of the town and starts filling out orders for everyone's favorite treat. However, there is always a price to these simplistic and harmless looking miracles, and weather girl/love interest Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) has to help Flint before he inadvertently causes the end to his little town, and the rest of the world.Visually, it isn't anything spectacular. It does have its moments of sparkle; a glass shattering here or water splashing there, but that's all that she wrote. Yet what this movie lacks in jaw-dropping finesse, it brings back in marvelous color. The town of Chewandswallow begins stark and grey, since it's an obvious dying and boring town. Yet once Flint turns on his machine, the hues of red, gold, blue, and everything in between shine through. It's truly a movie to play with if you have a Blu-Ray player and have been desperate to test it out with something with the kids.And speaking of kids, this is a well-done kids movie that keep anyone entertained. Jokes come fast and come in a manner that leaves you laughing for a minute or two, only to catch your breath and the have another joke thrown in your face. Although half of it is slapstick for the younger audience, it is done tastefully enough that you can at least appreciate the majority of the jokes. They respectfully forgo any and all of the body humor jokes, keeping it upscale (or as much as you can in a movie where the characters gorge themselves), leaving you simply happy by the end of it.The voice actors did a great job bringing their characters to life. Hader and Faris together create a cornucopia of awkwardness that propels the story and love interest. Hader himself did an amazing job with bringing his character to life, making you almost believe that someone as eccentric as Flint could live right behind you. Faris could have potentially toned down her peppy honestly, yet with the help of the supporting cast like Mr. T (who did an amazing job being himself, small wonder) it was hardly noticeable.All in all, this is just a nice and respectable movie to watch with the family or with a big group of friends after a long day. I could see myself enjoying this over and over really, without having any problems against it. Unfortunately, the issues of getting hungry as you watch this movie, that doesn't go away in fact it just gets worse as it goes on. By the time the credits roll, you better be planning something for a midnight snack, or you will be kicking yourself for it later.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cloudy: 8/10,"A delight and delicious to watch, Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs is beautifully crafted, nicely executed, and looked stunning.Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) thinks he's a genius. But none of the things he invented are things that make sense or are useful which is why he shouldn't be inventing things if you ask me. However, he has the support of his mother but when she dies, he's left alone with his father (James Cann) who thinks he should give it up (agree). When the community that he lives in, is in an economic crisis because their primary source of income a sardine cannery was shut down, Flint decides to try his latest invention, a machine that can turn water into food. But something goes wrong and the machine ends up in the atmosphere. Later it starts raining food like hamburgers, pizza, hot dogs, etc... And so the shifty mayor tries to use this as a way to help their community. But when Flint sense something's wrong with the machine, the mayor convinces him to ignore it. But as Flint predict chaos ensues. So not to ruin the story, something bad happened.It is funny and gut-wrenching, but at the same time it is hopeful with Flint's dreams almost coming true. This is Sony Picture's better animations and probably their best of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I really wanted to love this film,"I almost feel guilty for not liking this film. It has so many great ingredients and the team clearly put a lot of effort and heart into it. The main character's aspirations, the gags, the side characters, the animation, the imagination - oh, it was all so wonderful! Where can I even begin? But alas, the story was just so thin and predictable. The plot felt like an eleven-minute cartoon short expanded to a feature length movie. Relatable inventor makes some mad science, mad science goes mad, inventor saves the day. The other content like Flint's interactions with his father and Sam had a lot of potential but it ends up rather flat. Everything except the story is a solid 8/10, yet I can't ignore the story, so I have to belatedly give it 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A different animated film.,"As the title says, that was the feeling that I got. The animation, physics, and sounds are quite different from a lot of stuff done before.I was not completely sure what exactly the movie was, but the title gives a good hint. The story was quite sweet and the animation was brilliant and very visual. The dialog fit right in with all the movements of the characters. And there were plenty of moments to laugh.I have not read the book, but if the movie is anything like the book, then every kid (and adult) would have a blast watching the film. I only docked some points for not being quite as satisfying as many other animated films have been.All in all, I was quite content and have very high expectations for the sequel.

The epitome of obnoxious late 2000's / 2010's animation films,"As 3D animation films became more popular in the 2000s, there seemed to be a later surge of films with an obnoxious energy to them (i.e. The Lorax). Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is once such case. It feels like the movie can't go without a minute of having some weird slapstick humor. Not enough time is given to truly emotionally connect with the characters, because the constant absurd humor takes away from the seriousness. And funnily enough, the near constant absurd humor takes away from the absurdity of the jokes the writers were trying to make. There's so many ""weird"" moments in this film that none of the humorous moments really stand out. It feels like the writers were throwing a bunch of ideas, hoping one thing would stick. But like a bunch of food falling from the sky, the sheer volume of it all just ends up making the whole thing feel gross.So the obnoxious humor and pacing is what mostly bogs down this movie for me, though I barely discussed the plot. When you look past the humor, the story itself is pretty bare-bones. The main character Flint designs a machine that rains food, the town takes advantage of it and things expediently go too far when a villain wants to use it. There's also a love relationship thrown in. Overall it's a pretty standard plot for a children's movie. I think the story would have had more depth if they removed the ""villain"" character and focused more on the conflict between the inventor and the town as a whole. Otherwise the plot is pretty basic, though the animation is unique at times. It's cool to see how the town transforms when it's covered with food.Overall Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs isn't the most offensive movie, it can just feel a bit too high energy for the sake of it. And I'm judging this film on it's own merits; this is definitely separate from the 1978 book that it's based off of. So I'm not rating this down based on a bias from the book, I just think it's a mediocre film in general.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A foodtastic adventure,"Rating-8/10Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a charming animation full of great designs, voices and jokes and that all makes this a movie that all the family can enjoy. It doesn't lack the laughs as I say and some parts make you laugh out loud, the story is a little crazy but if you go a long with it then you will thoroughly enjoy it. I thought it to be solidly a very good movie and here below is why so.The plot is random but all about food and so if you are eager to get hungry whilst watching a film then this is the one to see. The plot I did feel goes just a little fast but in any case you can really enjoy it and yet again, if you get into the flow of it all, you really like it. It is funny and surprised me, it genuinely has funny jokes and things going on and the creative side of the movie is so richly made you will love the heart of it's creation.The voice cast are strong and people such as Bill Hader and Anna Faris contribute brilliantly with there voices. I loved the animation style here and the movement is a little unrealistic but hey, it's an animation basically aimed towards kids so it is just good old fun. With people like James Caan, Mr T and Andy Samberg this film really throws random people at you but they totally work out.Phil Lord and Chris Miller direct and write this and do a great job, they masterfully make this funny and sweet, yet also good fun to watch so that by the end, people from 6 to 60 can be joyful at what they just saw. The detail in the animation is kind of basic but when it comes to the food, well it is beautiful and the movie does seem a lot to make food which isn't so nice, actually look pretty delicious.My main criticism probably comes with the end, I wasn't too keen on the final scenes and what happens etc, mostly because the movie is very along one line then BAM! The ending creates a whole new side twist(some may love the ending though). Some jokes are repeated but hey they are funny in the first place so I don't think there are a lot of places where you can poke holes in this piece.You may expect me to recommend to this to children, well I do because children should love it, the plot and the comedy will make kids laugh and have a great bit of fun. With the adults well, the plot may not draw in older people as much but the jokes should find your funny bone somewhere along the line and you may find this one gem of an animation, and a film you may want to see again one day.Overall I give this a 8/10 and felt it to be a Solidly Impressive movie and one which comes close to animation greatness. I think a recurring theme in this review is that adults can also enjoy this and I can't stress that enough, if any kids out there are reading this review and you loved the film, then spread the word to every adult in the world that not every animation aimed at kids, is only made for the kids.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Delicious,"Pixar is the undisputed king of the animated. According to tradition, no other studio is even able to hold a candle to the impeccably written/rendered masterpieces the Disney-affiliated atelier continues to churn out year after year. With the critical acclaim Dreamworks' How to Train Your Dragon has recently received, though, the previous is quickly becoming an antiquated notion. Recently, another brilliantly written (and directed) animated feature—which, for some inexplicable reason, somehow managed to drift under the radar of the popular eye—was released and serves as a great example of how the competition is heating up for the hitherto unchallenged Pixar. I present to you Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.The story follows a down-and-out inventor named Flint Lockwood. He lives with is dad and is considered ""the local crackpot."" Flint's hometown—which is situated on an island in the middle of the Atlantic— has fallen upon dire financial straits after its chief source of revenue (a sardine canning plant) closed its doors. Flint, however, has come up with a device that he believes will preserve the sanity of his fellow citizens, who, in addition to facing sever monetary problems, have been forced to consume the leftover sardines from the cannery. The nifty little contraption he's created converts water vapor to food. We're talking ice cream, spaghetti, pizza, chips, etc. When Flint attempts to hook his machine up to a more sufficient power source than he's afforded in his lab on stilts, things go haywire, and his food-maker is launched into the stratosphere. Before anyone knows what's happened, hamburgers begin falling from the sky. Flint soon realizes that he can broadcast a signal to his device and control the items it releases. Soon the entrepreneurial spirit of the town's mayor takes over, and greed becomes the order of the day.I know what you're thinking: this all sounds very familiar. WALL-E tackled similar themes, and it addressed them so beautifully that it seems like Meatballs couldn't possibly be anything more than an afterthought withering in Pixar's massive shadow. Surprisingly, this is very far from the truth. Don't make the mistake of dismissing this as ""more of the same"": it's not. Actually, it's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I'm saying this as an adult male who typically finds the comedy in animated features strained and flat. Here, I laughed out loud at regular intervals. The humor is subtle, nuanced, and often nothing short of riotous (parodying everything from viral videos to blockbuster action flicks).I don't think I can heap enough praise on the cleverly constructed story and the superbly timed comedy, so I'll drive my point home by saying that Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs will delight you in the most unexpected ways.In fact, you should go watch it. Right now.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Surprising But Great Movie!,"I don't know what really made me see this film. I just saw this film with my best friend out of my instincts.

The main character is a failure of an inventor. Everyone thinks he's an outcast. One day, he invents a food machine. Due to a problem, the machine goes into the clouds and starts raining food. But too much food can cause problems.This film certainly has a talented voice cast of Anna Faris, Bill Hader, James Caan, Al Roker, and more. They're all really good.

Not complete balls.,"Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs (2009)-While this film is fun enough to entertain kids with it's totally farcical and unbelievable story, it didn't completely grip me.It was lacking something that the others of its genre have and I can't quite put my finger on it. Perhaps it is because it's so hard to believe? That the story is just so obscure that the usual jokes and humour can't get through?I love the animation of Tim (The Dad) and Manny, who is also probably the funniest character and Mr T as the Police Officer was a great choice too. With Steve the Monkey thrown in, the ensemble cast should have had more screen time, which I think is resolved a bit more in the next one. I think that they were where the jokes should have come from.They are all played by a very competent voice cast too.There is nothing to complain about with regards to production or delivery, so I think that it is the storyline and direction that needed to be looked at.Overall, I can see the appeal for a younger audience. It's daft, it's got junk food and it's colourful with lots of nutty characters, but I just feel it lacks a bit of substance and perhaps a moral message. I'd be interested to see just how far off the story is from the original book.317.61/1000.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

Just Enjoy It...,"Based on Judi Barrett's 1978 children's book of the same name, CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS hits the right spot for kids and adults alike. It is whimsical almost to the point of such old cartoons as The Road Runner and Popeye. Which I found to be a refreshing break from the more in-your-face animated features that try to stuff political/social commentary down our gullets (see WALL-E and HAPPY FEET as two that did this to an extreme degree). Now I'm not saying that we shouldn't try and educate little Johnny and Jane, but we should, sometimes, give their minds a break and allow them a moment of sheer entertainment. And CWaCoMB does that.Take one part kid scientist-wannabe and add to the mix an intelligent weather forecaster and a father who wants his son to join the family business, and you get spaghetti tornadoes, cheeseburger hailstorms, and Jello castles. Yep. That's the type of whimsy I'm talking about.Bill Hader (TROPIC THUNDER) stars as the voice for Flint Lockwood, the crazy kid scientist who's creations seem to go wrong more often than not. But his one creation, a machine that mutates water into food, is a resounding success. That is, until something goes terribly wrong. But before it does, Flint meets up with sexy newscaster Sam Sparks (Anna Faris, MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND), who caught a break and is on the scene in Flint's sardine stricken town when his new machine launches itself into the stratosphere and starts making it rain food. Sam is very excited by this astronomical development. But on Flint's other side is his father, Tim (James Caan), who only wants his son to stop these ridiculous experiments and get into the family bait and tackle business.As Flint's machine begins raining down watermelons instead of water, the people of Flint's town become enamored with their new whiz kid and the world's interest in their little corner of the globe. This includes town Mayor Shelbourne (Bruce Campbell, SPIDERMAN 3) who's gluttonous nature (in both food and fame) lead not just their own town, but nearly the entire planet, into ruin. Flint's machine goes into overload mode when too much is asked of it and, in fact, it begins to resemble features we've seen in various science fiction films. Remember the egg layer in ALIENS? Make sure you look at the machine whenever Flint and his crew catch up to it toward the end of the film. And sentient food that plans to destroy its maker? Foodinator! (Ahem... I mean Terminator). And remember the first STAR TREK motion picture with V-GER? How the Enterprise had to go through layers of V-GER's outer ""ship"" in order to reach its core? Keep an eye out for those similarities, too.So the film has a few extra bangs for fans that pay attention. But even if you don't, it'll still be very entertaining. And it won't be shoving poli-sci junk down your throat, which ought to at least please a few of us on news media overload.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Solid fun,"Life isn't always easy if you're a young inventor. Especially not if some of your experiments run into disaster. It isn't any different for the lead character in this animation film - wanting to save the city he lives in from becoming a ghost town he invents a machine that can turn water into food. And while the idea sounds good it has all the potential to turn into a full flexed catastrophe.Intended for a younger audience this film plays around the invention and the effects it has on the city and its denizens while skipping lightly over a couple heavier subtopics - those go way over the heads of the smallest ones in the audience but fit right in there for their legal guardians.The animation style used is great - a wild color scheme, lots of exaggerated forms, heavily characterized persons (both in style and actual behavior).All in all it makes for a hilarious film that will have the entire audience laughing.8 out of 10 meatballs in a storm.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

And you could just hear on the actors that they had a lot of fun doing the movie, and they really did an amazing job with the actor performances, they just seem so happy when telling the story, and it reflects the whole movie, just fun...anyway this is it for my little review, go see it if you wan't to have a good time and some good laughs... It is definitely better than most animated movies, and I rate it a 9 out of 10...See you all!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing Work by Bill Hader,"As more studios dive into making animations which is great a problem emerges and that is cliche storylines which this movie suffers heavily from this problem. Watching 30 percent of the movie you can figure out all the rest. That being said, the voice acting of Bill Hader is right on the spot and the other casts are good as well. I hope that someday all animation movies can be as good as Pixar's animations.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Inventive and Funny,"Up until the last 20 minutes or so, this captures all the best aspects of a Lord / Miller picture: clever dialogue, sharp humor, honesty in its childlike moralism, and characters that reflect reality even in their over-the-top skin.

Cloudy with a Chance of Heart,"They can do great and inventive animation at the drop of a hat these days, as evidenced by Storks and Book of Life I've seen recently, so to be REALLY good, it must come down to story and pacing and emotional investment. That kind of thing can leave an otherwise inventive film like Book of Life in the dust, especially when compared to a similar film like Coco. It can leave a film like Storks somewhere decidedly in the middle of the pack, even when charming. And it can raise a film you don't necessarily expect much from, like Cloudy with a Chance. Despite some hyper, overblown action, especially towards the end, there is something sweet at its core, a story about a bullied, quirky scientist who finds acceptance by all the wrong people with his invention that turns water into food, his sweet relationship with the weather girl until he almost ruins it with his newfound fame, and the disconnected relationship he has with his Dad. It's very sweet, and I identified - a lot - with the feelings and motivations of the main character. So in the end, this one winds up being the best of the three most recent animated films I've seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

HORRIBLE AND OVERRATED MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sony Pictures Animation is one of, if not, the WORST animation studio that makes movies. They have only made two good movies themselves (Surf's Up and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse). Just because I love those two films (as well as being some of the ONLY movies I like) doesn't mean I have to admire Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. I still like some of their animated films, including those NOT made by Sony Animation, like Monster House and a few others, but Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs?!? CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS?!?!? This movie is BEYOND overrated!!!!! I cannot believe I used to watch this mess of an animated movie back when it was released!!!!!! The writing is awful and gives out a very generic plot, the humour sucks, the characters are hateable (especially Flint!!!), the villain is stupid, and everything about it is stereotypical!!!!! Not to mention that it has some of the WORST animation in the history of cinema, where the characters look disgusting and move in a way that is so bad it can be considered UNWATCHABLE!!!!! It also enforces the stereotype that animation is a kids genre!!!!! For no reason, this film was put in the level of GOOD quality Sony movies, such as Surf's Up, Arthur Christmas, The Pirates! Band of Misfits, Monster House, and Spider-Verse. How come Cloudy gets the same treatment as Monster House, yet Surf's Up doesn't?!?!? I cannot believe I used to like this film back before AniMat reviewed both this film and its sequel (I'll explain soon!). Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is BEYOND overrated. Why was Bill Hader in this movie?!?!? It CLEARLY wasted his talent when voicing Flint Lockwood!!!!! And don't even get me started on the sequel, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 (THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!), as well as the TV series, which are BOTH WORSE than the original film!!! I suggest you DON'T watch the movie at all, and instead stick with the book it was based on. The book has aged way better than the movie, and has something that the movie never did -- a professional artist who worked on it.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
A hilarious adaptation with lots of healthy lessons.,"One of the most memorable books of my childhood was Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. I was skeptical a short book with no plot could become a feature-length movie. But, just like trying new foods, I gave Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009) a chance. The result was something hilarious that both kids and adults could enjoy on different levels. Somehow, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller transformed this beloved book into a fun movie with lots of valid points about life.For their first film, Lord and Miller knocked it out of the park with their style of humor. It was goofy. It was smart. There's no doubt that this movie helped catapult them into other projects like The LEGO Movie (2014). Sure, there were the occasional bathroom humor bits, but there were so few of them as to not ruin the vibe. The voice acting fit perfectly with the characters, and the animation style was loose and frenetic enough to match the feel of enormous food falling from the sky.What's perhaps overlooked here are the great lessons this movie can teach kids. Flint (Bill Hader) has the confidence to follow his dream of being a scientist/inventor-despite several setbacks. Sam (Anna Faris) overcame her embarrassment of being smart and broke out of her shell placed on her by society. Even Tim (James Caan) could finally connect with his son and tell him how proud he was of him. Similar to eating their vegetables, these are all things kids should learn early so they can develop into emotionally mature teens. Overall, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a full plate of family fun.A hilarious adaptation with lots of healthy lessons, I give Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I'm not even a fan of CG animation but I loved this movie.,"Somehow, this movie made me forget my dislike of the exaggerated style of animation most CG animated movies tend to have. It just somehow felt more like a classic 2D comedy cartoon in its style and execution. This is also my kind of humor in both dialogue and screenplay, almost every funny bit actually makes me laugh, sometimes a lot. It's hard to believe I live in a world where this has a 6.9 while Despicable Me has a 7.6. This is one of the few actually funny movies I've seen in general in the past 2 decades. I usually have to go back to Hollywood classics for my kind of comedy, especially silent classics like anything from Charlie Chaplin or Harold Lloyd.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A good film that should be as famous as everything good about me and my fans,"This is one of those things in life that should exist, and it does, and people gained faith in humanity because of it. Although that Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs doesn't have some creativity with food and a bit of heart, it doesn't change the fact that it's a good movie that delivers a familiar story, along with likable characters, and possibly the best animation in the history of cinema, if i must make a recommendation, just watch the movie, that thing should even be as popular as it is now, and read the original book it was based on, I can tell you that the book has a lot of charm and pleasant and it has something that the movie did have during it's making, a professional artist who worked on it. Would this be the best animated film out there? Yes, i will say it's as good as it's average sequel or most of the Weinstein films, but if that's the case, would that be the reason why I have a celebration with this film, because, it's a good movie? Well, technically yes, but not quite, the full answer is much more complex. Animation is having a easy time to be a film medium except a genre only meant for kids. What this film is doing is enforcing that stereotype making the industry look good by presenting something only film buffs with a sense of good quality can easily be distracted too, but what makes it even better in this case is how people are so giving to this film just by how it is as a good film mediums film, and the minor novelties it offered, rather it be from the character animation and design, to the big use of respectable actors like Mr. T, Neil Patrick Harris, James Caan, and Bruce Campbell, and the fact that this is the directorial debut of Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who would leave Sony Animation in order to make more good films for once. Just because it's niceness, it gives the public a idea that all animated films are just cool cartoons only catered to buffs. And what makes this even better is that Sony Animation is continuing to enforce this notion with more films that continue the tradition of good writing and awesome overly-cartoony animation. Because of the news of the company is moving from LA, California to Vancouver, Canada, I will pray for the industry's sake that this means a fresh start for Sony, but otherwise they will see the same fate as those who stood in Vancouver. If there will ever be a day when animation will be looked upon, then this film should just stay, in the coolness that shares with other films of the same quality, like Layton and the Eternal Diva, Mars Needs Moms and Space Chimps, because like the mentioned, this is nothing more than cartoon art. In fact, as Flint Lockwood himself said it best ""this is art, this is art, this is art."" and for the art that it is, the only thing it deserves, is the Coltonversal. Seal. Of. Approval!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The original concept was maximized and none of those corny animation antics or script was on the film. The animation itself was impressive. The colors and vibrant hues were the best part of the animation. It was so on-point that the senses of the audience were surely satisfied, leaving them in awe of it. The dubbing was also ahead of its time. It was very well-made that the script itself would be impossible to produce outside of the film.

Raining cans and hotdogs.,"'Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs (2009)' might just about be Lord and Miller's weakest film, but that just goes to show how good they truly are. Frankly, this would be most people's magnum opus. While many of this flick's jokes can be seen - at least, in spirit - in their later entries with slightly tighter timing and, perhaps, bigger scope, that doesn't reduce their often absolute hilarity and general inventiveness. The fact that you can see where they've improved doesn't make their first attempt any less successful. It's great. The meat-and-potatoes of the piece - or, at least, its comedy - is the sight-gag, the funniest of which involves a walking TV stealing a man from an electronics shop during a riot (you just have to see it). It's very funny and it's very fun, too, which is arguably more important. It also has a well-rounded, fast-paced and fairly moving story chock full of memorable and endearing characters. The cherry on the food-pile is its colourful, cartoony animation which makes each frame a feast for the eyes. It's just so enjoyable. The amount of, often, genuine belly-laughs is impressive, to boot. I guess the way to your heart really is through your stomach. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Works on Every Level,"Simple enough concept for young children to laugh at, yet builds in plenty of more subtle layers of humor for older kids and adults. In particular the various winks at sci-fi tropes are especially funny, but there are almost always a few levels of whatever the primary joke might seem to be. The casting is absolutely perfect, and using Mr. T to play a manic super-cop, ultra dedicated father version of himself was inspired. Bill Hader and Anna Ferris both bring plenty of energy to their roles, though obviously it's really Hader as the quirky science good who carries the movie.The animation is well done, though no one was looking to break any new ground per se.

Makes me hungry,"The only way to solve world hunger is if it happens free of cost and everyone gets as much as they want all the time. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a movie that is about exploring this idea. The film follows Flint, a gifted scientist who uses his mind to come up with this idea. Although this movie mostly makes no sense and is not suitable for a mature audience, it does not pretend to do so. It is what it is. While writing this review I learnt this is a book adaptation which was originally published in 1978. So considering that I believe the author would have really liked this movie.Flint is a character who is all about creating weird, wacky things without caring about the consequences. It is very similar to a superhero comic I've been making, so I can very well understand how much thought goes into showing what all things the protagonist makes in order to make the audience believe the tall claim. The problem here is, however, it is never shown why he suddenly decided to make a machine that can create food. It was never established that the whole town has been eating his father's sardines, nor it has been shown that Flint was made to eat the sardines. It was only said that his father wants him to sell them. Also there was no problem of poverty on the island either, so none of that really mattered.Then there was the introduction of Sam Sparks, who was introduced as a journalist that really pretended to not look like a nerd. The character seemed annoying until it was told how she became the way she is. And honestly the transformation should not have happened. From what was established, her glasses were of near-sightedness, so she has hypermetropia and thus she should only wear glasses when she needs to read. Also the song ""Four eyes, four eyes, you need glasses to see!"" got embedded in my brain after watching this movie. It also comes to my mind whenever I play Brawlhalla.Seeing the food from the sky really makes me hungry. Many people ask if you were to live in a fictional world, which one you will choose. If I had to choose, I'd say this one. The food which gets thrown away can help me last a lifetime. This is the reason why the climax scene didn't scare me at all. I'd gladly die that way, if it meant not eating gruel for breakfast the way I have always been doing since the pandemic started. But then again, this is just my personal problem because of the situation we are all in right now. This is a part of the original story so I won't blame the movie for this.I'm not sure the original story had Flint and Sam blow their cheeks while kissing though, so I'd definitely call that out. Overall considering all the creative liberty that this movie took, this was the only thing I found annoying. Other than that I liked everything about this. The character of Baby Brent, the police officer, the mayor - everyone was very well done. It's a good thing this movie turned into a franchise, because of which we will be able to see these characters more in the future.Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is just what you'd want to watch if you have nothing better to do and want to spend some time with children. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and is an adaptation of a children's book, plus the animation is also pretty good so you will definitely not want to miss out this one if you're watching all the 3D animated movies of the current times. A definite watch from my recommendation.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Silly and Absurdist; With Adult Themes.,"I have read the book;t this is definitely the best film you will ever get base on off of a children's book. These sequel is meh, and unnecessary, though still fun, but the first film is pretty subversive. It is well animated, not sure what some people are talking about, I am guessing the fact that the characters are more cartoons, and less realistic. Here is the thing though, this film is quite absurdist in it's approach, where it presented in a more realistic manner, well, it would be so awful barely anyone would enjoy it. The animators did the right hing by making things more on the cartoons side. It is goofy looking, the story is goofy, the characters are goofy, the dialog is goofy, the whole thing is just goofy and silly; and though it still has some deep themes.When I watched this the first time, I was blown away, and I still love it; though I totally get why some people hate it, it is not for everyone. It isn't as though the themes in the film were new; success perverts and destroys a community and the character has to get back to his roots to fix this, it is a story we have seen time and again. What sets this film apart is it's unabashedly cartoons and absurdist approach, it is not afraid to be so incredibly goofy you either get angry.
It really is more than a children's film, the second film is certainly more of a straight up kid's film, the first one strives to appeal to both children and adults, and it mostly succeeds. The father and son relationship is fantastic, and the whole village is filled with silly and ridiculous characters, and some that you want to punch that you later end up liking, ie Baby Brent. I don't think I can downplay that this film is absurd, and their's a good chance you'll hate it, but that is truly what makes it endearing. The studio took a chance making a film based on a tiny children's book, a film that is film with the truly weird and bizarre and absurd, and that in and of itself is admirable. It almost achieves greatness, but even if it doesn't quite get there, it is pretty darn close.God Bless ~Amy",,Anonymous,Animation
"Unlike most other animated movies, this has an ideal premise","I don't watch new animated movies anymore. I think ever since the original Toy Story, decent ideas for movie animation have declined. Making an animated movie and merely coming up with something (original or not) isn't enough. It should be something that's worth the trip to the theater. It doesn't have to be original, but I do expect something worthwhile. ""Monster House"" is such an example. I thought the characters and story were pleasant enough. Anyway, ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" is one of those rare quality animated movies that's actually worthy of itself. I saw the 3-D version, but I'm sorry to say that I don't recall seeing absolutely any 3-D. Was I wearing the glasses for nothing? Aside from wearing the glasses, this movie is by no means a waste of time.*** out of ****",,Anonymous,Animation
"A rapid-fire, zany, daft and fun romp that is very tongue-in-cheek and feel-good","It's pretty clear from the start when the Sony Pictures Animation logo comes up that this is not a film that'll take itself too seriously and rightly so, given the main concept: food, falling from the sky like rain.The voice acting is pretty solid all round - Hader as the misunderstood scientist, Caan as the doubting dad Tim, Faris as the bubbly reporter Sam and of course Mr T playing what seems to be an enthusiastic acrobatic policeman.Plot-wise it's really simple, clichéd and predictable. The main characters are archetypes. I thought while watching it, some gags were so quick, it's as if they threw as many jokes as they could at the wall, and what stuck, they kept.OTT and sometimes bizarre, some jokes are very funny in a silly way, and a few are witty. Some don't work as they try to hard, but these days, family animated films seem to think that's the best way to keep ADD kids interested through constant jokes and it shouldn't always be like that.I didn't like the romance between Sam and Flint as it just felt very forced - hey Hollywood, not everyone of the opposite sex with similar interests needs to end up together, you know. Seriously, it's getting annoying.Also didn't like Mr T's character repeating the 'I love you son' - got a bit mushy for my taste. Maybe some realism in there like maybe the uneaten mountain of food rotting with maggots, since the pile mostly looked like a giant kid's fake plastic food used for for make-believe role playing.The animation is pretty decent. I still think they could've incorporated the illustrations from the picture book(which I've never read, but have seen the cover online), to give it a very distinctive seventies look.What is in there, character design wise, looks like Betty Spaghetti dolls mixed with a dash of Pixar. So, generic, but does the job as it's colourful and blockily animated, that gives it that instant familiarity that should make it accessible.The score is good, although with such a fantasy plot as raining food, there could've been more creative and innovative themes. I liked the song Raining Sunshine at the end, though.Overall: It's not brilliant, but for what it sets out to do, which is pretty much 77 mins of diverting and funny entertainment, there are far worse options out there.Bright, bonkers and fun, all ages should devour this easily.If this film could be described as a weather forecast, it'd be sunny intervals.",,Anonymous,Animation
Fun and Humorous Film for the Whole Family,"With his hometown of Swallow Falls teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, would-be super inventor Flint Lockwood unleashes his newest creation on the world and watches as it literally takes on a life of his own. After failed inventions like Ratbirds, Monkey Translators, and non-flying Flying Cars, Flint introduces a machine that instantly pops out any food that you might ask it for. In a town that almost exclusively dines upon sardines, this is potentially big business. His invention, however, somehow shoots itself off into space and, like a satellite sending TV signals back down to the population, drops giant quantities of food onto the plates of Swallow Falls. This makes Flint a hero, of course, but the popularity only leads to big problems, mainly due to the fact that the townspeople want more and more, finally taking the machine past the point of safety and smothering the town (and the world) in giant bagels, hamburgers, and the obligatory meatballs. Flint and his gang must stop the machine before the food overtakes the entire world.""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is based on a beloved children's book of the same name. Visually speaking it is unquestionably one of the better non-Pixar animated films I've ever seen. Absolutely stunning visuals. The story is quite original (obviously) and it's very easy to get sucked into to the absurdity of the tale. And the voice talent is as good as you could possibly get for an animated feature. Every voice is a somebody and more importantly, all of the voices work in concert and no one voice dominates the screen. ""Cloudy"" isn't the funniest cartoon movie I've ever seen but there are enough laughs to go around. What is it that is so funny about a talking animal? Dug the talking dog was perhaps the best character in ""Up"" last year and in this case Steve the talking monkey brought about more laughs for me than anything else. Somebody needs to study this phenomenon. Anyway, the overall impact of ""Cloudy"" doesn't quite reach the heights of the Pixar products or Dreamworks' ""How to Train Your Dragon"" but it is a quality film with a fantastic world in which to operate and a great deal of fun.My site, the Soap Box Office: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com",,Anonymous,Animation
