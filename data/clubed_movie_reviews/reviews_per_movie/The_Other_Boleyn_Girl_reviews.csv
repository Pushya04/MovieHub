Eh... Nice costumes and sets,"If you want a good movie about Henry VIII and Anne Bolyen, rent Anne of the Thousand Days. That was a film that used history to tell a story about real people who had a love to change a nation.In this version of the eponymous Phillipa Gregory novel, historical inaccuracies abound. Approximately fifteen years are compressed into two hours with no indication time has gone by except for various babies. None of the characters ever change or grow any older. The characters in this movie are completely one-sided. Anne is ambitious. Henry is a womanizer. Mary is simple. No one has any complexities. The sisterly rivalry plays out like an underdeveloped soap opera.On the other hand, the film is engaging and the costumes lovely. Same with the gorgeous palace settings.Eye candy it is. Truthful or realistic it isn't.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Sometimes the Truth is Stranger Than Fiction,"A quick glimpse at the Tudor family line on Wikipedia will yield hundreds of years of made-for-movie material, but none quite as compelling as the story of Anne Boleyn. Pair a classic story with airy language, beautiful sets and costumes, and some A-list names and you have Oscar magic in the making. Right? Well, not always. We've seen it before and we're not necessarily impressed with royalty anymore. The Other Boleyn Girl offers new perspectives and dramatic angles on the saga of wives that is Henry VIII's legacy, but nearly drowns in melodrama.And it's not entirely the movie's fault. Boleyn Girl follows the story of both Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) Boleyn and their relationship with the English court. King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) has trouble producing a male heir, so the Boleyn family offers their daughter Anne to bed. When Henry has a hunting accident due to Anne's carelessness, he is nursed and subsequently charmed by innocent Mary. But Mary is already married, so the King promotes her husband and sends the couple to court where he can meet with Mary whenever he pleases. Mary falls in love with Henry and becomes his mistress. Anne, the elder sister, is scorned by what she believes is her sister's ultimate betrayal, and plots revenge. The two continue on in these roles for some time, swapping places in bed with Henry and spurting out babies while their relatives egg them on. This isn't quite how things went down in reality, but the changes are minor and seem necessary to condense the timeline and create at least one sympathetic character.The Other Boleyn Girl fares best when it's exploring the relationship between Anne and Mary. This isn't the first story of sister rivalry, but the dynamic between Anne and Mary is extraordinarily well-played. Their previous roles and their public images make Portman and Johansson perfect fits. We believe Portman to be intelligent and coy, and Johansson to be naive and desired. More - we believe these roles might be easily reversed. As sisters, their relationship is deeply disturbing: they love each other, they hate each other, they're unable to escape the expectations placed upon them by their family. As an older sister (with an admittedly not-as-screwed-up relationship), I found this portrayal very realistic - rich with emotion and complex meaning.I wish I could say the rest of the movie was as artful. There's constant allusion and foreshadowing to the Boleyn demise through use of visual and editing metaphors. If some details were twisted, other details might have been cut out - too many tear-filled scenes means that this eventually feels like a soap opera. At one point in the movie, Anne is sent off to France and comes back wearing a very distracting ""B"" charm, which she sports until the end of the movie. When I finally finished inventing what else ""B"" might stand for (besides Boleyn, there are plenty of other fits), I wondered about Anne's character. She's now praised as being changed and thus back in play, but I don't see it - she was smart and ambitious before, and only gained a bit of wit during her trip to France - certainly not the drastic change everyone seemed to be making it out to be. There are some very poorly done scenes where supporting cast spell out the politics of the situation for you. This is a little condescending and probably unnecessary, if not repetitive. The costumes are beautiful, but the matching dresses become unbelievable and even plain in places. PETA must have a field day with this movie and its use of fur and meat. You won't get to see Scarlett Johansson naked in this movie, in case you were wondering - just lots of fuzzy sex montages, weirdly full of backlit hair and fur. Katherine of Aragon (Henry VIII's first wife) is given some of the most powerful lines in the movie, but they're delivered with such woodenness that my disappointment must be made known.The Other Boleyn Girl could be so much more. As a hyper-dramatic costume flick, it does stand out. There's more than meets your eye, and the costarring performances are not to be missed. There's a lot of material to cover in this story, but a simplified script would have helped keep this film farther away from melodrama. Especially with a true story as wild as this, there's not a lot that needs to be changed or added to grip the viewer. Any embellishments verge on destroying believability and creating situations we can't relate to.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Don't go expecting accuracy!,"Overall, the movie is entertaining. I thought the acting was good, particularly Scarlett Johansson's. The cinematography and editing leave much to be desired, and the entire movie seems rushed. If you have any knowledge of Tudor history,you will recognize the many inaccuracies, but those did not bother me as much as did the fact that important characters were omitted, undeveloped, or even seemingly forgotten (as in the case of Mary's husband, William Carey).There ARE very affecting characters and scenes, but I left the theatre wishing for MORE. The fascinating lives of these people simply cannot be dealt with in a movie that lasts less than two hours.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Satisfying and entertaining, but it promised so much more","The Tudors are very chic at the moment. If it isn't ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" (awful) or the television series, ""The Tudors"" (soft-pornographic trash), then it is ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", the latest film written by the Oscar nominated screenwriter, Peter Morgan. After his work on the Golden Globe winning TV film ""Longford"" and the Oscar winning (for its lead actors) ""The Queen"" and ""The Last King of Scotland"", his scripts must be in demand by actors across the globe. Little wonder then that this film attracts a stellar cast, including Eric Bana, Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman. So, why is it that this film, which is filled with great talent and potential, delivers only satisfaction? This was originally slated for release late last year, right in the middle of the awards season. Yet, for some reason, it was moved back. Why this was done is not widely known, but, as the IMDb had the film listed as completed last autumn, I should think that the decision was taken that this film would draw more attention outside of the congested awards season. Watching the film, you are aware of the ambition and lavish costumes that would draw the gaze of Oscar. But the film lacks punch, depth and the power to grip you the whole way through.That's not to say that it isn't entertaining. Far from it, the film is, for an hour and a quarter, perfectly pleasant, with intrigue, scheming and romance aplenty. A lot of the credit must go to the performances, which range from accomplished to fantastically enjoyable to watch. Natalie Portman is impressive as Anne Boleyn. She ranges from scheming and nasty to genuinely sympathetic. It is her most notable work to date. Scarlett Johansson is fine, but everybody is still waiting for her to realise the potential she showed when she announced herself on the scene in ""Lost in Translation"" and ""The Girl with the Pearl Earring"". The supporting cast are a joy to watch. Eric Bana is excellent as Henry VIII, but it is the schemers in the background who provide the best entertainment. David Morrissey is having a lot of fun, whilst Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas are great as the Boleyn parents.It is a perfectly bearable watch, but unfulfilling. There's an awful lot crammed into the hour and fifty minutes. As year after year of history is skipped through, the film's focus continually shifts, failing to allow certain characters from gaining appropriate intensity. Henry VIII is not as proactive as he might, or should, be. He is more driven then driving, whilst his first wife, Catherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent), is given very little time on screen, thus sidelining a character which should be a figure of great interest. But your expectations are dashed mainly because the film reaches its climax with half-an-hour to go, with an emotional pinnacle being reached and never again surpassed. A rape scene, which seems to be the start of the culmination, with so many points of interest going on in it, proves to be the end of it. The last thirty minutes, whilst quite stylish, are drawn out and slow, and end with a final scene that can only be described as cheesy.It's a shame that this film is nothing more than admirable in places. But it is a good film for this time of year (that springtime lull between the quality of Winter and the bombast entertainment of Summer). It is an entertaining and satisfying way to pass an afternoon, but it won't live long in the memory.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Not a history lesson, it's a movie, a good one at that","When I first saw the trailer for The Other Boleyn Girl, I have to admit, it looked good, but like it wasn't accurate. I am a huge history buff, especially in the time of England's dark ages, I am fairly familiar with the Boleyn sisters and their affections for King Henry, Anne being the second wife to be executed for committing adultery and not birthing a son heir to the thrown, her life was absolutely horrific if you think about how hard it was to be a woman in this era. I was a little scared that they wouldn't portray her well in this film, but my mom and I saw The Other Boleyn Girl today and even though I'm not fully satisfied with the portrayal of Anne, the movie is still very good. The story has a Hollywood layer to give the story a little more ""oomph"" sort of speak, like most other pictures, but The Other Boleyn Girl is still a very decent movie.The Boleyn has quite a family, a mother, father, a son, and two daughters. After failing at several attempts for Queen Catherine to have a son heir to King Henry's thrown, he wishes for a mistress. Sir Thomas Boleyn offers his daughter, Anne, but when King Henry sees Thomas's other daughter, Mary, he is smitten with her and wants her as his mistress. She gives birth to a son, but they are not married and she is looked down upon. Anne is given a second chance to come back after a marriage that was not granted and then annulled, but King Henry then falls for her and wishes her to give herself to him, but she puts up a fight and tells him not until she assumes the crown and to be his wife. But she fails to give him a son, her life depends on it as well sadly.The true story of Anne Boleyn is very sad, but extremely interesting, I wouldn't recommend the book, just go for a regular history book when it comes to this story. But for the movie, The Other Boleyn Girl, I liked it, it had good acting, beautiful costumes and sets, and a very good story. If you are looking for a history lesson, this is not the film for you, but if you are looking for a good movie, then watch it. Just like the film ""Elizabeth"", they make the story a little more juicy, it's for the sake of some audience members who don't understand why England has the system it does, but it still makes for good drama.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Film Worth Seeing for the Issues of Gender,"The Other Boleyn Girl is a compelling film due to the exceptional performances and the splendid costumes. Additionally, there is simply a terrific story told about the relationship of Henry VIII and the two Boleyn sisters, Anne and Mary.Natalie Portman (Anne) and Scarlett Johansson (Mary) are outstanding as characters engaged in both sibling rivalry and sisterly bonding. In the central relationship of the sisters, the film develops the social roles and imposed limitations on women in Tudor England.One of the film's most moving character portrayals is the mother of the two Boleyn Sisters. In the heartbreaking performance of Kristin Scott Thomas, Elizabeth Boleyn can only watch helplessly as her daughters become pawns of the greedy men (Thomas Boleyn and the Duke of Norfolk), who use the young women much like pimps in order to line their pockets and further their own advancement at court. Another sterling aspect of the film is the portrayal of Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent), another victim of the men due to the obsessive pursuit of Henry VIII to beget a male heir, leading to his momentous divorce from Katherine and England's break with the church of Rome.While commentators may point out the omissions of many of the details from the novel by Philippa Gregory, the film is still true to the spirit of the book. It is also a faithful representation of the role of women in Tudor age. The film effectively presents the gender issues from the perspective of many of the remarkable women of the age along with the reminder of the greatest legacy of Anne Boleyn, which was the indirect result of her relationship of Henry VIII. That legacy was the future ruler of England...and also a woman: Elizabeth I.",8.0,Anonymous,History
What A Piece Of Drama!,"I think that the main critics done to this film came from those who don't like Natalie or Scarlett. I hope it has nothing to do with the the fact that it is a costum movie - I personally found this film an excellent piece of drama, as well as the book was (I think it's an awesome reading, too!). A perfect cast, a good storyline and a strong screenplay are the main reasons that made ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" a wonderful screen adaptation - and both Portman and Johansson revealed themselves in one of their best performance ever! I also believe that the choice of casting two of the most brilliant and famous young actresses in Hollywood (perhaps the best ones, right now) was a smart move from the movie producers and - as well as the most fascinating thing about it is the rivalry between the two sisters - let it able to do captivate young people's attention.

excellent drama,"Put it this way, if you saw Anne of the Thousand Days, you probably felt sorry for Anne Boleyn. After seeing this film, while you might feel sorry for her - not so much.The Other Boleyn Girl is a 2008 film starring Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johannson, Eric Bana, Kristen Scott-Thomas, Mark Rylance, David Morrissey, and Benedict Cumberbatch who at this writing is #2 on the IMDb Starmeter, so I'd say his fortunes have changed.The story fills in what we don't actually know about the Boleyns and tells some of their story, though the writers had to leave out a lot of material.Nevertheless, this is a great drama, beautifully costumed and filmed, with wonderful acting and, let's face it, two of the most stunning women in films today.Natalie Portman plays Anne Boleyn, who is more or less pimped out by her father (Mark Rylance) hoping that she can give Henry VIII a son and, in so doing, increase the family's fortunes. It doesn't work out.Instead, the King takes a fancy to the newly married Mary, Anne's sister, and both the young women are given a position at court. Henry, then married to Catherine of Aragon, then takes Mary as a lover. Mary later gives birth to a son.Anne secretly marries someone who is betrothed to another, and as a punishment is sent to the court in France. When she returns, she captivates King Henry by refusing to become his mistress while he is still married, driving him to distraction.He eventually gets the law changed so he can divorce Catherine and marry Anne. By now he is long finished with Mary, barely acknowledging his son.One of the created scenes in the film occurs when Anne miscarries her child, a boy. She is desperate that Henry not find out and appeals to her brother to sleep with her. He can't do it.In truth, one of the crimes Anne was charged with was incest, but these allegations were made up. Her brother George was executed because of it, however. In the film, someone sees them together and reports it.I actually think the writers did an okay job with this story - in historical films one always has to combine events and characters or leave them out.Natalie Portman is excellent as Anne, rather bratty, seductive, and emotional. Johannson has a less showy role but she's marvelous as well.Eric Bana is an attractive Henry. The real Henry was a redhead, but the depiction of Henry as slender and attractive is certainly correct for the period in which the story takes place.The film makes a great deal out of the relationship between Anne and Mary -- Anne is furious when Mary nabs the King, then Mary is furious when Anne makes her big move.In fact, the two sisters weren't particularly close. And though in the film Anne is the older sister, historians today believe that Mary was the older one.Mary actually had two children, but there isn't a lot of evidence to support that her second child was actually King Henry's. What isn't mentioned in the film itself is that after Mary's husband (Cumberbatch) died, she married a soldier secretly, a man way beneath her station, and was banished from court, never to return.Her family also disowned her. Up until then, she was at court; when she was widowed, Anne arranged for her to have a pension and had Mary's second child, a boy, educated.After Mary's and Anne's parents died, Mary inherited some property and she and her husband lived quietly and happily for the rest of their lives.Very good film, well worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Mary is forever doomed to be  ""The Other Boelyn Girl""","All and all, not a particularly enjoyable film.This movie sacrifices all that was interesting about the novel in the first place just to squeeze in all the historical aspects. All of the page turning scenes in the book that would have been interesting to see translated to screen (Anne's bloodstained dress, the deformed child, the courtship between Mary and William) were cut.Fortuanatly, I expected that. With such a long book, I had to expect most of my favourite scenes were going to get the axe.What I didn't expect was for the narration to change from that of Mary (aka. ""The Other Boelyn Girl"" for which the book was named) to yet another story about Anne Boelyn. The film started off well, if rather slow, with the story being told from Mary, but it quickly changes gears as the audience is suddenly following Anne's courtship of Henry and Anne's trials, emotions and desperation. Mary is quickly delegated to little more then a secondary role, with many key moments happening while she isn't on screen.The story of Anne was told well, she was portrayed brilliantly by Portman, and had several fun and emotional moments. But that's just the problem, I've seen that all before. There have been dozens of films, series, and books written from Anne's point of view. If I wanted to see a story about Anne, I would have watched Anne of the Thousand Days or maybe ""The Tudors"" HBO series. What made this story special was it told the story behind Anne and Henry (and it was mostly fictional which added to the drama).Unfortunately the movie ignored this, and thus failed to create the same reaction I had towards the book.Another problem is that of characterisation, I expected that the movie would make the two sisters friends as it creates more drama towards the end as opposed to them being not particularly close like in the book. Same with the enormous changes they made in the personalities of the parents (and honestly, almost every character)I expected it. Many of the characters in the movie were actually more two-dimensional then the callous characters from the book. It wasn't as though this movie was badly acted or written...it was just bad.The person I was most disappointed about was George (one of my favourites in the book) who was given a woefully small role, although the actor who portrayed him did it brilliantly. Also, The character of William Stafford seemed to be added in as an afterthought which confused the audience who hadn't read the book (the two main questions I heard were ""Is that the guy she married in the beginning"" or ""What happened to the guy she married in the beginning"") and left those of us who had read the book wondering why he was portrayed as such a pansy?And the editing, where to begin. Horrible, the particularly poignant scenes (few and far between as they were) were not given enough time to sink in before the audience was whisked off to another scene. Even having read the source material I was lost, so I can only imagine how it must have been from those new to the story.The only bright side of this tedious film were the beautiful costumes, but even the bright colours and swirly dresses couldn't distract anyone with more then a 10 second attention span and despite them the movie soon became unbearably boring.All in all, this movie probably shouldn't have been made in the first place. It was apparent there was too much story to tell in two hours, it had mini-series written all over it. But seeing as it had to be made for the film industry to cash in the the books success, it could have been done a lot better.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"Showtime's Version (""The Tudors"") is much Better","I was looking forward to watching this version of Ann Boleyn for the simple reason that I've had so much fun watching Showtime's version now running, ""The Tudors"".However, after seeing the movie yesterday, my advice would be go rent ""The Tudors"" at Blockbuster or Netflix and skip this movie.It's not that Scarlett Johansson is bad as Mary Boleyn, she does a pretty good job considering what she had to work with. Natalie Portman comes up short as Ann Boleyn. The actress who portrays her on ""The Tudors"", Natalie Dormer, is much better. There really isn't anything bewitching or captivating about Natalie Portman's portrayal of Ann Boleyn, unlike Ms. Dormer's performance, which is everything Natalie Portman's portrayal is not. Dormer exudes the aura of a temptress with sex appeal galore. Portman simply does not. I think Johansson would have been the better choice for Ann.Eric Bana is so-so as Henry VIII. Rhys Meyers portrayal is much more entertaining on the ""The Tudors"". To be fair, Bana didn't have much more to work with than did Johansson. The main character in this movie is Portman's Ann Boleyn, who seems to miss the mark.The supporting cast was good but overall you should save your hard earned money & wait for this to appear on cable.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"fun movie, not very accurate","I watched this out of curiosity because of Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson playing the two Boleyn sisters. It was an engaging portrait of palace intrigue, sex and violence in Tudor England. But if you're at all familiar with the storyline, you'll see a number of oddities that somewhat spoil the fun.Mary was the elder, not younger sister (why did they even make this change, didn't really matter to the story). Henry VIII wasn't manipulated into marrying Anne. He desperately wanted a legitimate heir, so he was as eager to marry a fecund young woman as she was to be queen.And then there's the scene that implies the charges against Anne and George had some basis in fact. Yes, it makes for an entertaining Game of Thrones style plot twist but seems very unlikely and is kind of distasteful in blaming two people who were railroaded by false chargers. Also, there was no mention of all the other men who were railroaded along with them.Lastly, young Elizabeth was not raised by her aunt Mary. That would have been very odd considering she was a royal heir who merited her own household.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A historical  character study that is beautifully-designed...,"I saw this last year when I was 16, at the cinema with my mum and my sister, and I must say we were impressed. I will confess that I haven't read the book by Phillippa Gregory, but from my perspective of the film, this is a beautifully made historical character study of some of the most famous historical figures in history. The film does look exquisite, with lavish costumes and splendid locations. The acting from Natalie Portman and Scarlet Johanssen are the redeeming merits of an above-average but rather unsubtle movie. These two actresses are brilliant at showing emotional depth. I also liked the actress of Catherine of Aragon, though I didn't expect Catherine to be conveyed in the way she was. However, I was not so impressed with Eric Bana as Henry. He fits the part physically, but emotionally he comes across to me as rather flat and lifeless. There are many historical inaccuracies, probably an attempt to be faithful to the source material, and because of this, sometimes the dialogue is very wordy and could have been simplified, and the rape scene seemed as though it came from another movie. I also thought the film rather overlong and a bit slow, and I will confess that I was out of my seat in the execution scenes with genuine fright inside of me, believe me a man screaming for mercy is one of the last things you want to see portrayed on film.(I really found that scene in particular very upsetting to watch)In conclusion, a beautifully made and in general well acted period drama, but suffers from uneven dialogue and pacing. 7/10 Bethany Cox.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Interesting period piece, with attractive stars and sumptuous costumes....worth a look","King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) sits on the throne of England. His virtuous wife Catherine of Aragon, mother to Princess Mary, has just given birth to another stillborn child, a son. Sensing the king's growing discontent and fading love for his honorable wife, a key adviser decides it is time for the king to have a mistress. He calls on the family of his sister (Kristin Scott-Thomas) and her social climbing husband, Sir Thomas Boleyn. After all, they have two lovely daughters to offer. One, Anne (Natalie Portman) is beautiful and very clever while Mary (Scarlett Johannsen) is also fair, kind, and sweet but not as quick-witted. Oh, wait, Mary has newly been married to a country landowner so that leaves Anne. The father invites the king to his country estate so that the royal can get acquainted with his older daughter. However, on a foxhunt, Henry is injured when Anne, on horseback, leads the company into dangerous terrain that only she knows well. The king ends up bedridden and Mary is designated to be his nurse, as she is patient and adept at caregiving. Suddenly, Henry prefers Mary and, as he is the king, he moves the entire Boleyn household to court and makes the wedded Mary his mistress. Anne, greatly miffed and rejected, brews up some trouble for the sister she once loved well. But, is Henry through with Anne and devoted only to Mary? We shall see! This is an interesting period piece with a story that, somewhat familiar, deserves to be told again. Most folks have heard that Anne eventually married the king, gave birth to Elizabeth, and subsequently lost her head over some sort of controversy. But, here is a portrait, little known, of her much kinder sister who was also involved with the king, due to her father's insane scheming. As the principal players, you could hardly find a better looking trio than Portman, Johannsen, and Bana and they perform quite well. All of the secondary actors are superb, too, with Scott-Thomas spouting the best lines of the film, absolutely, in great style. Noteworthy indeed are the costumes, for they are sumptuous and worth the ticket price alone. There is also some nice scenery and excellent production values, while the script is interesting and makes history come alive. Most importantly, the film clearly shows that while feminism is a ""recent"" phenomenon, women have had important roles in the world's turning since time began. If you are a fan of romance and adore period pieces, this one is definitely for you. Yet, even those who usually can't be bothered will, I predict, take a shine to this one, where the drama is heavy and the stars so wonderfully winsome.",7.0,Anonymous,History
costumed soap opera,"Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) is the older sister embodying the hopes of her family. Mary (Scarlett Johansson) is the other sister and her good heart is not seen as being useful. With no male heir, King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) is frustrated with his marriage to Catherine of Aragon after a stillborn male baby. The Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) sees a way to introduce his niece as a mistress to the king. Sir Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) and Norfolk's sister Lady Elizabeth Boleyn (Kristin Scott Thomas) offer the more outgoing unmarried Anne. Instead, the king is taken with the shy Mary who recently married William Carey (Benedict Cumberbatch) hoping for a quiet life. Mary is ordered to be the king's mistress and one of the queen's ladies-in-waiting. The family joins her in court as they gain in prestige. Anne secretly marries nobleman Henry Percy and tells her brother George (Jim Sturgess). George tells Mary who then tells her parents fearing a scandal over Percy who is engaged to another arranged by the king. Anne is exiled to the French court. She would return to take the king from Mary. She would give birth to future queen Elizabeth. Mary is widowed and remarries William Stafford (Eddie Redmayne). Ambitious courtesan Jane Parker (Juno Temple) marries George and would cause a great royal scandal.Anne seems to be written as the flamboyant sister while Mary is the shy one. Portman is older than Johansson and that does fit the Boleyn sisters. However, I think Johansson and Portman are more fit in personality to switch their roles. It's pushing through a lot of plot and the material may be better for a TV series. The actors are capable and the story is fascinating.

Closed World,"I'm an easier audience than most. Cheap effects, poor production skills by modern standards and cheap theatrics are all ignored when there is even the dullest of hooks. I grab and am willingly pulled through. Hey, I even liked ""Miss Congeniality.""

It could have worked too, if Scarlett was a deeper actress and was able to convey that all the lushness we see is because her eye is in a decorated mind. It could have worked if it wasn't such a closed world.The ""closed world"" deal means this: everything we see is ""explained"" or tightly bound up in the story? Henry is king? Well then his kingliness is bound up exclusively in dressing, having fun and worrying about babies. There's no tie to anything outside what is carefully strung together with visible ribbons. No character, no urge, no happening crosses the shell that contains what we see. This is underscored by the way the cinematographer handles the visuals. Yes, he gives us more lushness in framing and positions than usual.But in keeping with the costumes, these are all from a well known vocabulary, just more elaborate. And the physical framing is closed world. Its stagy. There's nothing that bleeds off the frame to imply that there is anything at all in the universe but what you see.This is why people call this soap opera-ish. It isn't because of the emotional dynamics themselves, which are strong enough to matter in a worthwhile container. Its this notion from the TeeVee that there are only a few people in the world and the story is just a matter of who sleeps with who.But there's a larger opportunity missed here. There really are only two choices you have when combining great societal movements with personal emotions in this way. Either you can posit a world of great souls who somehow pull the world into a future, shaping by the power of being they have. Then we study that power.Or you go the way that things seem to the audience: things happen that are uncontrollable triggering incidental forces on the people who are in the way: political leaders and interesting people notwithstanding. Its something friendly to the noir tradition that we know a lot about now. They did neither here, and since they didn't give us a known cosmos, that stifling of the closed world is accentuated.Too bad. This was an interesting time, leading up to and preparing the way for the literary enlightenment that still glows, now in film. The times literally resulted in a storied way from what emerged from then through Shakespeare and Harriot, through settling the new world with idealists rather than simple catholic thugs.... on through to the creation of the rich vehicles for thought we have now: like the stuff a available to grab for this film and this comment.Henry was a responsible monarch, less driven by personal desire to see a spawn rule, but more concerned about shaping the future. That meant severing ties with the Catholics, a tie denoted by his marriage. She had to go for reasons outside her womb. The entanglements of religion, wealth, power had to be reshaped. We know he was most thoughtful in this, that he recognized a dying feudal system and the rise of urbanism. We know that his daughter  far less intelligent  followed through with his plan and got all the credit.None of this open world stuff is visible here. The women don't even seem desirable, and that blows the whole soap opera deal.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,History
The boys and girls of yore,"Historically speaking, Anne Boleyn was the second wife of England's King Henry VIII. She was instrumental in England's political and religious upheaval that saw England ultimately break away from the Catholic Church. When Henry's first wife was unable to produce a male heir, he began to look elsewhere. His advances toward Anne were not returned, as she did not want to chance pregnancy. Any child born before the King could annul his first marriage to Catherine of Aragon would be a bastard child and therefore not a potential heir to the throne. As if this weren't enough drama for the Boleyn family, Anne's sister, Mary, was also involved with the King and rumoured to have had a child he fathered prior to his involvement with Anne. Regardless of how sordid the whole affair might have been, it altered England's history dramatically and Anne went on to become both a martyr and a feminist icon. You would think that a screenplay about both sisters' involvement with the King by the Oscar nominated writer of THE QUEEN would be an impartial account of the period but instead, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is nothing but a sexist farce that reduces both the male and female players to tired platitudes before robbing the story of all its humanity.Men crave power and status. Women crave powerful men that they can manipulate to do their bidding. Men will essentially do anything to get into the skirt of a woman they desire and will lose their minds and capacity for rational thinking if she denies him. Women will in turn step over anyone, including their own sister, in order to bag a supposedly good man. Not only are all of these statements borderline offensive but they are also inane. There is always so much more to it than simply that. These clichés are the stuff great teen movies are made of and perhaps it was unfair of me to expect more from a costume film than insipid, nonsensical melodrama. What most undermines first time feature film director Justin Chadwick's work is that it is amateurish and not at all convincing. Anne and Mary Boleyn (Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson) are introduced as loving, caring sisters. They protect each other, respect each other and love each other. Why then would I believe that either would hurt the other so maliciously? I guess because they're girls and that's what girls do when there is a man involved, right? Sure to stereotype both sexes fairly, the men do not escape Chadwick's narrow view of gender definition. Am I to seriously believe the King of England (Eric Bana) would risk his throne and country's well being just because a girl he lusts over refuses his royal wanting?As Anne, Portman is a natural for the period but as she gets caught up in her father's plans to have her bed the King as a means to better position her family's standing at court, the inherent intelligence she brings to most of her roles makes it seem entirely unnatural that she would be naïve enough to play along with Daddy's game. Johansson has never looked more drab as she stands amidst an always-overcast English countryside, her long, golden locks lying limp on her shoulders, her eyebrows almost invisible against her pale face. Though she seems to be playing catch-up to Portman's supposed ease with the material at first, it is her poise and restraint that make for a more believable and sympathetic Boleyn. While Portman certainly masters the pain, remorse and paranoid fear necessary to convey Anne's arch, she is incapable of escaping the same trap the entire cast falls into. Perhaps from having seen too many period pieces prior, the ensemble acts as though the events taking place are not actually happening to them as characters. Instead, they come off as amateur theatre actors caught up in the lore that comes with corsets and faked British accents.THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is not all that horrible. I too find myself getting lost in the barrage of bodices. Still, marrying off your children as commodities should not be taken lightly and the knowing twinkle in these girls' eyes gives away their modern feminist thinking, making their wily behaviour seem all the more implausible. The only thing that makes this all worse is that all this trouble comes about to please the patriarch of the Boleyn family who is nothing more than a pathetic, insecure coward.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Maid in England,"I don't like period pieces. The only reason I went to see this was Natalie Portman. What puzzled me was that the theater was packed with young women, nicely dressed and giggling. In that respect, you might say the audience was a mirror image of the on-screen action. I guess the girls were there for Natalie too. Or maybe it's the fancy dresses. I have it on authority that girls like fancy dresses. Surely they couldn't have been there for the movie as such. Or could they? It turned out not to be such a dusty duck after all. I guess marrying for wealth and power never goes out of style. Think Moscow. Think Dubai. Hell, think Park Avenue. The way the story is told makes it easily digestible for a 21st century audience too; the scene in which Anne ogles Henry like he's just another juicy hunk feels thoroughly modern. Says producer Scott Rudin: ""If you're going to spend two or three years of your life working on something, you've got to be making the kind of movie that discusses and influences the culture and is engaged in the world you're living in."" Despite its merits, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is not one of those movies. Unlike ""There Will Be Blood"" and ""No Country for Old Men"", both of which are recent Rudin productions as well. Forgive me for thinking that the best thing about ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" was the tiny black dress Natalie Portman wore when she went to promote the movie on Letterman.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Question for ""Old Fashioned and Heavy""","I haven't seen the film yet but I'm a huge English history buff and have followed the story of King Henry since I watched the PBS series about his life and six wives as a young girl. That being said, I have to ask - is there some OTHER reason why Henry broke with the Catholic church and founded the Church of England beyond freeing him up to divorce Katheryn of Aregon and marry Anne Boleyn? If there is, please do tell. After more than 30 years of reading (non-fiction) and following this story, I have heard of no other.Also, why do you say that this is a film for an older era? The history surrounding King Henry's monarchy are more compelling and captivating than any fiction and led to extraordinary changes in the history of the country that echo into the modern era. It is a timeless and fascinating story of ambition, fear, greed, and yes, love. While this film may not accurately depict the complete story, it is still entertainment and may well lead to stimulating a new generation to learn more.Just my thoughts.",,Anonymous,History
Banal but for Bana.,"Light on accuracy, light on characterisation and light on point  this film is essentially a vaguely pretty piece of flimsy material. Taking a famed piece of history and weaving some interesting supposition around it is a good start, casting some fine (and fine looking) actors is a great second step. Leaving them with nothing to work with and having the most interesting character (Henry) as little more than an extended cameo is disappointing and silly.Johansson does her best with a tediously feeble Mary Boleyn, whose niceness quickly becomes insipid and annoying. Equally, Portman attempts to make Anne likable, when the script essentially has her as a spiteful bitch. Almost all the other characters are bland caricatures, with the exception of Bana's Henry, who would have been a great role if he'd had a few more scenes  powerful, conflicted and believable. Alas, this is a movie of poor decisions and the end product goes little better than Anne's marriage.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Inaccurate historical detail,"This story is not close to being correct. First off, Anne was the younger sister (born in 1510). Mary was the mistress to King Francis of France she returned to England with Mary, Queen of France after the death of the French King Louis She became Henry's lover. She became pregnant and was married off to William Carey. The King NEVER acknowledged her child as his. Anne was STILL in France with Queen Claude. She was never banished to France. She returned to England when Henry changed allegiances from France to Spain. When Anne returned she fell in love with Harry Percy (who was NOT betrothed to anyone) It was a love match. The King saw Anne and became besotted. He had Cardinal Wolsey separate them and then Percy was married off to Mary Talbot. Henry adored Anne. He was never anything but generous to her and she hated him only a little less than she hated The Cardinal Wolsey. She blamed them for separating her from her love, Harry Percy. The King pursued her and she refused him, this went on for 6 years. she finally fell in love with him. They married (after he split from Rome) and were happy. Elizabeth was born, and Henry changed the Act of Succession to make Elizabeth his heir. It wasn't until the second death of a stillborn son that Henry had had enough. The saucy temperament and sharp tongue he loved in the beginning began to wear on him in the end. One of the greatest historical quotes is from Anne in the Tower ""when I no longer hated him, he began to hate me""This is a great story if told correctly. This movie was awful. Anne was not guilty of adultery and the scene with her brother never happened.In fact it was the situation with Mark Smeaton a court musician that caused Anne's downfall. She was accused with him (he was tortured to admit guilt) and with all of Henry's friends from the time he had first met Anne, her brother was thrown in to make sure there was no sympathy for the Queen. Interestingly, even though most of the people hated Anne for what had happened to Katherine, Henry's actions made the people sympathetic to Anne as they did not believe her guilty of what she was accused. Jane Seymour was no longer a secret. I am amazed that such an inaccurate movie would be made and the worst part of this is that in a time when women had little to no power, a young girl changed the face of the world.By refusing the greatest man in the land..The King. Her end was tragic and not her fault. It was the doing a spoiled and old man who was always looking for the greener grass. The movie was shot horribly and the costumes were seen too often. Katherine of Aragon was not an ugly woman but one worn down by lost children and a philandering husband.The best movie on this subject was Anne of The Thousand Days. The Tudors on Showtime is good but also rife with historical inaccuracies. Mary was not the saint she was made out to be but a whore who gave everyone everything and asked for nothing. She did live a quite life after the death of her sister.And her children were honored by Elizabeth I",2.0,Anonymous,History
Glamorous film with the ups and downs of melodrama.,"Well what do you know, Anne Boleyn has a sister. Even more interesting, she gives King Henry the son he wants, that should make everything okay right? Well not exactly. If the movie ended there The Other Boleyn Girl would be a mere forty minutes in running length. The remaining fifty-sixty minutes, are a bloated mess, quite uninteresting and not very sympathetic. Even so, The Other Boleyn Girl doesn't end up being a bad movie. It's a gorgeous looking production, and it has a few exceptionally dramatic scenes, but the whole thing just doesn't amount to very much.Personally I've never been fond of Natalie Portman. She strikes me as more of a 'girl' than a 'woman' in all her roles, and not simply because she is small. She plays more of a woman here, though I think she is more interested in looking pretty rather than powerful. Eric Bana is much better as King Henry. He is not just a pretty face.The Other Bolelyn Girl, is pure melodrama, which is all it intends to be I guess. The whole thing just feels too loose, and unorganized, sometimes that can happen when adapting a book. It is best looked at as a smart chick flick.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Movie destined to be a boring melodrama.,"I know very little of the original story. I only know the biggest and most important details, so I don't know how reliable this representation of the events in the British crown is.

What really bothers me is the lack of realism and the lack of care with temporal continuity. The performances are above expectations and in this case it isn't a good thing. Editing suddenly skips days, nights, rainy, sunny days no matter what.The most notable within the positive is the production design, including interior sets, exterior locations and costumes.For a regular viewer who is not attached to British historical stories, the film fails to entertain, therefore, I recommend it only to those who like history or excessive drama.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Natalie Portman was fantastic as Ann Boleyn, many scenes we can feel her feelings. Eric Bana however is terrible, a robot with few expressions. But Eddie Redmayne in his small paper was realy nice. Scarlet Johansson is only a pretty face.

"Not a good historical film, but a considerable drama with indefensible historical laxity.","Don't trust either good or bad critics upon ""The Other Boleyn Girl"". It's a serious thing to castigate such a bold work. First of all, this movie is a mediocre adaptation of a heart-breaking novel of late epochs of the English kingdom and the royal family. This work of art(both novel and the movie) has a courage to reveal the unknown reasons of English kingdom becoming less potent with the Renaissance revolution from Italy, and losing the support of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church, accordingly becoming adversaries with Italy.The Renaissance revolution is strongly flowing all over the movie just effectively with the Love. Yes, Renaissance invented the Love; but not lonely. There supposed to be growing artists, poets, sculptors, etc. Where are they? Even, we see the palace of the kingdom, the courtroom, the royal family's bedrooms all like a dungeon. Love wouldn't be existed, unless there is Art. Regrettably neither director nor the screenwriter is aware of the Renaissance flow of the actual novel. Hence the spirit of the movie is lost; and they still try to make us believe that the king of England is cruel and he has set apart the lovers. On the contrary, in fact English kingdom always had let literature, theater and love grow.Beside this failure, this fiasco of the plot; the cinematography and the costume design are stunning. The music score is outstanding, yet we feel that the whole movie is in a mournful silence.After all, we have a touching story with a great deal of melodrama in a sensational way. It seems like it took much effort to get together this powerful cast of actors and their cordial acting. Give it a try; at least it's worth seeing.",5.0,Anonymous,History

""The Tudors"" on Showtime though is guilty of the same, but this just was too far-fetched an actually absurd in places. It just goes to show that time and time again that people love their soap opera stories and find history to be too boring on it's own. I think that is a pity and believe that we don't actually need to have fake stories to make history interesting. If you actually want to learn anything don't bother watching this.

The Tudor thing,"The Other Boleyn Girl is an adaptation of a historical fiction novel by Philippa Gregory. It was previously made as a BBC mini series and several years later BBC films co-produced the condensed film version.Looking at it now its an all star cast with Oscar nominees Benedict Cumberbatch and Eddie Redmayne is small but important roles, Andrew Garfield credited although its blink and you miss him and Oscar winner Natalie Portman plays Anne Boleyn and Scarlett Johansson plays her younger sister Mary Boleyn.The film is not meant to be historically accurate given that the source material is a fictional historical. In that sense it ties Henry VIII need to father a male heir with the Boleyn Family trying to engineer their rise in social status, riches and political power by using the Boleyn girls hooked up with Henry.The film also deals with rivalry as Mary first becomes Henry's mistress and gives birth to an illegitimate son and then Anne pledges herself to Henry but only if he first divorces his wife and also send Mary and her child away.Of course as Anne could not give birth to a son causes friction and for her Henry's wrath which results in the two sisters bonding again as the Boleyn family are put to peril.They say life in olden times was short, nasty and brutish. It seems to be no different even if you are in the inner circle of the Royal family particularly the Tudor court. This is a quick romp through a period in Henry VIII's life with enough intrigue, plotting that is doomed to failure.The film is carried by its actresses both Porter and Johansson are very good and Kristin Scott Thomas as the mother is excellent as the one who realises that her daughters are at risk from this foolhardy plan.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Strong, Sexy, Captivating Film","Two stunningly beautiful English ladies who happen to be sisters compete for the affections of England's notoriously lusty King Henry VIII. Dark-eyed Natalie Portman plays Anne Boleyn, the ""bad"" sister who takes what she wants and says whatever outrageous thing pops into her head. Blonde and soft-spoken Scarlett Johansen plays blue-eyed Mary Boleyn, a sweet, submissive young girl who falls sincerely for the king and is unable to endure the cruelty of the court.I was blown away by Natalie Portman in this movie. I have enjoyed her work in films like GARDEN STATE, but I thought of her as a sort of light, non-threatening girl next door type. It's amazing to see her give a performance worthy of Bette Davis at her greatest! Natalie makes Anne Bolyen into the darkest, most desperate, most desirable screen siren I have ever seen. Her emotions are so electric they sizzle and crackle in every scene! ""I cannot sleep . . . if I cannot sleep I cannot think . . . it becomes ever harder to arouse him and the measures I take always disgust him more each time!""Scarlett Johansen is radiant as Mary, who is so meek and gentle that it's easy to underestimate her character at first. But by the end of the film it's clear that Mary is not only a survivor, she is a strong woman capable of compassion even for the sister who has wronged her so many times.The only complaint I have about this film is that Eric Bana gives a somewhat lifeless and timid performance as the robust, charismatic Henry VIII. I have enormous respect for Eric Bana. I thought he was brilliant in BLACK HAWK DOWN, even with a very small part. And I thought his performance in TROY saved the picture. But although he can be brilliant as a decent, honorable man of principle, he really doesn't seem to be ready to tap in the truly nasty side of human nature. The real Henry was a liar, a manipulator, a bully, and at times almost a psychotic personality. None of that comes across here. Henry seems like a shallow cad, not a terrifying monster. Given Eric Bana's talent, I suspect the real problem is that the film makers feared a strong King Henry would overshadow the conflict between the two stunning leading ladies. It's a regrettable mistake, but THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is still a strong, sexy, captivating film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Entertaining but ends up as unutilized potential,"Reviewed June 2010Though it features fantastic production values and decent acting, it falls quite short of an epic classic it could have been.It is based on real events during the initial phase of Henry VIII's infamous six wives saga. This is a story of ambition, power, ego, jealousy and lust and the makers should have gone all out with an R rated content to induce the grit, drama and madness of the period; Instead it wimps out as an uninvolving paperback thriller. Main problem here is that it does not linger on any important moment as it jumps all over the place in a hurry that leaves us no character to care for.Having said that, it should be appreciated for it's lavish sets and costumes, beautiful locales and all this richness captured in the best camera available today. Natalie Portman delivered a fantastic performance as the wily ambitious Anne Boleyn, a commoner who changed the face of England by making the already married King Henry part with the Roman Church to make way for her. Eric Bana looked apt as King Henry VIII and was especially good with his cold stares and authoritative one line repertoires.Finally it is still an entertaining movie but if you know a bit about the history of this story you cannot ignore the potential that was not utilized.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Cast and costumes better than the script,"The things that a man will do for love (or at least sex or a male heir) - even if he is one of the most powerful monarchs of medieval Europe. We all know that England's King Henry VIII divorced Katherine of Aragon in order to marry Anne Boleyn and, in so doing, took his nation out of the Church of Rome.What this movie purports to do - based on the hugely successful novel by Philippa Gregory - is tell us about the rival affections of Anne's younger sister Mary who, following an affair with the king, gave birth to the future Queen Elizabeth. Although all the leading characters are actual historic figures, the film - like the book - is a work of fiction, so separating the real from the reel is a tricky task.The three central characters - all quintessential members of the English nobility - are in fact played by non-British actors who nevertheless affect convincing English accents: Eric Bana as the king and Natalie Portman as the famous Boleyn and Scarlett Johansson as the other Boleyn. Some of the support roles are particularly well-played by the likes of Kristin Scott Thomas and Ana Torrent. This stellar cast - plus wonderful costumes and a slew of splendid English locations - makes this an immensely watchable film in which, in spite of the title, Portman has the meatiest role. If only some more effort and skill had gone into the script.Footnote: I have a lifelong love of the cinema and, throughout the nearly 50 years that I've kept a daily diary, I've recorded all the films that I've seen at the cinema, on television and on VCR or DVD and maintained a card index system to note when I've seen (or re-seen) each film.

I just wish they could have been more accurate with the facts of history but maybe this is just too big a topic/story for a short movie. Much better as a miniseries. I also think it just all felt rushed. It would have been nice to see some more pleasant interaction between Anne and the king. King Henry had a smoldering quality, but the chemistry was lacking with Anne. He really seemed to have more affection for Mary - why was a mystery.

Puts the 'bana' into banal.,"This is the second effort at bringing this titillating but only averagely interesting book to the screen as we begin to surfeit on Tudor history.There have been, therefore, several recent Henry VIII's. Jonathan Rhys Meyer's portrayal in The Tudors is the most inaccurate but Bana's is the worst. In fact, however far back you go, it's still the worst. The thinly disguised Melbourne twang doesn't help, however it does help to excuse Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen who both needed more time with the dialogue coach. And an acting coach would have found plenty to keep him occupied on this set.Natasha McElhone and Jodhi May played the sisters in the mini-series and were both significant improvements on the two female leads here.But ultimately, whatever crew you picked would be unlikely to make much of this not very interesting angle on an extremely interesting period of history.",,Anonymous,History
A Pretty Tudor Thriller,"First, an easy quiz (which you're going to get wrong): How many wives did King Henry VIII have? Answer at the end of this article, but why not try to figure it out before looking? Oh, too late, you already did...And now, a question: Did Henry VIII always look like Charles Laughton, with the heft and bulges of the most memorable actor in the role of the monarch? The truth is that both the king and Laughton looked a lot better when they were young.Instead of a fat, dissolute Henry, there was back in the early 16th century a trimmer, more handsome king, who soon ate and married too much. That Henry, not the famous picture of him by Holbein, must have looked like Eric Bana.And so, in Philippa Gregory's Hollywood-compliant but terrifically entertaining ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" it is Bana - from the non-green scenes of the 2003 ""Hulk"" - who rules, while the real-life plain-to-ugly Boleyn girls are brought to you by Natalie Portman (Anne) and Scarlett Johansson (Mary).It is to their credit and, especially, that of director Justin Chadwick that you buy all these prettifications, all or most of author Gregory's romantic liberties with the story, and enjoy the movie thoroughly.Chadwick is new to feature films, but he has solid credits in TV, especially with the recent magnificent BBC ""Bleak House,"" as fine a realization of Dickens as you'll find anywhere.And, speaking of the BBC, if you want to see a less ""pretty,"" more substantial version of Gregory's novel, dig up the 2003 TV version of ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" with Jodhi May and Natascha McElhone; those two run rings around the smirking Portman and the too-angelic Johansson. The exalted Peter Morgan wrote the screenplay - as well as for the superior ""The Queen"" and ""The Last King of Scotland"" - and an in-depth research project is just waiting for the right scholar to compare Morgan's ""Boleyn"" script with Philippa Lowthorpe's for the TV version.So, with novelist, script writer, director, and a darn fine yarn to begin with, the new film has much going for it. The supposedly well-known story of Henry's marriage to Anne and dalliance with Mary is told well, bringing into focus a great many sub-stories of background machinations by a power-hungry family using the two sisters as bait.If at first you must overcome the challenge of seeing Anne Boleyn behind Portman's glitz and 21st-century 'tude, by the time the character reaches the catastrophic comeuppance for her (and her family's) scheming, Portman comes close to the touchstone established by Jodhi May.Quiz answer: Two. Surely you think six, but that's not right. Four of Henry's marriages were annulled, which means officially they never existed. Although Gregory's book doesn't deal with this tricky question, you can take the information to the bank.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Critics and history fanatics need to get off their high horse...,"Although I wasn't completely captivated by the film, I think it is fair to say that the Phillippa Gregory deserves some credit for bringing the attention off of Elizabeth I for once, and focusing on another monarch for a change. In this case, it wasn't even about the monarch because even though Henry VIII was always present, he was fairly insignificant. Yes, this movie favors women and is very one sided in that sense, but that is the perspective that it chooses to show, and viewers should accept that. I feel that many people are way too critical of this film. It is the authors and/or filmmakers privilege to make the film from what ever perspective they choose and with whatever historical inaccuracies they want. I am seeing that many are criticizing the factual errors and I think that they need to realize that this is historical *FICTION*, it is NOT the authors or directors obligation to educate the audiences. Besides, many of the historical facts surrounding the plot of the film are unclear to historians themselves, so why shouldn't Gregory fill in the blanks whichever way she chooses? For example, even historians don't know who the older Boleyn was, (Mary or Anne), even though there is some evidence to Anne's seniority, which is why the author chose to present it that way.I will have to admit that much of my motivation to see the film stemmed from reading bad reviews because generally I thought the film would receive a positive response. I did have some complaints... As I stated earlier, I didn't necessarily like the fact that the King's role was insignificant, but I was even more disheartened by Eric Bana's lacking performance. Do not misunderstand, I am a huge fan of Eric Bana, and I feel that he has much potential as an actor; he is the type of actor who forces compassion from the viewer when you watch him on screen. However this time around, I had no such feelings, in fact, I couldn't wait for a scene with him to be over. Ultimately, I feel that if someone else were cast in his place, I would've had a different outlook on the King's role and presence.During the film, I started to form an opinion on the acting of all the women in the film and I am certainly glad that I didn't set it in stone. Starting with the less obvious characters, I think that Kristin Scott Thomas was a perfect choice for Lady Boleyn, definitely worthy of recognition. I disagree with those that felt that Natalie Portman was the star actress because I think that Scarlett Johansson is the real star of this film. I feel that Portman had a good performance, her acting is not believable in the beginning, but I am certainly convinced towards the end. With that, however, she was still replaceable; Scarlett Johansson on the other hand, is not. She embodies the role of Mary Boleyn and I cannot imagine any other actress in that role. Another actor that is starting to shine, Jim Sturgess is really starting to show his talent, although he still has a long way to go to even be considered in the same caliber that British actors are held to.Overall, I felt that the film is worthy of more positive recognition and viewers should be more open to overlooking the ""questionable"" ways filmmakers choose to interpret history especially if the genre is historical fiction.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not bad but not really compelling,"Second version of Philippa Gregory's novel of the Boleyn's family to assure their future by helping the King find an heir, or at least a mistress. The idea is to let Henry take Anne (Natalie Portman) as a mistress, however after a riding accident he is taken instead by the newly married Mary (Scarlett Johansen). What happens next is the movie.I'm going to plead bias in the viewing of the film. For me this is one of the films where Natalie Portman has been terribly miscast and so it became a challenge to get through. While I don't hate Portman as an actress I do find that she is often miscast to the detriment of the film she is in. Eric Bana, another one of my lesser favorite actors, as Henry actually gives a performance but he also leaves no impression what so ever. I kept wondering where the king was.The film itself isn't bad. It does seem to have the feel of a larger scale TV movie and does seem to be ""modern"" in feel, the result is that a good portion of the film seems like dress up time in the English manor house. Part of this is the result of the miscasting of Portman who never seems to belong in the place on screen. I kept waiting for her to walk off the set and into a Porche and drive off. Actually to be fair I felt that way about most of the cast and the unseen crew who could be felt just out of shot.As I said its not a bad movie, its just not a particularly compelling one.",6.0,Anonymous,History
not so impressive,"Maybe i would have enjoyed this movie more if i hadn't seen the first season of 'The Tudors'. The fact is that i made the comparison throughout the entire movie without wanting to do so ... it's quite clear which one is better. From my point of view, 'The Tudors' has a way better cast (perhaps some people would say that Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman in the same movie couldn't be at all a bad idea, but i think it was!), the characters are more complex, whereas the ones from 'The Other Boleyn Girl' strike as not having enough substance. I could comment even more on the quality of this movie, but i believe it's enough to say that after watching it for about half an hour i was already waiting for the end of it.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The Writers Need to go back to British History Class,"The Other Boleyn Girl probably marks the debut of an adaptation of the most intriguing tale of English Royal history. However, very poorly does the film actually describe the events. I must say that probably the only accurate part of this movie is the inevitable ending--which I won't give away because there may be a few who don't actually know what happens.I am quite the Anne Boleyn fanatic. She is one of my favorite historical figures due to her intelligence, wit and ambition. But this film completely let me down. Obviously Ms. Gregory and the people working on the film are partial to Mary Boleyn, for they idolize her throughout and scorn Anne. What for? Mary Boleyn was a naive and vain young woman who only wished for the king's attention for as long as any ordinary mistress could have it. She was unintelligent. Anne, however, used strategy to get what she wanted. She did not wish for love (perhaps not a noble thing, but at least she was honest about it); she wished for power. And she got it. Because of her refusals, she became Queen of England. It was only her growing ego and ambition that destroyed her--quite the theme; however the writers ignored it and decided to go with the cliché ""love conquers all."" Of course that is a noble truth, but Anne's downfall is much more interesting. I recommend reading her biography and the (somewhat fictional) diary by Carolyn Meyer.The one thing I despised about this movie was how terribly inaccurate it was. Not only was it shown that one sister was favored over another by the writers, but also the historical portion was completely wrong. For one, Anne Boleyn was not the elder, more social and beautiful of the two. On the contrary, Mary was older by two or three years, and she was welcomed in by society because of her beauty and popularity. Anne was younger, darker, and she had two imperfections: A mole on her neck (believed to be Devil markings) and a sixth finger on her right hand. When she went to France she learned how to cover these imperfections and make herself seem flawless. Her wit was always present. And although I adore Eric Bana, he was a poor choice to play Henry VIII, one of the most morbidly obese men in all of history.Also, it is quite evident throughout that Anne was vying for Henry's affections all along; however, Mary was the one who wanted to be his mistress. Anne was busy with a poet and musician in court until Henry began to take interest in her.Perhaps because I am partial to Anne I found this movie so horrible. But I understand that she was a flawed human being who fell because of her ego. Still, the movie represented almost all of the characters horribly exaggerated. Anne was too bad, Mary was too good, Henry was too brutal, etc. I believe the only accurate characters in the film were the girls' mother, father, and uncle. their parts were true to history and made for an interesting relationship to follow.I suppose I don't see the necessity of changing fact to fiction. The true story is already interesting enough. Even if the writers etc. have differing opinions there are many ways to illustrate a character as good or evil without altering history. People need to learn that history itself is a story that needs to be told ACCURATELY. It makes more sense, it's more believable, and it's much more entertaining for people like me who obsess over such inconsistencies.Historical Accuracy aside, the movie was way too melodramatic for my tastes. there were no redeeming qualities other than the fact that Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen really understood their characters. Kudos for playing not just an historical figure, but also for playing another person's opinion of an historical figure. It is not always easy. the action was very repetitive, and most of it not very good. I'm sorry, but I'd have to say no on this one. Even if you don't care about historical authenticity, the movie itself isn't great.If you do care about the facts?? Run away. Fast.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Good for its Genre of Soap Opera Epics.,"I just got back from a 12:00 screening. Of course it was just me my two friends and like five other people (it was the first showing after all) and all I can say is that I was pleasantly surprised. Ignore the reviews. This movie is ten times better than Memoirs of a Geisha and granted its a soap opera of a movie, its really a good one.Natatlie and Scarlett are surprisingly good. I mean a lot of the reviews were on the fence about both of them, but they pull it off, or they pull what they can with the accents. Portman is devilishly good as Anne. Yes this isn't a good representation about Anne (I prefer Anne of the Thousand Days, which historians and movie critics believe is probably the closest portrayal of the doomed Queen of a Thousand Days) but Peter Morgan did an excellent job in not fully adapting the book. The book made her out to be this delusional bitch who you really hate, but in the film he makes her a two dimensional character, which you hate one minute, and really, really love her the next. I am not going to give anything away, but what she goes through from both her Parents, her uncle, her sister, and of course henry and the court, its only fair in saying that the girl had the right to go a little crazy.Scarlett is Mary, and she is sweet, loving, and of course a two dimensional character like Portman's Anne. Its so strange because in the book, she is the main character while Anne gets the supporting role, but in this film both Girls share the title of Other Boleyn Girl equally until the third act which is the final act, where it is clear Mary will forever be known as the ""other."" Bana is pretty bland in some parts. He is given nothing to do but yell, laugh, seduce, yell some more, and of course go a little mad. Female audience's as well as Bana lovers on these forums, he does show a lot of skin, more than the ladies Jim Sturgess who plays the elder brother George Boleyn, Ana Torrent who plays Katherine of Aragon, and Kristin Scott Thomas who plays Elizabeth Boleyn the mother of Anne and Mary are all equally good in their supporting roles, especially Ms. Thomas who I am so happy is getting work. She is still beautiful and when I was watching her I could not stop thinking that she is Katherine Clifton from the English Patient. Sturgess is also a promising talent. He and the girls had great chemistry.the overall direction is way much better than The Golden Age. Yes okay the plot borderlines Age's soap opera, but Chadwick made Boleyn Girl a good soap opera. It is not over the top in technicals, its subtle textures, and gorgeous costumes from Sandy Powell are all excellent. The score is also subtle and haunting, nothing like the huge epic blasting in Golden Age.Overall I give it an 10 out 10. Its enjoyable, and the performances fit the roles. Portman and Scarjo have a lot of chemistry. It was nice to see them act alongside each other. I think if it had been released for Awards considerations I think costumes, score, and art direction would have been nominated, along with maybe cinematography (the countryside shots, as well as palace balls and banquets and Anne's coronation are beyond gorgeous to look at!) This film isn't supposed to be taken seriously. I mean look at the material it is based on. The film was made to be enjoyable whether you agree with the story or not. We all know that it is not real, but that is the point of making movies to tell stories we hadn't heard before. This film isn't a history lesson. Its more of a character study between two sisters who were forced by their family to be rivals.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Do not see this movie if you love the book!,"As a movie, The Other Boleyn Girl is interesting, compelling, and visually stunning. However, if you are like me and absolutely loved the book, then the movie version will (as usual) be extremely disappointing. The purpose of the book is to follow Mary's story (hence the title). We all know Anne Boleyn's history, it is the chronicling of the younger sister's journey that caused the book to be such a phenomenal read. Apparently someone forgot to clue the screenwriter in on this little detail because Mary is virtually forgotten for the middle portion of the movie. Her romances and emotions are swept aside for the drama of her older sister's life. What is somewhat ironic is that this is the reason Mary's story was neglected all of these years- she was perpetually overshadowed by her sister. The movie was no exception.To be completely fair, Scarlett and Natalie give incredible performances and the movie, taken as a separate entity, is very good. However, for the hard-core Phillipa Gregory fans out there, do not expect to see the book come to life or you will leave, as I did, greatly disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Lifetime Channel version of History Lite,"If you forget these are historical figures and just take it as a movie about two sisters competing for a king, it's mildly entertaining, mostly a bodice-ripper with A-list actors and very elaborate costumes.

I expected to see someone chewing gum.Has very little in common with the book, which at least made an effort at historical accuracy.What I don't understand is this: if you just want to make a movie about two sisters competing for a king, why pretend it's about Henry VIII and the Boleyns? Just call them King Rodney and the Watson sisters or whatever. I felt sorry for the actors. I bet they thought this might be a good movie.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Surprisingly good,"THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRLI was pleasantly surprised with this film. It was very good... I got given this film on DVD for Christmas and I decided to watch it with my girlfriend last night...It is about King Henry. His wife, the Queen, loses their baby before it was born, and the king then goes away and finds a mistress. In a little town there is a family with 2 sisters and it is Natalie Portman who is chosen to be the mistress until she was blamed for an accident that the king had. He then turns to her sister for comfort, even though she is also married.It is a family fight between 2 sisters and their twisted family over a king and power.The acting is very good actually... Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana were all very good.I felt the film made the King look very weak and thick. He seemed to let everyone else around him control what he was going to do. He seemed to be easily swayed on decisions by anyone.The only thing I can say about this film is it can be very slow in places, but not for long enough to get bored...I will give this film 7 out of 10.A very good drama that is worth seeing.For more of my normal reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,History
HK Neo Reviews: The Other Boleyn Girl,"Tagline: A tale of two sistersReview by Neo: In a dream combination of two of Neo's favourite Hollywood starlets, Natalie Portman and Scarlet Johansson, movies just don't get better marketing than this, at least in Neo's honest opinion. Without being too bias, the two stars radiate the sort of screen beauty that is enough to keep Neo focused and watching for the entire 2 hours duration. Perhaps it is the style of Portman, or the angelic face of Scarlet, the movie is well-paced, at times compelling, filled with moments of tension all add up to disguise what is actually a thinly plotted historical drama. Still, the film somehow managed to brisk by the 2 hour duration without a second of boredom and that's an achievement alone.History have always been an area of interest within Neo's life and while he is very much an ancient historian, his fascination in King Henry VIII is without question. Perhaps it is his ability to conquer 8 wives or maybe it is the tragedy of his character, King Henry is by far the most interesting and fascinating King of England. Aussie Eric Bana is given the aforementioned role and unfortunately despite his undeniable coolness his character is never given a role where Bana can stamp his authority and depth. The answer to this is that this is ultimately a vehicle for the two starlets to perform and most notably Natalie Portman.Portman have always been the stylish one, but then again this is probably because she shares the same favourite colour with the current reviewer – sky blue. With that aside, Portman who stole the show in My Blueberry Nights (which will be released later in the year), outshone the entire cast in a role that she is born to play. Jealousy, death stares, threats, sexy, deadly are a few side of her character and more importantly she is able to do so with radiating screen presence. Her final scenes of awaiting death are a perfect indication that Portman have certainly come of age since her stoic Star Wars days.It is without question that Neo likes Scarlet Johansson and here she reprises the sort of innocence last seen in A Girl With a Pearl Earring. She is suitably elegant, graceful, lovable and absolutely adoring. Despite being hampered by some awful makeup (Whoever did the makeup on her, should never work in a movie again!), Scarlet manages to match Portman, despite the later star given a more substantial role. Who can forget the expression on her face when she faces her uncle and father in the question of how many times did she do it with the King. Her expression was just priceless and the look on her face tells a thousand words.All in all, The Other Boleyn Girl is a movie that brisk by despite clocking a little under 2 hours. It is a credit to the producers and director for creating plenty of thrilling and tense filled moments of timeless themes in romance, betrayal, love and redemption and doing it in absolute fine style. It is easy to be critical about such a film, as the plot is so thin that you can probably sum it all up in a single line. Luckily, the actors carry the film up and above all shoulders and the result is an entertaining if not substantial ride. While the film is certainly the case of what could've been and what ifs, the film is still enjoyable enough for any fans of the above stars to sit through. Then again, who can resists the charm of Scarlet Johansson and the style of Natalie Portman, well at least, Neo cannot (Neo 2008)I rate it 6.75/10www.thehkneo.com",6.0,Anonymous,History
Entertaining despite the historical inaccuracy,"Many criticize this film for its lack of historical accuracy but to judge this film on that fact alone is to do in an injustice. The Other Boleyn Girl is first and foremost based on a novel by Philippa Gregory and that novel is specifically stated as historical fiction.I thought this was an aesthetically pleasing film and was well acted throughout. The dynamic between Natalie Portman and Scarlet Johansson is captivating throughout. Many films focus only on the life of Anne and leave Mary in the shadows. Well this film did no such thing. The interesting approach to the sibling rivalry gave the film a much more intense vibe. The sibling rivalry being the main focus of the film prevented it from becoming an overdone telling of the life of Henry VIII. Eric Bana does a passable job as Henry. Bana may be aesthetically pleasing which the real Henry lacked but that does not make up for the lack of character development withing the character. The lack of character development is in no way due to a lack of acting. Better writing would have helped the character. But this film focuses on the Boleyn girls not the king.The costumes, set, and props all were true to that of Tudor England and therefore added to the draw of this film. Although it may lack historical accuracy in the true sense the costumes and set do not.The main draw to this film is its ability to please the mass audience. If you are looking for a film filled with historical fact and period language this is not the film for you. This film is intended to introduce the common audience to parts of world history they may not be aware of while still entertaining them at the same time.Overall this was a pleasing film and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a pleasant night of entertainment. Will I recommend this film to fellow historians as an accurate film I think not, but I wouldn't condemn it to the back shelves of rental stores throughout the country either.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Horrible film,"I had high hopes for this movie, not having read any of the reviews or summaries. Alas - this film is total rubbish.1. The acting is mediocre at best. Natalie and Scarlet will never be known as great actresses and they do nothing to elevate this film.2. Revisionist history. Yes, the Boleyn family is known for its power hungry characteristics, but in this film they make Henry look like a moron and suggest Ann was behind most of the schemes. Thats just fail.3. The film omits many important events that helped shape Henry's court, skipping ahead from pregnancy to pregnancy. A lot of the interesting maneuvering and intrigue is lost in the process.If you want to see decent cinema for this time period - watch The Tudors mini-series. This film is not worth your time.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Dumbed down history and bad acting,"It was a real chore to endure 2 hours of this weak film. The historical inaccuracies aside, of which there are more than will fit on this page, the acting was awful, and both actresses' English accents were laughable. Why can't English actresses be cast in English roles? It's a difficult accent to master especially for American actors, similarly hard for English actors to get down an American accent or specific dialect. Bottom line not worth the $4 rental fee, and definitely does not do these real people of history any justice.There are much better films about the Tudors already made. Recommended would be ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" and ""Elizabeth"" and ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"".",1.0,Anonymous,History
"perhaps not historically accurate, but certainly entertaining","Two kinds of objections have appeared to this film: 1. Many inaccuracies with respect to historical facts. 2.

No film can ever be the same as a book.The filmmakers did a good job bringing the novel to the screen. Scarlet Johansson's acting, and more so Natalie Portman's, is brilliant.

Why does the movie feel the need to make Anne the older sister?,"Pretty decent movie, but there is one thing I just don't understand. Historians seem to be pretty much in agreement at this point that Mary was the older sister of Anne, not the other way around. Despite that fact, this movie goes out of its way (way out of its way) to set forth repeatedly that Mary is the younger sister. Twice Anne calls her ""my younger sister"" and once the King says something about what it is like to be in the shadow of her older sister. The thing that is bizarre about this is that it adds absolutely nothing whatsoever to the movie--it's not important to the plot and is essentially unrelated to the story. So, the movie goes out of its way to establish something that isn't true, and even if there is legitimate dispute on the issue, why not just steer clear of the topic altogether? There was no point to or reason for the movie going down that path at all, so why do so?",7.0,Anonymous,History
Intrigue,"I have not read the novel, but I am now considering it. Also, if you are unsure, this is *not* entirely historically accurate; I personally have no problem with that being so. When taking in a work of *fiction*, you are not meant to consider it to be completely authentic. I would think that anybody realizes that, and no one who expresses themselves in any medium have a responsibility to those who do not understand that. This is very compelling, with an interesting and smart(but easy enough to follow) plot. The production values leave nothing to be desired, with lush and beautiful costumes and sets. This is graced with excellent acting by all of the principals. For one of the first times, I was impressed with Eric Bana's performance in something. The characters are credible and well-written, and the women are strong, determined and even, at times, outspoken, without this coming off as entirely unrealistic for when it takes place. This has gorgeous cinematography and spot-on editing, as well. I love how this uses the Old English, and yet you can follow it with no problems. There is a bit of sexuality, a little disturbing content/violence and infrequent mild to moderate language in this. I recommend this to any fans of dramas and/or period pieces. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
One for the chopping block.,"Another venture into Tudor History Lite. This film has gone the way of the recent HBO miniseries on the Tudors. I admit the Tudor family, with the exception of Elizabeth I, were the B-movie equivalent of English royals, but this film poorly modernizes their lack of sensibility and desperation to build a dynasty on very shaky hereditary ground. The conflicts all seem equivalent to Silicon Valley mergers. Dry, scrubbed clean, and dressed with cable-TV sex scenes. The movie's on-screen talent is immense. I have never seen Natalie Portman acting so badly, so over the top. I have to surmise this was the director's bidding. And what was happening with Mark Rylance's beards? I think that make up person might end up in The Tower. The whole production reminded me of the history pictures of the 1940s and 1950s. However, those beloved old films were great camp and did not take themselves as seriously as this misguided attempt.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Great film with the right level of expectations...,"I walked into the theater to see The Other Boleyn Girl with extremely low expectations. I am not a Scarlett Johansson fan, and Natalie Portman has had her fair share of roles where she's left us wanting more. I assumed Eric Bana would be the bright spot in this nearly two hour long chick flick.After leaving the film, I found out my initial assumptions could not have been any more the polar opposite of the film itself. Both the female leads (and in fact almost all the female characters) were played remarkably, and I felt that Natalie Portman specifically really outdid herself with portraying the emotional distress of her character. Eric Bana, conversely, was not cast properly for this role. Perhaps after his portrayal as Hector in ""Troy"" there was an assumption he could play royalty, which may indeed be true, but not not in this movie. And lastly, this is most definitely NOT a chick flick.The film did step fairly closely to the realm of clichés, but the dialog and acting was credible enough to outweigh this. The costumes were not too elaborate as to take away from the film, and neither was the background music or camera work (both of which I found to be excellent).Those who go in to see this movie as a film version of the television show ""The Tudors,"" be warned. This is not a chick-flick television show dragged out into 2 hours on screen, and has a few fairly suspenseful (and to some) frightening moments. Those who intend to see an accurate historical piece should also be warned; though the historical content of the movie to some extent seemed accurate, this film was not written by a ""History Channel"" employee. If you go in to the theater to see a well-acted and scripted drama, which will open your eyes (if you had no previous knowledge) to the story of the Boleyn sisters, then you will be very satisfied, and will most likely leave ranting and raving about this film.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Period,"Every other (and mostly good) periodic drama, tries and puts contemporary issues in it's theme (or at least the story).

I think it is.Not only for those who like there costume/period drama (they'll watch the movie, regardless of what I or anybody else is gonna write), but also for newbies and people who like dramas. This movie is very well acted, could be a bit tighter on the pacing part, but all in all, it was a satisfying experience/movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Pretty costumes - and that's it,"This is a terrible film, there's no two ways about it. The script is bad, the actors miscast, and it fails to give any real insight into the Tudor era. I can forgive historical inaccuracy in decent films, but this is far from a decent film.My biggest disappointment is the lack of scope. The budget was clearly blown on making the costumes and hiring the actors, because the entire film takes place in a dingy mansion. Scenes set outside are few and far between. Even the key execution scene, which would have seen hundreds of spectators, has about half a dozen bored-looking extras standing around instead.Johansson is vacuous and Portman made me cringe at times. Eric Bana is probably the worst actor yet to play Henry VIII (and he knows it), but at least he has little to do. The best actor in the film, Eddie Redmayne (of PILLARS OF THE EARTH) is wasted as a pageboy. I find Philippa Gregory a dry, unengaging author anyway, but I'd hoped this would be a decent adaptation. How wrong I was! As for the bit where Anne is prepared to commit incest with her own brother - ludicrous! They should have just brought in Cromwell making up evidence in his torture chamber, at least that would be closer to the truth.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Squandered . . .,"Losing your head to ambition is pretty much what we know of Anne Boleyn, wife of the mercurial Henry VIII, who clipped a few necks to get a legitimate Tudor heir. The Other Boleyn Girl details the inner workings of the Boleyn family's intrigues to get their daughters in the bed of the king to secure their fortunes. The relentlessly disappointing births form the boring center of a period drama that shows how the superior talents of Natalie Portman (Anne) and Scarlett Johansson (Mary) can be squandered.The accessories, like those in Sophia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, are visually stunning: costumes, castles, boudoirs are appointed sumptuously and, I presume, accurately. What's lacking here is in the depiction of Henry by Eric Bana, as physically, intellectually, and emotionally far from Charles Laughton's defining portrayal as could be possible. Even if Laughton's part were trumped up, the king who married six times and may have composed Greensleeves (Anne did reject his advances, after all ( ""cast me off discourteously"") was more than a disappointed baby maker, as neophyte director Justin Chadwick has Bana play it.That Anne was beheaded for adultery is known; when the film proposes incest as a mitigating circumstance, I'm lost to the extent that I'll have to verify this salacious footnote at a future date. The film does acknowledge that Henry assumed a dangerous power after he realized that an alliance with Rome was unnecessary. But then this is essentially a study of sixteenth-century women lost to the power of men, not a history of bad boy Henry.As a feminist tract, The Other Boleyn Girl works. These ladies define their lives by achieving social station in whatever way possible, being reminded of their infamy by their mother, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, played with an ominous resignation by Kristin Scott-Thomas. The ascendancy of the surpassing Elizabeth to the throne, presiding over the arguably most productive era in Western history, is a satisfactory coda to this film and a supreme irony for a king who thought only a male heir could assure transcendent hegemony.Hillary Clinton's achievements can be illuminated and enhanced by looking at the centuries-old queen who supported William Shakespeare. Perhaps Hillary will join Elizabeth in making converts of obtuse men and enabling women in the 21st century.",,Anonymous,History
Great actresses - not real history,"Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman are great in this movie. The opposition of temperament between the 2 sisters is well played by these two gorgeous actresses. The atmosphere of the royal court is also well described.However, don't expect from this movie to see a reconstitution of these historical events that changed the destiny of England (the separation with the Catholic church). The movie is full of historical inaccuracies.But, even if not historical, the story is dramatically intense and seems real.Forget the real story, see it as a fiction. A story of love, jealousy, power, domination, cruelty, forgiveness. A whirl of violent passions that will leave you breathless and knocked out at the end of movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"could've been a good deal better, but as it stands it's not too disrespectful (not of history, I mean as a movie)","The Other Boleyn Girl's approach to its story of corrupted love and lust and, in the end, the cold search for a male heir to Henry the VIII, might have worked a lot better had the director gone for one of two approaches: either an extremely restrained, Barry Lyndon-esq style with the performances and a tight control of shots and editing, OR a trashy guilty-pleasure kind of style, with an R rating and a look at the historical documents that throws it on its head completely. As it stands it's just... conventional, emotional kind of stuff. It's about as shallow in its own way as an episode of Beverly Hills 90210, and yet has enough really good acting (or at least appearing to be so) to justify its existence in movie theaters as opposed to straight-to-PBS weeknight. If you've seen the trailer, you'll know if this PG-13 material is for you.Now, taking just from history perspective, one should understand that it's not for purists: there's very little actual politics here, except ""No, Henry can't split from the Catholic church (next scene) Henry splits from Catholic church"". It's a relationship drama when it comes down to it, between the two Boleyn sisters, Ann (the more famous one, for obvious reasons, played by Natalie Portman) and Mary (the shy and sweet one, and thus the one to produce a male not-so-heir played by Scarlett Johansson), and how they become ""involved"" with the infamous Tudor. Involved, by means of a pushy uncle and father who through power and influence get Mary to become his mistress and use her for a child which, ironically, can't be used as an heir to the throne. Meanwhile, Ann tempts Henry in the most dastardly way she knows how- reject him, and force him to break certain rules (i.e. divorce) to truly get what he wants. Bad move, it turns out of course.All of this plays out with sweeping, romantic/period music, great costumes and very good sets, and even the acting from Portman is way above average for this type of pap. She's truly on her way to being one of the best actresses of her time. Johansson, on the other hand, isn't given as much of a character to work with, so her performance doesn't go quite as deep (albeit when asked to do so she is good, weird non-eyebrows and all). Bana, on a whole other hand, has the crap end of the stick: he's so good an actor in other pieces- most notably Munich and, as I've heard but not seen, Chopper- that it's a shame to see him with such a one-dimensional cliché. It almost becomes like a dull running gag where it's more like the Henry Tudor corporation, where we continue to procreate the finest male seed to the next male heir.If it was more dangerous and seductive ala Dangerous Liasons, it's dramatic ambitions might get more and more interesting. As it stands, it's a good piece for the crowd its meant for: highbrow chick-flick fans, and those who want just a spike of difference between their Masterpiece theater and actual Hollywood product. If you want a great film, look elsewhere, probably much elsewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Could have been better, but still worth it for those interested in the story","Quite a good period-drama about a famous story of loyalty & betrayal. Though there were questions raised as to why American actresses were chosen to play such important 'english' roles, they did a good job. Potman proves again that she is a versatile...(read more) actress, & Johanson was OK. Bana's portrayal of a lustful king was quite bland and could have been given more substance. The settings & costumes gave the film an authentic feel, however some parts did feel rushed. I felt that the conflicting emotions depicted should have been explored further. For instance Catherine the great's role was lacking in substance, considering how loved she was as a queen.Overall, this was a good period-drama for those who enjoy the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,History
An intoxicating historical romance,"I had read the book, and now I had just seen the film with my mother. I thought both the book and the film were excellent. I did get confused about the genre, though. I mean, is it a historical romance? Or an historical drama? But I know the film is a historical romance because of the two sisters, Mary and Anne Boleyn, pitting against each other for King Henry's affection. After Henry (Troy's Eric Bana) tires of his queen, Katherine of Aragon, he initially takes Mary as his mistress, who bears him a bastard son. But Anne manipulates herself into the bedroom of the king, forcing him finally to marry her on the promise that she will bear him a male heir to the throne. Mary is thus reduced to ""The Other Boleyn Girl.""You know, throughout the film, I couldn't believe that Mary and Anne were very close to each other. But after Mary attended his majesty's wounds after a hunting accident, And at the palace, Henry and Mary play ""That's not a belly button; that's not my finger,"" and then Mary bears him a bastard son. She also ""squealed on"" Anne about her secret marriage to Henry Percy. Now Anne hates Mary, but of course Mary was there for Anne as a queen 'til the end after all that happened during her reign, and... well, let's not go there. You will see the film for yourself, for those who love historical romance like myself.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Not worth the time or the money,"WARNING-potential SPOILER ALERT: Although I am a huge fan of Phillipa Gregory's work, I was extremely disappointed that she allowed the screenplay to be as awful as it was. I understand the historical inaccuracies (they are needed sometimes to make the story flow better) but some of them are grossly and unwisely used. Why is the King surprised to find Mary married when HE was the one that arranged the marriage to William Carey. Also Anne was not exiled to France because of showing off for the king, that was a random addition to the story line. The addition of the rape scene between Henry and Anne was by far the most horrifying of them all. The part wasn't even in Gregory's book!As far as casting goes, where to begin. The ONLY two roles cast correctly were Norfolk and Lady Elizabeth Boleyn both played spot on to the historical depiction of those people. Why did NATALIE PORTMAN play the legendary Anne Boleyn as a petty, grinning idiot. As far as grace goes, i guess some things cannot be taught. Anne Boleyn was graceful and intriguing, neither of which came out in Portman's portrayal. THOMAS BOLEYN'S casting was nothing short of a joke. Here is a person who was a savvy, manipulative business man willing to prostitute his daughters out for his own gain. Instead the audience has to watch a man who seems scared of his own shadow. Eric Bana could have made the role of the King very enjoyable if the writing of his role would have had any kind of substance. WILLIAM STAFFORD historically was a tall, handsome, strapping, and assertive man so why was the role given to a scrawny 12 year old look-alike? Costumes were another downfall. In the DVD extras, it was mentioned that the production ""searched high and low for Tudor costumes but another production (Showtime's The Tudors) had used them all up."" So the production was not intending to use original costumes based on the feel of the screenplay that was written. It seems an easy way out to use someone else's time and effort. Instead, the audience has to watch the characters prance around in the same dress just in different colors. The costumes looked very cheaply designed and made and it is evident on screen.Overall, this movie seemed to lack in so many areas and one has to wonder if so much money was spent to attain the three leads and had little money left to allocate elsewhere. If you love the Tudor era, I suggest you do not see this movie, it will just make you want to throw something at your TV.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Solid effort, well worth seeing","A few things up front: I never read the book, I love period movies, and I've always been interested in the Tudors. In light of that...""The Other Boleyn Girl"" excels in many, many ways. The look and feel of the film are superb (I guess credit the art direction). There is always a brooding, mysterious, dark element in every visual. I think there were only two instances where we saw full golden sunlight, and those were two scenes, one at the very beginning and one at the very end, where children are shown running through a tall grass field.The costumes are fabulous. The colors seemed a bit strong and almost gaudy for that era, but the clothes (men's and women's) are to die for.Acting was very strong throughout. Scarlet as Mary Boleyn was fantastic, at first disliking the court and only going in order to help her sister's cause; then gradually warming up to Henry and eventually coming to love him; then her hardened, steely self towards the end as she sees her family come to disaster and herself as the only cool-headed person left who can do some good.Portman's portrayal of Anne was terrific. She too went through a series of changes and made them all credible. Her gradual unraveling towards the end was particularly powerful and remained convincing.Bana's Henry was, contrary to other reviewers' opinions, very engaging and quite central to the film. He was able to capture both the tenderness and poetic side of Henry along with his manic and despotic side.Supporting roles were also well done: Queen Catherine, the Duke of Norfolk, Anne and Mary's brother, all had important contributions. Anne and Mary's parents, the Boleyns, were fascinating: the grasping of the father for advancement and riches, but always with some nagging doubts showing in his eyes; and the resigned strength of the mother who was powerless to interfere and could only watch her family's destruction.Now, on the other hand, the script does suffer from numerous shortcomings. The language throughout is very much today's language, and one is often struck by phrases and sentiments which surely no one in that era could have conceived or framed in those words. There are a number of loose ends which the plot never ties up: what happens to Mary's son or her husband, for instance? And if Norfolk in the end betrays his family, why are we not given any insight to his moral wrestlings with this betrayal (after seeing him plot and scheme to advance the family interests all through the movie)? Music was generally weak; not at all period-appropriate, occasionally trying to be but generally not.The most profound aspect of the movie is that it made one think about the role of women, how the only avenue for an ambitious woman to reach power and authority was to seduce a powerful man, and Henry was about as powerful as they got. To think that a miscarriage meant the difference between her being beheaded or being the most powerful woman in the realm is pretty amazing.This is also a strong cautionary tale, as Anne seeks the security that comes from being married to the king, although the only way to do that is to convince him to annul his previous marriage which in turn makes all his future marriages just as easily revocable. The relationship between sisters is another dominant theme, part rivalry, part mutual support, and in the end unflagging devotion.All in all, it is probably not the definitive portrayal of these characters, but it does capture one's imagination. Whether historically informed or not, the movie conveys a powerful sense of the turmoil and intrigue of the Tudor court.",8.0,Anonymous,History
It would be a better movie if it were historically accurate.,"This film is based on the love affairs between the English King Henry VIII and his two courtesans, Mary and Anne Boleyn, the second of which would become queen, though for a short period. Directed by Justin Chadwick, was written by Peter Morgan and has the participation of Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana.This film has its origin not on historical facts but on a historical novel by Philippa Gregory, slightly inspired by historical facts. So, this movie does not portray what really happened. An historical novel is not a history book and, unfortunately for the movie, this novel is bad, openly subverts the facts and omits some historical personalities that were crucial for this events. Basically, she almost rewrote history and Justin Chadwick obediently swallowed all the straw the book had without bothering to examine their veracity.In fact, while this film portrays Mary Boleyn as a very serious girl, the truth is that she had a very bad reputation and maybe have had lots of lovers, in the French and English courts. As the Boleyn family machinations seem to be true, probably didn't have involved Anne because she fell in love with Henry Percy, heir to the duchy of Northumberland. Who probably also fell in love was the king, but we know that Anne rejected his advances. Thinking about it, we can almost hear Anne saying ""no, no way. Only after the wedding, I am a family girl"".Returning to the film, and knowing now that the script is bad because it had a poor start (everything that is born crooked, later or never straightens), we can say that Eric Bana disappointed in the role of the English king: besides he not seem very inspired or comfortable with his character, Bana starred in a stupid violation scene. Henry VIII was a famous gentleman, a seducer, he didn't need to humiliate himself violating a girl, no matter what. Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson look good in the roles of the Boleyn girls and, judging by the portraits, they must be very similar to what the real girls were.The most interesting thins in this film are the sets, the costumes and the visual effects. The scenarios are many, usually English cathedrals and palaces from that time. The costumes have been carefully designed to portray the historical period faithfully, radically contrasting with the script.",3.0,Anonymous,History

I would diffinately recommend watching this but you might want to catch up on a little history before hand. I like Anne was a very gifted and strong willed person but she has courage to bout.

Proto-femme fatale captures the king's fancy and plays him like a lute.,"Java Man Reviews ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" (Rated PG-13. Directed by Justin Chadwick. Written by Peter Morgan. Starring Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Eric Bana, David Morrissey, Kristen Scott Thomas, Mark Rylance, Jim Sturgess & Ana Torrent. Running Time: 115 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW:England's Henry VIII (Bana) and his Queen, Katherine of Aragon (Torrent) have been unable to produce a male heir to secure the Tudor royal line. While the Henry decides on a course of action, he finds himself in need of a mistress. The Duke of Norfolk (Morrissey) and Sir Thomas Boleyn (Rylance) realize that their family fortunes can be greatly enhanced if Boleyn makes one of his fetching daughters available for the king's consideration. Strong-willed Anne (Portman, pictured left) is chosen, but soon falls out of favor and is banished to France. Naive Mary (Johansson, right) then catches the king's eye and becomes his lover, even though she is already married to a merchant's son (who approves the match when offered a cushy job at court). By the time Henry loses interest in Mary, Anne is back from France having studied the womanly wiles of the femme fatale. She captures the king's fancy and plays him like a lute. She will gladly submit once his majesty meets a few minor requirements... break with the Church of Rome, annul his marriage to Katharine, and take her as his queen. The rest is history -- and you know some heads are gonna roll.REVIEW: 2.5 Java Mugs out of 4This is the story of how the course of human history was changed when the most powerful man in the world risked his kingdom and his soul for the love of a beautiful woman. I'm not sure any movie can do justice to such a momentous theme, and this one wisely doesn't even try. It begins as a mildly interesting, conventional costumer, but somewhere along the way deteriorates into an embarrassingly soapy melodrama.While the characterizations never rise to the level of the historical figures they are based upon, the acting itself is more than enough to keep the viewer's interest. As the king, Bana seems a strange casting choice. My image of Henry forever remains Charles Laughton gleefully devouring a leg of mutton. Bana's Henry is much younger, more virile and interested in legs, but not of the mutton variety. The problem with Bana is that his kingly bearing is overshadowed whenever one of the Boleyn girls enters the frame.Portman is nicely naughty as England's most notorious seductress, while Johansson brings the voluptuously innocent Mary as far as the screenplay will allow her. The supporting cast is impressive too, with Morrissey as the dastardly duke of Norfolk, Scott Thomas as a proto-feminist Lady Boleyn and Torrent as the spurned Katharine.The movie's greatest strength is certainly the art direction and production design. All of the exteriors and many of the interiors were shot in castles and estates that actually date back to the period portrayed. England has what it calls the National Trust, a system that preserves its history all the way back to King Arthur. It's great for tourists... and movie makers, too.In many movies made in England the setting is often a central character, and -- as in this film -- one of the most interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Neither The Best Nor The Worst Of The Many Tudor Movies,"For a dynasty that only lasted a little over a century (although in that relatively short span of time it produced 5 monarchs - or 6, if you count Jane Grey - including two of the greatest in Henry VIII and Elizabeth I) the Tudors have had a disproportionate impact on both history and Hollywood. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is the latest in the Tudor-inspired collection of films. It's not the best of the bunch (I'd personally give that place to ""Lady Jane"") but it's also not the worst. It features an excellent performance from Natalie Portman as Anne Boleyn and also from Scarlett Johansson as her younger sister Mary. Yes, it perhaps has too much of a soap opera type feel to it (although that tends to be the way we regard the British monarchy today as well) but it is interesting and I thought it portrayed a believable account of the complicated relationship between the two Boleyn girls as they competed for the attention and love of Henry VIII, played by Eric Bana, who I thought failed to nail that part as well as he could have, but who wasn't bad. I also thought that Ana Torrant gave a pretty good performance as Henry's first Queen, the unfortunate Catharine of Aragon.The reconstruction of 16th century England (in the sets and the costumes) was well done, while some of the dialogue was, frankly, less than engrossing. To modern eyes, the most unsettling thing about the movie might be the way in which the Boleyn girls were used as pawns by their own father and uncle - knowingly sent off to the royal court to be sexual playthings for the king (even though Mary was already married) - in order to gain the family favour and status. Even having said that, it's difficult to feel too much sympathy for them - especially for Anne, who is portrayed as a master manipulator who would willingly sell out anyone to fulfill her dream of becoming England's Queen. As I said, this is neither the best nor the worst ""Tudor movie"" you'll find, but it is a decent enough movie - not a masterpiece, but worth a couple of hours to see it through. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
The sad saga of the Boleyns,"If you are a student of history you know that this is not a movie in which everyone is destined to live happily ever after. If you are not a student of history you've probably wandered into the wrong movie. 16th century English royal dramas are not everyone's cup of tea. I suppose one could try to ignore the historical aspects and just look at this as a romance film. But there really is nothing particularly romantic going on here. The characters in this film are motivated by many things but love certainly does not seem to be one of them. It's a rather tawdry spectacle and very few of the characters do much to earn your sympathy. But there is no denying that it is an enjoyable, compelling film.Henry VIII has been a popular film subject but while he is an important figure here this is not a film about the king. Rather it is the story of two sisters who would end up vying for his affection. The story of Anne Boleyn is well known. But there was another Boleyn girl. Anne's sister Mary may not be nearly as famous in the annals of history but she has her own story to tell. And in this film that story is told and some of it is even true. Yes, this is a film littered with historical inaccuracies. It's not a documentary, it's entertainment and the film takes liberties with the truth to try to make things more interesting. But the gist of the actual historical story is there. And it is quite a story.Natalie Portman plays Anne and her performance is probably the best thing about the film. It's a fascinating character arc to say the least and Portman hits all the right notes. Sweet and charming at times, conniving and ruthless at others. It's a powerful portrayal. Scarlett Johansson has a less showy role as Mary, not getting very many of the big dramatic moments presented to Portman. But her performance is certainly fine and she creates one of the very few sympathetic characters in the film. Mary does things of which she may not be proud but she really had very little choice. While Anne's lust for power is evident you get the sense Mary would have been perfectly happy living out a quiet, nondescript life out in the country. In the end Mary is one of the few who comes out of things able to hold her head relatively high. Since we're dealing with Henry VIII here the fact she holds on to her head at all is probably an achievement.This is a film in which the story grabs you and it will certainly hold your interest throughout. For a period drama it is important to get the costumes and sets right to give things the proper feel and this film certainly does so. It looks spectacular. The film does have its problems though. There are some characters, most notably the sisters' father and especially their uncle, who are absolutely irredeemable louses and their presence at times makes it very hard to embrace the film. The things these two force upon the girls all for the supposed good of the family are deplorable. In their blind quest for power they don't seem to mind the fact that they may well ruin the girls' lives. Whereas Portman and Johansson do fine work one gets the sense that Eric Bana's portrayal of Henry VIII is somewhat lacking. Henry does not come across as powerfully as one might expect. The ruthless streak is there but it seems there's a certain something missing. And while the story is engaging you feel that in the end things are rather rushed. The second half of the film moves at breakneck speed with important historical events flying by as the film hurries to its conclusion. After spending so much time setting up the connection between Henry and the sisters in the first half of the film more time certainly could have been spent to allow things to be properly paid off. All of a sudden the film's over and you're left wanting to see and know more. All in all it's an enjoyable film. Not perfect by any means but entertaining enough and a worthwhile, if not always entirely accurate, look back at a fascinating time in history.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Don't judge this by the book!,"I've been hearing constant whining that the movie has done an injustice to the book by not accurately portraying it. While, I thought the novel was marvelous, the movie was just as beautiful - in a different way.

In the movie, they tried to show the viewers a more vulnerable side to Anne. Natalie Portman was devilishly good in this movie and you could really feel the pain she was in near the end.Eric Bana (incredibly charismatic) and Scarlett Johansson played their roles well as well, but Johansson never truly shone for me.

If you want to! Watch it for Natalie Portman,"Just watched this movie and must say I was disappointed by the treatment to this royal subject. This subject required more screen time than under 2 hrs as after the movie the feeling you are left with is there should have been more, more in detailed. But apart from less details in the story, acting is superb and especially by Portman. Natalie Portman definitely deserves praises and awards for her depiction of 'Anne', she is simply brilliant. Her portrayal of the Other Boleyn Girl gives her everything, every space to show off her skill as an actress and she does that with complete authority. Scarlett too is good in her role, and so are other actors. Again among another negative aspect of the movie in Eric Bana, he is a very good actor but he had nothing to do in this movie and also for me he wasn't at his best either and at any time didn't feel like he is the King of England, he lacked that authority.

"Shameless exploitation film, inferior re-tread with bad direction","The BBC made a TV series of this in 2003 and then decided to flog that horse again, so this was the result, an inferior feature film, very badly directed indeed by Justin Chadwick. The casting is terrible. The history is nonsense. (Anne Boleyn was the younger sister, not the older one as misrepresented in the novel, etc., etc.) Despite the terrible flaws in this misconceived monster of a project, some sterling performances do stand out. The most impressive is Ana Torent, the Spanish actress who has been a favourite of true cineastes since she played a 12-year-old in 'El Nido' (1980). She nearly steals the film, and if it were not for Scarlett Johansson being so good, she would have. Johansson has a natural dignity and an innate sensitivity to period (as she showed in 'Girl with a Pearl Earring'), so she and Ana Torent were perfectly capable of directing themselves and pulling off magnificent performances. Natalie Portman was a casting disaster. In the first part of the film, obviously wholly lacking in any meaningful direction, she tries to portray the flighty young Anne but does so as a 2008 girl, complete with the same knowing looks and arrogant insouciance you would expect to find in that wonderful satire 'Clueless' (1995), rather than in a period drama. In the latter part of the film, where at last she has a definable character and situation which she can at last figure out, she delivers some very powerful dramatic acting indeed, but always with too modern a touch. She was simply not made for the 16th century, sorry. Australian Eric Bana is totally and even more disastrously miscast as King Henry VIII. Since everyone knows that Henry was gingery in appearance and inclined to corpulence, why do we see this ludicrous version of him as a kind of brooding macho chap who has just stepped in from the set of 'Star Trek'? For more than half of the film, everybody addresses the king as 'Your Grace', whereas for the whole of English history, no such form of address was ever used for a king, but was only used for bishops, dukes, and duchesses. More than halfway through, unable to re-shoot their earlier scenes, they suddenly realize their mistake and start calling him 'Your Majesty', but it is too late. David Morissey is way, way over the top in his portrayal of the Duke of Norfolk. There was clearly no directorial control with this production at all. Was Chadwick sitting gagged and bound in a corner, one wonders? Even that old pro Kristin Scott-Thomas wobbles in her early scenes, unsure of what everybody is meant to be doing. Mark Rylance looks like he needs to run and do diarrhoea in every scene. Eddie Redmayne does very well, which I am glad to see, as he never went to drama school and defied parental advice to be a banker, so he pulled it off before his father's three years of support was up, well done Eddie. Juno Temple does as well as she could in an undefined part with no help. Why do they keep doing this to history? Why don't they just tell the TRUE stories and be accurate once in a while? Truth is more interesting than all this nonsensical, exploitative fantasy. The producers, director, script writer, head of the BBC, and the whole sorry lot responsible for this abomination should be taken out and shot. No, correction, - beheaded!

"Dear Lord, what a bad movie","When I saw the title I thought it was going to focus on Mary rather then more famous (infamous?) Anne but no. Then I thought, hey, maybe it will focus on relations between sisters but that is only partially true. Instead the movie starts with two sisters living together, then how they try to win king's attention then on Anne's story.And all that crammed into 2 hours so expect things to start happening really fast, specially after Anne wins king's affection. In the end Mary takes a back seat and Anne is the focus so not really ""the other"" Boleyn girl.I can understand that studios are trying to cash in on interest in Tudors (be it Elizabeth or The Tudors series) but this one is just first two seasons of said series condensed into 2 hours.this movie had potential but was wasted on script that failed to focus on less-known parts of this story and instead after somewhat interesting start fell into retelling the known parts of this saga.avoid if possible",,Anonymous,History

enjoyable but historically questionable costume drama,"Though no ""A Man for all Seasons"" by any stretch of the imagination, Justin Chadwick's ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is a handsomely mounted, reasonably entertaining soap opera set in the politically-charged court of King Henry VIII.Based on the highly fictionalized and speculative novel by Phillipa Gregory, the movie chronicles the 16th Century catfight between the two Boleyn sisters - the more famous one, Anne, whose marriage to the divorced king resulted in England's final rupture with the Church of Rome (and the eventual loss of her own head when she, like his first wife Catherine, could not provide him with a male heir), and the lesser known, already married Mary who, at least as portrayed in this film, was every bit as attractive to the king as the sister who would eventually win his hand.The Peter Morgan screenplay reduces the complex historical events to the level of a Harlequin Romance, pitting the two sisters against one another in a competition for the king's affections. All of this is of considerably less interest than the almost ruthless, behind-the-scenes machinations undertaken by the girls' family to groom them as concubines for the crass purpose of currying royal favor. In fact, it is when the movie touches on the mores of the time and of life at court that it is at its most compelling.Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana all seem to be having great fun playing at dress-up, but the richest performances are delivered by Mark Rylance and David Morrissey as the girls' calculating father and uncle respectively, and Kristin Scott Thomas as their levelheaded, pragmatic mother, helpless to prevent the tragedy that was doomed to engulf her family.The costumes and settings are nothing short of sensational, and they alone maintain our interest even when the scriptwriting fails to live up to the level of its subject.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Nice costumes.  Terrible editing.,"As previously commented, the book ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" was not particularly accurate from a historical perspective, but at least the characters were developed. The best part of this movie was the costumes. Some of the acting was OK, but the script or the editing of the movie (or both) was awful! The movie neither followed generally accepted historical fact nor the points and time line proposed by Gregory as fact. It skipped around leaving out important points, which made it impossible to follow the story. I went with a friend, and part way through(after Mary is receiving a marriage proposal), I asked my friend ""Did I miss something or did they neglect to mention that Mary's husband died?"" Now, I will admit that I might have dozed off or been daydreaming, but my friend confirmed that the movie had left out that little bit of information. Furhter, I could swear that I'd previously seen scenes in previews that did not appear in the movie. Unless you just like looking at lavish costumes, stay home and read something instead. It would be a shame for people to think that this is a historically accurate movie. Better yet, save your money until you can afford to take a trip to Hampton Court (the ads for which say ""Henry loved it so much, he took his honeymoon there. Again and again and again. He did confiscate it from Woolsey, so I guess it was true.) You will learn more.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"Great acting, overly dramatic","Great acting, beautiful costuming and sets, but decidedly a bit too over dramatic.

Period Piece on a Dysfunctional Family,"I like historical fiction in general. I like films that deal with historical events. So I really made time out of this very busy week to see this film. The star power of course helped a lot to convince me to catch this. Imagine a movie that combines Natalie Portman AND Scarlett Johannsen. It is certainly a must-see for that combination alone.These two stars played the Boleyn sisters at the time of Henry VIII. Natalie is the more familiar Boleyn girl Anne, while Scarlett plays the unknown sister Mary. While their ambitious family is trying to push Anne to interest the King (played by the lucky Eric Bana), he actually falls for younger and married Mary first. Because of this, the family is brought to live in the King's court. Mary gets pregnant and gives birth to a son. But by then, the King has turned his eyes to Anne.The rest of the story, we are more familiar with already -- how Anne teases the King with her wiles so much that he breaks with the Catholic Church in order to divorce his wife Catherine of Aragon. However, when the King finally gains Anne's body (in an unexpectedly violent manner in this film), he is at the same time racked with severe guilt feelings about what he had done.This situation was not helped when Anne first born was a daughter. When Anne suffered a miscarriage next, she was already on the brink of madness on how to hang on to her position in court, especially since the king has already begun to show interest in Jane Seymour.We all know what happens to Anne in the end, so there is really no suspense there. But the family dynamics in the Boleyn family is really very interesting, albeit disturbing, to watch. The side stories and fates of Mary and brother George, as with those of their parents (particularly the mother so well-played by Kristin Scott Thomas) are so well integrated in the known history. I am not really sure where fiction separates from facts in these auxiliary stories.It was melodramatic, that is for sure. There were so many key omissions, such as the role of Thomas More, who was not even mentioned. Nevertheless, I was entertained. Got me interested to reading the book by Philippa Gregory soon. Good enough just to see Natalie and Scarlett together, most definitely.",6.0,Anonymous,History
One Of Portman's Best Performances,"Whilst I think this movie Missed a trick by not casting Keira Knightley as Natalie Portman's sister, this is still an excellent movie featuring brilliant performances from Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric BanaPlot In A Paragraph: Two beautiful sisters, Anne (Portman) and Mary (Johansson) Boleyn, driven by their family's blind ambition, compete for the love of the handsome and passionate King Henry VIII. (Bana)David Morrisey (Walking Dead) Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock) and Eddie Redmayne (Les Miserables) Kristin Scott Thomas (Four Weddings & A Funeral) are all good in their supporting roles, as is future Amazing Spiderman, Andrew Garfield. However this movie is all about the three leads, and Portman is the best of an excellent bunch, giving what I consider, to be one of the best performances of her career.She gives a brilliant performance as the tragic Anne Boleyn. Her Speech in her final scene is wonderful, and I'm surprised her performance here has not been as praised as much as her Oscar winning turn in ""Black Swan""Sadly her career will forever be linked with the Star Wars prequels which seemed to hurt her career, rather than help it. I think she is wonderful, and any movie automatically becomes better when her name is in the cast.",8.0,Anonymous,History

So Very Disappointed,"I have just finished watching this movie and I finished the book yesterday, so while I have the book fresh in my mind I shall say this. The Other Boleyn Girl (movie) is the worst book-movie adaptation I have ever seen. For one King Henry VIII does not RAPE Anne Boleyn, Mary Boleyn bears TWO children to King Henry, Catherine and Henry, William Stafford is not in the book until towards the end when he whisks Mary away to Rochford, where they have their own children, the country Anne refers when she sends Mary away should have been Hever NOT Rochford, and also Anne is exiled twice and she goes to Hever NOT France!!!!!This movie was appalling on all counts and I would never watch it again having read the book and also many more on the Boleyn family and the Tudor Court.

Flawed script and directing,"Regardless of historical accuracy, of faithfulness to the novel the Other Boleyn Girl is a bad film. The screenplay is a succession of scenes with very little purpose until the second half of the film. Even then it fails to create a sense of intimacy with the characters, a series of monsters in their own right for which the viewer does not care. Even the good sister is depicted as too stupid and obedient to be worth any sympathy. After all her sister has done to her she still loves her; whatever monstrosity her daddy or uncle asks her to perform she does it with a nod and smile. So she can't be the right point of view to tell the story and she is not. The main problem of this bad screenplay is indeed that it is not told from any body's point of view. The POV is outside. So is the spectator. Outside the theater quick. Fresh air. Relief. Now when it comes to directing, the director manages to make three of the most handsome actors and actresses in Hollywood today look plain, vulgar and tired. Almost every shot has the wrong POV. The camera moves are repetitive. Filming through a grid, a fence, whatever he can find is a repetitive pattern of photography. Horrible color timing. One scene is green, the other is dark, the other red, without any apparent logic. Lighting is crude, plain, TV-like most of the time, and all of a sudden falsely sophisticated for a minute without a reason. The castles feel empty and dead. You feel it's a movie set all the time. Costumes: ugly, taking all the appeal away from the actresses. A Majority of BBC TV period dramas look better than this film. Deserved to flop at the box despite its ultra glamorous cast and a very interesting story to begin with. A complete waste.",,Anonymous,History

"Glossy entertainment, but inaccurate history","""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is a highly romanticized, glossy adaptation of the Philippa Gregory novel about the fate of sisters Mary and Anne Boleyn in Tudor England, mostly focusing on Mary. She is shown as a soft, pliant pawn in a dangerous world where marriage and sex were used for political and financial gain, and what's really changed, one may ask?The cast is filled with big names and there are gorgeous sets and costumes that idealize the royal court of Henry VIII, but the script is laughably bad. Key historical facts are discarded in favor of soap opera-style storytelling. Everyone looks hot and there are a few dreamy sex scenes, but the interpretation of political gamesmanship in 16th century Europe is mangled to inject contemporary feminism and egalitarianism. You are better off watching Wolf Hall.This film might have been better if they had created a fictional king and court of this period instead of portraying real people and events. I assume they think all American viewers won't know the difference. Still, it's pretty, romantic, dramatic and steamy, so many people may enjoy it anyway.",5.0,Anonymous,History

The girlfriends and wives of Henry VIII - and the children of same,"Many are the attempts to tell the wide and deep story of England's talented but power-spoiled Henry VIII and his wives. The intrigue and the ramifications for Europe and the Christian religion are the ""wide and deep"" of it. This one rates well for acting, costumes, and scenery. Its flaw is in the concept of limiting it to the Boleyn family. That should have been its strength. Something doesn't go right. The skips and jumps, the telescoping in transitions may be the culprit. That's a director's job, and that of his staff. If it were to be otherwise, the story takes more care and not 115 minutes as is allowed here, but about twice that. It has been done. A series. This cast could have been a good one for that re-effort. Portman and Johannson are excellent as the Boleyn sisters. Their ambitious and doomed father and uncle are done very well. And King Henry's actor has the figure and face that could be aged unto his death, shall I say, comforted by his sixth wife. It would then take another few hours to tell the story of the daughter of Anne and Henry, Elizabeth I. History demands this to be told many times, probably each generation. Henry's father, Henry VII, was the last English king to win his title on a battlefield, at Bosworth in 1485, defeating Richard III. It would be good to see the story from that point. It could be carried through to Shakespeare and beyond Elizabeth to James I. Therefore, from 1485 to the earliest part of 1600. That would be something to shoot for. I wanted to see ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and did so over a 2.5 hour stretch with 45 minutes of TV commercials. Interruptions were every 10 to 15 minutes, and the ads were a jumble of nothingness as several were stacked without consideration for whatever part of the plot is chopped into. That's what TV has become: the greatest salesman ever invented, and yet powerless to do much beyond brand-naming. It may well be the goose that laid the golden egg but is cut open in greed to find them all -- so greed will kill it. Television is not an entertainment medium so much as it is an advertising medium. Rent the movie for a better experience and a chance to appreciate.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not a very good movie,"The Other Boleyn Girl was beyond disappointing. The acting was very good by all. The story was so far from reality that it was hard to watch. The problem with movies like this is that people watch them and think they are reality and historical. I prefer more historical versions of Anne such as The Six Wives of Henry VIII. Although Natalie Portman played a decent Anne, she was played much better by Geneviève Bujold, Natalie Dormer, and Merle Oberon. The danger in a movie like this is that young people will think that Henry VIII actually raped Anne. There are no historical documents that reflect that. In addition, Mary was banished from Court and never to return after she married a commoner without permission. The one thing it did portray fairly accurately was the role of Anne's father. He didn't care about anyone but himself.",2.0,Anonymous,History

Parts of the movie made me feel like I was watching a Renaissance fair, not a period piece. A bit repetitive as well concerning the ""birth"" scenes. Don't waste your money on this one, instead rent ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" (not on DVD, only VH).

Where Were My Heaving Bosoms?,"I was expecting heaving bosoms and bodice rippings galore from this costume drama, but sadly, the filmmakers and actors decide to take this piece of ""historical"" fiction seriously, and so ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is not nearly as fun as it could have been.Either Natalie Portman, as Anne, or Scarlett Johansson, as Mary, is the ""other"" girl of the title, depending on your point of view. Both are paraded before King Henry VIII (Eric Bana -- yeah right!) in an attempt to make one or the other his mistress and so establish the Boleyn family firmly in the king's favor. It's a vaguely feminist story -- the girls' uncle and father pull the strings, while their mother (Kristen Scott Thomas, underused) stands in the background looking disapproving. But first and foremost, the film is a gussied up bit of Masterpiece Theatre starring beautiful Hollywood actors.The film is entertaining, but never fully engaging. For me, this was largely due to the casting. Natalie Portman is directed to play Anne Boleyn like a scheming villainess one moment, and a nobly suffering wife the next. The performance is uneven and unconvincing, and I'm not sure if the fault lies with Portman as an actress, the way the part is written, or the way she's directed to play it. Eric Bana does not have the physical presence or spirit to play Henry VIII, though the ladies in the audience should be happy, because the only bosoms to be seen in the movie belong to him. Let's just say that if Henry VIII had looked like Eric Bana, history might have turned out differently.The only actress who I felt truly did service to her role is Scarlett Johansson. Johansson gets a bad rap from people for some reason, but every time I see her in something, I'm impressed by how much I like her. I think she's a good actress who doesn't coast on her looks (like she certainly could), and I wonder how this film would have come across if she and Portman had switched roles.Fans of elaborate costumes and production design should have fun with this movie.Grade: B+",6.0,Anonymous,History

I wasn't a big fan of the actor that played the king, nothing necessarily against him, he just didn't have the presence that the two sisters did.

I do have to admit though, it was quite trippy watching Black Widow and Doctor Strange going at it in the bedroom.Some flaws with the picture for me include the lack of nuance for certain side characters, and the big plot twist towards the end that really didn't feel like a twist the film was shaping it out to be.

Powerful Costume Drama,"The story of the six wives of Henry the Eigth is a staple of British history. Director Justin Chaswick , who cut his teeth on period drama with a TV production of ""Bleak House"", makes an excellent job of converting Phillipa Gregory's novel, in which she picks out the Boleyn girls contribution, onto the Big screen. Much of the credit for this goes to Peter Morgan whose fine screenplay confirms his status of one of the best writers of screen dialogue around at the moment.Whilst historically inaccurate in some key respects, the context is enough to provide a convincing and rewarding ""faction"".Two hours of intrigue, treachery, plotting and heartbreak focus on the efforts of the Boleyn family to do a spot of social climbing courtesy of their daughters Anne and Mary. Natalie Portman as the former, leaves Scarlett Johansson as the latter somewhat in her wake in a towering performance of froideur and ambition. Eric Bana as King Henry is absolutely convincing is his arrogant amorality, yet still allows the side of him which can be manipulated by women to shine through.Lavish, whilst falling short of being a full blown costume drama, the story depends upon plot , rather than action, and succeeds triumphantly. The below par CGI recreations of Medieval Cityscapes are more than compensated for by a rip roaring pace to a cleverly paced tale. My only criticism is that the cerebral battle between Henry and his wife Catherine, and the visceral passion of his relationships with Anne and Mary are somewhat under drawn, presumably to give it as wide an audience as possible with a 12A rating.However the ingredients of a King, mistresses, a scheming Court and razor sharp dialogue deliver an impressive result, which I can recommend to all.",7.0,Anonymous,History

She doesn't come off as being a period piece kind of actress. However she and Portman turn in the film's best performances, as well they should since they are playing the titled characters.Bana gives us a tortured and VERY faulty Henry VIII.

"THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL (Justin Chadwick, 2008) ***","Having studied European History in Secondary School, I've always been fascinated by the reign of England's King Henry VIII  a period less noted for chivalrous deeds than bed-hopping antics, as he married no less than six times in order to secure a male heir to the throne (even if this caused a rift between the country and the Roman Catholic Church which endures to this very day). Unsurprisingly, all of this has made him ideal film material  personally, I've watched THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII (1933), THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER (1937), THE SWORD AND THE ROSE (1953), YOUNG BESS (1953), A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS (both 1966 big-screen and 1988 TV versions), ANNE OF A THOUSAND DAYS (1969) and, of course, CARRY ON HENRY (1971); I recently acquired HENRY VIII AND HIS SIX WIVES (1972), which was adapted from a much longer TV series, but have yet to check it out.This, then, gives a 'novel' twist to the most turbulent period in Henry's life and reign  as we discover that, before making Anne Boleyn his Queen (whose offspring was Elizabeth I), he had been involved with her younger sister (who had actually borne him a son)!; incidentally, these events  based on a novel by Philippa Gregory  had already been adapted for the small screen in 2003but someone thought that this little-known romance was intriguing enough to make it into a feature film. As it stands, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is a sumptuous-looking production  despite being mostly restricted to interiors, and where the color scheme is actually quite subtle; for this reason, much depends on the acting  and the three leads (Natalie Portman as Anne, Scarlett Johannson as the titular figure and Eric Bana as Henry) are all given the opportunity to shine, thus overcoming their basic youthfulness for the roles. Two other notables in the cast are Kristin Scott-Thomas as the two Boleyn sisters' mother and Ana Torrent (still best-known for playing the little girl in THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE [1973]) as the barren and jealous Queen Katharine.Even so, the plot (which, reportedly, doesn't play fair with history) defies credibility at times and tends too often towards melodrama. For one thing, Henry is depicted as something of a pawn in the machinations of an over-ambitious family; he's also gullible (it's Anne who pushes him into breaking with Rome!) and, least convincingly of all, is the fact that everything seems to happen simply because she refuses to sleep with the King before he makes her Queen (which then leads to a potentially campy scene in which Henry rapes Anne)! The less said, then, of the Queen's attempt to entice her fey brother into impregnating her (soon after she loses Henry's second child)  and how this is what ultimately led to Anne's execution!  the better; incidentally, the film rather rushes through her tenure as sovereign (despite the title, she's the real protagonist)  while the pivotal character of Sir Thomas More (the subject of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS) doesn't figure at all in Church-rupture affair! That said, such narrative shortcomings don't really impinge on one's enjoyment of the film  hence the respectable rating accorded it.At the end of the day, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL won't dispel memories of the better cinematic versions of Henry VIII's reign and (some of his) loves  but it's nonetheless valuable as much for shedding light on an episode which had previously been all but overlooked as for its atypically frank detail of life at court.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Horrible history,"Asides from historical inaccuracies, and certain excruciatingly awkwardly written scenes (e.g. the King and Mary's bedroom scene), I thought this movie was quite well done.I do not agree with naysayers that claim Anne Boleyn was made out to be manipulative and cruel in this movie. She did have instances where she came across as cold-hearted, but the filmmakers did the best job in terms of character development for Anne, because at the end of the movie, in the face of possibly devastating circumstances, her cold facade slips off and we see her genuinely as a Boleyn girl. For me, the final scenes showed her fragility and I began to understand why she put up the front. Perhaps it all boils down to the almost always underrated role of women in court life.Natalie Portman did a brilliant job and her acting most definitely made me forget the historical inaccuracies. Scarlett Johansson was overshadowed by Portman to some extent, but given that she had extremely limited space to work with as a mostly one-dimensional character, I thought she did provide depth. I think the best thing of the movie is the chemistry because the chemistry of the Boleyn family, and especially between Portman and Johansson, really brought the movie up to a whole new level.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A colorful attempt to breathe new life into a familiar story,"An all-star cast weaves a sixteenth-century soap opera in this colorful attempt to breathe new life into a familiar story. Written by Peter Morgan and directed by Justin Chadwick, The Other Boleyn Girl (2008) was based on a novel of the same name by Philippa Gregory. Billed as a scandalous portrayal of King Henry VIII's courtship and eventual marriage to Anne Boleyn, this film seems quaint by today's standards. Its release was timed to capitalize on Showtime's The Tudors (2007-2010), but lacked that show's outstanding performances.The film opens in Tudor England during the reign of King Henry VIII (Eric Bana). Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) and his brother-in-law Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) learn the King is unhappy with his wife, Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent), who has not yet produced a male heir. They sense an opportunity to advance their social standing by installing one of Boleyn's daughters as the King's mistress. His daughter Mary (Scarlett Johansson) has already wed William Carey (Benedict Cumberbatch), so they turn to Anne (Natalie Portman).Over the objections of his wife, Elizabeth Boleyn (Kristin Scott Thomas), Thomas invites the King to his estate to introduce him to Anne. Things get complicated when the King is injured in a hunting accident and he falls in love with Mary when she tends to his injury. Mary becomes the King's mistress, and Anne is exiled to France for trying to marry an earl without the King's knowledge.Anne returns from France a transformed woman, and despite Mary giving birth to a baby boy, she sets her sights on winning the King's affection and becoming Queen. It's an all-too-familiar story, which ends in an all-too-familiar way. Unfortunately, the filmmakers chose to continue the story past its logical conclusion, when Anne wins the rivalry with Mary for the King's affection.King Henry VIII ruled England from 1509 to 1547. He is known for severing the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church, and for having six wives, two of whom he had executed. Mary Boleyn was the King's mistress for a time, and is rumored to have bore two of his illegitimate children. She was married twice, the second time to a common soldier, and died estranged from her family.Anne Boleyn became Queen of England in 1533, however, her failure to produce a male heir led to her execution for treason and other trumped-up charges three years later. Henry and Anne's daughter, Elizabeth, became one of England's most renowned queens, who reigned for over 44 years.The Other Boleyn Girl follows the general outline of history but changes many details. King Henry VIII met both Mary and Anne Boleyn at court, not at their father's estate. Henry had been present at Mary's wedding. Mary was not an innocent maiden when they met, having already had an affair with the King of France, among others in the French court. In contrast, Anne was well-educated, intelligent, gracious, and politically astute, a far cry from the brash and boorish depiction in this film. The Tudors also unfairly portrayed Anne this way.Compared with The Tudors, the acting in The Other Boleyn Girl leaves much to be desired. Natalie Dormer played a much more convincing seductress than Natalie Portman. She oozed sexuality, confidence, and energy. Jonathan Rhys Meyers' portrayal of King Henry VIII makes Eric Bana's seem flaccid by comparison. Of course, The Tudors had more time to develop their relationship and keep building the suspense. That's why The Other Boleyn Girl should have ended when Anne became queen and devoted more time to the rivalry with her sister.The Other Boleyn Girl is the kind of romantic costume drama that critics generally dislike but that appeals to a certain audience (the word ""soap opera"" comes to mind). It currently holds a 42% positive rating from critics and 62% audience favorability on RottenTomatoes. The film was commercially lukewarm as well, grossing $26.8 million on a $35 million budget. The filmmakers should have focused on what unique elements they brought to the story, rather than waste screen time rehashing what audiences have seen before.",6.0,Anonymous,History
History is Interesting Enough - You Don't Have to Change and Distort It,"This movie is one of the most God-awful portrayals of Tudor history I have ever seen. It even beats out ""The Tudors"" in it's inaccuracies and outright fictionalizations.They completely miss the mark on the time-line, the ages of the characters; they skim over important events, they portray main characters falsely - in short, they totally screw up this movie. If you are going to do an historical film, you should make it as true to history as possible.The historical truth of Henry VIII, Anne and Mary is much more compelling and fascinating than this tripe.

"Not very accurate, but quite captivating historical drama","The film captivates you from the first minutes. Lively acting, in addition to the swirling whirlwind of palace intrigues, is all that is needed to keep the viewer glued to the screen for quite a while. It is no secret that historical films are wildly popular, but still, many of these films fail miserably.After watching this film I immediately wanted to know what actually happened in the history of England and what was just a figment of the director's imagination. As expected, an enormous chunk of the story is pure fiction, but it surely adds a lot of personal engagement for the viewer, so I don't mind it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Natalie Portman... wow!,"After I watched this film on DVD I read a few comments about it here. It seems that people's main complaint is the inaccuracy of the movie which is supposedly based on real historical events. I however, don't care about this issue. I didn't even know it was based on a real story until I read those comments. Real or not real, the story is very lame. Although costume design and cinematography are very good, you cannot feel yourself interested in following the film because it lacks a key parameter: characterization. The characters are simple, one-sided, and yet hard to understand. There is only one exception. NATALIE PORTMAN. Her play is so powerful and sensible that you feel that she owns the film. She fills the empty space of a good director in the scenes that she is present. Her last scene in the movie, is alone able to win her an Oscar. I pity her for playing so good in a so-so film.6 out of 10 (of which 5.5 is for Natalie)",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Spellbinding Winner,"The story of the hapless wives of King Henry the Eighth is not any new. How many films and books do we have by now? Anyway, the new movie is a pretty fresh look at this never getting old story. The film boasts three huge stars  Eric Bana as Henry himself, Scarlet Johansen as Mar Boleyn, and Natalie Portman as unhappy Anna Boleyn. The film offers us a newer look at this story, and the whole 1 hour 45 minutes holds us tight. The plot is very curious and the actors play extremely well. A big cheer must go to Portman for her deep, serious, endearing and earnest performance. Her tragic heroine is very real, very convincing and very deep. Bana is a bit too slow and bleak as Henry, he really lacks some energy at times, and likewise Johansen is all the same frightened scary pretty face with half opened mouth. We saw it many times, did not we? The movie is not bereft of some bias. It seems that the filmmakers did everything to shift the initiative on all things from Henry to Anna. It is her who starts the whole machine rolling; it is her and not him instigating the schism with Pope, divorce and all. Bana seems so weak and passive here, that you start wondering if he is a king after all. Anna sometimes seems so evil and cruel in her plots that her tragic death sometimes looks like something she really deserved. But still, as a whole, this movie is a very good effort that is spellbinding in its portraying of the severe times. Recommended for a fresher look at old, trite story.",8.0,Anonymous,History
another movie about the Boleyn sisters,"One does not learn the history of Verona from 'Romeo and Juliet' - neither from Shakespeare's play, nor from Zeffirelli's film, nor from Prokofiev's ballet. This is what historical treatises are written and read for. Likewise, the story of the Tudor dynasty, the reign of Henry VIII, his relationships with the unhappy wives and their historical impact that gave birth to a major current in Christianity, are not learned either from the movies on the big screens, or from the television series nor from historical novels such as Philippa Gregory's, which was the basis of the film 'The Other Boleyn Girl' released in 2008 and directed by Justin Chadwick. The film by the British director, who specializes in television productions and is one of his few creations for the big screens, tries to present the story of the thousand days and the years that preceded them from a feminist perspective, emphasizing the relationships in the family Boleyn and bringing sister Mary on the same plane as Anne - the queen who will lose her head. The perspective is interesting, the realization has some problems.'The Other Boleyn Girl' is one of the cinematic versions of the story that deviates most noticeably from historical truth. Even if we're not history experts, we've seen the events on screen enough times to know that Mary was the older of the two sisters, that the French exile lasted many years and took place during the sisters' childhood and teenage years, or that a character key to the political intrigue was Cardinal Wolsey, who does not appear in the film at all. Instead, we are exposed in detail to the relationships between the two sisters, mutual loves and betrayals, parallel destinies, one of which would end in tragedy. I have no objection to historical licenses. The problem is that the material we are served instead of a more detailed description of the history of those years is a palace and alcove melodrama that fails to interest or excite. At least that's how I perceived it.What do we get when watching this movie? A stellar cast, first of all, with the perfect Scarlett Johansson as Mary and the slightly inappropriate - at times - Natalie Portman in the more difficult and complex role of Anne Boleyn. Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas, two actors I like a lot, are excellent as the sisters' parents. Benedict Cumberbatch, then just before the big roles of his career, seems undercast. The most difficult role in Henry VIII movies always seems to me to be the one of Henry VIII. Eric Bana is a good actor, but his performance emphasizes the predator side too much and did not at all reflect the great dilemmas behind his decisions. In addition, the physical appearance is also far from what we know historically. I'm waiting for the movie where Henry VIII looks like in Holbein's portrait. I found the historical reenactment - sets, costumes - accurate and detailed, British filmmakers are experts at this. 'The Other Boleyn Girl' could and probably aimed to be a film about the fate of women in a man's world and how the relationships between them can change something in the destinies of individuals and - in this case - of the nation. It only succeeded in being yet another film about the Tudor dynasty and not one of the best.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Rubbish,"This film was terrible. Not only did it not stick to historical facts (which would be understandable since Gregory didn't either), but it also completely changed the plot of the novel. First off, the first twenty minutes or so of Mary getting married, etc were never even in the novel, and basically wasted space in the movie. There was just so much wrong with this movie, I cannot even go into it all. I even like all three of the main leads. What annoyed me the most though, was the choppiness of the film. It never took the time to properly explain anything so that if someone who nothing of the Tudor Era walked in to see it, they'd be left dumbfounded the entire 115 minutes. Ex: If you hadn't read the book, you think ""what the heck happened to Mary's first husband?"" Also, they never shell out the characters properly. Mary, the MAIN CHARACTER, is barely in the movie at all! And you never really understand the relationship with Stafford or any of it! Hm, the one thing that irritated me the most: Henry raping Anne? WHAT?!",2.0,Anonymous,History
"8 stars for acting, alone","Both Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson were phenomenal in their roles. The flaw of this production lies only in the idea and subsequent attempt of compressing an extremely significant and complex era - yes, era - into a two-hour span. It felt as if I was watching 'Cliffs Notes' on Anne Boleyn's relationship with King Henry VIII, the Roman Catholic Church, the English court and the English people. How painful and disconcerting. I found my brain trying to pull all the background information that I have gleaned over the span of my life surrounding this story and with, at times, some breakthrough moments when I was genuinely moved by the acting of many of the cast members.",8.0,Anonymous,History
I liked the movie,"I thought it was a nice movie, especially as far as the photography and music were concerned. Now it's interesting to find out it's quite historically inaccurate, but this is usually the fact in this type of movies. I am Greek and get upset every time I see movies about Greek history (eg. Troy - I'm talking about the storyline).I think they chose a very young and sexy actor to portray the king. I mean, which girl would really regard giving herself to him as a sacrifice? Anyway, I imagine why they did that - that's the reason I myself went to see the movie in the first place! Eric was great as always, but I don't think the script helped him much.About the actresses. I think Natalie Portman was quite good there. She managed to make me both like and dislike her character at times, which I think is good. Johansson was awful, I see her acting the same boring way every time in every movie she is in, I think I would act better! I found Christine Scott Thomas's acting surprisingly dramatic and persuasive. I think she would make a great supporting actress academy award nomination.In all, the movie was pleasant but a bit tiring, too few characters maybe and script loops.I give a 7/10 - worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Fascinating History, Entertaining Presentation","I give all credit to Scarlett and Natalie. What a great combination they made, two of the best of their generation. It doesn't seem like a very common thing to let two actresses of their age carry a film, so I also offer a solute to the director for the cast. I also happen to like Kristin Scott-Thomas, though I'm not so impressed with the roles she gets to do. I think she was marvelous as the mother. I'm not so certain about Eric Bana as Henry VIII. Henry was an imposing figure in his era, and I'm not sure Bana has the charisma to pull it off (I liked him better as Hector, though even there I didn't get the heroic stature that I thought a semi-mythical figure ought to have). I wonder how Stellan Skarsgard might have been as Henry. Ah well.Truth is that now that I've seen this movie, I think I do want to see Anne of a Thousand Days. My reading of Anne's history is that she wasn't sent to France for misbehavior, she went there because she wanted to and stayed longer. So maybe I'll have to go back and look at the story again. If history had gone the way this movie did, I'd have been tempted to think the royal French court deliberately taught Anne so that she'd sow dissension at home since the English and French courts had a long history of jousting for preeminence in the European power scene. If Anne had to ""take it in the neck"" from such power politics, I'm sure France wouldn't mind that at all, would think it served her father right for his own use of girls to ""advance"" his family.Anyway, I got it for Scarlett, who has the same effect on me she had on Henry.

Somewhere on the List,"I actually did look forward to this film. I practically dragged my sister to the cinema so we could see the adaptation of Philippa Gregory's bestseller. Given, I was half expecting distortion, but this is movie's alteration is in a class of its own. The already twisted history of Philippa Gregory was transformed to something else entirely, a movie that only feints historical reference. But you don't really come to the movies to be given a history lecture now do you? No. You come to be entertained. Was I entertained? Far from.Firstly, I believe credit was not given to where credit was due. To present Eric Bana and Scarlet Johansson as the main attractions of this film is falsification to the maximum extent. I can honestly say that Johansson looked uncomfortable in the role. She looked awkward in unauthentic. She made me feel as if I was watching an amateur video, and not in the good way. She seemed all too scripted for me, as if there were no internalization to her character or even a thought on how she should portray her character in an honest way, but at the same time in a refined way. Granted that she has been in the industry for a long time, I do believe that she has much more to learn and hopefully, this movie would be a stepping stone for a better performance in her next film, Mary Queen of Scots. I would hate to see that destroyed by overacting and awkward expression.Eric Bana. What can I say. I expected more from you. I pity the people who see him first on this film. Please do watch his other works, he does better there. I promise. Troy! Munich! Please don't judge the man too harshly. He does have talent, just not exhibited well in this particular film. Aside from the grunting noises and pensieve faces, this movie did nothing for showcasing the talent that we know is in Bana somewhere down there.Now, on to the pleasant surprises. Yes people, I did like some parts of it.Natalie Portman. I expected to see her sink like a rock in this film. I did. Coming into the theater, all i could remember of her was the atrocious Star Wars Prequels. That still gives me nightmares. But this film, in the role of the ambitious Anne Boleyn, she reminded me of that girl I saw in Paris Je t'aime. Now that is the Natalie Portman worth seeing. In the first few scenes of the movie, I was thinking, 'why did I watch this instead of Horton Hears A Who?', but as the film progressed, so did she. I must say, when it came down to it, she did a spectacular job. She gave a convincing performance of a scorned girl, pining for revenge, bent on keeping her power and her head. Portman commands the screen and shows us that she is not only a bankable investment for any producer, but also a talented one at that.Jim Strurgess give a blossoming and dynamic performance as the enigmatic George Boleyn. His star is rising. Mark my words. His performance as the double-dealing, conniving, yet also emphatic noble in a court designed for corruption gave me hope that you can be in a big, blockbuster movie yet still maintain the integrity of good acting. But then again, what else would you expect from good old Jude? And of course, I would love to shed a light on the unsung heroes of The Other Boleyn Girl! Kristen Scott Thomas, Ana Torent and Eddie Redmayne! I must say that their presence made such an impression of me, despite the fact that they had such little screen time! Why was that? I shall never know.Ana Torent gave a regal performance, no less than can be expected from a woman who plays Catherine of Aragon. Her final scene in the film left me with my jaw hanging open and the word 'WHOA' coming out of my mouth. She was sublimely amazing and gave me the lift that I needed to reassure myself that my money was not wasted on this film.The same goes for Eddie Redmayne. For anyone who's seen him in Savage Grace and Like Minds, you know that the man has talent. Why that talent was not given more a role when William Stafford was such an interesting character in the book (showing that court life can produce some decent ones and that you can be a commoner but still happy - the moral haven for Mary's sullied life), again, I shall never know. But rest assured, that one long scene he did (perhaps five minutes or so), was worth it for him, but know that the young actor has more in him than that.Kristen Scott Thomas was definitely worthy of praise. Though her role was more tame and motherly than that of Lady Boleyn in the book, she made me think that the movie version was better. And that is saying something, especially in this adaptation.With regards to the rest of the film, all I can say is, it was a mediocre historical film. It did not knock Anne of A Thousand Days as the best film on the subject of Anne Boleyn, but it was certainly not a total flop for reasons mentioned above.So if you are looking for a good watch on the Tudor intrigue, this wouldn't be the first on my list, nor the second, nor the third, but it is somewhere there.

The Other Other Boleyn Girl,"As a fan of the book and a fan of Tudor history this movie seemed like something very different.

You have some amazing actors and they try their best but they don't have the good writing to work with and it seems like they never seem real in their characters (but Bana was a good king). And two things drove me crazy! One...they say ""sister"" 500 times in the movie...Two..the loose strings.

"Catty, Soapy & Sexist","If there is one thing I can't stand, it's catty women. Anyone who's hung around an office filled with women long enough knows what I mean. I am also not a fan of sexism, which is usually directed toward women. In this movie, though, it's against men where every male is pictured as a low-life. Just about everyone here has poor intentions and few morals, except perhaps the Boleyn girls mother ""Lady Elizabeth Boleyn"" (Kristen Scott-Thomas), but she's no angel, either.Meanwhile, the Boleyn sisters - ""Anne"" (Natalie Portman) and ""Mary"" (Scarlet Johansson) - and others provide much of the cattiness. The whole idea is for some people to gain favors and be in good stead with King Henry VIII and the best way, of course, is to have sex with him.Frankly, I don't find Natalie Portman the least bit sexy and Scarlett Johansson, the other suitor for the king, is overrated beauty-wise, too. The third part of the sexual triangle is the king, ""Henry Tudor,"" played by Eric Bana. Whether he's attractive or not, I'll leave up to the female audience.All I know is that the film is a ""chick flick"" and it's a pretty film to look at, with good production values. I appreciated the visuals but the story is mainly for soap opera fans, those who like to watch other shed tears, in addition to their own.From what the British reviewers say here, it's not too accurate, either.

I have read much on Anne, Henry VIII, and The Other Boleyn Girl, now I was not expecting much when I went to see the movie, but it was even worse than I could have ever imagined! It stopped being historically accurate after about the first five minutes, and it only loosely followed the book. There is no way that Henry would have fallen for Anne had he met her previously, and they met at court, NOT at the Boleyn's place of residence. Anne was not sent to France as a form of exile, both her and Mary spent their early youth at the French court. In fact both Boleyn girls served Henry VIII's sister Mary when she was Queen of France. There were many important details that were left out, and relationships that were formulated that never happened. There was always an intense jealously between Anne and her sister Mary. In the movie they are portrayed as being close sisters. Save your movie and wait until it is on the $1 rental list at Blockbuster!",1.0,Anonymous,History
Power and love are mixed in this story with Portman and Johansson.,"I have seen it a couple of times and I was always quite a fan of the film, today that I saw it again I can give a more objective opinion without becoming so attached to my fanaticism for Portman.

Natalie Portman very proud portraying 'Anne Bolena' in that ambition for power that has no end until she is sentenced, Scarlett Johanson as her sister 'Mary' a little shy and with little personality for my taste but she was fine and the great Kristin Scott Thomas as the mother of these young women, imposingly seeing her daughters more and more destroyed by her brother's manipulation.Controversial story and well adapted that the years did not sit well with him.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Aiming for mediocrity is worse than failing totally,"I haven't read the book or studied the history surrounding the events in any detail, so I'm not really concerned with those aspects (which seem to have been the major gripe with the movie judging from the comments). The problem I found with this ""bodice ripper"" is it's just a bit dull. Although the costumes are quite pretty, the only way the film maker seems to convey excitement is by cutting to scenes of people riding horses... hard... with dramatic music. There are no set pieces in the movie. It's just a soap opera really. I started to feel like the castle had four or five rooms in it.I'm usually fond of Natalie Portman. She was terrible in this movie, incapable of extracting sympathy or condemnation from the audience. Totally miscast and out of her depth. I was quite surprised anyone bothered casting Eric Bana in the movie - they could have got by with a much cheaper option since his role is very small. Scarlet wasn't bad. Kristin Scott Thomas actually stole the show.The script was odd. I kept getting that sense of anachronism - like when Anne says ""You'll have to show me how you did that sometime"". This is acceptable if you're making a movie set during a historical period with a different slant (see A Knight's Tale or Marie Antoinette). It's a bit jarring if you're playing it straight.It's quite a short movie, and that's a good thing. If it hadn't been, it would have been far more ponderous with its curious lack of passion.

"Dark, Beautiful Clothing, Waste of Time","After Reading the well written book by Phillipa Gregory, I was anxious to see the film, hoping upon hope that Hollywood would, at the very LEAST, make it worth watching. They failed, other than at costume design.Being a bit of a Henry VIII history buff, I devour as much as I can of the actual history. This film leads you to believe that Mary, Ann and Henry VIII were young people in their 20's. Nothing is further from the truth. Henry VIII, was in his late 30's to early 40's, while Mary and Ann Boleyn were merely in their mid-teens at the time that Mary became Henry's mistress. Of course, there's no way Hollywood could show this discrepancy and OBVIOUSLY politically incorrect (yet TRUE) version of history. The sad fact is that young women and girls were thrown at the king (and men in general) and were mere chattel to be used to further their family's prestige and wealth.The film runs through the story like a runaway freight train, heedless of what was really going on.My suggestion is skip the movie and read a good book instead.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Definitely Under-rated. One of 2008's Best Films So Far.,"A terrific story with excellent multi-dimensional characters; particularly the 4 leading female actresses; most particularly Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen. I'd never have given either credit for the brilliant job they do here. One of the few films for adults, I'd like to say that when I was an 11 year old boy (since 90% of Hollywood product is targeted at 11 year old boys) we would have enjoyed a film like this, and learned something from it.When you watch the almost G rated sex scenes with Scarlett Johanssen you can understand why she was named #1 in sex appeal in a recent poll.As the Episcopal Church was created for the ill purpose of providing the King with a means toward his unjust divorce, as well as to allow his false marriage to Ann Boleyn, these ill deeds --- including the head-chopping of moral men -- seems of comparable high purpose in light of the recent split in the Episcopal Church to allow the consecration of a man who divorced his wife and dumped his children in order to have sex with his buddy. As Liberals steer their church into the abyss and attempt to force compliance through extortion, righteous persons stand strong, as their leader the Archbishop of Canterbury -- spineless and weak -- does nothing at all. Thus does history repeat itself.Sex and the City is definitely this years's chick flick, but this excellent historic drama stands right there with it; both films strongly recommended for men.",8.0,Anonymous,History
uninspired petty drama...,"The story of this movie surrounds the petty infighting between the two Boleyn sisters vying for the king's affection. The king is portrayed as simply a womanizer who does nothing all day but to please the next lady in his court. The father was a unprincipled merchant who wants to achieve power by selling out his children and the uncle is a calculating duke using the Boleyn children to gain power. The only characters of some decency were the Queen, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn (the mother) and Mary Boleyn. However, their performances were so low key and unemphasized that throughout the entire movie, the overpowering feeling is that everyone is petty, calculating and had very little to do but indulge in personal drama.

A TV movie at best,"I had high expectations for this film, loving everything about that time frame.

The costumes were awful - silly really. The girls looked like twins with only the colour of the dresses telling them apart. The dresses were dull, no great patterns, jewelry, or anything remarkable. Even the hair just look flat ironed and boring. True to the time? I don't know - I cannot imagine that they really did not have more variety.Makeup? Hello! Where was the makeup artist? Even the Egyptians wore makeup. And I could not look at those weird hats after a while. Really? Everyone wore them? Without much variety again? It seemed like all the costumes were recycled over and over again.The movie felt filmed on sets for almost everything. There was never a sense of space to me, just one set to another, and some really strange shots as if there was a limited space so we needed a body part up close like an elbow then another character in the distance to indicate space. This seemed like a very under-budget way of directing to me.The acting though I enjoyed, and even if the story wasn't entirely factual, it was fun, and seemed to ring true as to the nature of Anne Boleyn.Ultimately, this seemed like a TV movie fitted to the big screen (as opposed to the usual vice versa).

Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselvesand Their Greedy Families in 16th-Century Tudor England,"When they were publicizing the theatrical release of this film during a fluffy interview with Matt Lauer on ""The Today Show"", Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman came across as two attractive, sensible young women who admired each other to no end. Ironically, that bonding is exactly what works against the movie, specifically the lack of a sharp edge in their characters' intractable relationship which dilutes how far sibling rivalry can go in shaping fates and destroying lives. Granted there's a palpably pulpish tone to this fanciful 2008 historical fiction based on Phillipa Gregory's 2002 novel, but the royal intrigue in the House of Tudor is overwhelmed by melodramatic flourishes and transparent character development. First-time feature director Justin Chadwick (BBC's ""Bleak House"") has made a handsome film with an attractive trio of stars, but he places most of his focus on the soap opera elements of the book's adaptation by Peter Morgan, a specialist in merging fiction with truth (""The Queen"", ""The Last King of Scotland""), and lays waste to what could have been a more fully rounded historical drama.The overstuffed story begins with a cursory portrayal of the Boleyn sisters, headstrong Anne and diffident Mary. Even though Mary is married to wealthy courtier William Carey, the sisters soon find themselves in a competition for the affections of King Henry VIII, thanks to the machinations of their weak-willed father Thomas and their Machiavellian uncle, the Duke of Norfolk. Henry is initially drawn toward Mary's gentle nature, siring an illegitimate son as he is still married to the barren Catherine of Aragon. However, Mary's difficult pregnancy and mandatory bedrest opens an opportunity for Anne, who uses all her cunning wiles to land the King. At the expense of Mary's happiness, Anne succeeds but not before the creation of the Church of England and her own ascension to England's Queen. Meanwhile, Henry evolves from gregarious womanizer to haunted despot, and everyone already knows what becomes of Anne at the end. The film's perspective alternates between the sisters, thus reducing Henry to a convenient plot device. Thanks to the film's broad brush strokes, the challenge for the viewer is to monitor the imbalance between the sisters. For instance, Mary is rather bland in her virtue but her story is affecting, while Anne is comparatively intriguing in her blind ambition but her fate feels less than tragic.I still think Johansson is the more natural temptress on screen, but she actually plays Mary and manages to elicit sympathy to her character with surprising ease. However, Portman gets the lion's share of meaty scenes and runs with them, especially a couple of effective face-offs with Henry. As expected, both are alluring in period costume even as their accents waver a bit. As Henry, Eric Bana seems to have been hired for his brooding persona and beefcake appeal, while the character's lightning-fast transitions make Henry an elliptical figure at best in Morgan's truncated script. Kristin Scott Thomas again brings her innate chilliness to the abbreviated role of Boleyn's mother, while there are mildly interesting turns by Jim Sturgess (""Across the Universe"") as devoted brother George, Mark Rylance as Thomas, and David Morrissey (Sharon Stone's befuddled paramour in the execrable ""Basic Instinct II"") as the Duke of Norfolk. Spanish actress Ana Torrent brings conviction to her few scenes as Catherine of Aragon. Sandy Powell, no stranger to the period (""Shakespeare in Love""), designed the exquisite costumes, while John Paul Kelly's sumptuous production design feels authentic. Kieran McGuigan's richly colorful cinematography is undermined by his recurring tendency to use a side-swipe effect to transition shots. Production details aside, the film remains stubbornly hollow at its core.Starting with Chadwick's zealous albeit sometimes overly technical commentary track, the 2008 DVD has a robust set of extras. Thumbnail sketches of the film's historical figures are provided in brief video snippets with insight provided by scholars and various members of the cast. Two featurettes are also included - a ten-minute short, ""To Be a Lady"", which discusses the severely limited role of women in the 16th century, a theme addressed pretty well in the film; and another ten-minute short, ""Translating History to Screen"", which prominently features Gregory and focuses on how a voluminous bodice-ripper of a book had to be pared down to a running time of 115 minutes. Separately, there are twelve scenes presented, mostly expanded versions of the ones that ended up in the film and none I would consider indispensable to the final cut. Rounding out the extras is a brief reel of a test used to calibrate the HD cameras used during the shoot, as well as eight previews of other films.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Historical drama that was a bit shocking,"I am having difficulties rating a movie of this genre. The acting was very good, the story complex (even if inspired from history), the portrayal of the time's way of things was both well rendered and disgusting. The subject was not so interesting to me, so I am trying to ignore my slight boredom to try to maintain some sort of objectivity.About the movie, imagine women (and young men) planned, traded, manipulated and used as a mere commodity, nothing more than cattle, for the reasons of gaining favor upon their families. Marriages were ignored or broken at the whim of kings or higher noblemen, daughters were forced to accept whoredom and everybody had a plan.In the middle of things, the Boleyn sisters, played by Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson. Handled between their greedy family and a petulant and immature king, they become part of history without, I would wager, having much to do with any of the things that happened to them. People have deplored the lack of historical accuracy of the script, but I wouldn't know about that. In the film Anne is shown as manipulating the king by refusing to bed him and the king, maddened with passion, does everything she asks. I wonder if that could ever have been possible.Bottom line: if you are a history buff, you should watch it. Women might also get a kick out of marriages and babies and miscarriages and drama. It is a well done movie and, subject aside, a very decent film.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Six wives and a mistress,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" (2008) was directed by Justin Chadwick. It stars Natalie Portman as Anne Boleyn, and Scarlett Johansson as her sister, Mary Boleyn. As everyone knows, Henry VIII broke with the Roman Catholic church in order to divorce his first wife, Katherine of Aragon, and marry Anne Boleyn. We all know what happened to Anne when she failed to produce a son and heir. What many of us don't know--but is apparently true--is that Henry fathered a son by Anne's sister Mary. Because this child was born out of wedlock, and because Henry assumed he would have a legitimate male heir, he didn't acknowledge the child. The relationship between the king and the two sisters is at the center of the film.The film doesn't adhere to a strict timeline. For example, Anne Boleyn spent most of her early life in the royal households of the Netherlands and France. In the film, she is sent to France as a punishment, and almost immediately recalled. However, the basic facts- - that Mary Boleyn was Henry's mistress and that Anne Boleyn refused to become his mistress, but became his wife--are correct. The acting is excellent, and the casting choices are outstanding. (Some people have written that the two sisters are cast against type, but I don't agree. Johansson, with her blonde hair and open expression, is perfect for Mary, who is portrayed as naive and trusting. Portman's exotic dark beauty is ideal for Anne, who is manipulative and ambitious.)Eric Bana does well as Henry Tudor, but three of the supporting actors are truly excellent-- David Morrissey as the amoral Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, Kristin Scott Thomas as the girls' mother, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, and Ana Torrent as Katherine of Aragon, Henry's first wife.If you hate costume dramas, stay away from this film. If you enjoy movies with great castles, magnificent horses, gorgeous costumes, handsome men and beautiful women, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" delivers all of these things.We saw the movie on a large, flat-screen TV. It would work better in a theater, and would lose some of its grandeur with DVD on a standard television screen. Still, whatever the format, I think it's good enough to be worth finding and seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A tale of two sisters,"Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Eric Bana, a bestselling novel, and an Oscar-nominated screenwriterall these elements should form a brilliant, talented collaboration, but unfortunately the novel is hacked into an incongruent muddle of scenes which are further ruined by the atrocious editing.It is based on Philippa Gregory's bestselling novel The Other Boleyn Girl, and tells the story of two sisters, Mary (played by Scarlett Johansson) and Anne Boleyn (played by Natalie Portman), who bother vie for King Henry VIII's (played by Eric Bana) affection (if only they knew he was not the one-girl-type). It is a time in England when girls were as their mother lady Elizabeth Boleyn (played by Kirstin Scott Thomas) put it ""Traded like cattle for the advancement and pleasure of men."" The girl's father (played by Mark Rylance) wants to catch the eye of the King to secure wealth and status by ""pimping"" his daughter Anne to be the King's mistress. King Henry passes over Anne in favor of the quiet submitting daughter Mary, but once she is pregnant with his illegitimate child, he quickly turns back to Anne who has returned to the court scene with a newfound sensual, seductive confidence. As Henry falls hard for Anne, Mary is quickly swept aside so the stage is set for the inevitable conclusion.I did read the book and loved it. However I generally enjoy film adaptations no matter how far they stray from the book. Film and book are two completely different types of storytelling, so with that said the reason I did not like this film was not its major detractions from the book, but the incredible dull, emotionless production.The acting from Natalie Portman, Eric Bana, and Kirstin Scott-Thomas was top-notch, especially Portman's (I am convinced had this been a better production and release date she would probably be garnering nominations). The rest of the cast could not hold up. Scarlet Johansson's acting was cringe-worthy as she never removed the same complacent, angelic expression from her face (she didn't even cry when her sister's head was chopped off!) and spoke in the same tone the entire film.The production itself was not bad, the sets, costumes, etc. were all quite exquisite. The problem with this film was it had so many good aspects it could not make use of them. The editing, I must point out, was the downfall of this great story. All the scenes were so disjointed and quick that you never had time to get pulled into the story. Helping it along was the frustrating script which had lines spoken so impassively and for the sole purpose to inform the audience what was going on that it was devoid of any eloquence or originality. I felt there were whole sections left out that I knew because I had read the book, but someone new to it would be thoroughly lost.This is such an unfortunate botching of an intriguing tale, and once again feels like the producers did not know what to do with all the talent they had. It not only is a horrible adaptation, but a very poorly done film that moved through its' material so quickly it lost its' emotional depth on the way. At the end you are left still waiting for it to start, and are so detached you do not even care about the characters whose lives were so horribly ruined. The only reason I would recommend anyone to see this film is to see Natalie Portman's performance which is utterly fascinating to watch as she plays this illustrious historical figure.",4.0,Anonymous,History

I have not seen the Elizabeth movies yet but Cate Blanchett has always pleased me in all her performances so I know I will love them. Natalie and Eric really pull you into the plot with intensity. These actors should do more roles in the future. There was a magnificent chemistry.

One of the Worst Historical Adaptions Ever,"This film is so bad it's hard to know where to start. There is very little adherence to historical accuracy in either the plot, mannerisms, costumes or speech. It's more a thigh-slapping romp with characters given historical names than it is a serious attempt to bring the story of the Boleyns to life. Mary Boleyn did not have a son with Henry VIII. Anne Boleyn was not 'exiled' to France for a couple of months for being cheeky to Henry VIII. She was brought up from an early age in France with Mary when her father was the ambassador. Mary Boleyn did not take baby Elizabeth from the palace and raise her romping around in fields in the peaceful countryside after Anne's beheading. Mary died in penury. Elizabeth was raised in Hatfield as a Princess with her own establishment until declared a bastard by Henry. And these were just the most glaring changes to the story. The acting is awful. I like Eric Bana, but he's woefully miscast in this. Awful, awful, awful.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Anne Boleyn as Lady Macbeth,"I didn't read the book, although I have read some of the history, and found myself blown away by ""The Other Boleyn Girl"". What blew me away was Natalie Portman's awesome performance as the tragically ambitious Anne, whose scheming creates a slippery slope that sends her into desperation and almost to madness before she literally loses her head. I had always regarded her as a great beauty and a charming performer but in this film Ms. Portman becomes a great actress. People have said the film concentrates too much on Anne but it really doesn't. Natalie just so dominates the film you think she's in every scene. She's just in every scene you care about. Hopefully Oscar voters will still care about her a year from now. With the heavy criticism of the film and its lack of box office success, they may not.The problem, of course is that the film, historically, is nonsense. Every indication is that Anne Boleyn was not like this, (Wikipedia has some very good discussions of this). And if she wasn't the film is not merely inaccurate but a libel on her character. The question is: do we simply accept this and ""go with the flow"" so we can enjoy the story? Or do we condemn the film and everything in it because of the liberties it takes? Portman blows away every other Anne Boleyn that I've ever seen but the comparison seems unfair because she wasn't really playing Anne Boleyn. She was playing Lady Macbeth, (and showing she'd be very good at it if it ever came to that).Anne Boleyn seems to be kind of like General Custer- her portrayal depends on the political climate of the moment and the agenda of the writer. The same could be said of the criticism of the portrayals. Many of the alleged inaccuracies are open to debate, (see Wikipedia on the book itself). Perhaps it's best just to look at it as a story and enjoy the blossoming of a great talent. If you have to read the book to find out it's a bad movie and you have to read history to find out it's a bad book, why do either?",8.0,Anonymous,History
Good job!,"I will start with the bad. While there are some historical inaccuracies, you do see the effort put into the colours of the dresses, the change in behaviour (Anne Boleyn has a different attitude after she has been a lady in waiting at the French court), it is maybe with the help of Philippa Gregory's book of the same name, that this can be achieved. Now with the good. Anne Boleyn is controversial as a figure, while I think that every person that starts to read more into history can appreciate the positive about this person, about this queen and about such an intellectual, because above everything else Anne was a very well read person for the time, and this can be seen in how Natalie Portman manages to play this role. Unsure if Scarlett Johansen was best suited to play her sister, Mary but all in all a good movie, and the small bits are missing do not make this movie to be rated anything less than 10 stars. Good job!Just an opinion. Just a thought. Just Steven J. Scott.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful but not worth the screen it's played on.,"First, let me start by saying, I do not hate or rather despise this movie for its historical inaccuracies. Although numerous in their quantity, other shows based on the same time frame and with the same amount, if not more manage to carry the rise and fall of the Boleyn's with far more grace than this movie does.Natalie Portman's acting is dubious at best and the same can be said for Scarlett. Eric manages the role with far more grandeur and skill than I had expected and yet it felt somewhat lacking. The costumes and sets are gorgeous and yet it all seems very stilted and wooden.Now, let me get onto the historical inaccuracies. 'The Tudors' (Showtimes production) has near the same amount of inconsistencies but they at least keep true to the more important and vital parts of history. Anne Boleyn did not cry at her execution, it is a shame as I thought this would be the strongest part of the movie, she was dignified and strong until the last blow of the sword. Mary Boleyn was banished from court and was in no accounts present at her sisters executions. Anne wasn't married and there was no rape.As much as I wanted to love this movie, it was hard to move past the glaring inaccuracies and slightly boring performances.It is a great shame, Alison",4.0,Anonymous,History
A Well Done Drama,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is a good historical drama which is well made and well acted.

I would recommend this film, especially if you like these types of historical soaps. This movie helped me to understand and visualize the human aspects of all this drama and the impacts. For example, just imagine being the daughter Elizabeth and learning as you age that your father executed your mother! My rating 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Inaccurate, uninteresting and terribly acted.","The historical inaccuracies are mind-boggling. It feels like they sat down said 'Alright, we know that Henry will bang both of them and that Anne will have Elizabeth. That's all we need. Let's make the rest of it as sexy as possible.' The ironic thing being that with a PG-13 rating, you can't really be sexy. Especially not when you make Scarlett Johansson incredibly unattractive and knock down Portman's looks a few knots as well. They advertised it as this massively erotic soap opera and it was just a melodramatic, unappealing mess that couldn't have been further from sensual. The technical achievements are pretty solid; the cinematography, costume design and score are certainly among the best of the year so far but none of that makes the film worth watching. I would say that Natalie Portman's good performance makes the film slightly worth sitting through, but the positive aspect in that is completely cancelled out by the atrocity that is whatever Scarlett Johansson did. Calling that a performance would be an insult to performers. It was terrible.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Jim Sturgess was equally convincing as the brother. But Here I say what happened to George Boleyn's homosexuality? What happened to William Carey? Henry Percy said nothing in this film, he was a hopeless romantic that made many a women fall in love with him. Mary Boleyn had two children, a daughter and then a son.

Captivating Movie with Lots of Surprising Merits,"Although British history has been brought to screen in several memorable productions, there has been a shortage of some historical periods on screen, periods which are very interesting and which could constitute nice bases for a wonderfully entertaining movie. These feelings of lack had been rising in me until I went to see this latest movie by Justin Chadwick, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL the content of which is set in the infamous period of Henry VIII's reign. And let me make myself clear at the beginning: I did not go to see it because of young starlets, neither Natalie Portman nor Scarlett Johansson. I went to see it as a genre buff being interested in two supreme factors: historical period being executed and its artistic features. What were my impressions?I was stunned by beautiful cinematography, a very accurate mood of the times, impressive wardrobe and particularly lavish sets. This movie proves the fact that they can really make wonderful movies these days, too. Together with the action and strong storyline, the director did not forget that historical movies need to contain some grandeur which, like nothing else, stir our imagination of the days of yore. There are lots of scenes in THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL that leave you breathless. Let me mention, for instance, the beautifully shot scene of hunting during the king's first visit at Boleyn family's. Katherine of Aaragon's trial is also filmed memorably with managed pace and unforgettable atmosphere. The execution of Anne Boleyn contains unforgettable moments. Therefore, I think that this movie truly provides a viewer with an accurate image of the period. However, that is not all I would like to praise about the film since the merits of the film went beyond my expectations, beyond my factors.What surprised me a lot were the performances. As I mentioned at the beginning, I am not a fan of new actresses who play the main roles but I must admit that both Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson do pretty good jobs in their portrayals. Ms Portman depicts the very psychological complications of her character changing from a shy girl into a wicked mistress of the king to whom love matters only when supplied with power and position. It is her who finally changes into a suffering victim. Scarlet Johansson memorably portrays her character's goodness of heart, simplicity and straightforward attitude towards people and their feelings. She is easily identified with and appears to be extremely appealing to tender people. As far as supporting cast are concerned, Eric Bana depicts the king really well providing us with the insight into desire which affects all the rest. In a memorable scene, we see him kneeling down in a chapel behind Anne and lustfully looking at her neck. His decision to tear apart from anything that should have meant much to a noble king proves that powerful impact of lust. Kristin Scott Thomas also surprised me in her role of Lady Elizabeth Boleyn who portrays a good mother, a reasonable woman who strives to stop the mad conspiracies and sickly ambitious plans of men in her house.But what makes THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL a must see is the particular insight into the psychology of humans, into various bad acts that we either regret or forget, into desires that blind men to many significant matters. Finally, it is an insight into selfish hatred that usually ruins the lives of the innocent, calm people. It is not a sort of historical film about which you could only say: a spectacle. THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is truly a captivating movie that you watch with attention and interest. Pay attention to Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon and you will notice the core of what the film offers. It really touches the gist of human nobility or human wickedness, the gist of upright feelings combined with devotion or earthly desires that, by chance and mistake, got the name of ""love""THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is a movie I highly recommend, one of the very best productions that have been made these days. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Scarlett Johansson headlines a major list of reasons why this movie is terrible,"Never have I seen such a melodramatic, boring and insulting adaption of the tale of the Boleyn family. A film that substitutes historical accuracy for soap opera antics and loathsome acting.The casting of this train wreck is wrong, with numerous better British actresses who could've done a better job. Portman manages to hold firm but Johansson's evident disinterest in even being on the set is off putting and her utter laziness when it comes to speaking dialogue or expressing emotion is frustrating. This is meant to be a period piece, there's a certain calibre of acting you need to bring to the table, and she fails to do so, making it clear she was only cast for her A-List status.Bana isn't very interesting as Henry, popping in every now and then to say ""hey, this is still a film based off a true story"", as the focus of the film, to it's very minimal credit, keeps centred on the Boleyn's, even if a majority of it was made up for dramatic plausibility. When you have to make things up to make a film that's supposed to recount a real event, then it's clear that it's not meant to be a film.Perhaps if they told the story with the actual events, a way better actress than Scarlett Johansson as Mary and a lot more life into this dull, tired flick, maybe it could've worked, but considering the choices they decided to make, The Other Boleyn Girl fails.The Other Boleyn Girl 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,History

Old-fashioned and heavy,"Rooted in the tradition of the BBC historical piece with a thick glossy Hollywood layer on top, the movie tells the rise and fall of Anne Boleyn through the complicated relationship with her younger sister Mary who first won the favours of king Henry VIII - that's why Anne refers to herself at one point as ""the other Boleyn girl"" even if in the end it will be her name to survive. The point of view of sister rivalry in the wake of court life and family ambition looks promising for the first part of the film, making sense of the elaborated costumes and sets in what is largely uncharted or minor territories in historical terms. Portman and Johansson as young superstars are in fact a good choice to level the field for the match between the Boleyn sisters.However at some point the fiction needs to cross history and since there witty remarks leave place for solemn declarations, gloomy palace halls and a pompous dramatic musical score, and the film sinks down inexorably by effect of its own weight all the way to the end. The last minutes of the movie are in fact intolerable, ending with historical footnotes (what happened to the King, to the Duke of Norfolk, etc.), a link to the opening sequence to show ""the circle of life"" and a dedication to Anne's only daughter, most recent darling of historical flicks, Elizabeth.And yet in all of this the historical simplification is such that the audience will likely get the idea that the only reason for Henry VIII to break from Catholic Church and create the Church of England has been to marry Anne Boleyn...

NOT faithful to the book!,"Did they even READ the book? If you are a fan of the novel, do not see this movie; you will be disappointed.Obviously, any film adaptation of a novel needs to condense events, and I completely understand that. Some people have criticized the historical inaccuracy of this film, but like the book, it's a work of fiction, so the creators are within their rights--no one is going to see this expecting a documentary. My complaint with this film is how utterly it strayed from the novel. For example, the first 20 minutes or so of the film depict a totally different story than the novel does. The new scenes were not (in my humble opinion) less complex than the novel's opening, so I really have no idea why they chose to drastically change a New York Times' bestseller. Also, a number of crucial details were omitted, such as what happens to William Carey. (Really? They couldn't have spared one line to mention it?)I did enjoy George Boleyn's performance, as well as Mark Rylance's. Natalie Portman's final scene is stunning and emotional. It is the only part of the movie I would watch again.If I had not read the book, this may have been a decent movie.

A very poor film,"The acting in this film was very poor to the point that it was boring. Eric Bana's portrayal of King Henry was totally inappropriate as his accent, his language and delivery was too heavy toned and desperate for the period and for some one of regal status at this point of history. It is the use of dramatic license that is used to imbue some sort of passion in what was a very dry and stoic King Henry the eighth.There are many British actors who were far more appropriate for the role than an Australian ""Actor"". The recent production ""The Tudors"" proves my point extremely well.Another silly film that is historically non factual.",1.0,Anonymous,History

A horrible adaptation of a beautiful book,"I just wanted to say that if you read the book and LIKED or LOVED it, you will not like this movie. I was so excited to see it. I actually went to the 4:15 today (the day it came out). Right from the beginning I was disappointed. They completely disrespect Philippa Gregory's work of art. Also, the movie tries to make you feel sorry for Anne - - one of the biggest villains in the story. And finally, I was very annoyed that the movie did not explore Mary's relationship with William Stafford. That was the element of the book that brought me the most joy and Hollywood killed Mary's only happiness, in my opinion.However, Jim Sturgess was lovely, as always.

a bit disappointing,"The movie is nothing like the novel, which is unfortunate, as the novel was exciting and, for the most part, historically accurate. While the costumes and sets were exciting, the script was a bit dull and important parts of the history were skipped over. I also think that some events were made up for the benefit of the plot. The development of important characters was limited and made these important historical figures seem flat. I do think the casting was done well and that the performances of the two leading women exceeded my expectations. They played their parts well and I can't imagine any other actresses in those roles. I confess, I've read Philippa Gregory's novel perhaps one too many times to be completely unbiased, but I do feel the movie adaptation could have done it better justice.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Period film without substance needs saving,"I watched ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" mainly to see some more scope in Portman and Bana's acting. I was satisfied by their very fine performances, and the rest of the cast did a fair job.However I do agree that the script wasn't up-to-scratch, and it made the movie lack a lot of substance. There were a few odd 'scenery' shots that didn't seem to fit in. The directing of this film is to be commended given the weak script.The art direction and costume design were stunning, and Paul Cantelon's music (though slightly intrusive at times) set the mood of ""Boleyn"" well --- although, in my opinion, Cantelon is showcased more strongly in ""Diving Bell and the Butterfly"".",4.0,Anonymous,History

This movie sucks.,"I thought the costumes were beautiful, but that's about where I stop giving good comments. I've read the book as well as watched the HBO Series the Tudors, that covers the same story, and I have to say I'll be impatiently anticipating my Boleyn fix from the second season of the TV series rather than the DVD version of the movie. The acting was TERRIBLE. The drama that this story could entail is obvious, but the actors and actresses fall far short of expectations. The scenes seemed sedated and enacted with about a quarter of the passion such a dramatic story deserves.Don't even get me started on how cowardly the directors/writers of the movie are because they didn't play out the controversial scenes, instead, taking the weenie/noble approach that didn't happen in the book or history.As a committed student of history I was extremely excited for the release of the movie and was sorely disappointed. For as much as I love the plot, I can't even recommend this movie based on my personal love of the period. Instead, if you want a juicy well-done version of the same story, invest the time in the HBO Series the Tudors: the acting, costumes, and story will certainly be much more worth your time and money than this sub-standard movie.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Avoid at all costs,"After watching the movie, I had to look up the Boleyn family on wikipedia as well as Phillipa Gregory's book on Amazon to get any semblance of historical truth on what actually happened during Ann Boleyn's life.While movies definitely should not be viewed as telling history, this movie bears so little resemblance to historical truth that all the characters should be renamed so that no one would mistake the movie as having any correlation to Ann Boleyn and her sister. If you would like to know the truth about her and her sister, I recommend you look up Ann Boleyn and then Mary Boleyn on wikipedia at the very least.Historical facts aside, I found the camera-work oppressively pretentious with too many dark forebodings of the ending. I am sure that even England gets some share of temperate weather...but in the movie you'd think that pre-Renaissance England was marked with years on end of dark and gloomy days to punish all the English for Henry's treatment of his wives.Natalie Portman is wasted on a one-sided character. It's good to see Kristin Scott Thomas as Lady Boleyn and she, along with Katherine of Aragon, are the only characters of intelligence. Eric Bana has little to do but glare (it's a little like him replaying his Hulk role but in historical costumes). And Scarlett Johannson makes good seem insipid.It was a waste of money to make this movie, so don't waste your own money by paying to see it in a theater. I would go so far as to say don't even waste your time watching this movie...unless you are a costume designer. The historical costumes are actually quite fabulous.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Awful,"Instantly, the movie starts telling a different story than the book. It continues with gorgeous sets, great acting, but a horrible screenplay. I was not expecting the movie to be half as good as the book, but I was not expecting it to not follow the book at all. The movie depicts Anne Boleyn as a victim of King Henry VIII, but in the book she is not a nice, caring sister, but a vicious, competitive woman who will stop for nothing, even her sister. The book was a wonderful read that allowed for a great movie, but it was not filmed in that way. If you have read the book you will more than likely be incredibly upset after seeing this movie.

Gratuitous and irritating framing of far too many shots, through doorways, curtains, pillars, horse's tethers, etc. I could go on, but you get the idea, and 2. inadequate performances in some of the leading roles. Natalie Portman as Anne is great, as is David Morrisey as her uncle, and Kristin Scott-Thomas as her mother. However, Scarlett Johansen is far too weak, as is Eric Bana as Henry; I kept thinking of Robert Shaw in ""A Man for All Seasons"". Winona Ryder probably would have made a better Mary. George Boleyn ended up too much like Del-boy's brother Rodney. However, I did enjoy it, although the TV version was as good. In addition, it paled in comparison with Elizabeth, Elizabeth: The GoldenAge, and Elizabeth I. One other thing; Scarlett's performance does not bode well for Mary, Queen of Scots.

I remember thinking the entire movie, that Anne Boleyn , Natalie Portman's character, was like some femme fetale character from a hard boiled 1940's crime thriller. She behaved in a way that would not have been acceptable, or historically accurate, for another four hundred years or more. She would have been put to death within the first five minutes of meeting King Henry, if she had behaved that way in England , circa early 1500's.It's not completely devoid of entertainment value.

But it is very pretty to watch...,"THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL suffers from overexposure to the passion for all things Tudor that has produced multiple novels, television series, and films that range from great to mediocre. Having not read Philippa Gregory's best selling novel, this viewer entered the theater without preconceived notions of the path the story would take/stray in the wake of heightened interest in historical data. From the opening scenes to the end the impression is one of having viewed some very beautiful scenery, sumptuous costumes, grand lighting - and very little involvement in caring for the plight of the characters. The soggy music score underlines the unrelenting dark atmosphere of the story and the production, and despite a cast of actors known for credibility in historic roles, there is little compassion stirred.King Henry VIII (Eric Bana, in relatively little screen time) tires of Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent) and her inability to bear a male heir. The Boleyn clan (Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas in collusion with the Duke of Norfolk David Morrissey) seize on Henry's frustration and serve up their daughters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) to satisfy his dalliances. The younger Mary beds him first, produces a daughter (Elizabeth), then falls our of favor leaving Anne to works her newly honed skills of feminism learned in her exile to France on the easily seduced King. The results are tension in the castle, in the Boleyn family, and between the sisters Anne and Mary. History is molded by the writer to maintain more of a Hollywood soap opera that a recreation of fact and it all ends with beheadings and the child Elizabeth running gaily through sunny old meadows of England.The actors all try to make us buy into this version of betrayal and lust and loathing, but the dialog (written by Peter Morgan) is tired and used and anything but in keeping with the period.

So much acting! So what.,"It has been on our list forever, a costume drama like PS likes, with actresses that I like (Natalie Portman and Scarlet Johannsen) with feminist and historical themes that PS likes.
It was, of course, about Henry VIII's quest for a son and how it hurt women and men, and the terrible pain from weird gender rules and untrammeled ambition.
Natalie and Scarlet acted their asses off and presented a reality that was horrible, hopefully a high level mark of human awfulness in history.
I interrupted it to make popcorn.
At the end, PS rated it ""Didn't like"" and I exclaimed that it was just her thing, like Pride and Prejudice. She said it was nothing like! I said what, they are both about how awful it was for women and how the manners and mores were horrid. With costumes! And female-centric!
Of course I didn't like it either.
She exclaimed that I really don't know her at all.
The next day, I said I recognize that P&P uses wit, and excepting the one cad, everybody is trying in their own flawed way to do their best. Unlike TOBG, which had utterly no wit and was just people at their most dreadful. (Except Mary, their mother, and the matron Queen, Katherine of Aragorn (Aragon?)).
PS seemed glad, and said ""Yeah but now we know Scarlet Johannsen can act."" I sneered ""Her mother must be so proud."" and she laughed and seemed to get exactly what I meant, the complex mix that we are proud as parents, but nobody else really cares, or many even resent it, and now in their shoes, we don't really care either, it didn't do anything for us, and a movie intended to convey only that, is just an elaborate and pointless brag.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Awesome,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is a historical romantic drama set in the 16th century, focusing on King Henry VIII's troubled marriage to Catherine of Aragon and his infatuation with Mary and Anne Boleyn. The plot revolves around scheming family members trying to improve their position by manipulating the king. The story includes themes of betrayal, love, and power struggles. The film follows Mary and Anne as they navigate the dangerous court politics of the time, with Mary eventually becomes involved with the king and Anne marrying him to become queen. The characters are complex and intriguing, especially Anne, who is portrayed as ambitious and determined to achieve her goals. I enjoyed the film because it is based on a true story, and it offers a glimpse into the fascinating history of the Tudor era.

This is a pretty shallow costume drama,"It's set in the mid-1530s in England when King Henry VIII had liaisons with both Mary and Anne Boleyn.Henry VIII (Eric Bana) is disappointed in his marriage with Catherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent), who cannot provide him a son. Mary Boleyn (Scarlett Johansson), recently married to William Carey (Benedict Cumberbatch), is offered by her father, Thomas (Mark Rylance) and uncle, Thomas Howard (David Morrissey) as a diversion to Henry VIII. Mary's older sister, Anne (Natalie Portman), had first caught Henry's eye, but a misunderstanding and her strong personality delayed her relationship with Henry. Henry finally broke with the Catholic Church, annulled his marriage to Catherine, and married Anne. Unfortunately, it didn't work out.This is a pretty shallow costume drama that makes the whole story about having a son. Very little of the political intrigue of that period is visible, and even the main characters don't have much of a personality. Many seem like cardboard cutouts.

"A tale of two sisters, not as compelling as the trailer makes it seem","I saw this movie on a plane to pass the time or else I would have probably passed on it. Nothing about this movie really stood out to me, in fact the trailer makes this movie seem better than it really is. It would have been somewhat entertaining if there was a cat fight in this metaphorically speaking. Like the two sister constantly clash with each other by trying to set a trap for one another or try to figure out ways to hurt each other in order to win King Henry VIII affection. But the story isn't like that, Natalie basically plays the bad sister and Scarlett plays the good sister. Natalie basically plays the sister that deceives in order to get what she wants and Scarlett's character basically gets forced to be with the King by her family's wish and Natalie's character wants to steal what she has. Natalie Portman is the actress that really drives that movie, she played her role really well. However I didn't find this movie all that gripping like some people claim or compelling like the trailer makes it out to be. Plus for a movie that has a lot of seduction and sex in it, there is no nudity. Now I don't judge a movie for it's nudity in most cases.

Sad Rip-off of a Truly great film,"What a huge disappointment ... The historical tale of Henry the 8th's passion for Anne Boleyn, which resulted in the creation of Protestantism and the downfall of absolute Papal secular authority, is one of the great tales of Western culture,one of truly Shakespearean proportions, the consequences of which have reverberated for the last 400 years.This movie, which seems at times like a simple shameless ripoff of the great film ""Anne of the Thousand Days"", and at other times, seeks to dumb this story down to a bland soap opera, with the elements of bodice-ripper dimestore romance novels, completely ignores the virtually earth-shaking political and religious dimensions of the actual events, and speeds up events in a ""Reader's Digest Condensed Books"" fashion, so that they become devoid of all meaning, while piling on absurd historical inaccuracies, is evidence of the extent to which popular culture has Dumbed down over the last 4 decades. Most of the acting is wooden and unconvincing, especially in the case of Eric Bana, who is only slightly less believable than he was in the first ""Hulk"" flick, although the two lead actresses, in particular Ms. Johanssen, do make a heroic effort to rescue some feeling from the otherwise banal and pedestrian dialogue. Anyone who is not particularly familiar with the historical events, or has not seen the superb film of this story done by Hal Wallis, starring Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold, can be forgiven for considering this a passably interesting entertainment, but, to realize how fully awful this movie really is, one needs to watch ""Anne of the Thousand Days"".

The Boleyn Babes,"Anne Boleyn (mother of Elizabeth I) is one of the most fascinating Queens in the royal history of England. If one is expecting a realistic portrayal of her life in 'The Other Boleyn Girl', then they're in for a huge disappointment. The movie is full of inaccuracies and is best watched as a work of fiction.I haven't read the novel but seeing that it was a vast Hollywood-type production, I was expecting something fictitious. In a way, that worked. The movie's more like a drama of rivalry, jealousy, despair etc of these fictional Boleyn sisters. There are many melodramatic moments too that exude a soap opera feel. The movie is supposed to be set in the 1500s but the language feels very modern. The actors look the same throughout the entire film. There's no indication of passage of time. The men are portrayed in a negative light and most of them are hateful. The settings, sets, costumes and visuals are impressive but the cinematography is very ordinary.As for the cast, Natalie Portman, does not physically fit the part. Women in those days were far curvier and Portman's skinny body looks out of place. Both she and Scarlett Johanssen lack the mannerisms of women of 1500s. Portman's Anne is manipulative, witchy, desperate, and impatient which is quite the contrary of what the real Anne Boleyn was, but then again this is a flaw in the writing. Otherwise, Portman's performance is okay. Scarlett Johansson looks very pretty. She does look clueless (again) in many scenes but there are a few notable sequences where she shines. Poor Eric Bana looks like he doesn't know what he should do. He lacks the charm and ruthlessness of Henry VIII (it's pretty much the women who are forced to work the charm). David Morrissey's Thomas Howard is evil but one-dimensional. Kristin Scott Thomas and Ana Torrent are the only ones whose wonderful acting linger in mind after the end credits have rolled.'The Other Boleyn Girl' is best watched as a fictional semi-soap opera. But if you're expecting some historical enlightenment, forget this one and try 'Anne of the Thousand Days' which is also a far more engaging film.",,Anonymous,History
