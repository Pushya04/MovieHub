"""I am in blood, stepped in so far""","Was actually really looking forward to seeing this 2015 film version of 'Macbeth'. The play is one of Shakespeare's best, most famous and most quotable and has leant itself to film, with Roman Polanski, Orson Welles and Akira Kurosawa all giving it splendid treatment. The cast is a talented one, having often admired Michael Fassbender, Marion Cottilard and David Thewlis and ever since seeing him in 'The Borgias' Sean Harris struck me as one to watch.Not to mention the great reviews. Was a little worried though too, seeing that it was directed by Justin Kurzel who directed the big misfire and huge waste of potential that was 'Assassins Creed'. Luckily, this 'Macbeth' lived up to expectations on the whole if not exceeding them. It is not the definitive version of the play, either on film or filmed production, and did have room for improvement, but for all its flaws the film on the whole surprisingly impressed me.This 'Macbeth' isn't perfect. It is agreed not always easy to understand the dialogue, which didn't need to be as hushed or as muttered. While the film a vast majority of the time looked absolutely great, there is a gratuitous overuse of slow-motion.Especially in the first 10 minutes or so, which were more sluggish than arresting. There are cuts and some of the omissions do affect the drama where the storytelling becomes less coherent.For all those drawbacks, there are a lot of positives with this 'Macbeth'. Other than the slow motion, it is quite an amazing looking film, with hugely atmospheric and grandiose visuals (from the suitably myterious fog early on right up to the boldly bloodthirsty climax). The photography to me was some of the best of that year, especially in the act and those locations are hugely effective in their atmosphere, uncompromising but also oddly beautiful and dark without taking it to extremes. The music is still haunting and Kurzel's direction is bolder and less muddled than it was in 'Assassins Creed' from the following year.Moreover, although it would have been nice if it was more consistently intelligible, Shakespeare's text is still powerful and hard to forget. The story takes time to get going but does get more compelling and remarkably ambitious, at its most emotionally investable from the point where Macduff learning of his family's murder (which has always been a very moving part of the plot) up to the end. The action is both exciting and ferociously harrowing, pulling no punches without being too unnecessarily over the top (seeing as 'Macbeth' is already a dramatically brutal play).Some interesting changes here. Really did like that the witches weren't portrayed in a way that was too reliant on witch cliches, and were spooky underneath their deceptive exteriors. Lady Macbeth is still an effective and steely manipulator but it was interesting to see a more conflicted side to her (very different as it is not what the play indicates) rather than her being completely villainous. This is not going to work for some, but to me it was interesting. The performances were on the whole great from all, Fassbender is searingly fierce in the title role without being too brutish and Cotillard contrasts with him effectively as a steely and imperious Lady Macbeth. Paddy Considine's Banquo is suitably noble and Harris proved in 'The Borgias' that he could do creepy but also tortured, and he is very moving here as Macduff. It is somewhat sad that Duncan's role in the play is not bigger because Thewlis, while perhaps a touch young, commands the part extremely well.In conclusion, intriguing and well done but there are better versions of 'Macbeth' around. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
An important Shakespeare film,"An important Shakespeare film.My best ""Macbeth"" still remains the Orson Welles version, followed by Kurosawa's ""Throne of Blood.""Why is director Justin Kurzel's version important? This version's visuals (cinematographer Adam Arkapaw) and music/soundtrack are fascinating (though at a few times in the film, the music goes overboard by increasing its volume). The overhead shots of the kings on the throne, the near final sequences of Macbeth's end in red fire and smoke are Kurzel's masterstrokes. The screenplay's variation of the three witches, complete with the young child, is another first. In fact, all children, specially Fleance, in this version acquire a major space that no other version of Macbeth allowed.Marion Cotillard is amazing always. Fassbender is not the best Macbeth--others have been a lot better. The music of Jed Kurzel is notable, more so the sound management most of the time, though not always. Now, is the music composer Kurzel related to the director Kurzel? Both are Australians with the same surname.The lack of bagpipes in the music was odd. So also the several Christian crosses that one does not often see in Shakespeare, unless it is essential, as in ""Romeo and Juliet."" This Macbeth is different in more ways than obvious. The Special Effects department needs to take a bow as major contributors. Methinks, the Australian element surfaced in this British/US/French production.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Five Word Review: Extraordinarily Acted Gritty Shakespearean Drama,"William Shakespeare's most famous (and quotable) tragedy has not had a major big-screen adaptation that has stayed faithful to the play in many a year. Justin Kurzel's film attempts to provide a definitive cinematic version of the iconic play with this gritty, war-based work of drama starring Michael Fassbender (Oscar-nominated for ""12 Years a Slave, 2013) in the eponymous role and Marion Cotillard, who won the award for her role in Edith Piaf biopic ""La Vie en Rose,"" 2007.As a quick word of warning: if you've not read any Shakespeare, then I'd advise you not to watch this film. Rife with Shakespearean language told through coarse Scottish accents, this is not a story easy to follow for those unfamiliar with it. Having studied the Scottish play in school, I can bring you up to speed if you're unaware - Macbeth is a Scottish thane (equivalent of a lord) who sees a premonition of witches after winning a battle. The witches' prophecies trigger a spiral which sends Macbeth beyond sanity. And a character-based war drama is, in my opinion, the perfect direction to go in for a Macbeth adaptation. I always thought in school of what a good film Macbeth would be if made with sweeping battle scenes and a rough, gritty take on the tale. This is what Kurzel does, to great success. The first thing to note is the acting. Easily his best role (which is saying something,) Michael Fassbender portrays the flawed deterioration of the eponymous protagonist with gravitas yet often relatable humanity, even as his deeds become more and more ghastly (a scene with stakes is especially hard to watch.) It will be interesting to see how Fassbender's upcoming performance in Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs biopic compares to this. An Oscar nod is almost inevitable; it would be a travesty for him not to gain a nomination for this. Marion Cotillard is not to be over- shadowed in a role which would require a considerable lack of talent to play badly. Luckily the French actress has that talent in spades and at first she brings to the table hardened resolve before the true extent of Macbeth's madness is revealed and her acting changes accordingly with an impeccable change-over.Also good is the haunting score and stunning Scottish scenery, bleak yet beautiful in a cold, austere way. The supporting turns from David Thewlis as King Duncan, Sean Harris as Macduff and Paddy Considine as Banquo are also all fantastic. In addition the ending is unexpected, but in a good way.There's little bad to be said about the technique that went into the process of making Macbeth. The only things which detract are the admittedly shallow complaint that the dialogue, and therefore the story, is often hard to understand due to the coarse accents and antiquated language. This does sometimes have the effect of ruining scenes due to being taken out of it trying to understand the speech. Also, the slow motion is used rather poorly. Too much to be used effectively, with the slow motion lingering a little too long mid-battle, but not enough to be part of the visual style like Zack Snyder's 300. However, apart from this Justin Kurzel's Macbeth is a masterfully made film that may not win over those unfamiliar with the source material but will be a true treat for fans of Shakespeare and cinema. 79/100.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Macbeth,"William Shakespeare's famous tragedy is brought to the screen on a large scale. Full of his intricate and unique style of writing, this play focuses on Macbeth.
....
What I did not expect to see is that the landscape of Scotland becomes not just the scenery background but one of the main storytelling streams. One sees too many modern adaptations of Japanese interpretation of Macbeth that one seems to forget where the story came from in the first place. Truly magnificent cinematography in this version of Macbeth and it really lives up to bloodbath on the battlefields as stated in the Bard' s words. One of the best movies in 2015",,Anonymous,History
Stylish and atmospheric take on a classic,"This version of one of the greatest plays in the English language is worth seeing for the visuals alone. We're placed right into a medieval Scottish countryside with its strikingly beautiful landscapes, lochs, and mountains. That austere and foreboding setting underlies just about every scene. The three Weird Sisters (who look superficially like peasant women but convey a genuinely creepy otherness) stand in fog-shrouded fields as they utter their cryptic warnings and prophecies to Macbeth and lurk in the background off to the side of the battles. Hardscrabble peasants and soldiers dot the landscape, sometimes strangely motionless, sometimes lining the roads, but always enhancing an air of strangeness. Life is brutal, violent death is never far away, and the supernatural world is always just offstage.I won't worry about giving away spoilers here because this is one of Shakespeare's best-known plays, but if you haven't seen it before, then this is maybe not the best place to start. Two reasons: first, a lot of the text has been cut (even though the complete play is not that long) and it will help a lot if you already know the plot and characters. Otherwise, you might be lost not knowing who's doing what and to whom. I got the feeling that the director Justin Kurzel essentially assumes that his viewers will already know the play and are deliberately looking for a different, postmodern take on it. Second, most of the dialog is (appropriately enough) in thick Scottish accents but often almost whispered, as if the characters are speaking only to themselves or someone right beside them. In places it's hard to pick up. But this too adds to the atmosphere, as if the actors are standing outside themselves both watching and taking part.Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard make a first-rate pair of leads. David Thewlis (Duncan) and Elizabeth Debicki (Lady Macduff) are also notable, as are the three witches. The various captains and soldiers with speaking parts are hard to tell from each other, but that's another reason to know the play before going in. One added touch I thought was interesting came very early on where we see the Macbeths burying an infant daughter (who's only referred to obliquely in the play) and then losing a teenage son in battle. If they don't have their own children to live for, it maybe makes it easier to understand why they would go ahead and do what they do. Another effective touch, an interesting director's interpretation, is that Lady Macbeth slides over into madness specifically because of her husband's brutal murder of Macduff's family -- she was willing to push him into assassination as a career move but didn't bargain for what it led to, which was outright destruction even of women and children and a reign of blood. ""What's done cannot be undone.""See the full play in a live theater, somewhere, and then see this movie for its distinctive ambience. It's an added-value experience.",7.0,Anonymous,History

The dark version of MacBeth.Against: Maybe the actress playing Lady MacBeth could have been Scottish.

Phenomenal,"I recently saw Macbeth with Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard and directed by Justin Kurzel and is easily my number 1 film of the year so far. While the Shakespearean dialogue may be hard to follow at times, it doesn't matter as this film is a visual masterpiece and not only i the way of shot types but also in the use of colour (which the end scene uses in a truly jaw dropping sequence). The cinematography in Macbeth is truly something to marvel at and is perfectly accompanied by magnificent performances from the 2 leads and also the rest of the cast. Fassbender was born to play this role and portrays Macbeth in a powerful and emotionally engrossing way and Cotillard is a beautiful and faultless Lady Macbeth (she has a great monologue in one scene which gave me goosebumps). Another element that I loved was the score, wonderfully haunting and powerful and matches the scenery and setting of the film. Overall, Do. Not. Miss. This. It is spectacular and I've probably hyped it up too much now but what ever its great. If I had to fault it I would saw that there are some iconic lines from the original play that aren't used in the film which was disappointing but it probably wouldn't have fit with the tone so maybe it was for the best.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Is that Fassbender I see before me,I am not a big lover of Shakespeares plays but Macbeth is a story few haven't heard at one time or another this movie is a great watch for those who enjoy the story and those who are new to it Fassbender gives an amazing performance as Macbeth and speaks the famous words in a way not heard before a modern day retelling of an old story done right.,7.0,Anonymous,History
Mumbles And Mumbles,"Well it was certainly very artistic and certain parts were just gorgeous. However there is not much more to recommend Macbeth. The worst part to me was how the dialogue was spoken, or not spoken since it was mostly whispers and mumbles. Just mumbles and mumbles. Shakespeare's prose just begs to be enjoyed but here I couldn't understand what they were saying half the time.Also they seemed to have no idea what to do with the talking parts and just tried to invent weird action scenes to go with them that felt out of place. Too theatrical is how I would describe this film. It tries to be realistic and set in historical times, but it just makes the theatrical stick out more in awkward ways.Performance wise there is nothing to complain about as everyone did a great job. Overall there are sparks of brilliance here but I just get the feeling that the makers gave up before reaching the goal and the final product is hence mediocre.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Gripping, Intense, Beautifully shot, with Unforgettable Performances","HAIL MACBETH, HAIL MACBETH, HAIL MACBETH.WOW, that was a gripping, intense, beautifully shot film with unforgettable performances and has to be the best retellings of not only 'Macbeth' but all of Shakespeare's plays on screen. This movie did an incredibly amazing job at sticking to the source material whilst also incorporating a visually stunning cinematic style. It has a very interesting cinematic style using slow motion effects and sped up film in order to capture the emotions that the characters are feeling at every moment. I was in awe at how beautiful this film was, the wide shots of the landscapes were incredible whether there was something going on or nothing at all. And i don't know where the cgi in this film was if there was much at all because it all looks so incredibly real and grand and it only adds to the scope of the film. The movie's amazing cinematography is accompanied by many amazing performances including two of the best performances this year.Sean Harris and David Thewlis were standouts in their supporting roles as Macduff and Duncan and really displayed some of their best performances but the show was stolen by the two leads. Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth were absolutely mind- blowing and amazing and encapsulated these characters as perfectly as you could get. They did incredible jobs at playing these extremely complex personalities and led me to see only Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, forgetting their previous roles. They pull of their monologues so well that you are fully engaged in what they are saying and can see that what they are feeling is not only expressed through what they are saying but just from the expressions on their faces. And Lady Macbeth's most iconic scene/monologue was represented so perfectly that it was one of the best and most gripping scenes in the film. The Oscar race is heating up and Fassbender and Cotillard have to be the front-runners for Best Actor and Actress, truly amazing.Having read the play a little while ago i was able to still recall many of the key events and know mostly what was coming up next. So hearing plenty of familiar lines from the play and seeing these scenes was incredibly rewarding. And reading the play i feel helped to follow along with what is happening at all times. But for someone unfamiliar with the story of Macbeth i think it might be a little hard to follow at times. This is definitely not a film where you can look away for even a minute and still know what is going on. If you miss a few lines of dialogue or zone out during a scene, when you zone back into the film you will probably be lost. The Shakespearean dialogue is probably going to be a barrier for people to understand and if you can't understand that dialogue you really won't like this film. But as i was saying i felt that if i hadn't read the play i would have been quite lost during the film. If you aren't paying careful attention and reading into even the most subtle of hints some scenes will seem random and you'll have no idea what is going on. So i think this is definitely not for general audiences who just want to relax and check out a film, it requires a fair amount of attention.So in the end, it is beautifully shot, intense, extremely well acted and a great adaptation of this incredible play. Maybe not for the general audience but any fans of the source material or lovers of film should love this movie. - 8.6/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Shakespeare - it's about the language, stupid!","I wanted so much to love this movie! A stellar cast, wonderful source material, what could go wrong. What went right was the visuals; the film looks great. Locations, costumes, cinematography, all are just splendid. But all that is spoiled because most of the time you can't understand what the actors are saying! Other critics commented on this issue but I went anyway, hoping they were wrong. They weren't. And there is simply no excuse. I've seen all these actors in other roles and they know how to enunciate quite well, so what went wrong? It's Shakespeare, people! The words matter! Now, I don't know if this was sloppy sound editing or deliberate obfuscation, but the result was that a movie that worked magnificently on every other level was totally spoiled, a disappointment to viewers and I'm sure an embarrassment to the cast and, I hope, the filmmakers.",3.0,Anonymous,History
A Stunning And Savage Epic Drama,"Fantastic adaptation of Shakespeare's iconic tragedy, Justin Kurzel's drama is a stunning and well-crafted epic, featuring some unforgettable performances from Marion Cotillard, Paddy Considine, Sean Harris and of course, Michael Fassbender in the role of the savage tyrant, Macbeth. Joining the other great Shakespearean masters such as Olivier and Branagh, Kurzel has created a brutal and ambitious depiction, caught by the awe-inspiring cinematography of Adam Arkapaw. Featuring glorious locations across the bleak and wintery Highlands of Scotland, 'Macbeth' is a film adaptation that even the great playwright himself would be proud of.",,Anonymous,History
Definitely not without flaw,"In many ways this is easily the best adaptation to Shakespeare's timeless play. The camera work is truly beautiful at moments, which is helped greatly by the geography of Scotland. The film has almost no reliance on CGI and what is used blends very well to the themes and surroundings. However Macbeth, like many other films adapted from written media, suffers from extensive pacing issues. Most scenes feel just a bit too long which, along with some not so praiseworthy acting, makes the film seem slower than it should be. Of Cause being based on a Shakespearean play you must make the scenes longer in order to fit in all the foreshadowing and metaphors however reaching a middle ground between pacing and metaphors would be much appreciated.In my opinion this is definitely worth watching especially if you are a fan of the original play, but it is not perfect and a better adaptation can still be made.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Great Cinematography,"If you´re going to make a film of a Shakespeare play, it better be beautiful. Otherwise, what´s the point? Fortunately, this version of Macbeth provides what no theatrical production ever could: top-notch cinematography. Above all, the viewer is treated with gorgeous images of the barren, forbidding Scottish landscape. I also thought that the acting was quite good, by everyone involved, from the witches to Macbeth to Macduff to Lady Macbeth and everyone in between.I am not sure why this film has a lower rating at imdb than many easily forgettable movies devoid of anything but brash spectacle and with no real reason to exist. I do see that some people are complaining about the characters´ enunciation. Having watched this on Prime video with the subtitles on, I always knew exactly what everyone was saying.

"Great Cinematography, A Tidily Bit Dark","While watching the film I was impressed to see what director, Justin Kurzel, was able to do with the beautiful yet tragic story of Macbeth. Director of Cinematography, Adam Arkapaw, was able to make so many innovational shots of the characters and was able to manipulate the tremendous geography of England and Scotland to his benefit. Through different shots and angles, Arkapaw was able to really bring out the intended intense emotion of Macbeth.Throughout the entire film, the acting of all was truly riveting. The way that all of the actors portrayed the Shakespearean characters really drew me into the plot. One thing I would recommend would be turning up the brightness a little. If you are not watching in a pitch black room, you are not likely to see all details. Overall.... 8/10, not too bad, definitely worth the watch.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Cinema meets Theatre,"If you are going to the Cinema to watching Macbeth you just need to know one thing: Macbeth is a Tragedy written by Shakespeare; so you are going to see an ancient theatrical Tragedy on a screen. This is a good film in optical of the Drama, but you will dislike it if you are going for watching war, battle and fighting. I think Fassbender and Cotillard played very good their role, they are sublime in this film, because they have to explain all the Drama with only words and facial expressions, like they are in Theatre and not in Cinema. The dialogue are intricate, they speak like Shakespeare write the Opera, so metaphor and turn of phrase, you need to keep concentrate to follow all the dialogues. Enjoy it, like you will enjoy in Theatre a Shakespearian Tragedy.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Fatuous,"While the strongest features of this version: the locations, photography and production design, are quite outstanding the overall impression is less than memorable. It is afflicted by a meddling director, changes that serves little purpose or revelation in the end, and all the normal problems of cinematic adaptations of Shakespeare.A major defect is the music which constantly scrapes – telling us that all things are seething with malignancy. It does, however strain the nerves like a dentist's drill, and is just as annoying. In essence that is the flaw with the whole thing, and certainly the first hour which is dour and dreary, though not in a good way because it's so simplistically portentous and saved only by the scenery and the light.The actors manage quite well, even if they speak in a very mannered sotto voce. In itself this is a weakness as it leads through most of the film to a vocal range that is very narrow. This pitch is evident between Macbeth and his wife as though all relationships are marked by the same register and it is necessarily identical between all parties. Paradoxically this approach leads Macbeth to be nearly unchanged from the beginning to the end, which is not how the play deals with the character. The important ""Tomorrow"" soliloquy is rendered lame by the continuity of the low voice which preceded it and so this speech is no different to the rest.The typical problem of all cinematic adaptations of Shakespeare is apparent here. The two forms, poetic drama and cinema are anathema to each other. The former requires words and once they are edited it's not Shakespeare but an etiolated revision, replaced by montage and glances; which compared to a great text, are of very little consequence. Kurosawa's Throne of Blood was another prism by which to see this drama but it was only cognate in the same plot and story, not the language, and stands in the same way as his superb Ran is to King Lear.There are several film versions of this play and now there are more filmed staged versions to view and to compare. This particular version looks quite pointless by comparison. It has made some changes, cut some parts, removed the small portion of vulgar humor which relieved the glowering doom, but in the end, it is rather fatuous.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"""Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely"" (Lord Acton), in Shakespeare's Scottish play of assassination, set in scenes of blood and mud.","Elizabethan play-write William Shakespeare staged plays of great historical events. Necessarily limited by the stage-setting, these were the masterpieces of carefully crafted words and speeches that we now consider as Shakespearian English. Thus this reviewer considered the film version of Shakespeare's Scottish play as perhaps being too wordy and stagey to go and see. However, I was beguiled by the trailer, that seemed to suggest lots of action and battles. Alas, this was not to be. However, this dull, but worthy product, is a fine showcase for Shakespeare, Scotland, and the performing thespians of the film.This Scottish-themed film does open up on the battlefield. There are some interesting scenes as the warriors prepare for battle and the battle itself is shown well. (A later battle also has some interesting two-sworded battle scenes). During the battle, witches appear, and make a prophecy about the King of Scotland. The film tells the story of an attempt to fulfil the prophecy and of the aftermath of that attempt.The male lead is played by Michael Fassbender and the female lead playing opposite him is Marion Cottilard. They are superb in their roles and must have actually suffered hard for their craft. Location shooting for the film was in the Isle of Skye in Scotland. This reviewer has paddled in water there, and can assure readers that even in the height of summer, it is like putting your feet into buckets of ice. Yet, we have Mr Fassbender in water in a scene, and Miss Cottilard, far from her native France, is seen scampering about barefoot and lightly dressed. Bravo! it should be said that there is little sight of the summer in this story. There are many, many, scenes of bleak mountains and bogs and moorland. The climate is cold and wet, with swirling fogs often covering the rough terrain. The scenes are in fact very bleak and compare with those in the Viking film 'Valhalla Rising' (2009).Elizabeth Debicki, who also appeared in this year of 2015 in 'Everest', here does a standout scene, as relevant to us now as it was in the era it was set in. Sean Harris, who like Michael Fassbender, also appeared in Prometheus (2012), here delivers a brilliant and powerful performance. There is a scene in the 1995 Scottish film 'Braveheart' where William Wallace is floored in shock when he encounters the English champion. Here, in this film, Sean Harris, similarly has his emotions plunged to the depths, more than once. His acting is superb throughout the film.David Thewlis seems to have an ability to really inhabit his roles. The source material, (book), for the film 'Seven Years in Tibet' (1997) seems to show he got the part just right. So too, for his OTT role in the 2010 film 'Mr Nice' which again matched the source material in the book of the same name. In this year of 2015 though, his performances have seemed more subdued but still true to the source material. I found his portrayal in 'Legend' to be fascinating. Here, in this film, he takes a part and makes it very believable. The part he plays is very like one today and he seems to play it like that too. There are some obvious differences too in that role of course, but that is the essence of the plot of this Scottish film.We also get good supporting roles from Paddy Considine, David Hayman and Jack Reynor.Much of the location shooting is on the Isle of Skye in Scotland, though I did spot Bamburgh Castle too. Ely Cathedral is also featured. The cathedral scenes are spectacular as are the castle interiors, however the bulk of the film is shot in realistically grim surroundings. Our thespians spend most of their time wallowing in blood and mud, and the climate and terrain are both as gloomy and grim as the storyline. The use of hand-held cameras does detract though. As do some of the special-effects that take us out of the moment.This film is a good introduction to Shakespeare and his Scottish play. Political students can learn lessons from this story today, just as they can from 'I Claudius'. For those interested in the subjects of assassination, conspiracy, politics and statecraft, then the writings of the Renaissance Florentine statesman and writer Niccolo Machiavelli may also be of interest.This film of the Scottish play serves as a good way to engage a modern audience and as such has been a worthwhile project. 9/10.",,Anonymous,History
What's Done is Done,"Justin Kurzel's fresh take on the classic Shakespeare drama boasts two breathtakingly good performances from Cotillard and Fassbender, which is more than enough to overcome the unnecessarily flamboyant direction.For someone who isn't at all into any of Shakespeare's classic tales, I was intrigued with this project for merely two reasons; Marion Cotillard and Michael Fassbender. Not only was I enthralled by both of their turns, but I enjoyed the different take on a story that has been redone so many times. Kurzel chose to take a much more visceral and experimental approach with the storytelling, and for the most part, it works. It took me awhile before I became accustomed to Kurzel's style, but it proved to create more of an emotional backbone to what is already a heavy story.Fassbender, who has found such a nice balance in starring in blockbusters and indies, gives another astounding performance as the troubled title character. He effortlessly demonstrates Macbeth's confidence while also adding in vulnerability to his paranoia. If marketed more, this could have been another nomination for Fassbender. On the other-hand, Cotillard also had her hands full with the meaty role of Lady Macbeth, but she holds her own with Fassbender, constantly nailing the difficult Shakespearean dialogue.As previously mentioned, you do feel a strong presence of Kurzel's visual flare here and I think there is valid argument to make that it tarnishes some aspects of the story. For the first 30 minutes or so, the choppy editing and strange visual cues Kurzel uses didn't enhance my viewing experience. It wasn't really until I dug my teeth into this particular interpretation of these characters that I began to care for the stylistic storytelling.Overall, it's not a usual adaption but nor is it one that I would want to sit through more than once. It is, however, a visceral experience (unlike many Shakespeare adaptations) led by two Oscar caliber performances.+Cotillard and Fassbender are powerful+Kurzel's style grew on me-Takes time to get going7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
Macbeth 2015,"While this is not quite as good as Roman Polanski's 1971 version, it's definitely worth watching.The acting is excellent. The right people were chosen for the roles, especially Sean Harris who is the ideal Macduff. Marion Cotillard gives us a superb performance (perhaps best ever as Lady Macbeth). Michael Fassbender does a credible job as Macbeth.One major weakness is the cinematography, which was poor by times. There is lack of a detailed background in many scenes. During the final fight between Macbeth and Macduff we just see a reddish fog and some vague figures in the background. And where was the Great Birnam Wood?Some scenes were filmed in better locations, so there is no real reason they could not have used some of these places background for the ""empty background"" scenes. Visually Polanski's classic is much better.That being said, overall this version of Macbeth is very good.",7.0,Anonymous,History

So if you don't mind the movie being shot/spoken in Shakespeare English, you will have a very interesting movie on your hand.I'm also not too familiar with the Macbeth story in detail anymore (have to re-read it), so I can't tell if the movie does steer away at moments or leaves something out. But as it is, it does a good job and while it can not be considered the best Shakespeare adaptation, it still does the job, which comes down to the actors being as convincing as they are",7.0,Anonymous,History
Marion Cotillard and Michael Fassbender excel in Justin Kurzel's thrillingly savage interpretation of the Scottish Play.,"As the shortest, sharpest and most stormily violent of William Shakespeare's tragedies, ""Macbeth"" may be the most readily cinematic: The swirling mists of the Highlands, tough to fabricate in a theater, practically rise off the printed page. So it's odd that, while ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Hamlet"" get dusted off at least once a generation by filmmakers, the Scottish Play hasn't enjoyed significant bigscreen treatment since Roman Polanski's admirable if tortured 1971 version. The wait for another may be even longer after Justin Kurzel's scarcely improvable new adaptation: Fearsomely visceral and impeccably performed, it's a brisk, bracing update, even as it remains exquisitely in period. Though the Bard's words are handled with care by an ideal ensemble, fronted by Michael Fassbender and a boldly cast Marion Cotillard, it's the Australian helmer's fervid sensory storytelling that makes this a Shakespeare pic for the ages — albeit one surely too savage for the classroom.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"The Madness of King ""Macbeth""","From the beginning, Captain Macbeth and kinsman to the King is cursed with the witches' prophesy telling him that he will be King. How is that for a dramatic foreshadowing? And it is a curse. His desire to be King, a test of his prowess, will make and undo him.Why does Macbeth want the Scottish crown that wears so heavy? Why does Lady Macbeth lust after it so? What is the benefit of being queen? Is it just so, that all men lust for power and all powerful women lust for men with power? The play, and thus the film, offers little explanation. And unlike King Lear, there is no fool character to reflect the king's madness, only other lords and kinsman afflicted with a similar infliction.The acting is uneven. Fassbender does well with the material, but he doesn't live up to expectations. Cotillard as Lady Macbeth fails to impress. She does little to convince us that she is pulling Macbeth's strings and when Macbeth does his worst deeds, her madness and guilt over those actions misses the mark. What she expresses is a weak sadness, not the guilt and shock of an accomplice.Whether it is is the direction or the acting, Lady Macbeth often didn't strike true. In Kurosawa's version of Macbeth, ""Throne of Blood"", Lady Macbeth is a clearly conniving, manipulative terror. In this version, not so much. I like the more diabolical Lady and the more clearly falsely grieving version of the Kurosawa adaptation. And I understand how extremely unfair it is to compare anything to the master of cinema, Kurosawa.Macbeth was played only slightly better. Fassbender is unable to really honor and show the true bloodthirsty nature of character. He holds back, seeming to think that by holding back on his psychopathology, that it shows a complex character. It doesn't. It shows an unwillingness to commit. In the scene where he grieves his choices, he is much more powerful.Sean Harris, on the other hand, plays the complex Macduff to its fullest. Harris shows incredulity at the actions of King Macbeth, a confused anguish over the king's vengeance, while at the same time demonstrates a hatred and purpose. On hearing of his lost family, Macduff states that he will "" dispute it as a man"" but he will also ""feel it like a man."" And Harris/Macduff does just that. His recognition of his fate is the most powerful scene in the film. I like the way the film treats the witches as spirits as not as demonic as in other portrayals. That leaves room for the real manipulators of Macbeth, his wife and his unconscious and barely subsumed desire for absolute power, to come to the fore. His lust for power is barely hidden under a shroud of honor and love, and it only takes the lust of his future queen to bring it out.At its best, ""Macbeth"" is a tale of honor, country, family and megalomania. At its worst, the film is a confused jumble of motivations that are seldom clear, except in the case of Macduff. It didn't help that director Kurzel couldn't decide whether this version of the play should be more cinematic or theatrical, using elements of both and not always successfully. The best moments are on the moor, though one would assume the play favored the bedroom scenes between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Their chemistry was fine, but Cotillard in no way convinces us that she could manipulate Fassbender to do anything but bed her.Aye, there's the the rub. My mind is too modern to accept such simplistic motivations, and it will take more than reading words on a page to get me to accept the premise.Rating: MatinéeIt looks great in the Scottish and Northern English countryside. The sets and costumes are well done and even the Scottish warpaint, often a distraction in other films of Scottish warfare, is both powerful and subtle. The film is visually appealing, and despite its uneven performances, there is enough worth watching on the big screen.Peace,Tex Shelters",6.0,Anonymous,History
Complete and utter disappointment,"Wow. What a complete and utter disappointment. From the moment that I saw the rumours and the pictures popping up around the web that Michael Fassbender was to play Macbeth, one of the most brilliantly written characters of all time, I was all over the place of excitement. The imagery looked stunning and anything that Fassbender touches becomes gold. To follow it up with a brilliantly cast Paddy Considine as Banquo and, in my opinion a little too young, Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth I thought we were set for success.The opening is harrowing, beautiful and brilliant and it really sucks you in to their world. From the first moment costumes, props and carpentry look great, cinematography beyond beautiful and it really sets the mood. For nothing.What follows is a drawn out, slow-paced, pretentious interpretation of the text that loses it's insanity and rhythm completely. Now I'm all for revisioning and reimagining, and there's a LOT of room for that in the play Macbeth, so I was excited, but utterly disappointed.It's an orgy of meaningless violence in slow motion, topped off with so many close ups of blood and vomit that doesn't serve a purpose, sprinkled with, what I can only imagine being a directors ""vision"" with complete disregard of his actors talents.The ""redeeming part"" is it's beautiful imagery, but everything else pushes this movie down to the very bottom of my list. To cite Macbeth himself, ""It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""",2.0,Anonymous,History
poetry in motion,"peaceful candles on violent faces - rough vision of emotions deep - motion matched the poetry - of wondering thoughts to keep.a master piece combining theatre - excellent acting and visual art - authenticity in dress and location - even Shakespeare would take heart.Michael Fassbender made Macbeth, raw yet vulnerable which solved an issue I always had with this character. How can a strong war lord completely losing it? He portrayed Macbeth in a such a way that made me feel, that he truly (twistingly) believed it was also for survival and not just for simple ambition. He solved it for me.At the same time, I always thought of Lady Macbeth as a conniving, over-ambitious gold-digger. She still was yet at the same time I saw a strong person who helped surviving despite her pain and loss. Marion Cotillard's acting was so pure and emotionally complex, awesome.A Scottish friend who loves his country's history, was pleasantly surprised regarding the relative authenticity of highlander living and praised the costumes: no tartan, but Roman type with leather/metal battle uniforms which would be likely correct considering that Macbeth lived in the 11th century.The music was powerful, supporting the Shakespearian lines, subtly giving them more impact. @Sales: subtitles would be useful even for people whose first language is English ... although it would reduce the magnitude of this visual spectacle.This films was everything I was hoping for when seeing the trailer. It was a piece of art with moving pictures and words. Even if you don't like Shakespeare, it's an amazing film. A very high 9 score !",9.0,Anonymous,History
An evocative introduction to the play,"Very good, within the constraints of 113 minutes. (Maybe should have been called 'The Essential MacBeth' or even 'MacBeth: The Highlights' ;-) Great for those without the stamina or education yet to handle the 'real thing', and the film medium suits the private conversations and soliloquies much better as the actors can speak with more subtle feeling. That said, whispering in a Scottish accent is never going to provide the clearest enunciation. Those unfamiliar with the text may struggle to comprehend occasionally, but hey that's Shakespeare for you ! Marion Cotillard does not disappoint, Fassbender retains his crown and there's good support from among the current cohort of serious British actors: Paddy Considine as Banquo; Sean Harris as MacDuff and David Thewlis as Duncan; also from some past the zenith of their careers, as well as a sprinkling of up-and-coming talent. Watch it and realise just how enormous an impact Shakespeare has had on British culture and language.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"What was done, was done well.","The world of William Shakespeare can be a tricky road to navigate, especially if you are not educated in his tediously difficult language that arrogantly lies in waiting, sprawled across the pages of his many plays. If you are neither a Thespian or English Literature Graduate (which I am clearly not), you will struggle to understand the famous playwrights narrative. It just might be easier to learn French or German at the local community college than it is to painfully study what Shakespeare is actually trying to say. I have seen just a handful of the Elizabethan era writers work; the tragic love story of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar and the very puzzling comedy, A Midsummer Night's Dream. Each time I came away scratching my head, my feeble brain trying its best to piece together the events that had actually taken place. Through all the confusion, I still found myself enjoying the fragments of dialogue and story that made sense to me. This is why I was drawn to another of Shakespeare's great tragedies, even though I knew I would be sitting through nearly two hours of theatre without the use of subtitles.Macbeth is a well known story of ambition, murder, rage and tyranny but what I was looking for in Justin Kurzel's interpretation was a connection that an uneducated sloth like myself could get from a tale that had four hundred years of retelling. I wanted to feel the characters emotions and I wanted to visualise their world. I wanted to be able to identify Macbeth's tragic blind ambition and lust for power. More importantly, I wanted a tangible belief in the story being presented to me.Kurzel knows his audience well because he has directed one of the greatest Shakespearean plays ever put onto film. The brutal and bloody world that Kurzel has visioned, creates an authentic and powerful atmosphere that never deserts the viewer, allowing the famous story to illustrate itself effortlessly across the screen. Half the battle is won. Accompanied by an outstandingly appropriate score sets the scene for a film that would not look out of place amongst the very best movie releases this year. The eerie and sombre acoustics help keep the audience fixed to their seats as the savage tragedy of Macbeth unfolds in all its brutal glory.Michael Fassbender (Macbeth), plays the character to perfection and it is his performance alone that makes it easier for the common man to understand Shakespeare's historic language. Fassbender is thoroughly engaged in his role and every word he delivers oozes emotion. Marion Cotillard is equally impressive as the conniving Lady Macbeth. Cotillard was an interesting choice to play the femme fatal, but she has proved here that she can rise to any challenge. This performance is a very colourful feather in a exceptional cap. Her Lady Macbeth helped me to realise that she became somewhat of a victim to the King she had created. ""What is done, is done."" I am quite sure that she didn't envisage her warrior husband to become the tyrant that he became. Adding to the list of superb performances is Sean Harris, the vengeful and savage Macduff, who is hell bent on ending Macbeth's reign as the Scottish Monarch. Great little cameos by David Thewlis (King Duncan) and Elisabeth Debicki (Lady Macduff), along with brilliant visionary direction by Justin Kurzel will give the uneducated hordes a chance to witness one of Shakespeare's masterpieces.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A magnificent recounting of Shakespeare's Macbeth in which all the fire , doom , vengeance and ambition of his text come brilliantly to life . Although Shakespeare's Macbeth has little to do with Macbeth , the King , the real Macbeth was one of Scotland's better kings . Very well made film that contains stunning fight scenes , lots of mood , grisly killings , fine acting , breathtaking battles and being compellingly set in a barbaric society . Realized in cold and thought-provoking style that it bears remarkable resemblance to the Shakespearean original . However , some aspects differ from the original source material , as there would be only the three witches without the child and the infant , as Banquo's ghost would sit in Macbeth's seat during the banquet ; moreover , the movie subplot of Macbeth's dead child would be completely omitted as well as the famous beheading executed by MacDuff , opposite to the movie .

Truly awful!,"If you take the Shakespeare out of this mess, you would have an amateurish ""sword and sorcery"", pot-boiler movie which would (and should!) be laughed at.Re-insert Shakespeare (who must be disturbing his own bones by turning in his grave in Stratford-upon-Avon)and you have one of the most mangled versions of ""The Scottish Play"" that has been my misfortune to sit through.Briefly: scenes chopped, changed but not for the better; significant events simply skimmed over or missed; scenes invented and gratuitously inserted (e.g. the daft opening scene); lines entirely stripped of their power; lines entirely missed out and not for any particularly good reason. There is nothing wrong with interpreting Shakespeare and (say) missing out scenes and lines to give a vision of the meaning of the play as the director sees it - e.g. Olivier missed out nearly 1,000 lines of Henry V in his 1944 film production of Henry V (not a film that I personally care that much for but it was effective and did not do a violence to the play). However Justin Kurzel's effort strikes me as the production of someone who simply did not understand his material.The casting was frequently dire, Marion Cottilard was simply miscast as Lady Macbeth she may be many things but this was a step too far for her in my opinion. Malcolm was, in effect, a bit-player, mostly shorn of the small role he has; there are too many other examples. That said, Michael Fassbender gave an almost creditable/credible performance as the eponymous hero but he had a mangled text to work with.The Scottish accents were a curious mishmash of the genuine (i.e. the role was actually played by a Scot) and the dreadful made up, modern-day ""Glasgow"" accents that the BBC seems to trot out when it wants to do something about Scotland and show it elsewhere. That said, the diction was very poor - we certainly do not need declamation a la Henry Irvine but having lines mumbled in a hoarse ""tough guy"" whisper (a la Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry) was neither helpful nor illuminating.The choice of locations was quite bizarre - some were very good and atmospheric - conveying extremis well but others were, it seems, simply plucked at random from something like the Lord of the Rings.",1.0,Anonymous,History
All Hail Macbeth,"If you have ever seen a Shakespeare production, well good for you; but except for understanding the language, it does not prepare you for this ambitious Macbeth. I will include it in the first paragraph because it plays a role more important than any character, and that is our friend Atmosphere. This film utilizes what a stage production could never achieve, and it creates such a distinguished atmosphere.Say, Mr. Gill, what exactly do you mean by atmosphere? I'm talking about mood, I'm talking about tone, I'm talking about presentation! There is a lot of fog and mist to go around, and the camera hardly moves, painting picture-like shots of characters in front of a wide background. It's so visceral and bold and unexpected. Above all, it works. It fits the puzzle beautifully with the vision in-hand.There are plenty of smart choices, such as reducing the lines and spirit of the crazy 3 witches. Instead, they add such a mystical element that's almost taunting to the ticking and complex Macbeth. There's other noticeable changes, but before you traditionalists call foul, don't worry because it's not a change from the source like pre-good DiCaprio Romeo + Juliet is.Okay, the film is perhaps stylish to a fault. If you recall the iconic scene in Mission: Impossible where Tom Cruise sneaks into the white room, you will remember that any sound above a whisper would trigger the alarm. It felt like (with the exception of scenes like the haunting dinner) the entire cast was set to this mode. Although it adds a coolness to many of the lines, I kind of wanted to yell at the screen just to see if the characters would yell back. Oh, and I can't imagine watching the film without the use of subtitles. And on that note, I think every Shakespeare movie is probably enhanced with subtitles to help understand the lines and think them through more thoroughly.I don't think I have talked about makeup in movies as much as I should, so I will add it here. The battle makeup and makeup on Lady Macbeth stand out in a good way, and that is a big accomplishment to the people in that department.Now you just know I wouldn't do a review without mention of the acting. Hey, Harry Potter fans, Lupin is in this film! Okay okay, let's talk Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard. Fassbender is a powerhouse actor, and I think a little more variation in voice would clean up one of Shakespeare's best characters. And one of Shakespeare's best female characters, if not the best, is played by the French Cotillard, an interesting differentiation from the rest of the Scots. Combine these two experienced actors with incredible lighting, and we're back to the atmosphere.I must say how I was engaged for the entire film. It's impossible not to give huge credit for this Shakespeare adaptation that perhaps stands out the most from any of the movies of any of the plays. And yeah, the fighting is like Zack Snyder, but with more purpose. I don't think the opening and ending sequences could have been done better, and for the squeamish, there is enough blood to quench a vampire; but as I stated earlier, it is more meaningful and again adds to the atmosphere. If there's any way to get millenials excited about what a dead guy wrote years ago, it is through this film. And that statement could easily have its downsides, but even the shall we say sophisticated can appreciate what is done. I'd say this film is like Zack Snyder meets Gladiator meets European art, and on most notes, that is pretty good praise.

A cinematic triumph,"While it will not please everybody, Kurzel's treatment of a familiar story is little short of spectacular, gripping the spectator emotionally and visually.There have been many treatments of the semi-fictional yet inspiring Shakespearean saga of ambition and corruption, with famous actors and directors from the earliest days of cinema. In 1971, Polanski injected new life in the tale by depicting the grimness of the early Scottish landscape and the violent and brutality of events from the play. Although Polanski made an effort towards faithfulness of the words written by the Bard, bringing a grittiness to the screen that could hardly be achieved on stage, Kurzel in one sense goes a stage further, completely accepting that cinema is a different medium and that faithfulness to the spirit of a story can be fulfilled in many dimensions.From the very opening scenes, before hardly a word has been spoken, Kurzel uses visual images of desperate conditions, a child's death, a youngster preparing for war, to heighten our emotional sensitivity. When spoken words begin, there is little attempt to 'make Shakespearean English understandable' in the normal way. True to the story, he uses heavy Scottish accents, forcing the viewer to follow what is happening visually, and the emotional journeys become a tsunami.Superb acting shows Macbeth as an initially good, loyal, man, the three witches not as bat-boiling hags but as sincere, folklorish women, and the future Lady Macbeth as devoted, loving and kind (if a bit misguided). All this fits with reasonable history of the period and the story generally. The unsophisticated Macbeth is loyal to his king, but allows his wife (who wants him to succeed in life) to influence him against his better judgment. Her unravelling, as she witnesses the monster that her husband has become (at her bidding) is a transformation effected by Marion Cotillard in one of the most remarkable female performances of the year.As long as you have a passing idea of the story, it is easy enough to follow by focussing on the emotions of the characters. There is no need of the usual cinematic markers of overblown heroism and evil deeds to delineate good and evil (although there are plenty of evil deeds as well, some of them clothed in sweetness and piety). We can see for ourselves, in the subtle expressions and choices, as a pure heart becomes corrupt, and as evil takes root until the person no longer knows themself.The contrast between the old king and Macbeth in power also touches on broader themes: that leaders can embody things that all men and women aspire to, such as honesty, recognition of others, kindness and a better future for all. When these are lacking, most people no longer love and identify with their king but merely think of staying alive, being a bit better off materially, or going home to their family.Kurzel finds novel ways of dealing with the big supernatural events that strike us as entirely credible without the use of special effects and even manages to add a new interpretation to the famous 'Birnham Wood'. The stunning climax might suggest modern day lessons of tolerance over the heated Scottish independence question; and the final footage is used not to amaze in typical blockbuster style but to tear at one's heart and guts as we consider the horrors visited on innocent men and children by the unleashed greed and ambition that was as unstoppable as it was unintended.One cannot make a film like this which breaks the mold without upsetting those that seek straightforward entertainment. Yet this is, in some sense at least, Shakespeare: those that only go for battle scenes and the story on a plate may leave feeling distinctly unsatisfied.",6.0,Anonymous,History
MacBeth mumbles and stares off into middle distance for nearly 2 hours.,"When Shakespeare wrote his plays, he was writing for crowds of restless commoners who craved entertainment. He wrote captivating, expressive poetry for colorful characters to speak in telling magnificent and moving stories. Unfortunately, Hollywood directors have entered a new era of movie making where excessive lip movement or speaking above a mumble is out of style. Anyone who has seen the Mockingjay Trilogy will know what I mean. The words being mumbled seem to be incidental to the opportunity to film long lingering stares, someone standing in a field being wistful, a shot of horses grazing, curtains blowing in the wind, someone standing on a hillside being wistful. Meanwhile, time is passing, the audience is waiting for a story to be told but we are faced with more and more self indulgent cinematography. Everything that happens in this movie happens very, very slowly. Shakespeare didn't need clever cameramen, nor did he see any theatrical value in ten minutes of silent pondering.To make the experience even less pleasant, the sound track is someone playing a cello with only one string. When I say ""playing"" I mean whining like a petulant child, an unending drone that expresses nothing. The sound track is awful. As for the witches, an integral element in the story of MacBeth, they were about as interesting as suburban Wiccans at a baby shower. Once again, mumbled words through barely moving lips on expressionless faces made them seem more bored than chilling as they should be. If you want to see MacBeth, try one of the versions that came before this silly attempt to be clever.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Visually striking, but frustrating for non-Shakespeare lovers","This is a visually striking and hugely impressive adaptation of Shakespeare's classic tale. Whilst the screenplay remains faithful to the original by retaining Shakespearean dialogue, the original direction by Justin Kurzel allows for an often mesmerising display that is more often than not the most interesting part of the entire film.So, before we get into that, let's talk about how Shakespearean this really is. In short: very. If, like so many us, you are a hater of Shakespeare thanks to years of it being rammed down your throat at school, this isn't going to be as engrossing a watch, because you'll likely be consistently confused and frustrated by ye olde dialogue.However, the story itself is a classic, and whether you are a fan of the bard or not, it's a very gritty and dark tale that can be very interesting at times. Macbeth's rise to power is often haunting to watch, of course helped by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard's performances, as the two attempt to usurp the throne of Scotland for their own ambition.This film in particular is extremely violent and gritty. The various battle scenes feel like you're watching 300, with an onslaught of blood flying around, yet with such artistic direction that it's almost dream-like.The directing by Justin Kurzel is definitely the most impressive part of this whole film. His visual style turns this more into a loose-feeling art-house picture more than a classic Shakespearean tale, as he turns battles into warped dreams, monologues into very intense sequences, and makes an overall visually striking film.What's more is that the score here will also really get you mesmerised in the film. Again, even if you're struggling to cope with the Shakespearean dialogue, the eerie and unnerving music that plays almost incessantly throughout this film will have you hooked, as it really helps to create a more fearful atmosphere, likening Macbeth's ascent to the end of days, furthered by Kurzel's often apocalyptic-looking directing.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Shakespeare done away with and replaced by brutal primitive pretensions,"Whatever happened to Shakespeare? He is almost completely lost in this pretentious whisking away of any meaning and poetry of the play by complete obfuscation of the language, the very flesh and blood of any Shakespeare drama, here mumbled in the beards or wheezed half way while most gets stuck in the throat, as if diction suddenly was anathema and banished. All previous Macbeth adaptations for the screen that I have seen have been better, and they were at least four. Things are made even worse by the fact of the alterations, the important part of the porter (peeing in the gate) has been obliterated, the murder of the family of McDuff is turned into a grotesque exaggeration like a blasphemy of the play, and McDuff's war trick in the end with the wandering forest, the very top of the play, is substituted by an intentional destructive forest fire. The battle scenes are grossly exaggerated and turned into artificial ballets made worse by slow motion, and there is little to save the film except the marvellous landscape scenery, magnificent all the way through, and the after all good acting, despite the fact that the actors are not allowed more than to mumble. Sorry, this was an indecent corruption and humiliation of the theatrical art of Shakespeare. What a marvellous film it would have been, if Shakespeare had been kept alive and allowed to shine in his language in these true landscape settings of wildest Scotland!",6.0,Anonymous,History
Stellar visuals and weighty performances make for good Shakespeare,"Being completely bowled over by Adam Arkapaw's visuals, I was unprepared for the crushing weight in the performances of Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard. The former, who is admittedly my favorite working actor, impressed me with both his intensity and his restraint. He could have opted to play Macbeth's insanity in a wide eyed bat-dung homage to Mel Gibson's Hamlet. Many actors are overwhelmed by Shakespeare and, as a result, deliver turgid dribbling performances. Whereas for the most part Fassbender's Macbeth seethes and intensely eyes the object of his anger. Marion Cotillard absolutely killed it as Lady Macbeth. Even if this Lady Macbeth was much changed from what we're used to. In earlier adaptations, and I believe the original source, she was much more manipulative. It was almost as if she forced Macbeth's hand. That's not so in Justin Kurzel's interpretation. Here the two are equally yoked.",9.0,Anonymous,History
dark stark take,"This is a dark, bloody, stark take on the classic Shakespearian play. Michael Fassbender plays the iconic Macbeth and Marion Cotillard plays Lady Macbeth. In Scotland, Macbeth supports King Duncan (David Thewlis) in the civil war and comes out victorious. The witches make prophecies. It is a tale of ambition, power, and self-fulfilling tragedies.The cinematic visuals take advantage of the stark Scottish landscape. It wallows in the blood and mud. Even the slow motion blood dripping add to the mood. However, it does feel like style over substance. Sometimes people mumble. Sometimes it just doesn't sing. I'm looking at the Out Spot speech and the emotional power is faded. I wouldn't say anybody is bad but I want to feel more from Fassbender and company. It does take the familiar material into more compelling spaces.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Visually stunning, average adaptation","Although stylistically brilliant, Macbeth does little to propel itself beyond the simple label of a good adaption. The swooping cinematography, extreme close-ups and arty use of colour and smoke are visually stunning and the best aspects of the film. The acting is sublime too, with Marion Cotillard playing a typically evil Lady Macbeth and Michael Fassbender portraying Macbeth's dark character arc with vigour and intensity. There is not a bad acting performance in the film - equally impressive is the rugged moorland scenery of Scotland, reflecting the bleak tale. Thankfully the original dialogue is used, although rough accents at times obscure the language, whole scenes are omitted and the Shakespearean words are difficult to follow. Unfortunately this is enhanced by the pacing, as the story seems to develop extremely slowly, causing me to feel lethargic and lose patience with the ancient dialogue.Layers of mud and warpaint mask the character's faces, making it difficult to tell one war-wearied Scotsman from another; and there is the ghost of a young man who appears, throat slit, at tense moments for no apparent reason. The music, although scant, is sorrowful and emotive at the right moments. Naturally, the story of Macbeth is centuries old - but the success of recent medieval-period shows/films (Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings) makes me feel that this adaptation lacks innovation in its narrative and use of bloody violence.Macbeth's high-brow technical aspects (intricate camera-work, masterful set-piece layouts, and use of colour) elevate it slightly beyond an average adaptation. However, if the number of people who walked out of the cinema is anything to go by, it is more of a critical success than a public one.",7.0,Anonymous,History
What bloody man is that?,"A visually impressive, intelligently adapted, atmospheric version of a very famous play. Michael Fassbender is stunning in the title role. What an actor he is! Brutal and sensitive, cruel and caressing, he handles the verse effortlessly, the fights viciously, and he radiates a huge wattage of charisma. He and Marion Cottilard make a convincingly sexy couple. She is not obvious casting - usually the role is the province of more steely performers. All the same, she makes a success of it, forceful in the electrically effective banquet scene, and touchingly melancholy as she drifts into the deep depression of her mad scene.The supporting cast is terrific, the technical side superb, the score by the director's brother mesmerising. I have a couple of quibbles: the emphasis on interiority makes the pace feel insufficiently varied, and so much close-miking gives the impression that too much of the text is whispered. But on the whole this is a bravely envisioned, powerfully acted movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Missing Macbeth,"I am baffled by the positive reviews this film has received. I have seen many Macbeth adaptations and live on stage and this film portrays none of the raw human emotion that makes the play great. Instead we are subjected to a self congratulating aesthetic that might look visually visceral, misses the point of the characters. Sorely disappointed with Fassbender who usually has such depth was monotonous and dull. The concept of a historically realistic setting was a good one, but the execution left much to be desired. Shakespeare aficionados will notice the alterations and cuts made to the text, which I can't help but wonder the point of since the missing scenes would have aided the character construction a lot. I'm fine with artistic license but why remove the overtly pagan aspect yet retain the witches as true characters rather than figments of Macbeths mind? There are so many better versions of Macbeth out there, I don't see any value in this one at all. In short, this Macbeth is well worth a miss.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"A must see and then again, and again...","I was lucky to see this in a cinema where no one spoke during the entire duration of the film (a rarity I find nowadays) - it may be because people were holding their breath in anticipation of what was to come next. Wow. Had me transfixed the entire way through. Those familiar lines no less haunting for the multiple times my eyes have seen them and my ears heard them. Some clever interpretation of the original text including additions that were only spoken of in the original play script. Some purists might not like these additions and interpretations but I found them equitable to the original. Fassbender was amazing. Understated where needed, alternately a powerhouse. I can and will watch again.",9.0,Anonymous,History
7/10,"The proof that Shaekspeare will never get old. The umpteenth adaptation of the great tragedy by the Bard is another great vision of his work, unique in its own yet appropriately elaborated and adapted, despite the fact that it is more good storytelling than great cinema.By that I mean that the filmmakers didn't find a way to make the narrative deeply compelling and thrilling as I know it, it lacks that adrenaline punch that for me made Macbeth one of the greatest things ever studied in school. It is a very cold staging of the tragedy that doesn't really make for an absorbing cinema experience per say.Still, the power of the themes, characters, story is so superlative and so out of time it is hard to resist being engaged with Macbeth. Put on top of that Fassbender owning, and I truly mean, owning the role of Macbeth, Cotilliard giving Lady Macbeth a fantastic portrayal and a supporting cast making even the secondary characters stick out.Moreover, a visual style and staging that is unique and new, photography that can be liked or disliked but has to be recognized for its technical flawlessness. A soaring score that perfectly encapsulates the horror on screen. Justin Kurzel really comes out as a victor here, because his choices can be appreciated or turned down, but he clearly emerges as a having a true vision. I did not appreciate the depressing bleakness and anxiety he injects here, this is a little too depressing and maddening. It really got dark to points were I didn't even think it to be necessary. I would have left that behind for some more snap to the film, a little more active drama, which the movie has, but unfortunately not enough and regretfully so since those were the parts I really enjoyed.But you won't hear me complaining about this movie anymore since the passion and energy it has, whilst they might require a little too much attention to grasp, are totally deserving of admiration and respect.",7.0,Anonymous,History

How to Make a Bad Film out of a Great Play,"Shakespeare's ""The Tragedy of Macbeth"" should be a superbly cinematic play. It is relatively short by Shakespearean standards, has a straightforward and gripping plot, contains some of Shakespeare's greatest dialogue, includes a strong supernatural element which should stimulate any director's visual imagination and provides two magnificent roles, one male and one female. And yet there has never been any really compelling film version to compare with, say, Olivier's ""Henry V"", the James Mason/Marlon Brando ""Julius Caesar"", Zeffirelli's ""Romeo and Juliet"" or Branagh's ""Much Ado about Nothing"" or ""Hamlet"". Most of the numerous feature films based on the play were made during the silent era; about the only previous sound versions I can think of were Orson Welles' from 1948 and Roman Polanski's from 1971. Olivier had plans to make a filmed ""Macbeth"", but these came to nothing.Justin Kurzel is the latest director to have a go at the ""Scottish Play"". His main ambition seems to have been to root his film in historical reality, although pedantic historical realism is, I always feel, not necessary in Shakespeare. It was certainly not something Shakespeare aimed at himself. The real Macbeth, King of Scotland between 1040 and 1057, would have been an obscure figure in one of the most obscure periods in British history were it not for Shakespeare's play. We do not know a great deal about him, but we know enough to realise that the play is far from historically accurate. It contains a number of anachronisms; at one point King Duncan refers to cannons, which would not be invented for at least another two centuries. Macbeth is the owner of a castle, although castles as we understand the term would not be introduced to Britain until after the Norman Conquest.Kurzel seems to have been trying to recreate the eleventh century; for example Macbeth's home is not a stone-built castle but a mere wooden stockade surrounding a few modest buildings. Any impression of architectural realism, however, is undermined when in later scenes the action takes place against a backdrop of Romanesque (about a hundred years after Macbeth's period) or late Gothic (around four hundred years too late) architecture. He also seems to have interpreted the words ""Dark Ages"" absolutely literally as for most of the time the action is taking place against an atmosphere of Stygian gloom, either at night or (as the three witches would have put it) through ""fog and filthy air"".Now it is certainly true that ""Macbeth"" is a play in which many key scenes do indeed take place at night or in foul weather and in which images of night, darkness, gloom and tempest are used to describe or emphasise the ""dark"" deeds which make up the plot. It is not, however, simply a play about darkness. It is a play about contrasts- light versus dark, good versus evil, the just exercise of power versus the unjust abuse of it. It is also a play about kingship, and in the Middle Ages kings were figures of great power and authority, who would have expressed that power though outward displays of great splendour. It is no accident that Shakespeare often uses the word ""robe"" as a synonym for authority; Macbeth has not only usurped Duncan's throne but has (metaphorically at least) stolen his clothes.It therefore seemed to me that the unrelieved gloom which pervades the film, and the use of such dull, uninteresting costumes, represented failure of visual imagination and a distortion of the themes of the play. There was no attempt to differentiate the good characters from the evil ones, no recognition of the fact that different scenes within the play have differing atmospheres and no visual imagery to suggest that the throne of Scotland was something worth fighting for.The acting was no better than the direction, with the possible exception of Marion Cotillard who did enough to suggest that she might have made a decent Lady Macbeth in a better production than this one. Michael Fassbender in the title role, and some of the other actors, speak their lines far too naturalistically, despite the fact that Shakespeare's plays were written in a formal, poetic blank verse which was never intended to be naturalistic even in the early 1600s. It was also difficult to hear what some of the characters were saying. Special mention- for all the wrong reasons- must go to Jed Kurzel, presumably a relative of the director, for his horrible, whining musical score.When I reviewed Baz Luhrmann's eccentric but nevertheless watchable ""Romeo + Juliet"", I wrote that you can't go far wrong with Shakespeare, at least not if you stick to the major plays. This ""Macbeth"" shows just how wrong I could be. Justin Kurzel has managed to achieve the difficult feat of making a dull, boring film out of one of the greatest plays in the English language. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,History
"A Bloodthirsty Macbeth, Better than you might expect","Viewers are divided about this version of Macbeth. I find it a perfectly acceptable, if not always brilliant take on the great play. Like Roman Polanski's version--still one of the greatest Shakespeare adaptations ever--it's very violent. We are given some backstory, dialog-free, at the start, so the lead couple have a little more context for their feelings and action. Not necessary, but interesting, as is all the film on a visual level. It's grimly, broodingly beautiful pretty much all the time. The locations, largely on the Isle of Skye, can be breathtaking, almost distracting, but never taking away from the relentless machinery of one of the greatest tales of ambition ever written. Shakespeare's language does come through well, more often than not, despite what some reviewers say. I heard passages that were new to me. On the acting front, Michael Fassbender, always dependable for a fully committed, intense performance, is excellent, bringing out Macbeth's tormented inner conflict and underscoring the ironic results of his actions. As Lady Macbeth, Marion Cotillard surprises with her command of Shakespearean English, I barely noticed any accent. And she brings plenty of force to the character's domineering designs. It's possible to see her as the really perpetrator in this rendition. A moody, somewhat evocative music score adds atmosphere along with the striking visuals. Not a great Macbeth, but certainly worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Tragedy,"It seems everybody forgot today what the real tragedy is. In conditions of eternal fear to consult anyone's feelings, the genre of clear tragedy vanishes completely. If only George Martin allows to himself to kill consistently several characters in his books, we can hear yellings like 'he is a slasher!' or 'he kills everybody!'. It's strange for me, as we do not mind of blood rivers and streams in Tarantino's movies. Maybe because it is funny', I guess.Let's refer to an encyclopedia: 'Tragedy - branch of drama that treats in a serious and dignified style the sorrowful or terrible events of private or a public character encountered or caused by a heroic individual and usually leads to the hero's death'. Some Shakespeare's plays are tragedies and they were and will be it, as you might want it or not. If the place and time of the action moved, the meaning will be not changed. As it is important to understand the Chekhov is the great playwright of dramas, the same time it is important to realize why Shakespeare is the great tragedian.If you are not afraid to wade through the wilds of Scottish English with its archaic words, if there is no fear in your brave heart of the Shakespeare's iamb, if you love Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard in particular and British actors in general, so you have to watch this film.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Powerful Performances, but the Story Falls Flat,","Macbeth is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a top notch cast. The highlight is without a doubt Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard in their respective roles, the braveness and naivety conveyed by Fassbender from beginning to end is outstanding and we can see that he put a lot of work and thought in to this character. As for Cotillard, the rage and ambitiousness brought out from her is unique, spellbinding and an absolute spectacle to endure.However, I did find the plot failed to engage me and truly pull me in, it felt as if they were taking so much time trying to stay faithful to Shakespeare that they forget to make this story feel relevant and gratifying for an audience who might not be familiar with this material. It should have been made for a more universal audience.As well as that, a lot of the enotion felt forced, not by the actors, but from the direction, score, cinematography and so on. It felt like they were trying too hard to enforce this on us, rather than merely letting us merely get engrossed in to the drama from the performances, I understand that it is based on a play, but I thought it all could have been done with a little more subtlety.Not breathtaking, but very enjoyable. Great performances throughout, Macbeth is flawed, but I would recommend any fan of Shakespeare or these performers check it out, it is certainly worth your time.A man will stop at nothing to become king, while his wife enforces evil upon him.Best Performance: Marion Cotillard",7.0,Anonymous,History
Among the very best!,"Sustained brooding crushing dread! From the superb cinematography of the perfect landscapes to the masterful performances of the principles this was a truly memorable cinema experience. We can only guess at what Shakespeare's reaction to the 'miracle' medium of cinema would be but I suspect, technology shock aside, he would have been moved by this splendid interpretation of his work. Fassbender and Cotillard are perfect. The decision to use the Black Cuillin on the Isle of Skye is inspired and the landscape becomes a star of the show too rather than just a background. I have witnessed some unfortunate 'adjustments' to Shakespeare's text over the years (principally in the theatre!) but the departures here fell naturally into place and felt by no means awkward. A stunning achievement by all concerned. If this film is not highly feted at awards time I'll eat my tartan!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Hugely disappointing -- for anyone who cares at all about Shakespeare,"After all the really good, not to say rave reviews of this film I, who, like countless millions, think Shakespeare was a marvellous writer, was really looking forward to seeing it. My disappointment was total. Let me say first what I have no problem with. I have no problem with the fact that they obviously had only a small budget. The scenes were almost all shot outdoors, on Rannoch Moor or somewhere similar, in the mist. The costumes were fairly cheap, raggedy looking things, but why not? We are talking about mediaeval barbarians, and Scottish ones at that (no offence intended). I do not even have a problem with them pulling the play around a lot, chopping it up a bit and re-stitching it, provided they keep some sort of sensible narrative going. I do not really have a problem with them adding an extra scene, character, or line here or there, provided they keep the sense going. No, what ruined the film for me, made it very painful to watch from almost the outset and unremittingly thereafter, and what required of me an iron resolution to see the debacle to the end – which I needed to do if I was going to write a review – was the appalling handling, most particularly by the two lead actors, of Shakespeare's lines. Almost all the time Fassbender and Cotillard appeared to have little or no understanding of what the lines actually meant. She delivered most of the lines in a hushed, sibilant whisper, he in an uninvolved monotone. I do not ask that they should perform like Laurence Olivier or some such, but at least they could bring some inflections to the lines, bring out the meaning and make them interesting. These two seemed to have no intention behind their sotto voce recitation other than to get to the end of the sentence as quickly as possible. The fact that there was scope for some decent speaking should have been demonstrated to them so clearly by the excellent performance of their colleague, David Thewlis as Duncan. There is a man who, with his theatrical training, knows exactly how to handle Shakespeare, whether on stage or, as here, in front of the cameras. There were also one or two good performances in smaller parts, particularly from some genuinely Scottish persons, including an elderly actor, whose name I cannot give because I never discovered what the name of his character was. The long and the short of it is that your wonderful film stars are quite hopeless at speaking Shakespeare, particularly if they need, for artistic reasons, to speak quietly. They have not had any training in supporting the voice when speaking quietly, so that it comes out as a low growl, a whisper or a hiss, or a mixture of all three. This was what put me off right at the beginning, the Lady hissing and shushing through lines, which were virtually unintelligible. You get the same sort of thing in the world of music, where pop singers need all manner of electronic support as they alternate between whispering and screaming. A good example of what happens if you try to sing when you do not know how to support the voice was given by Anne Hathaway in the film of Les Miserables. How she could have received any praise for this effort, as opposed to her dramatic scenes, quite baffles me. The last part of her pathetic solo (pathetic in both senses) was no more than a hoarse whisper. She is, of course, not to be blamed for this, as long as neither she nor anyone else thinks of her as a singer. So, with the two lead performances flat as a pancake and largely unintelligible, how can I give the film any stars at all?",1.0,Anonymous,History

Great Cinematography - Hard To Understand Dialogue,"Very good film. After initially not liking it 30 minutes in it quickly grew on me and Marion Cottilard gives a spectacular performance as Lady Macbeth. I think why I initially could not get into the film was the dialogue. I expected the script to be original dialogue but it's all Shakespearian and it's not clearly spoken. I watched it with subtitles and I still only understood half of what was being said but without subtitles I wouldn't of been able to decipher a single word (it definitely helps to know the story of Macbeth already before watching.) The cinematography is gorgeous and one of the top things about the film, especially the final scenes with tons of red smoke rolling in and the falling snow sticking to Michael Fassbenders beard. Fassbender is great as Macbeth and really sells his descent into madness, however he is overshadowed by the superb Marion Cottilard who gives one of her career's best performances. There are some deviations from the original Macbeth plot which I won't go into but I think it gives a refreshing look at one of Shakespeare's greatest plays.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Pretentiously poetic, lacking depth and cold like ice!","This new adaptation of Macbeth got excited me weeks before and when I saw the cast, Fassbender and Cotillard, I got excited even more! Because they are just great and I am a fan of both. However, from the first minute, the film couldn't catch the viewer's attention fully, because it lacks emotion, depth and thrill. This is not an exactly drama film, because there is not much of it. You can see this even in the first battle of the film. A pretentious way of film making just to be seen poetic and artistic. The movie visually looks beautiful at some moments, but those images serve nothing. Fassbender and Cotillard make us surprised by their ""low key"" performances, so please don't expect any kind of tour-de-force acting from them. If you do, you are seriously disappointed. In the film, there is no character depth at all and the dramatization of the events was totally ineffective. For example, a character is portrayed evil, but you have no idea or clue why he or she is evil? A character is portrayed brave, but you have no idea, why he is such a brave man? It is mostly because there is no tension which should increase gradually like Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece Throne of Blood. As expected, this is not a ""war"" film. If you expect a Kingdom of Heaven like film, then you are seriously disappointed. I had not any problem with unusual monologues/dialogs in the film, but some may find it hard to follow. It doesn't ruin the reality of the film which is a success. Especially, in the second act, the film becomes more pretentious with the over the top and ""poetic"" visuals and just leaves you with no emotion.

Flowery words of bloody battlefield and treacherous kingship.,"Shakespeare is not the easiest material to translate to silver screen, it's quite complicated even for native speaker and the narrative is told mostly on poetry. Luckily for Macbeth, the movie has talented cast and astounding visual to present a tale of treachery. It's fluid in delivery, varied in meaning and the contrast of sultry voice and brutal war game is beautifully appealing.First and foremost, it's a gorgeous display throughout. There are not many movies which shift between styles so easily, the colors look vivid even in the most morbid events. This also works in a continuous narrative, akin to flipping across chapters as the tint alters from dawn till dusk. The view of carnage is also shown in its fullness yet lacking no delicate effort.Michael Fassbender as Macbeth is probably the best lead one could hope for. There are glints of his Spartan time, although he doesn't falter when the movie demands an elegant banter. The acting is definitely different that most, it's an acquired taste as characters tell their pleas with underlying or double meaning. This is certainly not the kind of straight full blown carnage typical war movies would offer.While it has its perks of being artistic, it can be unapproachable even if there's attempt to make it the contrary. The dialogues are expectedly ancient, some words might have different delivery than we have today. Furthermore, the delivery itself is often either too rapid or too quiet, maybe both at the same time. Alas, this can be remedied by investing in subtitles. As it deals with heavy narrative the pace can stutter to make room for admittedly poetic exclamation.Macbeth is certainly vibrant in his vainglory, as his tragic rise is witnessed in grand visual, yet the archaic style might prove repelling for those unaccustomed to it.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A nightmare tale that will be every English professors dream come true,"'What is done, is done.' -Lady MacbethWalking into the cinema... How does Shakespeare continue to dominate cinema? A language of yesteryear and by- gone cultures, but the timelessness of his work continues to show how little mankind has changed over the years. The question is can Michael Fassbender carry the mantle of the greats who have taken on this role in the past?Overall Rating: 3 stars Cinematic rating: 4 stars Bigger questions rating: 3 starsDo you remember your English Literature class and the infamous line, 'Out, damned spot?' Lady Macbeth's struggle with guilt and regret that epitomises the narrative of Shakespeare's drama. Macbeth is a classic storyline that involves revenge, murder, mental illness and betrayal. For those who may have missed that week on The Bard's play, here is a basic summery. The central character Macbeth (Michael Fassbender) is a duke of Scotland and an accomplished leader of men on the battlefield. After a key victory for his king and country, he receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he would become King of Scotland. During the celebration of his victory, he remains consumed by this vision and eventually conspires with his wife (Marion Cotillard) to make this vision a reality. Their plot leads to a series of events that end with the assassination of the king and Macbeth's eventual ascension to the throne. Throughout the transition to kingship, Macbeth and his lady suffer through the mental anguish of their evil choices that brought them to power. Ultimately showing that what is done in secret will eventually be exposed.Michael Fassbender plays one of the most bloody and visceral of Shakespeare's theatrical creations and is exceptionally tantalising in the role. His portrayal as the tragic king is mesmerising. He effectively leads this film with the support of an incredible cast that delivers on the expectation of this timeless tale. Director Justin Kurzel (The King's Speech) provides a modern spin on this classic tale of murder and deception. Even though the slow motion sequences do become tiresome, over all, he utilises the Scottish landscape as another character to capture the look and feel of horror that comes from this story of betrayal. The material and the talent provide the needed lift for this murky journey into the depths of human emotion. For those who are not familiar with this time-honoured story, be aware that Macbeth is exceptionally violent and contains disturbing themes.The biggest challenge for this film will be breaking out of the English department at the local university and into the hearts of the general populace. It might seem sacrilegious to challenge the usage of this classic dialect, but know that the critique is not of the content of the script. The challenge is found in modern ears. People have difficulty understanding this bygone era's application of the English language. The Shakespearean wording is for the classically trained in theatrical productions, but makes for a difficult cinematic experience. Watching this drama gave off the feeling of 'enjoy it, because it is good for you. Whenever something has the 'it is good for you' label, it tends to be difficult to swallow. Albeit it is beautifully adapted for the silver screen, it might be a stretch for people to understand or enjoy the experience. Not to be misunderstood, this film was entertaining and faithful to the source material, but lacks enough of a modern spin to connect with modern audiences.Leaving the cinema... To appreciate the classic tale, it is worth knowing the story prior to entering the theatre. For the Shakespeare purists, this will be satisfying, but for the general audiences this will be hard to understand.REEL DIALOGUE: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1.

A Modern Take but still with enough originality to make it work,"Michael Fassbender plays the mentally deteriorating Thane of Glamis, who is told by three witches that his destiny lies in becoming the Scottish King, in Shakespeare's classic play of corruption, greed and blood letting. Marion Cotillard plays his wife the Lady Macbeth in a role where she puts in a fair amount of passion.This is directed by the extremely talented – and original – Justin Kurzel – who brought us 'The Snowtown Murders'. The battle scenes are a work of art and the themes of stylish horror (almost) are kept going through out the film. The plays real strengths though are the verse in which it is delivered and so Shakespeare purists will not be pleased with some of the treatment seeing 'The Bard' as sacred. I was only let down by the whispered lines that I had to strain to hear. The acting though was all excellent and almost painful to watch– which is the point here.It is though not 'easy watching' and requires full commitment.

"great costumes and cinematography, OK/good performances by the lead actors and soundtrack, lack of a better understanding of the plot","Having never watched the play by Shakespeare, I had high expectations for the film adaptation of such a famous and acclaimed piece of art. I was immediately impressed by the beautifully somber photography, the enchanted Scottish landscapes and the brutality of the fights. However a major unexpected hurdle awaited me: without subtitles, a difficult whispered diction and a strong accent in a long-gone form of English, I found myself often lost in the dialogues, which distracted me from following the course of the plot.

The best film I have ever seen,"What is there to say about Justin Kurzel's MACBETH? I have adored this film for years ever since I first saw it in the cinema.The performances, the visual use of red throughout the story, the music. There isn't a film more beautiful than this one.Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard are true forces to be reckoned with. Easily the best performance I've seen from both actors.This film has inspired me to go and watch every single adaptation and incarnation of MACBETH I can get my hands on. As well as read the text, which makes you appreciate the films more. This film has inspired me to have a desire to make my own version of Macbeth.There are so many ways to tell this story, as evidence by all of the different artistic mediums that have been used over the years to do just that.This is a beautiful story, a beautiful film, and one I truly hope will go down with the classics.If anybody that ever worked on this film ever reads this.

Blisteringly Nightmarish,"Some say the movie with the Mother of all twists is The Sixth Sense (1999). Then the Father of them all must be William Shakespeare's Macbeth, written way way back in 1606. It didn't just have one monumental twist, it had three. This is my favorite cautionary tale of how the love for power can corrupt the most righteous person. The play has many visceral layers and each time I teach it in schools, I discover something frightfully new. As I plumped the depths of murky hell, I gratefully clawed back into the light. This is one of the world's best stories and I sometimes feel it is the blueprint for telling all great stories. But do we need yet another film adaptation? Do we need to wake Shakespeare up from his eternal rest for this? O for Goodnesse sake, quake thee absolute yea! (But there are some caveats. Later on that)Australian director Justin Kurzel's vision for Macbeth is one of tone and mood. He has distilled the essence of Shakespeare's most enacted play in any form and translated onto the big screen with a huge soundscape and an implosion of monochromatic colours. If you want to know how a waking nightmare feels like this is it. Watching this feels like taking a stroll in hell. Every frame is carefully shot to illustrate a paean of pain and madness. Kurzel knows the story all would know, so narratively he is even handed and allowed the nightmarish tale to unfold itself. Under his unique vision there is no gloss, nothing and no one is romanticized, all the characters are distilled to a single motivation, an entity resigned to the supernatural forces at play. Everyone seems resigned to play out the game, no one wants to break out of their state. The theme of puppets and the puppeteers comes to the fore like a stab to the heart. I was glad the hellish journey to hell was over but I was utterly lost why I felt like I needed to stab something (I did stab something after that - a piece of chicken chop. Thankfully not the two idiotic PRC women sitting behind me).The performances by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard are frightfully spellbinding. Their soliloquies performed with venomous aplomb. Making us fall in love with Shakespeare's exquisite turns in phrases is not Kurzel's aim. He was more intent on making the madness real for us. Macbeth's despairing complaint about life: "" ... it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing"" hits a spot in my heart I never thought existed, and Lady Macbeth's painful ""Out, damn'd spot! Out, I say!"" is poignant and as the shot pulls out we actually see who she is lamenting to. My heart broke.Kurzel's Macbeth though blisteringly visceral and gut-twisting in its vision, doesn't say anything new or reward the faithful. It is an unwavering and outstanding adaptation, but unlike Kurosawa's Throne of Blood (1953) and Vishal Bhardwaj's Maqbool (2007), it doesn't breathe new life into the tale. 30 minutes in you will already know what you will get: an unsentimental retelling of an old favorite. It does tweak a few scenes remarkably well like how the film opens and how its relevance is made so pronounced through Lady Macbeth's final soliloquy. I particularly also enjoyed the three witches scenes which play up the nightmare angle. Overall, the film is intense and depressing to a fault, unapologetically so. I am grateful for the moody experience but I wouldn't want to relive it. One visit to the murky depths of hell is enough to last a lifetime.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Scottish Play reduced to a garbled Glaurfest,"Sadly, this film is a real pig's breakfast - Noggin the Nog meets Once Upon a Time in the West!The scenery is bleakly magnificent, but Kurzel succeeds in making it look more like a wet weekend in the Greenland of Erik the Red than 11th Century Scotland. Battles take the form of mud-wrestling with daggers in Braveheart warpaint. Michael Fassbender and most of the rest of the cast toy with versions of mumbled Lowland demotic. Sadly, nobody seems to have told Marion Cotillard, who delivers her lines theatrically in mannered Shakespearean English, hurriedly gabbling her way through her first crucial scene as if she were worried about missing her bus. Sean Harris seems to base his performance as Macduff on the insight that his character's name rhymes with gruff.As a mere thane, Macbeth appears to live in a flimsy shanty town in the middle of a Highland peat bog. After he becomes king, he and his missus are able to move into an elegant castle in the high Norman style. 'More than enough motive for murder there I would have thought.On the positive side, Lynn Kennedy, Kayla Fallon, Seylan Baxter and Amber Rissmann make a good job of the weird sisters, steering well clear of cackling crone clichés. And David Hayman puts in a good performance as Lennox, a man careful to stay on the right side of power.But overall, it's a big disappointment. Orson Welles and Akira Kurosawa have both made much better jobs of filming the Scottish play.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Incredibly Unique,This version of Macbeth is is going to be shown in high schools for the next 20 years. Visually very pleasing and true to Shakespeare's play. I don't think it was received well in theatres because it's literally read like it just came out of a 10th grade English textbook. But there's no getting around that this is one of the prettiest movies I've ever seen. Casting was also spot on considering every second felt super spooky.

Makes The Last Kingdom seem brilliant,"Shakespearian tragedy is where a character, so full of potential, makes a bad decision and their life falls apart from then on. The audience feels so upset by the waste of that potential. This film is a Shakespearian tragedy on an epic scale.For those expecting a modern version of Polanski's classic, you'll be sorely disappointed. Polanski it is not. The battle scenes are poor versions of the series Spartacus, the actors mumble their way through, delivering in a monotone, and they have changed the story so much, it is pretentious to call the film Macbeth. I didn't think much of The Last Kingdom but this film makes that series look brilliant. Even Polanski's 1970s special effects with the dagger are way better than in this 2015 production.Some of the scenery is spectacular but that's about it.

Intense,"This film tells the story of a noble Thane in Scotland, who is told by three witches that he will become the king of Scotland. He embarks on a journey to make the prophecy come true, shedding tears and blood along the way.I have to say this is a very good adaptation of Macbeth. The lines are original Shakespearean lines, delivered with conviction by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, who are both interestingly not Scottish or even British. The film emanates intensity throughout, because of the intended battle scene at the beginning, followed by the gripping delivery of the plot. The final scene is in an environment of reddish dust, making it so intense and stylish. I enjoyed watching it.",,Anonymous,History
Good adaptation of Shakespeare's famous play,"William Shakespeare's classic tale of ambition, treachery, guilt and revenge. MacBeth, the Thane of Glamis, receives a series of predictions from three witches. One is that he will be Thane of Cawdor and another is that he will be King of Scotland. When he is elevated to Thane of Cawdor he starts to think that their predictions have some merit. Encouraged by Lady MacBeth he murders the current King, Duncan, and is made the new King. This power emboldens him, resulting in a murderous purging of the Kingdom of anyone who may be a threat to him. Meanwhile the opposition forces are beginning to gather...A good adaptation of the classic play. Dark, haunting and reasonably fast-paced - Hardly the recitals that sometimes pass for Shakespeare-based movies. Good production values too.Great work by Michael Fassbender in the lead role. Solid support from Marion Cotillard as Lady MacBeth, Sean Harris as Macduff, Paddy Considine as Banquo and David Thewless as Duncan. Elizabeth Debicki also appears, as Lady Macduff, but does not have much screen time.On the negative side, there is an element of style over substance to the movie. The director tries too hard to be ""arty"" - jarring editing, slow motion shots, odd settings - and this does detract from the quality of the movie a bit.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Beautiful, brazen and atmospheric",The cinematography was excellent and I wasn't surprised to see it had won an award for it. Fassbender was great as the maddened and mental Macbeth. The music knew when to stop and when to play to create an aire of atmosphere of any kind. The cinematography and costume design sucked you in as if you were there you I the rugged Scotland.

Less than the sum of its parts,"The story of Macbeth is brilliant, by far my favorite of Shakespeare's plays. The lines, the dialogue and soliloquies are also top notch. Polanski's Macbeth is one of my favorite films, if not my all time favorite.The cinematography here is amazing. The soundtrack is wonderful (I bought it). The scenes are so beautiful; the action is so awesome, thrilling yet artful. The casting is also very good.All the components are great, all the ingredients are there, but the film is less than the sum of its parts.The biggest flaw is the mumbling and inaudible/unintelligible parts (I watched the film with English subtitles for friends that struggled with Early Modern English), but that's not why the film is merely good. Improve the quality of the speech and it's still less than the sum of its parts.The film is not thrilling, not haunting, not exciting. It's too theatrical. It cannot escape comparisons with Polanski's film, which felt like a psychological horror film.The acting feels theatrical and feels fake - you're watching someone playing a part rather than a king struggling with his thoughts. The delivery of the lines feels like the actors memorized the lines very well, but not for a moment did I feel that these are Medieval-era Scots that actually speak like that.I feel that this could've been a great movie had it had another story altogether. The story of Macbeth, normally a positive, ruined this film's potential, with lines and language that killed the realness of the acting and the story having no surprise to most people. All the ingredients (except the story) were there for a great medieval film instead of yet another Macbeth interpretation.",7.0,Anonymous,History
a film soaked in blood and the wonders of Fassbender and Cotillard,"The things that Justin Kurzwel's new film of Shakespeare's Macbeth are the sense of place that feels so authentic as to bordering on documentary-level, which is then off-set by the surreal, hellish sense of color (various shades of red make this so vivid as to be piercing to the senses at times), and then the performances, which are authentic to the point of feeling like these actors could leap off the screen.Surely if you haven't seen the adaptations by Welles or Polanski, or still the best Kurosawa's Throne of Blood, see those first. But it was playing near me in the city, it has Michael Fassbender digging so deeply as well as Marion Cotillard in the titular role and Lady Macbeth respectively that you feel like they almost forget they're acting in these parts, and thus it was a foregone conclusion to see it (David Thewlis also has a few good scenes as a certain obstacle in Macbeth's path).Luckily it's directed and presented with a firm degree of darkness and intensity, and while it may be SO much of a dirge into the dirt and heavy Scottish accents that you'll pray to get sunshine outside the theater, it's some strong art.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Cinematography kills and resurrects you,"As a quick way to revise texts, I resort to films. That was wholly my intention when my roomies and I gathered around for a late night show of Justin Kurzel's Macbeth which was released in 2015 starring Michael Fassbender and Marion Cortillard. We had our shares of Polanski's Macbeth, Kurosawa's Throne of Blood and our very own Vishal Bharadwaj's Maqbool, so it was hardly expected that a newbie director would match any of the masterpieces above.But what followed in the next two hours shook us to our core. Kurzel's Macbeth transported us into a lawless and savage Scotland, decorated with impeccable scenes of nature's wrath. His Macbeth became a symbol of the worst of humanity. Kurzel adapted his own screenplay and his renditions of the death of Macduff's children and wife left me utterly speechless. A raw, gritty and magnificent Fassbender accompanied by the equally heartless Cortillard as Lady Macbeth made us grab our hearts throughout the entire show. There were instances and scenes I could not forget long after the final shot was seen. This experience scarred me and left me intensely emotional which is what Shakespeare's plays are all about.Justin Kurzel, take a bow",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Pretentious, Unbearable","I simply don't have the words to describe the depths of pretentiousness and sheer purposeless-weirdness that this movie sinks to.EVERY interaction between EVERY character in EVERY scene is made into a SENSUAL act. Macbeth meets the witches? Let's make it SENSUAL, and have one of the witches PUT HER ARMS AROUND MACBETH AND SPEAK TO HIM WITH HER FACE THREE INCHES FROM HIS AS IF THEY'RE FREAKING PASSIONATE LOVERS! (This was probably the most bizarre bit of direction given by J Kurzel in a movie full of bizarre bits of direction.) Macbeth murders Duncan? Oh yeah, let's make it SENSUAL. Oh and good luck understanding any of the mumble-whispered dialog. I guess to have the actors at the volume people normally speak at in conversation wouldn't be SENSUAL enough. Oy.Justin Kurzel, my god, what in the world were you thinking?

"Fassbender and Cotillard are divine in an elegant, poetic, somber adaptation","Now, call me uncultured or whatever, but I have never seen or read the actual play. I'm of course familiar with many of the plot elements of it, to the point that I knew where much of the film would go. Saying that however, I didn't expect such a melancholy, quiet film. I had especially heard much about Cotillard's portrayal of Lady Macbeth and how she did a different take on it. First of all, I would really appreciate if those who are very familiar with the play would tell me how faithful this adaptation is and how different the portrayals and everything are.While I've always had somewhat of a problem with Shakespearean adaptations in terms of the prose, I found that this film's reliance on its visuals really compliment the story and its themes and really brought a perspective that I wasn't really expecting. It has a lot of style, but I think it worked well as it did. The cinematography and directing here are really strong, and there's such a firm grasp on every aspect of the film. Did it leave me cold? Somewhat, but I expected it to. I think what really helps it aren't just its technical aspects, but the really fantastic performances by Fassbender and Cotillard. It seems like both performances have been very divisive on here (again, I would appreciate if anyone wanted to elaborate or talk about why they liked or disliked them), but I thought both stayed in the vein of the film's poetic tone. I certainly do understand if, due to the film's extremely low-key approach, it may have been underwhelming. I personally thought both actors gave powerful, intense performances in the different way that one would be accustomed to.I wouldn't say I've seen countless of Shakespeare adaptations, but from the ones I have I would say this is my favorite. Certainly worth it for the acting.",,Anonymous,History
A Great but Difficult to Follow Plot and some Great Acting,"Macbeth is based off of the William Shakespeare play under the same title and follows a knight called Macbeth who receives a prophecy that one day he will be king of Scotland. He eventually becomes tired of waiting and sets out to murder the king and succeed him, and ultimately faces both the rewards and consequences for his actions.I love the story of Macbeth. I think that the plot is really good. It's interesting and it could be awesome if done right. Unfortunately I'm not a fan of Shakespeare, or at least how he writes. His stories are interesting, but when you can't understand a single word it makes it hard to truly appreciate how good his plays are. I've been wanting a Shakespeare movie adaptation with more modernized language, and unfortunately this wasn't the one. It keeps the same dialogue as before, and thus I ended up relying almost completely on visuals and the fact that I read the book and had what happened explained to me every two pages. If I hadn't had that I wouldn't have enjoyed this movie at all most likely.The characters are decent. Again, it's hard to understand what their saying, but if you do there's a lot of internal conflict going on, and it is pretty cool actually, particularly in the character of Macbeth. One thing that I especially liked about the movie was the acting. Michael Fassbender was good for the first and third act, but for the second he was phenomenal, especially in a particular scene in a dining room. I knew Fassbender was a good actor, but I've never seen him in any performance where he's knocked it out of the park as well as he did here. Unfortunately he switches right back to just good acting for the third act, but his character goes from confident to scared to a ""Well, I made it this far, guess I might as well"" kind of character throughout the movie, so he loses that sort of insanity at the end that he pulled off so well.Overall Macbeth is just decent. The plot is great but poorly presented, and Michael Fassbender does a fantastic job for about 1/3 of this movie. He's really the only redeeming quality of this movie, other than the visual aspect, which was quite good too. The first hour is pretty slow too, and it takes a while for the story to pick up. In the end I wouldn't really recommend this movie, but it definitely wasn't bad.",6.0,Anonymous,History

SHAKESPEARE & MUD MIX...!,"2015 brought us another retelling of Shakespeare's tragedy this time starring Oscar nominee Michael Fassbender playing the doomed Scot w/his lady in waiting, Oscar winner Marion Cotillard, who have to pay the piper after Fassbender has murdered his King, David Thewlis. Playing closer to Roman Polanski's bloody take from the early 70's (which he made after his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was murdered by Manson's family, one of which is getting paroled, talk about timely!) mixed w/a smattering of Mel Gibson's Braveheart makes for a good, solid take on the material but since we have the pillars of Polanski's & the recent Oscar nominated Denzel Washington/Joel Coen attempt (I also have a soft spot for Orson Welles' take from the 50's), this version is good but not especially memorable.

Shakespeare Fan,"It amazes me how other reviewers even bothered to write a review and gave this a one star rating, when their understanding of cinematography, acting is obviously limited and their appreciation of Shakespeare nil.
To think they expected an action packed Hollywood action film with modern language would be developed from Shakespeare is like turning Thomas the Tank Engine into Thomas Pink Convertable. Of course this could be done in Hollywood, but it would be a comedy.
This is a 'tragedy' and once that's realised, the mood of the play will be understood.
I have never had a problem with understanding Shakespeare and have always appreciated and found it challenging to read into its meaning.
The movie is fabulous and should be looked at what it represents and for what it is and not for what people think it should be.
Others have appreciated it and if there were problems with understanding, they turned on the subtitles... even then you will need to read deeper to understand their words in modern English.

This is one.If you like your poetry declaimed by a still figure, albeit with facial contortions and an occasional fondle, then you will love this. If you either enjoy theatrical performance or cinematic epic, this is not going to excite you.Macbeth is a serious tragedy. It confronts issues such as anxiety, ambition, political intrigue, the corruptive nature of power, consequence, temptation, equivocation, the divinity of legitimate kings and so on.

The Blood Soaked Tapestry of Macbeth,"Michael Fassbender can play any role you give him. Honest. 'Macbeth' is just further proof of that. Based on Shakespeare's play of the same name, 'Macbeth' is the tale of a man consumed by greed and power who murders his own king so that he can claim the throne for himself.'Macbeth' is not my type of film and yet I found myself won over, in spite of its notable pacing issues which drastically slow the film down in its second act. It's the high calibre of acting that works so well here. Fassbender consumes himself in the role and equally impressive is Marion Cotillard who plays his wife. Watching them hatch their plot and crumble when it fails is riveting. There are even a couple of bloody battles that bookend the film and for my money are worth the price of admission alone.Still I haven't mentioned the powerful poetic dialogue. Yes it is Shakespearean dialect and by its very nature is hard to understand and grasp at times. But in a strange way that makes it all the more interesting to watch and given time it grows on you and you come to appreciate the film for everything that it does right. Is this a faithful adaptation? Having had no previous knowledge about the play I could not say. Yet I know it's a fine and well-crafted film.'Macbeth' is a dark tale and as such the score in the film reflects that. Jed Kurzel brings a sad and symbolic soundtrack that signifies what power does to men and how it turns what was once good and pure into evil. From a visual standpoint 'Macbeth' is a sure fire winner. It possesses a cinematic beauty to it, one that the medium of television would be unable to bring forward.'Macbeth' is a poignant tale of a good man gone evil. If the dialogue is hard to understand at times and the pacing brings up issues it rarely matters; because the film is far often than not engrossing and Fassbender does justice to the source material.

It was okay.,"Watching the 2015 film adaptation of 'Macbeth' was something I was looking forward to. The play has been adapted successfully for film before by directors such as Orson Welles, Roman Polanski, and Akira Kurosawa. The talented cast, including Marion Cottilard, Michael Fassbender, David Thewlis, and Sean Harris, added to my anticipation.The film received decent reviews, but I had doubts because it was directed by Justin Kurzel, who had previously directed the disappointing 'Assassin's Creed.' However, 'Macbeth' surpassed my expectations in some ways, though it is not the definitive version of the play and has its flaws.The film's visuals are grandiose and atmospheric, with great photography. The music is haunting, and the action is both exciting and harrowing. However, the dialogue can be difficult to understand at times, and the overuse of slow-motion can be distracting. Some cuts and omissions also affect the storytelling, making the plot less coherent.This adaptation has some interesting changes, such as the portrayal of the witches and Lady Macbeth's character. The performances are also great, with Fassbender and Cottilard being especially impressive.Overall, while there are better adaptations of 'Macbeth, ' this film is still well done and worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,History
What went wrong?,"Like everybody else,I went to the theater with high expectations for this movie!...and we all know what happens when we have high expectations,don't we? It went through the whole film as a phony imitation of what it could have been if,well intended,or wanted by the director.I can't claim that I am an expert in the old bard's plays-English is not my first language,and I am a Latin American girl,saying this to imply my lack of sound knowledge in Sheakespeare's plays.But I do love films,and been seeing them for almost 60 years now.That would count,at least for me,in being moved by some quality work.

Don't wait till tomorrow or tomorrow--see superb acting and breathtaking visuals NOW.,"""They say blood will have blood."" MacbethAny production of Shakespeare's Macbeth will ring with that bloody certainty, and contemporary ISIS-like dictatorships confirm that what begins with violence will end with it. Director Justin Kurzei has made a tragedy known by most high school students as real as any battle scene they have seen on YouTube.Visually this Macbeth is dark and smoky outside so that villains like Macbeth (Michael Fassbender) and Lady Macbeth (Marion Cotillard) emerge with hell or at least be comfortable with its worldly manifestations in fear and blood, red and gray. Equally stark are the interiors, dark and minimalist to convey hollow temporary power. Visually the film is a creative take that fully uses cinematographer Adam Arkapaw's considerable talents.As for the bard's language, no one can improve on it, and Kurzei pares enough of it away to keep the essential speeches intact while lamentably to allow the visual to dominate. Fassbender is often in close up speaking quietly but with eerie nuance, such that I have a new appreciation for the character's poetic and tragic nature, a companion appreciation to my two favorite interpretations by Orson Welles and Kenneth Branagh. The way Fassbender slowly moans the iconic Tomorrow speech is as if I had not heard it before. His measured, low volume is just right for the melancholic doom of the sentiment.While I admired Sarah Paulson's wicked Mistress Epps in Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave, no facsimile can ever approach the insidious charm of Lady Macbeth. Marion Cotillard plays an effective power broker cum sexual temptress, a powerful combo for such an attractive and talented actress.Notice Lady Macbeth's sexual ministrations while Macbeth gives forth poetically. The irony of these two murderers making love while he rhapsodizes is a rich new take on an ancient Clinton motif, where Hillary could be thought of as a non-violent manipulator and Bill, well, a political and sexual Olympian.Macbeth is a visually stunning work whose elimination of swaths of dialogue to fit the battlefield scenes bothers me a bit. Equally so, placing Lady Macbeth at scenes such as Lady Macduff (Elizabeth Debicki) and her children being burned at the stake takes too much license for creative license.In the end, it's the bard's words that anchor any interpretation:""Life's but a walking shadow. Honor. Love. Friends. But in there's death. Curses."" Macbeth",,Anonymous,History
Music is The Champion,"The best thing about this movie is the music. It brought a great enthusiasm to me while trying hard to stay focus with its rather slow pace.

The war scene is made in slow motion, made me remember that part of Kung Fu Hustle. Why did you do this? Is there any particular reason? I expect it to be epic. Because I understand why Kung Fu Hustle did the slow motion, for the movement in Kung Fu is so fast. Maybe they tried to give the audiences a moment to capture every movement better.I really didn't get the conversation between King Duncan and his staff while Macbeth and the other are busy killing in the field. Honestly, I haven't read Macbeth yet.

It's dark, gory and pretty artsy as well, which adds to this excellent adaptation of a Shakespeare classic. If there was one thing negative to point out it is that the middle act does take sometime to get over and a few scenes which feature are pretty unnecessary. But with that said, the beginning and end are truly amazing and heart racing.Whilst adapting Shakespeare novels now seems overdone and clichéd l, this is an essential retelling that will go down as a classic.

You might get very lost,"I've never been much of a fan of Shakespeare, but then I haven't read or seen any of it since I last studied English literature about four years ago, so I'm willing to assume for now that it's because I couldn't understand what anyone was saying half the time.However, I have a bit of a soft spot for Macbeth, because for me, it was the obligatory Shakespeare play everyone in England has to study at least one of in their GCSE's, And at that point, understanding what everyone was saying was kind of essential, so our teacher actually bothered to explain it. And this had also just come out at the start of the school year, so we had a school trip to see it.All I really remember thinking about it at the time is that it was giving my eyes heaven, and that still holds true, this film is freaking gorgeous. That's easily the best thing about it, along with the soundtrack, because everything else is just fine to me.For a story that's probably over 400 years old, they really didn't change...well, anything. Like, nothing at all. Which kind of sucks because other than the cinematography, there's nothing all that special here. All the performances are good, don't get me wrong, but they don't add anything new to this story that's been told and retold and retold again and redone and revamped and remodeled and just generally ""re""-d for four centuries, so it feels a little unnecessary.This is in addition to the fact that the script is more or less completely faithful to the play as well, so yep, everyone talks in old English that you have a more than decent chance of being completely left in the dust by, and I'm not sure if the only reason I wasn't was because I've read and analysed those monologues again and again and again in the past.I'd never say the core story of Macbeth is bad, because that's just ludicrous, it's survived this long for a reason, but the occasional monologue or piece of dialogue does sound far too over-dramatic these days, and even if it didn't, I'll say it again: it's been four hundred years since this was written, and adding nothing but a new opening scene that shows Macbeth having a child that died in infancy that ultimately changes nothing in the rest of the film is not going to wow me very much.If you're a huge Shakespeare nut, then you might appreciate having an adaptation as faithful as this, assuming that none of the other ones are to such an extent, but for me, while I enjoyed the nostalgia, I don't think I'm ever going to watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,History

That figures.For my sins, I actually did nod off a couple of times during the screening of this drivel. Couldn't agree more with the comments regarding the belches of grumbled, mumbled dialogue that frothed like a soiled nappy from those poor unfortunates.Did anyone else feel that this painful tripe was so transparent in it's futile attempt to be 'trendy' and deeply significant?Artistically, (and I use that word loosely), it was a mismatch of sound and vision - from the silly pretend blood daubing virtually every male forehead, to the mistake of purchasing too much quilted material by the costume department.On a plus side, it would make a great stomping ground for male grooming products. The ultra close-ups of a male beard actually growing were unsurpassed.Throw a couple more shrimps into the cauldron, Bruce.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Watchable,"Blood and guts version of the Scottish play. The best features are visual, with good use made of the lowering Scottish countryside (though some scenes are filmed in Northern England). Fassbender is a suitably macho Macbeth, but handles the introspection well. Marion Cotillard does well enough but does not dominate the film enough - probably not her fault.The witches, all too easily a laughable aspect, are presented effectively with the addition of an eerie child. Difficult to understand large parts of the text due to the large variety of accents and intonations on display. The final scenes are well staged, and the interpolated opening scene helps makes sense of the rest of the story. Worth watching as an adaptation, but there are better ones available on film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Physical presence over spiritual drama,"Justin Kurtzel, the Australian director of Snowtown, tries to predetermine the Macbeths' unassuagable grief for a dead child becoming vaulting ambition, with them burying a dead child at the solemn start of the film, without embedding this in the drama. Macbeth goes onto burn later on McDuff's children and wife with his own hands. Fassbender and Cotillard are stars with charisma on screen,there are many close ups of their sexual chemistry.The Scottish landscape is a key player in this moody drama, one of harsh exteriors,foggy,cold,bleak,dank, containing the shimmer of violence. This approach is very much an invention, cutting the text to 25%.Macbeth and Banquo encounter 3 witches after putting down the uprising against Duncan (Thewlis),who predict that Macbeth will become King. The Macbeths decide to murder Duncan. Cotillard's Lady Macbeth is played with reigned-in delicacy, invoking spirits before candle-lit pictures, she seems to be withdrawn., sidelined. The battle scenes are like a slowed-down slaughterhouse ( a nod to Welles's Chimes at Midnight?) with hack-and-slash, interspersed with a roaring tumult. The supernatural elements are down-played, so the witches are very real, appearing out of the mist or as quiet observers at a funeral or appearing at moments of crisis; similarly the spectral dagger is held by the dead boy from the battlefield, who is swallowed by the smoke. Banquo's ghost is a living presence at the banquet among the guests.Kurtzel gets the Scottish-accented cast to mutter rather than declaim, he wants the verse to arise out of the context it is in. But what is apparent is that the meaning of the verse is lost in the fog of the film, whose visuals are superb:the camera sways, as if blown by the wind in an unstable world. If you are aware of the Welles's version or Polanki's, you will feel sorely let down. Usually verse taps into the inner lives of the characters, as it maintains the thrilling momentum, but here you get Fassbender reaching for the gestures of sociopathy, giggling, brooding,grinning. Go with a good memory of the text or you will be confused what they are saying. That could send you to sleep.

loved it,"""Macbeth"" storms onto the screen with a 7/10 rating, and it's evident you found this adaptation to your liking. Michael Fassbender's performance as the titular character is a tour de force, portraying the descent into madness with chilling intensity. The film's editing, while occasionally disorienting, mirrors the psychological unraveling of its characters. The strength lies in its grim and atmospheric cinematography, painting a haunting portrait of the Scottish Highlands. The weakness, however, may be in its pacing, which, at times, feels as slow as Macbeth's moral decay. The music underscores the mounting tension, enhancing the film's ominous atmosphere. This rendition of the timeless tale of ambition and guilt conveys its message of the corrupting influence of power effectively.

Shakespeare En Plein Air,"Australian director Justin Kurzel directs Shakespeare's magnificent drama (as adapted for the screen by Jacob Koskoff, Michael Lesslie, and Todd Louiso), moves the action outside of the claustrophobia of a stage castle and into the breathtaking majesty of the land of Scotland and the result is an epic film populated with some of our finest actors of the day who are able to deliver Shakespearean poetry with the finest seasoned Shakespeare actors of the day. The result is a dark look at a story we all know and the changes in scenery create a dramatic turn of stance in the way we interpret Shakespeare's brilliant drama.Brief synopsis: 'Macbeth, the Thane of Glamis, receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders his king and takes the throne for himself.' What this quick dollop of a plot synopsis fails to render is the extraordinary altered viewpoint that Macbeth is not simply a ruthless power hungry man driven by his equally power obsessed wife, but instead is a man whose battle time and the mass killings for which he is responsible have created a PTSD personality change that is gripping and very moving to watch his descent into his fate.Michael Fassbender continues to grow and impress as one of our finest actors of the time and he delivers the poetry of Shakespeare with eloquent and raw dignity. Likewise, Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth is inordinately impressive – a very fine portrayal by an exceptionally gifted actress. The cast is uniformly fine – Paddy Considine as Banquo, Brian Nickels as the Thane of Cawdor, Malcolm as portrayed by Jack Reynor, David Thwelis as Duncan, Sean Harris as Macduff, et al. The glorious cinematography is by Adam Arkapaw and the eerie musical score is by the director's brother, Jed Kurzel. The only criticism this viewer has is the need for subtitles in order to hear and understand the perfection of Shakespeare's words. This likely is the reason this film did not do well in theaters. It should have been considered in almost every category for Oscars and it's omission points out the sad state of all award consideration. Perhaps 'Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow...' A wholly brilliant film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Not enjoyable,"So true to the actual text, this was a harsh reminder of how difficult and almost unfathomable Shakespearean English was for me.

A complete waste of time,"MACBETH is one of my very favourite Shakespeare plays. It has all of the gruesome violence and tragic outcomes that one expects from a Shakespeare tragedy, and there are not one but two outstanding movie adaptations of the play that have gone down in history as classics (Kurosawa's THRONE OF BLOOD and Polanski's MACBETH). The good thing about Shakespeare is that he always lends himself well to new adaptations of his work, so I was intrigued by this new, low key effort.I shouldn't have bothered. As directed by SNOWTOWN's Justin Kurzel, MACBETH is a miserable viewing experience and one of the worst Shakespeare adaptations I've had the misfortune to sit through. It's an incessantly arty production in which Kurzel seems to be constantly trying to capture the perfect shot. His low key and sombre direction worked with the horrifying SNOWTOWN, but on MACBETH he feels completely out of his depth, missing the gravitas of the play and the genuine drama and horror of many of the scenes.The opening battle sequence is one of the worst filmed I've witnessed. Kurzel has got hold of one of those irritating ultra slow-motion cameras and uses it copiously, much like those annoying BBC cameramen at Wimbledon. The battle is a disjointed, badly-edited mass of random acts of violence and participants who look like they're on the highlights reel of a rugby match. It's awful, pretentiously awful stuff, and I very nearly switched off at that point.I stuck around to see typically strong performances from Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard negated by the decision to have them mumble their dialogue, leaving the viewer straining throughout to make out just what they're saying. The casting director has done a sterling job of assembling a fine squad of actors so it's a pity they're all wasted in this incessantly dull and unlikeable film. Kurzel's attempts to recreate mass battles of the likes of BRAVEHEART (a notable influence) on a tiny budget are also ill advised, leaving MACBETH looking like nothing more than a high school play. My advice? Stick with one of those two versions of the story I mentioned earlier in this review.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"It was good, could've been great","Your enjoyment of this particular movie, will rely heavily on a few things. 1. You have to appreciate Shakespeare. 2. You don't mind a slow pace and heavy dialogue and 3. Your familiarity of the Shakespearean language. I'm not trying to scare anyone off. This is an amazingly well shot, well acted and in my humble opinion, one of the best versions of Macbeth put to screen I have ever seen. Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard are the backbone of this film in their roles of Lord and Lady Macbeth, I felt so much, for the almost eternal sadness that seemed to surround them. The visual style of this movie is also very bleak (reflecting the inner turmoil of the peeps on screen), with only a few scenes where there seemed to be color and light. The costumes and scenery fit very well into what I've always considered, a horror story and the themes of grief, emptiness, greed and its destructive nature are all present. My main (really only) complaint is a big one and honestly this prevented me from enjoying what could've been a truly strong movie. The language. Don't get me wrong, I can handle Shakespearean dialog, but it HAS TO BE pronounced properly! I honestly couldn't understand a lot of what was being said. Not because of the words, but because of the way they were said! I don't know if it was because of their accents, but Fassbender especially ate up his dialogue and I had to turn the volume up and pay close attention to catch the details. Maybe the fault lay with Sound Editing. Either way, it spoils what could've been a truly solid movie. I can't recommend this for everyone as I'm certain the average movie watcher is not gonna like this movie. Please don't expect this to be Magneto in 12th Century. But for the more discerning lover of film, even if you aren't familiar with Macbeth (my favorite play of WS BTW), there is so much here to appreciate and enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Is there anything Michael Fassbender can't do? Marion Cotillard equally stunning,"""MacBeth"" (2015 release; 113 min.) is the latest big screen adaptation of the William Shakespeare play. As the movie opens, we see a small child's funeral (turns out to be the child of MacBeth). After the opening credits, we are given a very brief synopsis as to the overall situation, with MacBeth being loyal to the King, and it's not long thereafter that MacBeth leads the troops in a decisive battle. Meanwhile, we get to know Lady MacBeth, who has grander plans for her husband. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie version of the famed Shakespeare play is directed by little know Australian director Justin Kurzel (his brother Jed composes an outstanding orchestral score, and I noticed in the movie's end credits that Justin is credited with playing the drums in the score). Kurzel gives us a very stylish and visual interpretation of the play, with stunning photography from start to finish, pure eye-candy, The early battle scene is nothing short of epic, with at times ultra slow-motion photography for further effect. Michael Fassbender, whom we just saw recently as Steve Jobs, now incarnates MacBeth, and he brings a heartfelt performance. Is there anything this guy can't do? His list of recent performances is nothing short of daunting (MacBeth, Steve Jobs, Frank, 12 Years A Slave, Shame, and of course X-Men). He is one of this generation's leading actors, period. The minute Lady MacBeth comes onto the screen, I thought to myself 'this face is familiar'. It wasn't until 10 or 15 minutes later that I suddenly realized ""holy cow, it is Marion Cottilard!"". She plays Lady MacBeth without any trace whatsoever of a French accent, in perfect. It is nothing short of stunning to see her incorporate Lady MacBeth (check out her monologue late into the movie, as she is tortured with guilt and shame, it will leave you in tears). Speaking of language: it took me a good 10-15 minutes to get used to the early 17th century English language of Shakespeare's era, and even then, I will readily admit that quite a few of the lines simply bypassed me. If the DVD version comes with subtitles, you probably will want to take advantage of that. The movie was shot on location in England and Scotland. Have the Scottish highlands looked ever more beautiful? And the use of the spectacular Banburgh Castle will leave you in awe. Bottom line: eve if you are not a fan of Shakespeare as such, you will likely be taken in by this latest adaptation, if nothing else by the photography and the lead performances from Fassbender and Cotillard.""MacBeth"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early evening screening where I saw this at on Friday evening was attended quite well, frankly to my surprise, as I had figured that demand for this kind of movie would be limited.

The coldness and roughness of the middle age is very well represented. Regardless the initial criticism of the movie approach, the casting and the acting is not too bad.

"Intense, dark and beautiful","With the film-adaption of Shakespeare's tragedy ""Macbeth"" Justin Kurzel created an interesting and thrilling but also very dark and serious interpretation of the timeless play from the early 17th century.Macbeth tells the story of the brave Macbeth and his transition from a loyal, heroic general on the side of King Duncan to an unscroupulus tyrannt by killing his own king and ending up as a monster and maniac. It is about the question of guilt and abusion of power but also about the lack of morality.The film was directed by Justin Kurzel. He is mostly known for the Assassin's Creed movie which was not succesful at all. Michael Fassbender as the protagonist Macbeth is the highlight of the cast. He took part in several famous films like Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds or also in three X-Men movies in which he played the role of Magneto. King Duncan was played by David Thewlis who is famous for his role in the Harry Potter films and from ""The Boy in the Striped Pyjama"". But Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth suprised me the most because although she is a french actress I didn't even noticed it since her scotish accent is on point and her acting is outstanding.As I mentioned at the beginning, this adaption is more serious and more brutal than the play. The film also has some minor changes and I think the most important one is the fact that Macbeth has children in this version. This changes the view on him as a character since even though he knows how it feels like to loose his own children he still doesn't hold back from doing certain bad things throughout the story. Personally I think it was a good decision as it shows Macbeths inner monstrosity more clearly. While Macbeth was portrayed more terrible, Lady Macbeth was more humanized. When I read the play, I thought that Lady Macbeth is the pure evil and the main villain of the story. After I watched the movie, I sometimes even felt sorry for her because of her uncontrollable and totally crazy husband. There were some other minor changes like the appearance of the witches which were portrayed as some mysterious but still humanly women. And I think also this desicion was more adequate because the imagination of the witches how they were described in the play would mostly fit in a childrens book in these days.The by far best aspect of the film is the visual presentation. Adam Arkapaw as the cameraman created one of the most incredible shots and camera movements I have seen in a film. Especially the battle at the beginning and the very last scene were impressive and throughout the whole film this man worked perfectly with colors and angles. I even could have watched it without any sound. Speaking about sound, the dialogues were terrible. And I don't mean the lines themselves but the way they say them. I literally could only understand a little since they only mumbled and whispered and shouted. That combined with the scotish accent and the shakespearean language created a indefinable salad of words and sounds for my ears. I would recommend everyone to read the play parallel to the film in order to understand the plot.Overall I really liked and enjoyed the film. The actors were very good and I could sympathize with them thanks to their acting. The changes the director made made sense and even improved the story in certain ways. I love the camera settings and I hate the sound settings. So all in all I will give the adaption of Macbeth a 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Every Frame a Painting,"When I first watched this movie in my local cinema (which is where you should see it), I was definitely too tired. You really need to accept the slow pace of this movie. But watching it the second time on Blu-Ray at home, I really saw the genius of this movie. Firstly director Justin Kurzel did a great job in adapting this classic story in a modern way while staying 100% true to Shakespeare's original. Unlike any other of the Macbeth adaptations, he didn't change the setting. It's still set in 17th Century Scotland, or to be more precise: in the Scottish Highlands which brings me to the next point, the gorgeous cinematography.
From the moment I first saw the trailer, I wanted to see this movie just because of the images. Adam Arkapaw achieves to create paintings with every frame, paintings you could hang up both in your living room and in museums. He's a true master of his craft (also made True Detective Season 1 and Assassin's Creed). And this is also the reason why you shouldn't wait to head to your local cinema if they coincidentally show it. This is really the best way to enjoy those images. If not you should definitely try to find the biggest screen possible, don't just watch this on your laptop or even your phone.
The music, composed by Justin's brother Jed Kurzel, is also very good and always on point.

The play's the thing but not here,"After the film finished I asked myself where was Shakespeare's Macbeth as the text had been gutted and the main actors delivering the lines in a flat monotone distilling any passion and energy.Director Justin Kurzel has taken a graphic novel approach in this blood thirsty play, it is less 300 but more Valhalla Rising as Scandinavian moodiness is over produced.The film starts off promisingly as it sets out its stall with an exciting battle sequence that calls to mind Braveheart but at a lower budget, drawing in the crowd who may not normally take to the play but the Bard's words never arrive and when they do, the actors seemed to be embarrassed by it.There are some nice visual touches and interpretative flair but the finished product does not feel like Shakespeare's Macbeth.",3.0,Anonymous,History
A successful adaptation,"Macbeth manages not only to create a coherent cinematic experience out of the play, but at the same time it retains and puts in good use lots of the theatrical aspects of its roots. The directing is particularly stylized but with solid, conventional dialogue sequences, and yet at times Kurzel lingers over a person's monologue for minutes, just like Shakespeare originally intended, which works pretty well in maintaining and enhancing the emotion. The cinematography is a monochromatic masterclass, with three repeating color schemes driving the mood of the audience. The acting is radically different to the average hollywood movie and closer to a theatrical play, revealing a new aspect of the talent of the cast and giving Cotillard one of her best performances. Finally the visual effects are remarkable for this kind of films, the painterly matte painting with the soft edges has been replaced by a much more coherent composition, less distracting and equally (if not more) emotionally compelling.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Well, this isn't really what Shakespeare meant","I went to the theater with the great hope. I expected to see - for the very first time since couple of years in a commercial cinema - a piece of art.

It is about some idiots, running in shirts through the frozen hills trying to do bad things to each other.There is no motivation attached to any single piece of this story, making it all totally useless.However, I gave it two stars.

A bloody yet bloodless Macbeth,"This version of Macbeth has plenty of violent scenes, yet the performances themselves lack blood- by which I mean, passion and feeling. This is a version of Macbeth so lacking on enthusiasm or effort that it's puzzling as to why it was made and why the filmmakers thought it was necessary. The lack of imagination is first apparent on our first look at the witches, who are just... women. Their appearance is meant to be otherworldly (indeed, in the play they have beards, though I've yet to see a production of Macbeth that keeps that detail), but in this film they're anything but. And they mutter lines, hailing Macbeth, that should be said with a little fire.That's just a taste of what Michael Fassbender gives us as Macbeth. He's learned his lines, but apparently saw no need to act them out, speaking monotonously and saying things that don't match what we see. He refers to his hair unseated and his heart pounding- they're not. He tells Duncan he will be joyful while frowning. When debating whether to kill Duncan, he shows not a trace of fear or conflict. After Duncan's death, he says he wishes for death, but no one would believe him. Upon seeing Banquo's ghost, he says he is white with fear- he's not. Later, he calls a servant cream-faced- but he's not.Marion Cotillard does much better as Lady Macbeth. When we first see her reading the letter, her voice, unlike Fassbender's, actually varies accordingly to what she is reading. But there's not enough of her in the film, and the other characters lack any interesting traits. Our spirits who mislead Macbeth are supposed to be a severed head and a bloody fetus, but here they're just ordinary people. And plenty of the action lacks imagination as well- showing Duncan's murder, and having Duncan wake up just before, is ripped off from Roman Polanski's 1971 film. See Polanski's version instead- because a monotone Macbeth equals a botched Bard.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Difficult,"I think that this movie portrays the original text quite well, but that does not mean it is a good movie. My major problem with this film is that it keeps the original dialogue from the play, which makes for a completely unbearable experience. It was impossible to understand what the characters were saying to each other in some scenes, and I had to watch it with subtitles in order to understand it at all. The only reason I understood the story was because I had already read Macbeth, and even then, the differences in the movie sometimes made it hard to tell where the story was. The movie itself wasn't so bad, although the acting was made worse by the old English. But it was hard to watch when comparing it to the book.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"This Macbeth is a Shakespeare adaption at its best, if you can get past the dialogue.","William Shakespeare's style of writing, whether its reading chapters in his books, or listening to dialogue in the umpteenth telling of Macbeth, makes me feel stupid. Thankfully the story of Macbeth has been told plenty enough times to understand what's going on, and everyone in this 2015 telling more than make up for its insolence. The story as a whole is dark, horrifying and wicked. Macbeth, played by the impeccably flawed Fassbender, loses the plot when his wife, the sinister, manipulative Marion Cotillard, pushes him to kill the king of Scotland (David Thewlis). There's one battle Macbeth cannot win, and that's against the demons (or witches, in this case) that continually torment him. There are hints of Game of Thrones and The Lord of the Rings in there, dappling into the realms of fantasy through the eyes of Macbeth. This is gritty, dark stuff from director Justin Kerzel, a Shakespeare adaption that's not as hard to digest as originally thought.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Macbeth features a unique, painted in blood and buried in the mist, absolutely original and brilliant direction.","Nominated for Palme d' Or in Cannes Film Festival this movie features a unique, painted in blood and buried in the mist, absolutely original and brilliant direction by Justin Kurzel (Snowtown), that should be nominated for Oscar. Michael Fassbender is fantastic, he doesn't play Macbeth, he is Macbeth! He should also be nominated for Oscar but he is going to lose to himself (Steve Jobs). The classic and great theatrical play is translated into a movie in a way that Shakespeare would be proud, but beware that old English language is used all the time and everyone speaks like a damn poet, which will surely tire even the most patient audience. Also, having a great French actress like Marion Cottilard talk in 1600's English proves to not be the best choice and therefore her performance lacks persuasion, especially compared to Fassbender's. If you expect another ""Gladiator"" or ""300"" movie, don't watch this movie. This is not a typical blockbuster but a quality title that will not be widely appreciated.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Wrong, wrong, wrong!","The power and the majesty of Shakespeare's plays is in the language. Why then produce a film version where the dialogue is muttered, uttered in a monotone, or pronounced in accents almost impenetrable, such that the viewer is struggling to catch even the most famous speeches?
The wonder of it is that there is anything left, but the heavy mood and horror of the tale does capture attention. The actors all have powerful presences and retain their dignity throughout the overdone face-smearing and dripping gore. I can only conclude that they did as they were directed. I was just longing for someone to break out, lift their voices, and utter their speeches in traditionally round, stentorian tones - I would have cheered. Failing this, there was nothing to lift the heart.
I can see that no expense was spared and it is in many ways a high class production. I just ask WHY it was done at all. Did the producers just trade on famous names (starting with Shakespeare), or see it as an opportunity for horror and violence? They obviously didn't value the play as such, as they didn't preserve much of what makes it great. I'm not a purist as regards the plays, but they do have a stage quality which is lost with too much ""realism"".

Fassbender delivers once again a knock out performance : He was indeed born to play that part.Watching him transitioning from a brave warrior & moral man to a paranoid & lunatic king was quite something . Cotillard was also sublime as the doomed Lady Macbeth : Shakespeare's dialogue for a french performer must have been quite a challenging task but she's succeeded quite admirably.So big extra kudos to her. Let's not forget the excellent supporting cast : Thewlis, Considine , Reynor and especially Harris & Debicki ( in a short but poignant performance). All led by Kurtzel fearless direction (need to see Snowtown ASAP). He has truly created a dark,visceral & well-crafted epic. And in my opinion , the dialogue was quite accessible as well.

"First of all, this is not a film, it's an experience","One of Shakespeare's classic tales has been brought to a whole new level, as we enter the real dark world of Macbeth and the pain, guilt, and bloodshed forged from this mind blowing masterpiece. A soon as the film begins we are in the middle of a battle. We're not watching it, we're in it. The heart pounding sounds of the soldiers, the marvellous editing, makes the audience feel in the battle as you hear the fighting commence.Michel Fassbender gives a breath taking performance with power, and passion, along with an excellent cast behind him. With such passion in their tone, we instantly listen to the poetic dialogue especially from the voices of Fassbender, Harris, and Debicki. The music within the film is so powerful and moving it creates the exact atmosphere that we are thinking, and creates the dark and tragic themes of the story. There are also moments that are so beautiful, such as the battle scenes which you just admire.Although we do not see the manipulative Lady Macbeth as in the original story, and we have Macbeth as a much stronger and fearful character that has no weakness, at all. All been said, this is still a brilliant adaptation.This is an absolute must see, even if you have to drive to another town to see it.

Very good version of a great play,"Macbeth (2015/I) was directed by Justin Kurzel. It stars Michael Fassbender as Macbeth, and Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth. This is a serious attempt to make a excellent movie from one of the world's greatest plays. It succeeds on some levels, and fails on other levels.Naturally, director Kurzel ""opens up"" the drama by using shots of the barren moors and desolate shores of Scotland. He has chosen two highly talented actors to play Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Fassbender is brilliant. I would never have thought of choosing Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth, but she's a great actor and she does a wonderful job. Kurzel's handling of the three weird sisters is outstanding, although for some reason he adds a young girl to the group.Some of the things I think Kurzel did wrong involve changing Shakespeare's play for--to me-- inexplicable reasons. For example, one of the great theatrical scenes in the world is Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene. Orson Welles got it wrong--the scene takes place in a shapeless, formless cave. (But Welles didn't have money for a proper set of a room within a castle.)Roman Polanski got it right--a room in a castle, with the maid and doctor in attendance. (OK--Lady Macbeth is nude, but the scene is played for madness, not sexuality.)Kurzel turns this great scene into a soliloquy. It doesn't work. This is an example of Shakespeare's genius betrayed. We need the maid and the doctor because someone has to witness the scene and recognize what Lady Macbeth is unwittingly telling us. Why change it when it works so well?Similarly, one of Shakespeare's most horrific scenes is the slaughter of MacDuff's family. This scene is perfect, and shouldn't be tampered with. Kurzel shows Lady MacDuff and two of her children captured, and then burned alive while MacBeth is watching. The scene as Shakespeare wrote it is fine the way it is--horrible but realistic. It has worked for 400 years. Who decided we needed something better?Finally, the sound quality was such that some of the dialog was unintelligible. Everyone has some trouble understanding some of Shakespeare's lines, but at least you should be able to hear them. (This wasn't just my problem. After the movie, several people commented about this, as did some reviewers.)We saw this film at Rochester's Little Theatre. It will work better on the large screen than the small screen. This version of Macbeth is certainly good enough to seek out and watch. I was frustrated because it came so close to being a historically important version, but didn't quite get there.",9.0,Anonymous,History
What were they thinking?,"I managed to struggle through about half of this. Probably it would have been wonderful if I happened to speak Shakespearean English. Unfortunately, like everyone else on the planet except a few English professors, I don't. I cannot imagine American viewers taking to this film. Not only is the English regional, but it is written in the original dialogue, which makes it pretty much impossible to understand what's going on. The cinematography is superb, the actors look stunningly authentic, the acting appears to be faultless - but even if it had subtitles (it doesn't) it would be incomprehensible. Why, oh why, did the producers not render it in a more modern form of English? They must be mad.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"If you ever thought ""You can't go wrong with Shakespeare"" - sadly, you were incorrect.","Adapting a revered classic of literature to film can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the groundwork is already laid in: the screenplay needs only to be molded to fit one's particular vision, for all the dialogue, characters, scenes, and story beats are already there; unless one is bringing an old tale into the present-day, all the root thoughts are there for the costume design, hair, makeup, art direction, props, weapons, and perhaps filming locations. On the other hand, one also risks the harsher judgment of spectators, for we know the saga well, we have seen other iterations, and we may well be prone to seeing faults more than strengths when the strengths are all but assured. To be frank, it is definitely the faults that I see first and foremost in Justin Kurzel's 'Macbeth,' from the moment it begins. A tone that's abnormally subdued for the material threatens to rob from the performances and the proceedings at large the fire that tends to characterize them, and comes across as hollow substitution for the earnest atmosphere this would otherwise aim to foster. To that point, Kurzel clearly intended a dark, grim look and feel here, taking the ethos of Roman Polanski's 1971 iteration a step or two further, yet the effort feels heavy-handed and forced. In how scenes are written, in how Kurzel arranges them as director, and in embellishments of how those scenes are presented is an air of empty artistry, epitomized (but not exclusively illustrated) in the opening battle sequence where effusive use of slow-motion quickly becomes tiresome (think Zack Snyder and you're right there). And with all this firmly in mind, the vibrancy that commonly defines the acting in any interpretation of the Scottish play is all but lost; the players so often look and sound like they've been drugged, and struggle to act through the stupor, and for anyone to come out well amidst all these issues is highly impressive indeed.Soft voices, relative quiet, and a low-key tone, set against strong violence and sinister vibes, cannot replace actual dynamics. False as the doing seems here, further paired with artificial and coerced atmosphere and unconvincing artistic orchestration, the outcome is that we see subsumed the nuance that would allow the somber gravity and spellbinding vitality to flourish. Following in the footsteps of contemporary genre flicks that suck dry the teat of Grim Dark ideation - down to the lighting - this 2015 feature sadly comes across as a violent historical epic that just happens to be an adaptation of William Shakespeare. Verse aside, this seems to share more in common with Neil Marshall's 'Centurion,' Petr Jákl's 'Medieval,' or the more stark facets of Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart' than with The Bard. It's hardly that there's nothing to appreciate here, for that could not be further from the truth. We have before us a big cast filled with stars who have proven themselves elsewhere time and again (many of whom, like Elizabeth Debicki, deserve roles larger than what the casting provides them here); a subtle and stirring score, ably lending to the mood, with music that especially bolsters the climax; crisp, vivid cinematography; and outstanding shot composition whereby many frames would seem right at home hung on a wall. We are most certainly greeted with beautiful filming locations, gorgeous art direction, fantastic costume design that may well surpass that of other period pieces, impeccable hair and makeup, and fetching props and weapon craft. Those stunts and effects that are employed are uniformly excellent. And despite all it would be plainly wrong to discount the performances: young Lochlann Harris may offer up the first cinematic portrayal of Fleance that made me care about the boy; there are absolutely moments when Michael Fassbender breaks through the malaise of the presentation to make a fine impression. Above all, there is no doubt in my mind that Marion Cotillard is the one player present who is able more than not to adapt to the deficiencies, and the fruitless, questionably stylization, and shine nevertheless; the subtleties of her eyes alone, and her facial expressions alone, possess multitudes that are indisputably the top highlight of these two hours, and Cotillard shows once again that she is truly a world-class actor.As if to emphasize the point, as Act V Scene i is envisioned here, Lady Macbeth's most famous moment is very specifically diminished, and only the power of Cotillard's acting saves it. Still, even the greatest actor cannot carry a picture entirely by themselves. In fairness, it's not that Cotillard fully needs to, for I've spotlighted other qualities that this 'Macbeth' can claim; Kurzel's direction is technically sound, moreover, and Shakespeare provided the foundation for this himself nearly four hundred years prior. There are even small moments of surprising wit, such as how the prophecy is fulfilled, in this instance, of Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane Hill. Yet form all so heavily supersedes function here - nay, not just form, and not just fashion, but rather flair over function. For as demonstrative as the opening battle is of the flaws that will plague the whole, we see that same peak representation elsewhere, like the major scene in Act IV with Lady Macduff and her children, so glaringly over the top and heavy-handed (there's that word again) in how the beat is reimagined as to become ham-fisted; like the climax, overwrought and self-indulgent, and furthermore both carrying the same faults as the opening, and chopped up by dubious choices of editing; and like the last few moments, which are utterly superfluous. Where this isn't true, it still holds that, as stated, the somber gravity and spellbinding vitality are so gravely sapped from this rendition that those beats that should carry weight (e.g. Act V scene v, Macbeth's ""tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow"" speech) are instead bereft. For all the skill, intelligence, care, and hard work that went into this movie, far too little of it was bent toward earnest storytelling, and realization of the terrible potency that Bill Shakes' saga should boast in and of itself. Those factors instead were guided toward a modern historical drama that was very pretty, and which conformed to contemporary sensibilities, but too commonly at the expense of anything that should make us care about it.Not all adaptations of Shakespeare are equal, but the very least that can be said is that it's hard to go wrong with the man. The Scottish play, in particular, is a rich, bloody, absorbing spectacle even on paper, and it would be difficult to foul up what has already been established, revered for centuries, and brought to fruition in different ways again and again. Unfortunately, whether one wishes to point the finger at director Kurzel, the writing team of Todd Louiso, Jacob Koskoff, and Michael Lesslie, or producers Iain Canning, Emile Sherman, and Laura Hastings-Smith, this 2015 flick manages to do just that. I love the play, and I love many of those who were part of the ensemble cast. I had high expectations when I sat to watch - and I've been sorely disappointed. For all that is done well here, and for all that is admirable, and for all that is clever and meaningful, the preponderance of these two hours is instead given over to flimsy, dubitable pretense, ill-considered revision, and a mind for style over substance and significance. I anticipated that I would enjoy 'Macbeth,' and that I would like it. And while I do have some reasons to, the simple fact of the matter is that I don't. Of any cinematic treatment I've seen to date of this play, I regret to say that Kurzel's is the weakest link; the word ""worst"" often seems to carry a colder connotation than ""weakest,"" for that matter, and I think that's appropriate here, too. This had so much going for it, and the end result just does not come off well. I'm glad for those who get more out of it than I do, but as far as I'm concerned there are far better places to watch these actors, and far better titles to give us the adaptation we want of one of The Bard's most esteemed works. This version is something that you can just pass right on by without another thought.",4.0,Anonymous,History
A New Cinematic Classic,"Firstly we need to consider the sheer bravery of attempting to translate a classical adaptation of Shakespeare onto the screen with such close adherence to the original script. We also then need to understand that in an industry where Fast and Furious sets the standard for popularity, this film took a huge risk.And what a fantastic job it did indeed. The director exhibits an excellent understanding of Shakespeare's verse. This creative analysis of the script enabled a couple of new interpretations of some classic scenes which come off as both modern and devastatingly poignant as a result.The magnificently psychological subtext of Macbeth is also elaborated with skill and intellectual sensitivity. Certain choices of plot emphasis, the rearrangement of the chronological order of some verses and the angle of approach to the many linguistic metaphors was in every instance warranted and successful. The director was brave enough to take new and original turns in the adaptation and yet was never tempted to do something drastic for the sake of it. Ultimately this is very high quality.This film cannot be judged by whether or not you understand what's happening. The director tries to assist the audience as much as possible, with the help of excellent acting, but nothing is spoon- fed. If you have no understanding of Shakespearian verse or drama then you may not be able to access this film as much as you'd like.

Hardly one for the masses.,"Let me begin by saying I'm not a fan of Justin Kurzel's new screen version of ""Macbeth"". To be honest I found it something of an endurance test. This is a 'Macbeth' shorn of swathes of Shakespeare's poetry. Nothing intrinsically wrong with that; shortening Shakespeare or making him more 'user-friendly' I can deal with, (oh that Kenneth Branagh had taken the hint with his bum-numbing 4 hour HAMLET), but this is a 'Macbeth' basically comprised of nothing more than a bloody battle, (shot mostly in slo-mo), followed by one murder after another, (not since Alan Clarke's TV film ELEPHANT, about the Northern Ireland troubles, have I seen a film so given over to killing), and by stripping it down to its bare bones Kurzel robs it, not just of the poetry, but the plot as well.Unless you are very familiar with the play it becomes almost impossible to tell who is who other, of course, than the Macbeth's who are, at least, centre screen most of the time. Fassbender isn't really up to the part but Cotillard is outstanding even if her role seems to be sidelined. No-one else makes much of an impression. On the plus side Adam Arkapaw's dark, 'naturalistic' cinematography is excellent but Jed Kurzel's dirge-like score does the film no favors at all.

Something Awful This Way Comes,"I have to hand it to director Justin Kurzel. It takes a special kind of talent to reduce one of the greatest plays in the English language to the near-incomprehensible mess we see here on the screen.First, I guess, you begin by expunging half of the dialogue. (Who cares about stuff like plot or character motivation or coherence, anyway?) Then, you direct your actors to deliver most of their lines in either breathless whispers or marble-mouthed mumbles. (Since you apparently don't understand Shakespeare's language, why should anyone else?) Then, you make sure that your brother's score continually drones on in the background, competing with what dialogue remains. (Did you hope that lots of strings would disguise the fact that there is no real emotion happening up on the screen?)However -- and this is key! -- now that you're done stomping Shakespeare's verse into the dirt, make sure you throw in a lot of foggy moors, raging fires, moody lighting, slow-motion battles, overhead shots, and hand-held camera moves so that people can be tricked into thinking they are seeing something ""artistic"" and worthwhile.On paper, this film had so much potential. In actuality, it turned out to be nothing but an abominable waste of time and resources.My advice: Skip this piece of crap and watch Polanski's infinitely superior version instead.",2.0,Anonymous,History
A visually breathtaking vision of the classic tale,"In what's a film that's sure to delight the eyes and tickle the ears of Shakespearian fans the world over, Australian director Justin Kurzel has for his 2nd feature film (following on from the grizzly Australian crime classic Snowtown) showcased a love and a care for one of the great Bard's most beloved tales that remains faithfully in tune with its source material to at times its own determinate but also showcases the up and coming directors incredible visual flair and ability with actors that will likely see him prosper in the industry for years to come.Kurzel's Snowtown was a gritty, grungy and downright dirty retelling of one of Australia's most notorious mass murderers and while Macbeth is much larger in scale, the realism mixed with a sense of the otherworldly that was prevalent in his 2011 debut is on show once more here in the stunning backdrops of rural Scotland that at times feel drenched in the surreal.A downright masterful opening that throws the viewer into a brutal and bloody battle or soldiers wondering through the waterlogged moors of the countryside with a blood orange haze of nearby fires raging about them, Kurzel and his cinematographer Adam Arkapaw (another standout Australian export) have created something truly special here and with a moody provocative score from Kurzel's brother Jed, Macbeth is one of 2015's most astutely produced features.Front and centre to this immaculately designed drama is another powerhouse performance from Michael Fassbender who seems custom made for the world of Shakespeare. Thriving on the multilayered character of Macbeth, a man driven to insanity and battling his true nature, Fassbender is outstanding and is arguably one of the best seen incarnations of the famous solider who became king. With solid support from Marion Cotillard as Macbeth's equally tormented wife Lady Macbeth and character actors such as Paddy Considine, Sean Harris and David Thewlis, Macbeth's cast is universally excellent and almost make the ye olde English dialogue work.While Shakespearian faithful will be twirling their perfectly pointed moustaches with delight, the often jarring and hard to decipher nature of much of Shakespeare's wordsmithing is at times to much to bare and while it's commendable that the filmmakers here backed themselves and their cast in to deliver, moments of emotion and tension are often held back by dialect that is both hard to deconstruct and difficult to take in over one viewing. At the heart and soul of Macbeth lies a rather uncomplicated narrative and it would've been a relief to see the story treated so in a scripted sense considering what's lost here through frustratingly jarring dialogue.A constantly impressive feature that is often stunningly well filmed and acted, Macbeth is a seriously well acted and directed drama that suggests Kurzel could well become one of Australia's finest filmmaking exports and with his next film the potentially franchise starting Assassin's Creed with his Macbeth stars Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, it's highly likely that those in Hollywood are thinking the very same thing.4 tension riddled dinner banquets out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,History

Macbeth is one of the best films of the year.,"The latest film adaptation of Shakespeares iconic play has arrived. This time the lead role is inhabited by Micheal Fassbender. Who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors working today. With every film he is in he seems to get better and better. Each role he is in he takes on perfectly. Not once has he felt miscast. 'Macbeth' is no exception. His performance in this hefty role is nothing short of superb. He is able to show the grief and inner turmoil that his character is experiencing at any given moment. It's an Oscar worthy performance that may very well be overlooked. In fact, this entire film will most likely be overlooked come award season.It's an unfortunate fact that has plagued recent award seasons. Every year there are great films, like this, that are passed over because they don't have the buzz some of the other films do. Although, this can be ignored if this film receives, at least, a nomination for its cinematography.It's clear from the first shot in the film how much effort was put into the cinematography. Every moment of this film is breathtaking. Even basic scenes of back and forth talking are gorgeous to look at. We get beautiful wide shots of vast mountains shrouded in fog and haunting close ups on characters faces. This is only made better by riveting direction from Justin Kurzel.His control over the film is awe inspiring. The film is under such tight control that the weather itself becomes a character. It displays such an impressive attention to detail. And near everything is shot on location. These vast landscapes give the film the beautiful yet haunting feel the film needs.Having the film play out outside of sound stages is able to give these actors a setting that they can legitimately react to. That being said, this film is one of the best acted films of the year. Even if it was entirely filmed on a sound stage it probably wouldn't have mattered. Cotillard and Fassbender are absolutely brilliant in this film. In a film that is heavy with monologues their honest performances are able to drive through even the hardest spots.And there are a couple of these moments. One specific sequence before the concluding fight scene is particularly difficult to sit through. In a film that cuts out a lot of unnecessary fat, this scene feels very out of place. During this ten minute spot the film screeches to halt. Fortunately, the film recognizes this and hustles into the best part of the entire film. The fight between Macbeth and Macduff. It's an impressively shot and choreographed scene that is infected with emotion.It does everything you'd want from a faithful adaptation of the play while also being separate from all the others. It's a gorgeous film that brings out the best from everyone involved thanks to impressive attention to detail from director Justin Kurzel. 'Macbeth' is a powerhouse of a film that deserves to be seen.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"""Macbeth"" is an excellent adaptation of Shakespeare's classic play about madness for power.","I love Shakespeare! I really do! I don't understand all of it, but I love it! The Bard's timeless themes and insights into human nature still ring true 500 years after his death. His sense of tragedy, drama and humor still entertain. Then there's the language, as beautiful as it is challenging to most modern ears. Many stage, screen and film Shakespeare adaptations have tried to make his plays more accessible by translating them to a more up-to-date way of speaking and some of those adaptations have been excellent, but there's no substitute for the real thing. It helps if you know enough history and literature to understand what you're hearing, but even if you can only catch a line here and there, if you're watching great actors and they're working for a great director, you should be able to follow and enjoy most productions of Shakespeare. A very good example of this is 2015's ""Macbeth"" (R, 1:53).Wait a minute. I doubt this is the situation of anyone out there, but just in case, if you happen to be reading this review aloud inside a theater, please stop now, go outside, turn around three times and wait for someone to invite you back in. And for the rest of this review, every time you come upon the name of the play, just be sure to refer to it as ""The Scottish Play"". Got it? Good. Onward and upward.The play ""Macbeth"" was probably written around the middle of Shakespeare's career as a playwright. It's the shortest of his tragedies, perhaps indicating that the version we have today is an abridged version of the original. Possibility due to its brevity, but probably owing more to its compelling story, the Scottish play has been one of the Bard's most popular. Struggling theaters have often turned to it as insurance against financial ruin (even though some of them went under anyway, possibly fueling the superstition to which I eluded in my previous paragraph). The play's action (with more fights and combat than most of Shakespeare's plays) and its popular themes of the desire for power and the price we pay for our decisions have entertained audiences for five centuries and spawned nearly 100 films.In the 2015 film version, previous Oscar nominee and future Oscar winner Daniel Fassbender (yeah, I just predicted something there) plays the titular anti-hero, and Oscar winner Marion Cotillard plays the scheming Lady Macbeth. Macbeth is a general in the army of the Scottish King Duncan I (David Thewlis) who is in the midst of fighting a civil war. After winning a major battle for his king, three mysterious women (witches) approach Macbeth on the battlefield and prophesy that he will get a promotion (which he finds out about right after this encounter) – and that he will be king! When Macbeth returns home and tells his wife about the prophecy and that Duncan will be their guest for one night, she encourages Macbeth to kill Duncan and claim the crown. Macbeth is conflicted, but ultimately agrees.Macbeth steals into Duncan's tent and brutally stabs him, then Lady Macbeth disposes of the two daggers her husband used in the murder, framing the king's (drugged) guards. Duncan's son, Malcolm (Jack Reynor), discovers his father's body and flees in fear. This makes him look guilty of something, so after Macbeth kills the king's sleeping guards in a fit of mock rage, he is crowned King of Scotland in Duncan's place. As hard as Lady Macbeth tries to assure her husband that ""it's over"", it's anything but. Macbeth's lies compound and his murders multiply as he struggles to hold on to power – and his sanity.This ""Macbeth"" is an excellent adaptation of Shakespeare's play. Writers Jacob Koskoff, Michael Lesslie and Todd Louiso stick very close to their source material, in the film's language and its major plot points. Fassbender and Cotillard are perfectly cast and wonderfully matched in the main roles. They seem to actually live the lives of Macbeth and his Lady as they use every intellectual, emotional and physical tool they have to make these characters real. Throughout the movie, the actors are framed and the script is supported by the confident direction of Justin Kurzel, the amazing cinematography of Adam Arkapaw and the magnificent score of actor/composer (and the director's younger brother) Jed Kurzel.I admit that I didn't catch some (a lot) of the dialog, but I appreciated the movie more after I read a summary of the story. (I'd advise anyone who doesn't know the play, but is thinking of seeing the movie to do the same. What you might lose in terms of surprises, you'll make up in overall appreciation of the film.) Still, I would have liked to understand more of the dialog on first viewing and I think that there were ways to accomplish that without losing the beauty of the language, but this adaptation is outstanding either way. It would be unfortunate if the characters speaking in old English kept anyone from choosing to see this film, which excels on multiple levels. ""A-""",8.0,Anonymous,History

Despite the language barrier, I was constantly appreciating the scenes visually.The good thing is after that first quarter of hiatus, I grew increasingly inclined to the story and couldn't help but witness how great and perfect Micheal Fassbender and Marion Cotillard were for their roles!

Astonishing Adaptation,"As a literary student I always considered Macbeth as one of the strongest plays to be found among the Shakespearean tragedies. After reading the play in class and watching Kenneth Branagh 's magnificent and breath-taking performance as Macbeth in National Theatre Live : Macbeth afterwards--which still stands as the best after seeing this--I realized how symbolically and psychologically intriguing and strong Macbeth was as a Shakespearean tragedy. The story of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth is unique and the play is a literary masterpiece with heavy symbolism. Of the movie, I should initially tell you that it is not your typical history-adventure movie where you get to see a lot of sword- action and yet it is charming enough to take you away with great visuals of Scotland alongside the tragic story of Macbeth. The film uses the original dialogues from the play which made it tons better in my eyes. The synergy between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth is masterfully reflected on the screen. I must say that I am particularly amazed by Marion Cotillard's performance as Lady Macbeth; she was simply perfect. Overall, a visually stunning adaptation for those who loves the play. See this if you like the play as you cannot possibly regret it!After all, ''Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more. It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury Signifying nothing''",10.0,Anonymous,History
Brave attempt by largely unknown director,"Michael Fassbinder, Paddy Considine and David Thewlis are three of the world' best actors whether on stage, film or television, all of whom have well-deserved acclaimed credentials, so it is hard to imagine why Justin Kurzel's Scottish Play seems so dull and tired. Does the curse of the title apply only to performance on the actual boards of a stage, or does it apply to any performance? Because maybe that might explain why one of the bard's greatest tragedies comes across as flat and boring. Perhaps some forgetful novice mentioned the original title in passing, innocently dooming the entire production to best forgotten monotony. The only service that this version of Macbeth can do for the world is to, perhaps, introduce those who knew nothing of Shakespeare to his work, because, otherwise, it is simply a bad though brave attempt.Fassbinder and Considine, in particular, seem to be in a constant state of near exhaustion, much as if they had come rushing in from their real jobs to give their best effort after a hard day's work somewhere else. The choice to have them constantly mumble their way through diction that is provenly brilliant lies with the director and that choice is a shame. Its effect robs the audience of the essential progression of Macbeth from once trusted ally to embittered and murderous traitor, not to mention the later necessity to appear completely possessed by his own megalomaniacal arrogance. In fact, Kurzel's effort seems to have fallen victim to the current popularity of zombies, so lifeless and empty as the main characters appear. Cotillard's portrayal is so unsympathetic that the horrible dark sadness of Lady Macbeth's complete mental decline comes across as merely a slight variation from an original selfish airheadedness. Here, again, the responsibility lies with the director to inspire and monitor the performance of his actors so that the audience becomes aware of the role and its place in the plot. Instead, the only sadness of Cotillard's performance lies in its lack of credibility. One could well imagine that her very first reading of every scene happened the night before the next day's filming.The relief in the film's duration lies in the competent and robust performances of supporting cast members, such as Thewlis, David Heyman and Sean Harris, to mention just a few. By comparison, it is discomforting to witness the waste of the talent and skills of Michael Fassbinder (consider his performance as Bobby Sands) and of Paddy Considine (consider any other role he's ever played) by reducing their roles to those of passionless mumblers.While it is obvious that actors reprising such roles as the main characters here are tasked with will by necessity work to avoid turning in a performance copied from a previous actor's work, Fassbender and Cotillard could have done themselves a service by paying a little more attention to both Polanski's and Orson Welles' versions of the same material. Then again, those versions are the work of directors whose prior careers show ample evidence of a brilliant originality that Justin Kurzel has yet to present.I would suggest waiting for the DVD or other subsequent non-cinema version, to use as part of a Macbeth marathon. By itself, it's just a brave attempt.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Bitter Disappointment,"I was genuinely looking forward to this movie. Fassbender as Macbeth? Many had doubts but i thought... sign me up! Nope. Nope. Nope! Cinematography wise, I have no complaints. The eerie landscapes of Scotland, the costumes, the hair and makeup. The misty battlefields. The music. It all came together nicely and captured the essence of the period. But it was boring. Pretentiously boring because...this is Shakespeare! This is Shakespeare writing about Scottish people and their struggle during a time of bloody wars and this movie just...dulled it up. What's with all the whispering? Where's the passion? Tension? The brutality of it all? The fire? I know Macbeth, I've read and re-read it. It is a dramatic story of rage, tyranny, lust and struggle for power. It is gripping. It is the type of story that rips your heart out of your chest and makes you look at it and deal with it. This movie is not Macbeth. It is nothing more than a mediocre attempt to squeeze out some money and fame. In short, they bit more than they could chew (maybe that could explain all the mumbling).

A terrific Shakespeare adaptation,"Macbeth seems to have come and gone with little fanfare, but this is a rather excellent movie. It's a fairly faithful retelling of the play with Michael Fassbender as Macbeth and Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth. The most notable change is its unexpected side-lining of Lady Macbeth, and this is also its biggest mistake. Cotillard feels wasted as a result. The film excels the most with its depiction of Macbeth himself as a damaged warrior full of angst and grief. Thus, Macbeth is an unexpectedly sympathetic character in this version, which adds to the film's strength. It's perhaps not a film you'll want to see again. Brutal, rage filled and joyless, this is one hugely depressing movie and does get pretty harrowing at times. It's not a strikingly different adaptation like 1996's Romeo and Juliet. It's a faithful cinematic interpretation of the play which unleashes the full force of the play's emotion on the audience. There aren't many rays of sunshine here. This is full-on, ferocious stuff and this approach will put some viewers off.The lines are a bit too quiet at times, and can be difficult to understand. This is a problem, but the film leans heavily on its visuals to tell the story. And what visuals they are. Every frame is a painting here, and the cinematography is utterly mind blowing. As a piece of visual storytelling, it's brilliant. While it's pretty heavy, the film is effective and emotionally powerful, and it does convey the themes of its masterful source material. One to see on the big screen (Although this was box office bomb so sadly most won't), this is overall a very well constructed and executed adaptation. This interestingly seems to have divided people's opinions a lot. The film has a polarising quality, but I firmly see it as an excellent movie, and one of my favourite films of 2015. Easily one of the best cinema experiences I had all year, this is one brutally intense and powerful movie that isn't easy viewing, but does its source material proud and provides an amazing visual experience backed by excellent acting.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History

Macbeth is as intoxicating a cinematic experience as one could ask for!,"This review was first published at www.thisisfilm.com:Oh, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!Every single frame in Justin Kurzel's Macbeth plays bloody and spectacular homage to the ghosts of William Shakespeare's most morbid of plays. Just as I had hoped, the film is a viscerally charged visual onslaught that is every bit as intense, hypnotic and grisly as the previews promised it to be.Sure we've seen many different interpretations and adaptations of Shakespeare's tragic masterpiece of ambition, deception, murder and evil, but nothing as ferociously wicked as this. Australian director Kurzel (whose debut feature Snowtown made him the ideal choice for this project) has made a harrowing feature that is incredibly difficult viewing, therefore making it even more impossible to recommend to general audiences.What immediately stands out, is how unafraid these filmmakers were of taking the knife to the classic tale and making it their own, while still remaining respectful and reverent to the play's immortal legacy. Screenwriters Todd Louiso, Jacob Koskoff and Michael Lesslie have certainly embellished on some of the Bard's verses, inventing new scenes and adding back stories (deceased children) that weren't originally there. The script has also been readjusted to fit a conventional three-act structure.Equally as precarious, is Kurzel's choice of accent, which certainly emphasizes the 'Scottish' part of the Scottish play. While this may prove difficult for some to understand, others will applaud the effort to produce a raw and rich authenticity that the play's famed lines demand of their performers.With a truly superb supporting cast that includes Paddy Considine, Sean Harris and David Thewlis, the film soars into Awards discussions thanks to the unflinching and searing performances by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, who have confirmed to me their position as the two finest actors working today.Kurzel's camera, with its mixture of wide slow-motion shots and claustrophobic close ups, creates the perfect platform for both leads to demonstrate their unequaled acting range and pedigree. Cotillard's static long take, as she delivers the famed Lady Macbeth mental breakdown scene, is as expertly restrained as it is overwrought with heartbroken ferocity. Not to be outdone, Fassbender delivers believable menace and madness, as he brings Macbeth's torturous soliloquies to life in ways no other actor could do.Even when not employing the Bard's iambic pentameter, each performer exudes a myriad of emotional textures and touches, that should be examined at length by acting classes studying realism and naturalism across the globe.Aided by Adam Arkapaw's striking and scintillating cinematography and Jed Kurzel's droning and haunting score, Macbeth is as intoxicating a cinematic experience as one could ask for. The film is a brooding and unrelenting dissection of a man's downward spiral towards self annihilation. Macbeth is catered only to those who can stomach the thought of watching a tyrant slowly twisting and severing off his humanity until all who surround him have vanquished in the colorless and bloodied Scottish marshes.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Good luck making it through this,"Plays are live performances and suffer imitations films do not. Wardrobe and location changes, special effects and camera angles that show us things rather than tell us things are the best tools used in filmmaking. You know the phrase ""A picture is worth a THOUSAND WORDS?"" Whoever made this left the thousand words in and didn't rely on filmmaking techniques to do the story telling. It is like someone filmed a live play and I'm watching the recording of a live play. This comes complete with eloquent speeches delivered by everyone at all times. Even inappropriate ones.

Not a big Shakespeare fan but the performances are great! 3/10,"Review: I was expecting this movie to be a modern day version of this all time classic but the director chose to stick with Shakespeare's words, which got on my nerves from the beginning to the end. I'm really not a fan of Shakespeare's writing but I heard great things about this film, especially the main characters acting but I personally fell asleep through most of this film. The action scenes were impressive at the beginning but as soon as they opened there mouths, I lost total interest. Its a shame, because Fassbender and Cotillard are great and there chemistry is extremely believable but the whole ""thy"" ""thee"" language just wasn't for me. When Macbeth starts to lose his mind, especially when he burns the bodies and loses his wife, there is a sense of intensity which I slightly enjoyed. With that aside, I did find the pace quite slow and the long, unnecessary speeches made it seem like it was never going to end. Anyway, this movie was definitely made for a specific audience in mind but I personally didn't enjoy it. Boring!Round-Up: I've become a bit of a Fassbender fan since his great performances in Haywire, Prometheus, the X-Men franchise and the weird and wonderful Frank, which was definitely out of his comfort zone. His performance in this movie was extremely intense and amazing in places so, although I didn't enjoy it, that is definitely not due to his commitment to the role. He is due to star in Assassin's Creed later on this year after the release of X-Men: Apocalypse and Weightless with Christian Bale so he is definitely showing that he can star in various types of movies. Everyone is waiting for Alien: Covenant, which is due to be released next year and because of the popularity of his character in Prometheus, I'm sure he will be making an appearance in the Ridley Scott classic. Anyway, this is the first major release for Australian born  Justin Kurzel, who is due to direct Assassin's Creed. He certainly got the most out of the actors and his interpretation of Macbeth is true to Shakespeare's writing but you need to be into that type of dialogue to enjoy this movie. It did look authentic and the costume department done a great job but it's just not my cup of tea.Budget: $15-20million Worldwide Gross: $12.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/war movies starring Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Paddy Considine, David Thewlis, Jack Reynor, David Hayman, Sean Harris and Brian Nickels. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,History

There are a few issues I have with the historical accuracy one of them being the castle Macbeth later inhabits as it is a few hundred years out of context.The film is both beautiful and gritty and has gory battle scenes of which are not seen and other Shakespearean adaptations.

I don't really like Shakespeare that Much,"Maybe it's just me but I've never really seen the appeal in Shakespeare. Not only do I find his story's uninteresting and his characters uncompelling but I just hate the way he wrote, taking very simple sentences and trying to wrap them in layers of metaphors that, put bluntly, just make his dialogue sound messy in my opinion.I thought that Macbeth was okay, I didn't like the source material and I didn't think the sets were great but I thought that the relatively star-studded cast all put in good performances and the cinematography was interesting, the beginning battle felt very reminiscent of ""300"" and had some clear inspirations from the Snyder style which I'm not a big fan of either, but still it was different and visually interesting. I don't think I'll ever watch this film again but for what it was I can commend it and it does stay pretty true to it's source material so if you're a Shakespeare fan, which I reiterate I am not, then this may be an enjoyable viewing.",5.0,Anonymous,History

If there weren't short synopsis in the beginning, i probably wouldn't understand what was going on at all. The story here, based on well known material (but honestly not for me, i haven't read it nor heard about it much), is not the worst thing in ""Macbeth"" - it is the screenplay (which i don't know if is accurate to the material) which lacks anything that would resemble to interesting movie. Dialogs (or more like monologues) were highly uninvolving, and this movie at running time 1 h 45 min. is very, very, very (and did i say VERY) slow moving - it drags like hell. I somehow managed to sit though this mess in like 4 or 5 days, watching it like max 15-20 min. a day and hoping to see something that resembles a movie, but unfortunately it wasn't here.Overall, ""Macbeth"" was a shocking experience for me. This movie should be used as a torture devise for those who don't read reviews which says ""STAY AWAY FROM THIS STUFF!"". You have been warned.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"All Hail, Kurzel! All Hail, Fassbender!","In this postmodern rendition of William Shakespeare's Macbeth, Justin Kurzel excels as a dashing experimentalist and Michael Fassbender gives a performance of a lifetime claiming the tormented hero utterly his own.The problem with adapting a Shakespearean drama is that it has probably been read, performed, interpreted, represented, and redefined a gazillion times before, and to think you can positively contribute to the huge, already existing Macbethian discourse is an extremely challenging endeavor. Moreover, your audience have the upper hand; they know the story and almost all the lines by heart and could academically lecture you on the tiniest of details. But this didn't seem to dishearten Australian director Justin Kurzel from adopting a f*ck-it-I'm-gonna-do-it-my-way-whether-you-like-it- or-not attitude to carry on with this risky business. Kurzel made some cinematic decisions that he knew he would most likely be crucified for (already many film critics didn't miss a chance to do so as soon as the film was released); nevertheless, his dark, bloody, visually overwhelming adaptation shocked me but with no doubt satisfied me on every possible level.The visuals play the major part in setting the film's tone and ambiance, and you can call Kurzel's shots overtly pretentious and unrealistic all you like, but what's wrong with that? The film wears the badge of pretense proudly. Isn't Shakespeare's sophisticated language pretentious? Kurzel uses his images as a poet uses words and translates Shakespeare's poetic brilliance into emotionally engrossing visuals, almost to an orgasmic effect – I didn't want some of the long shots to go away because they were so consuming and beautiful to look at. Kurzel is not ashamed to use visual pastiche by borrowing elements from Frank Miller and Zack Snyder and, consequently, turning Macbeth into the most unlikely comic hero of our time.However, if I ever choose to call the film a 'contemporary' adaptation of Macbeth, the visuals would not be the only reason. The screenplay adds something uncannily ominous to the Shakespearean melodrama that directly pertains to modern consciousness. The stress on meaningless violence, brutality and war brings to memory recent events of killings and decapitations. Also, how children are represented as agents of death and threat is a colossal point of departure from the original text. The film opens with a shot of a dead child and a few seconds later we realize it is Macbeth's son's funeral. The infamous three witches are accompanied by a preternaturally looking little girl. A boy who gets killed during war becomes the recurrent apparition that encourages Macbeth to kill Duncan. Lady Macbeth sees a waking vision of her dead child stained with blood. Banquo's son becomes the threat that lingers after the film ends. Children have always been the literary epitome of innocence and subverting this image to the extreme opposite to express fear, guilt and menace is a relatively modern concept. This kind of thematic distortion is reflected in the narrative's time line which disruptively keeps moving forwards and backwards to add to the overall sense of confusion and distortion.Now let's talk acting.Usually, playing Hamlet, Othello or Macbeth is any actor's dream opportunity to toot their horns for a while. Few are those who do away with the generic melodramatic performance and play those characters with regard to the unique perspective of the work in question. Those are the ones I call smart actors and Michael Fassbender is definitely one of them. This Irish-German talent has read the subtext of his role and fully understood Kurzel's vision that his Macbeth reveals a new dimension of the iconic tragic hero I have never seen before. Fassbender's Macbeth is a Macbeth of postmodern proportions; he is no longer the beloved noble hero with one tragic flaw that brings about his demise, but a hero with many opposites. He is attractive yet most of the time covered in dirt and blood (physically and figuratively). He is gentle but in a cruel, detached way. He aspires to build only to destroy. I got the feeling that this Macbeth is not driven by blind ambition but by vengeance and a lurking desire to ruin and deconstruct a universe that has betrayed him – the opening funeral scene gives us a glimpse of how he came to be like that.Fassbender is very much in control of his emotions that not in one scene did I feel like something has been exaggerated or played down. The Macbeth I know goes through a journey of self-loathing and regret that leaves him a total wreck; on the other hand, Fassbender's Macbeth is already disillusioned and wrecked beyond repair. You can tell how dark his inside is from scene one, something which makes him all the more intimidating and incomprehensible. I left the cinema truly wondering what kind of pain and darkness Mr. Fassbender had to summon up from his soul to play that part (sounds melodramatic I know, but I really mean it).Two other people who are equally stunning are Marion Cotillard and Sean Harris. Cotillard has both the innocence and the venom to play Lady Macbeth to perfection, and Harris, with enough maturity and experience up his sleeves, turns the nondescript Shakespearean Macduff into an emotionally and physically powerful character that stands out as Macbeth's antithesis.One final player that invisibly contributes to this harmonious equation and should never go uncredited is the gripping music. Composed by Jed Kurzel (Yup, Justin's brother), the film's original score weaves the ominous atmosphere into existence and completes Macbeth's dark world. Just listen to the first 10 minutes of the soundtrack and you will feel that the music is literally mourning and wailing over Macbeth's eventual destiny.By all means, go watch it and leave your prejudices at the movie theater's door.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Macbeth (2015) Michael Fassbender,"I suggest before watching any Macbeth that you invest in and watch ""Shakespeare Uncovered Series"" Macbeth with Ethan Hawke.If you are watching the DVD Chek out the bonus track. Where they emphasize PTSD. So, there is a statement or view inside the play that was not originally explored.Be sure to keep the subtitles on as some of the wording has been changed to protect the innocent and maybe to keep you from opening a dictionary. There is a tad of scene shuffling for film continuity not needed in the play.It starts slowly with lots of god-awful background music that tries to set the mood of a funeral where they put coins on the eyes to pay Charon.Each version has to do something different with three witches that are ether dictating or just reporting the future. In this case, they are just four ages of disheveled females with some added dialog.This film does take advantage of outside and landscape instead of being cramped into The Globe. It is also not forcing us to modernize.Everyone does a good job of acting and does not let their personality outshine their character. However, it is a tad hard for me to see Remus Lupin in (2011) as Duncan in (2015) played by David Thewlis.I find that I can ignore any variations in this Macbeth and take the film for what it is.

A well-intentioned movie that misses the point,"For all the constant haunting violins, beautiful sunsets and striking landscapes shown in this film, it somehow completely misses the point of the story it adapts. I could accept a ""loose"" adaptation of MacBeth that skips about half of the play, modifies the order of scenes, combines other scenes together, gives lines said by one character to another character, and invents some plot points outright, if this retained the core of MacBeth, but this does not at all. Instead, Michael Fassbender mumbles and whisper-talks his way through a dull, practically wooden performance that strips MacBeth of what makes him an interesting character: his internal struggle where morality and reason fight against opportunism and ambition. The film is made like the director thinks MacBeth is nothing but a play about a violent guy and the various people who kills. I daresay if that's all MacBeth were, we wouldn't still be performing it 400 years after it was written. Instead of Shakespeare's beautiful poetry, the movie is drowned in over-art-directed vistas and just plain bad directoral choices (like setting the entire first 10 minutes of the film as a battle that is shot almost entirely in ludicrous slow motion--the kind of thing a first-year film student who has just seen ""300"" might think is a good idea).If you want to see MacBeth presented in a cinematic style rather than as a play, I suggest the far superior 1971 version by Roman Polanski.",5.0,Anonymous,History
The quitessential adaptation of the dreaded scottish playy,"(this is a film for lovers of Shakespeare and the Scottish play in particular - you might just hate it otherwise)This one does everything right; the acting, cinematography, soundtrack and casting are all 10/10.No notes.They also edited this together well by trimming it down significantly. It fits well inside its 2hr run-time.In short, and mostly, I feel this captures the atmosphere of the play perfectly.Macbeth is practically a horror story, a very dark tale of madness and murder and hopelessness.

What did he say?,"Count me among those who have already noted that this film is seriously hampered by a very difficult to understand sound track. For some very strange reason the actors are directed to speak in stage whispers, or whispers, in nearly every scene. Even during battle, and hand to hand combat, the actors whisper to each other. A lot of the film has voice overs and, you guessed it, all delivered in a stage whisper. The film boasts great sets, very moody cinematography, and a team of actors that are game and up to the demands of the Shakespearean dialogue, yet all is marred by relentlessly irritating dialogue that is mumbled, muffled, and mostly unintelligible. What a shame it is given all the other attributes this film has going for it, to say nothing of a script by Shakespeare! The blame must lie at the feet of the director, Justin Kurzel.

So its come to this.,"I thought that on a personal level I would never subject myself to the oppression of the mind that criticism lends but here I am, my hand forced after bearing witness to this DETACHED ADAPTATION. I must say first that to ATTEMPT to modernize Shakespeare and make it appear more natural by completely reducing it to a secular rhythm, an almost monotone slow beating of the drum, an ever-present whisper, misses the mark entirely. In fact it does the complete opposite of creating realism, it lends itself to the present visual shine and tepid cinematic climate of today's artistic oppression.YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE Shakespeare MODERN AND ACCESSIBLE to today's world by removing its poetic rhythm (designed for the stage). Yet somewhere you decided to reduce it to a whisper and thus striped it of its emotional integrity. Maybe because the traditional plays are spoken loud with such great volume the director felt in order to separate from tradition you must go in completely the opposite direction. I don't know but if that was the intent you should have known better.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Overrated!,"This is a film with a summary-plot. To be fair to it, one has to say that it took someone of the stature of Shakespeare to raise this story above its folklore background and into well-known tragedies. But come to treatment in film there is little to pen out from worriers mumbling one-liners,Star Wars styled witches, frozen silent terrain, blood, and more of it. In case you don't follow, let alone stomach, the gritty action, they continually reverted to extra-slow motion, CSI-style sliced scenes - but in swords and daggers instead of bullet, and loud bangs and screams. A blooded warrior lifted up, his boyish-blooded face zoomed out from the crowded scene then the camera wonders off lazily to other parts of the scene just to return to the warrior while he is being butchered. The result is wasted effort of very talented actors and actresses and the good intention of dazzling cinematography. The result an unconvincing hodgepodge of tricks and tropes that washes out quickly like those witches that pop in just to fade out in the desolate prairies.

No Fun To Watch.,"Between the soldier's light quilted armor sewn perfectly with a machine, the symmetrical cross gable roof on the Church built with dimensional lumber not introduced until the 1800's, the phony modern Scot's accent (in the 11th century who knows how they spoke. Not English certainly.) the ""fingernails on the chalkboard"" music mixed far too loudly and the the whispering voices mixed far too quietly, the net result was that the movie was just simply a mess. Pretty cinematography. Good acting (probably should have acted with a made-up language and subtitles. Pig Latin maybe. Moe: Omay. Larry: Arrylay. Curley: Curleycue, Nyuk Nyuk).

"Beautiful cinematography, mediocre everything else","Finally got around to watching this Amazon and StudioCanal produced rendition of one of Shakespeare's most iconic plays. The best way to describe this version - the third I have seen - is as ""Shakespeare meets Game of Thrones."" Not surprising they took this approach seeing the success of that dark fantasy series. Unfortunately, as with Game of Thrones, what results is something dark, violent, and ultimately less than satisfying.First, this production needs to be applauded just for staying in an appropriately medieval setting, as opposed to all the anachronistic versions floating around out there that move the action to 20th Century Eastern Europe, the Victorian era, or some other inappropriate time period for the subject matter. What is more, this production should be applauded for the wonderful cinematography by Adam Arkapaw. This is a beautifully shot movie that uses the Scottish Highlands to wonderful effect in creating Macbeth's nightmarish reality. Truly excellent work here.Sadly, that is about all good I can say about this interpretation. My first gripe is that Shakespeare's play has been so truncated here that it loses much of its emotional impact. Not only have some key scenes been completely removed, but other sections has been so compressed that at times they just don't make much sense. For example, in this version Macbeth's decline from nobility to regicide is so swift as to be bewildering. Again, even though this is the third interpretation of Macbeth that I have seen, I found myself getting confused at times because the story was jumping around so much.Secondly, the acting is mediocre at best. While Michael Fassbender has shown himself to be a very good actor in other films, here he sleepwalks his way through the story as Macbeth, delivering his lines with all the enthusiasm of someone terribly bored and disinterested in the material he has been given. To call his performance ""one note"" would be, frankly, giving it too much credit. Then there is Marion Cotillard's Lady Macbeth. Unfortunately for the film, Cotillard lacks the sufficient gravitas to be the scheming shrew who was Lady Macbeth. Adding insult to injury, her role has also been so truncated that it might as well not even be there. Instead of being the impetus for Macbeth's fall from grace, she comes across as little more than an indifferent opportunist who is seen to inexplicably swing from craving power at any cost to being bored and then completely disinterested by subsequent events, something that makes her later suicide something of a non sequitur. I suspect this blah interpretation of such an iconic villainess is due to a politically correct impulse to moderate her character. Whatever the reason, this production is severely hampered by thoroughly lackluster and idle performances from key characters.The last nail in the coffin of this film is the dreadfully slow pacing. I understand that the director was going for a suitably nightmarish approach, but what arrives here is less nightmare and more snooze- fest. Between the droning music and the endless slow motion sequences, I was almost ready to kill Macbeth just to end my suffering. Tone it down, fellas.Take all that, and add is some needless sexual groping and moaning (no doubt to please the GoT crowd) and a clichéd close-up of Macduff vomiting (an odd thing for an experienced soldier to do after seeing some blood), and what you ultimately have in this version is...well, much ado about nothing. You can seek out much better versions of this play (such as Roman Polanski's 1971 version, and even the more recent Patrick Stewart version which is solely marred by its 20th Century setting).",4.0,Anonymous,History
"Great atmospherics, but no poetry!","When staging Shakespeare for the cinema, directors have two obvious choices: one, to go with a straightforward theatrical production, and the other, to use the play as the starting material for a screenplay conceived for the purpose. In this version of 'Macbeth', Justin Kurzel clearly takes the second approach. He certainly gets the atmospherics right, and Michael Fassbinder is exactly the sort of actor you would think would be able to make the title role his own. What is lost, however, is the poetry, speeches are mumbled rather than disclaimed, and you might hardly recognise that this was a play written in verse. To me, the result is simply rather dull, and quite possible, hard to follow if you didn't already know the story (though for some reason, the minor detail relating to the prophesy about Macbeth's killer - that he would not be of ""woman born"" - seems to be repeated dozens of times). It's true, writing plays in verse is an outdated convention - but the reason we still watch Shakespeare is because he was so damn good at it, and what's left once that is abandoned is not nearly as interesting. I'd recommend the version with Patrick Stewart from a few years back, no less intense, but much more Shakespearian.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Garbage,"Never have I seen a film so average and lifeless that it made me angry. Shakespeare adaptions can range from absolutely fantastic to lackluster and this film unfortunately falls into the later. A big part of why the film fails for me at least is that I can feel as if it's trying too hard to be a good piece of art. Macbeth is a tragedy so obviously it's tone is dark. So in turn one might think that the color pallete of the film should reflect that. But what ends up happening is that the film gets this lifeless and dull look that doesn't leave a substantial lasting impression. They have a beautiful setting like Scotland and they manage to make it look grotesque. If a film has a more morbid tone, the color pallete doesn't necessarily need to reflect that.The performances range from substantial to lacking. Fossbender's performance is adequate but my biggest qualm with it is that he mumbles everything the entire film. Lady Macbeth is cold to the point where she leaves no lasting impression. A performance devoid of any emotion. As for everyone else, no one is memorable.Other minute things about the film really bother me. They might be hard for someone else to understand because my feelings are subjective but bear with me. All of the pinnacle scenes in the film manage to become underwhelming and as if they never even happened. The play really loses the epic feel that Shakespeare was able to convey in the play. Once the movies over your left with a feeling of being underwhelmed. The film doesn't feel theactrical.",3.0,Anonymous,History
my opinion is that it's pretty boring,"I wasn't too sure what to expect from this at first, since i just saw it when randomly scrolling through my HBO Max account. But it was pretty disappointing.They took everything way too seriously. The environment was very dark and dirty. Hardly anyone smiled in the two hours that the show ran. And they did it pretty much strictly to the era where and when it took place (1200s Scotland), leading it to be very boring. The fun of Shakespeare is that you can interpret it in any way you want. When i did the show we had it take place in a bar called the Wayward, and had lots of cool coloured lighting, making it have a sense of difference and immediately draw you in. If you do it strictly to the era, it gets very boring very fast.They also cut many lines (like the vast majority of the witches lines. What's up with that?), and took some from one scene and placed it in a totally different one. (pretty much they mixed and matched the lines to their liking.) they assigned some peoples lines to very different characters, and they cut entire characters and scenes. (all of 4.2!! That was an incredible scene, and the execution of it was extremely disappointing.)
it's unfortunate though, because some of the ideas and imagery were pretty artistic (like Lady M seeing the witches in her last moments), and the actors were quite good, and definitely knew how to speak Shakespeare.There was a lot of talent wasted on a movie that gets as boring as this one.I'm giving it 4 stars because 1, The actors and some of the crew had incredible talent, and it wasn't their fault this was poorly done; and 2, the reason i'm so bored with this movie is an opinion. Personally i really hate the style in which they did it, but others may like it.If you want something serious and very strict to the era where it takes place, watch this, it isn't bad for that!

Michael Fassbender plays Macbeth and he himself does a decent job as he does in most of his films.Director Justin Kurzel is Australian and tries to add some Aussie orange/red to the bleak Scottish Highlands which form the backdrop to the story.

"lot of familiar, but perhaps not enough","I haven't seen the Scottish play, so I was really looking forward to Macbeth. Besides A Midsummer's Night's Dream (both live and big screen versions), Romeo and Juliet (courtesy of Baz Luhrman, and its homages) and the small part of Julius Caesar we covered for my GCSE, my exposure to Shakespeare is embarrassingly limited. The trailer I saw one week earlier (before the superb ""The 33"") was so promising. Unfortunately it quickly became obvious why Macbeth is not as frequently revisited in the theatre as other more familiar Shakespeare plays. The language was just too inaccessible and despite the action promised by the trailer and the 18 certificate in Malaysia (Why? The Hunger Games has more graphic violence) it was spread too thinly amongst the monologues. One of my ESL friends fell asleep, the other could follow along me easily than me thanks to the Chinese and Malay-language subtitles we get in Malaysia. Sure, Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard and the Scottish landscape all looked incredible. But for the 2015 audience it would have been appropriate to reinforce the story with visuals (think Speed Racer, but maybe toned down a bit). To be fair, MacBeth did channel the battle scenes of 300 (and Braveheart), and elements of John Wool or other Asian kung fu epics with red smoke and silhouette, (and perhaps unintentionally, Star Wars and the Hunger Games -Princess Leia and Effie Trinket through Lady MacBeth's hair and makeup, and Game of Thrones – did anyone else things the wyrd sisters were Craster's wives?) but it wasn't enough. Perhaps Marion Cotillard is too nice a person for the role, but unfortunately her performance was overshadowed by her compatriots much more moving performance I saw the week before in ""The 33"".",5.0,Anonymous,History

The Camera is the Star Here,"If you like Shakespeare, or Macbeth, be warned: this is not that. This is a visually stunning film, with a wonderful score, a number of exquisitely choreographed scenes, some stunning acting by minor characters, tremendous witches, haunting scenery, some moments of brilliance, lacklustre performances by Lady Macbeth and Macbeth, and total (and annoying) inconsistency of accents and setting. There's a wondrous sex scene early on that was not followed through on later, when we needed it again on steroids; the madness is silly and everything is too slow; yet the surreal, colourized imagery, with its strong hints of IS and desert warfare and suicide bombers gone mad, is arresting. Too bad it wasn't more consistent. The camera is smarter than the actors or the script here. The madness in general is unanchored and a bit banal, and Fassbender only looks in control when whacking. He smiles too much, and has never heard that there is such a thing as poetry, or that this is that. Still, Banquo and MacDuff are tremendous. There are a couple of really annoying things, though. First, there's an attempt to make every interpretation new, even when it's a terrible, non-narrative stretch of disbelief, so stretched that it snaps. Lady Macbeth outing her spot looks like play acting, for example. I laughed out loud, it was so pop psychology. Nonetheless, for all its missed beats, what it hinted at and failed at, is magnificent, but, really, it's too much to ask for a production of Shakespeare in a non-poetic age to be be poetic, but without poetry Shakespeare makes no sense. This doesn't. The good stuff is good, though. Go for Banquo and the photography and the witches and for what might have been if the whole thing had been given to the camera crew early on. Moments of brilliance are rare enough.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Stunning Grandness,"Macbeth (2015) is as straightforward as a film adaptation of a Shakespeare play gets. Although the production and cinematography is undeniably rich and stunning, the real highlight is still the tragedy and language of the play. To those who are looking for a grand epic as the promotions suggested, it might disappoint them, though again it's all visually stunning, the movie doesn't let the action and warfare be just action and warfare. Just like the story, it's all about the tragedy, the cruelty and consequences. And it does them right with a perfectly bleak and grim tone, anyway. With performances that really spice up the scenery, Macbeth is an impressive piece of cinema.The movie mainly starts with a battle, but the real focus of that bombastic start is the atmosphere driven by the violence happening, even if they eventually won the war. Then Macbeth found three witches denoting that he will be king. This leads him to ambition and this ambition turns poison until he fulfills it as a tyrant. It's basic stuff, but again, as a Shakespeare play, it's all about the language. The visuals speaks through evident bleakness, but the dialogue speaks through madness. And it's actually quite effective, compellingly shows how their world crumble and so forth.The film allows the monologues to define these characters and the recipe for that is the leading actors. Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard seem they are born to be in this material; Fassbender brings the complexity of Macbeth while Cotillard brings the madness that she nearly steals the show. The supporting are also quite impressive filling up among the leads. The direction is downright stunning. Sure, it's basically just allowing for the language to flow, but the visuals just looks tremendous. There's a sense of grandness within this production, while the redness of the backdrops just fits on how harrowing things may get.Macbeth isn't the most overwhelming approach, again it's just too straightforward, but the story still is impacting enough, staying faithful on the text of Shakespeare. It embraces the mood, it focuses on the theme; if anything, the acting and the production is what makes it special, bringing grandness on the dialogue presented. To those who may be seeking for an epic, chances are there fights that is good looking, but then they aren't particularly action scenes. They're drama and really tremendously delivered drama. And that's how simple as this adaptation get.",,Anonymous,History
An Overambitious Art-house Flick That Will Enthral Some & Frustrate Others.,"There's no denying that the latest film adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most celebrated plays is ravishingly beautiful to look at, is more or less faithful to its source material in content and features committed performances from both Michael Fassbender & Marion Cotillard but the Shakespearean dialogues, woeful pace & experimental nature turns it into a cinema that will divide its audience.Based on William Shakespeare's play of the same name, Macbeth follows its titular character who, after a bloody battle, is approached by witches who tell him that one day he will become the King of Scotland. Blinded by ambition & coerced by his wife, Macbeth brutally murders his highness to take the throne for himself but soon becomes paranoid & turns into an imminent threat for his own kingdom.Directed by Justin Kurzel, the issue I have with this picture is that the Shakespearean language its cast have to utter becomes annoying real soon and is more suited to the world of theatres & opera than a film celluloid. Others may admire it for the same reason but I was having facepalm moments after the first 10 minutes. The main plot, however, closely resembles the material it is adapted from despite its lavish presentation.Cinematography is a definite highlight for the camera makes wonderful use of warm colour palette, lighting & shadows is pure wizardry, images are captured in splendid detail and the visual design is sumptuous to look at. The opening moment did feel like the cameraman was drunk and had trouble in keeping the device static but it's a smooth ride afterwards. Editing could've paced it better while the background score only works in bits n pieces.Coming to the performances, Macbeth features a fine cast in Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Sean Harris, David Thewlis & others. Fassbender's rendition of Macbeth is impressive on a visceral scale while Cotillard is effortlessly enchanting as Lady Macbeth. Their expression is simply spot on but just like the film's stupefying photography, the Shakespearean accent they try so hard to nail is unnecessarily distracting.On an overall scale, Macbeth is an overambitious art-house flick that will hypnotise its viewers with its rich, colourful & vivid imagery yet there are going to be few who'll find it a chore to sit through due to its sluggish pace, poetic conversations, empty spectacle, half-baked characters & tedious narration. Definitely not a film for all, Macbeth has a lot in store for art-house enthusiasts or fans of Shakespeare's tragedy but other than its spellbinding images, it was a vapid experience for me.",,Anonymous,History
