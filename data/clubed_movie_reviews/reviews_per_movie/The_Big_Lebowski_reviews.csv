He really is The Dude!,"The Dude, aka Jeff Lebowski, is mistaken for a shady, millionaire businessman with the same name, a gang of thugs, searching for money, smash his place up and steal his rug. The Dude is given the chance to seek out those men.What a hilarious movie this is, from start to finish it's sheer brilliance, it doesn't matter how many times I watch it, I never tire of it, talk about a film you can watch over and over.It's genuinely funny, and with plenty of mixed humour, some of it's smart, some of its slapstick, some of it's a little surreal, overall, it just works. I'm not sure the story is anything new or complex, but that idea of two people with the same unusual name being linked by a crime, it works.The scene with Larry and the car is probably my favourite from the whole movie, talk about hilarious, that poor car.Jeff Bridges has put in some marvellous performances over the years, for me though, this is the best, he just nails it, he's hilarious.John Goodman is great, he steals many of the scenes, Julianne Moore is terrific, not sure if I prefer the accent or hairstyle, she's so good.Perfect music throughout, seeing this you'll want to download The Gypsy Kings. You'll want to sip a White Russian at the same time.A Joy!!9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Dude Abides...!,My Rating : 9/10You either hate it or love it. I am in love with 'The Big Lebowski'! I love most of the Coen Brothers' work and this one is right up there with Fargo and No Country For Old Men. It's super funny and can be watched again and again. I think I watch it once a year and always have a great time.One that I highly recommend. Go watch it! And then watch it again and again.AN AWESOME CULT FILM.,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
indeed a cult classic,"More than 20 years it took me to have a look at this cult classic. Finally did it and I do undestand the fuss about it.Not a flick for everybody that I can tell because a lot of talking is done but it's the talking that starts to get funny after a while. In fact, a bunch of loser trying to solve a abduction and trying to hold the money for themselves goes terribly wrong.After a while you even want the talking to go on and on. And some art flick here and there it was indeed a hell of a ride, funny, stupid but genious in its kind.Gore 0/5

The film with the highest rewatchability factor of all time,"It's actually kind of hard to describe this movie (and what's so great about it) to people who don't already know it and love it; as with many cult films, The Big Lebowski will either speak to you (in which case you will become a fervent follower of His Dudeness and abide by his code for the rest of your life) or, if it doesn't, the film will either leave you completely indifferent or you'll even downright hate it.I believe it's a very funny film and I'm sure it can be rightfully called a comedy, but don't expect punchlines, gags, jokes or slapstick - it's not that kind of comedy. If you want to enjoy this film, you have to meet Jeffery ""The Dude"" Lebowski on his terms, hang out with him and his bowling buddies and follow them at a their (perhaps somewhat leisurely) pace through this weird and unbelievable tale about nihilism, theft (of a car and, more importantly: a Creedence Clearwater Revival tape), kidnapping, abstract art, porn and - of course - bowling.The story is actually kind of simple. You see, some no-good German nihilists urinated on The Dude's rug - and this kind of aggression just won't stand against The Dude. With the help of his bowling buddies, he will do everything in his power to get someone to pay for his rug - or possibly get a new one (because that rug really tied the room together). So he embarks on this worthy quest during which he will encounter many wondrous things and fascinating people (even Jesus - who is NOT the messiah but a very naughty man).With Jeff Bridges in the leading role, the Coen brothers have found the perfect actor to incorporate one of the most iconic characters that has ever been created. But it's not just The Dude that makes this a winner; the whole film is such an inspired folly and simply inventive filmmaking at its finest (the hilarious dream sequence alone is worth the price of admission). The supporting cast is outstanding (J.Turturro, J.Goodman and S.Buscemi among many others), the song choices are perfect and the dialog is the funniest, most quotable in any comedy I've ever seen. This - for me - is without a doubt the film with the highest rewatchability factor of all time. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"You can watch it a million times, and yet, it will never get old","The Big Lebowski is the type of movie that is so funny, and so clever, you want nothing more but to meet the Coen brothers, congratulate them personally for their unique talent, and get inside their heads and find out what makes these two geniuses ""tick"".  The main characters are Jeff Bridges (who plays such broad roles like The Muse, The Contender, and Sea Biscuit), John Goodman (who should have won an oscar for best supporting actor for his character, Walter Sobchak)Juliane Moore (Maude Lebowski)and Steve Buscemi (who is unique in every Coen Brother movie).The first time I saw this movie, I will admit that I enjoyed it, but did not fully appreciate its level of humor and raw talent.  I thought the middle section was a bit too depressing and long.  But trust me, this is a movie that gets more funny every time you see it, even if it's your thousandth time seeing it. Its level of comedy, action, brutality, and vulgarity become that much more evident and important.The characters are brilliantly written by the coen brothers, and, likewise, are brilliantly portrayed by the actors.  The Big Lebowski is like no other film.  It will make you laugh and it will make you cry.  There is no other film such as TBL that is sharp and witty all the way through. One of the Joel and Ethan Coen's best, and one of the movie industry's best comedic film of all time.  You want to go see this flick.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Most Quotable Film of All Time,"Those Coen brothers have an ear for language. You feel it in the sing-songy banalities of Fargo, and in the noiresque machine-gun dialogue of Miller's Crossing, but neither of these can prepare you for the feast for the ears that is The Big Lebowski.Channeling the opaque mysteries of Raymond Chandler, the Coens throw LA resident bum and Bowling aficionado Jeff Lebowski (""The Dude"" to his friends) into a strange triple-crossing case of kidnapping, ransoms, nihilists and urinated-upon rugs. It is the equivalent of throwing unrelenting forces at an immovable object, the Dude's bemused stoicism at constant odds with the world around him. He'd much rather be bowling with crazed Vietnam Vet Walter (John Goodman) and pure silent soul Donnie (Steve Buscemi).As with so much of the Coens' output, style is more than half the point: not just visual, though ace DP Roger Deakins paints an alluring canvas, but tonal and auditory. This is an insanely funny head-trip of a movie, with wonderfully idiosyncratic characters, down to the smallest part. Who better than the Coens to reinvent the comedy of errors?This is without a doubt one of their very best, a personal favorite, an unmissable film and the kind of experience that will plant an indelible smile on your face. Do yourself and see this now, if you haven't already.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Greatest movie ever made.,"With the combination of the writing of the Coen brothers and the Cinematography of Roger Deakins, they created a film as beautiful as it is funny. The Coen brothers consistently impress me with their ability to write an interesting story with fascinating yet quirky characters. Without resorting to gratuitous sexual scenes like many other writer/directors of R rated films the Coen brothers manage to add the right amount of language and violence that is necessary to the story without it becoming the only reason for watching. 'The Big Lebowski' has so many clever and hilarious lines that you have to watch it over and over again.Nothing else needs to be said about it other than it is the greatest movie ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I don't get it,I have rewatched this movie a number of times to see if maybe I missed something or maybe as I get older I will appreciate it more...I still don't really find it all that funny and certainly not worth all the hype. It's quirky and weird and that kind of movie has its place. Why there is such a cult following for this one I will never understand. Maybe it was hyped up too much for me from the beginning...,6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Dude Abides!!!,"No movie has entertained me more in the last year than this film. It's delightfully written, directed with poise and acted with extravagance and excellence. I do admit that this is a film that I had to see six times to get. Every time I watch it I learn something new. The genius of the film lies within a game I think the Coen brothers play with their audiences. There are the touches of the masters in many of their films. In ""The Hudsucker Proxy,"" it was Preston Sturges and Frank Capra. In ""Raising Arizona,"" I felt a touch of Sam Fuller. In this film, I felt many touches of greatness, but more specifically I felt John Sayles or even John Cassevettes in spots. The camera was manipulated beautifully and I felt a tinge of their talents lurking in at many a turn. The performances are astounding, especially Goodman as the deranged bowler still living deep within the jungles of the Vietcong. Huddleston is also quite wonderful as the title character. Turturro gives a fine cameo as ""Jesus,"" coupled with a rousing and humurous version of the Eagles, ""Hotel California,"" done in Espanol. I hope this is a film that is looked at with more seriousness. It is, once you dig deep, a fine piece of filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Coen brothers unabashedly out of control!  A plethora of fun!,"The Coen brothers are up there with my very favorite filmmakers (Scorsese, Kubrick, Carpenter).  I am very fond of their work.  Throughout their irreverent career, they have explored different subjects and themes.  Their best stories evolve from  kidnapping schemes in films like ""Raising Arizona "" and ""Fargo"", one of my very favorites.  I thought that film was fervently free.  I was so ever wrong. It's as if the Coen Brothers have celebrated their complete breakthrough success (Academy Award winners), and now are willing to do whatever they please.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is a film so meandering, so wonderfully novel, that I found myself missing the many other sporadic jokes as I was heaving from laughter.  The film is basically about mistaken identity, eccentric characters, and a soiled rug.  This film extols the bowler, the allies, even the pins.  We experience an actual bowling ball POV, as the Dude (Jeff Bridges) hallucinates.  This film has nihilists, feminists, millionares, paedophiles, drugged out hippies, underachieving students, incompetent criminals, pornographers and 'Nam veterans.  This movie is open to anything , anything... Some people are turned off by absurd looniness, because it's so grandiosely different.  Yet who couldn't chuckle, if not explode, when a bowler dressed in a tight purple suit licks a bowling ball's finger hole, and the camera pans down to reveal his name as Jesus! I will disclose no more, but urgently recommend you to traverse to your nearest video abode and rent this true escapists' feature. Abandon all solemn inhibitons, though!

"unique, weird, but not that funny","It's 1990. Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a lazy bum who insists on being called Dude. Two thugs break in to shake him down and pee on his rug. They soon realize they're mistaken. They're looking for the millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston) whose young wife Bunny ran up a debt. The Dude's unstable friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) convinces him to go see the rich Lebowski for compensation for the rug. Later Bunny is kidnapped for a $1M ransom. Rich Lebowski asks the Dude to do the ransom hand off. Walter tries to double cross the kidnappers but the drop off goes terribly wrong. The money is stolen. All the while, the Dude and Walter is in a bowling tournament with Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) is Lebowski's daughter who wants the Dude to recover the money from the kidnappers.This is crazy Coen movie. This is a weird black comedy. It reminds me of the craziest parts of 'Raising Arizona'. It's a little too meandering with weird characters coming in every few minutes. This is much more weird than funny. I found only a few big laughs like the fking toe. On the other hand, it is completely unique. A lot of it is weird for weird's sake. It's a lot of weird.

I just don't get it.,"TBL is not a terrible movie, but I apparently just don't get it. My lady-friend's daughter is always telling her that she should see TBL in order to understand some of the ""in-humor"" and comments of her generation. I kept telling my friend that I really didn't think that the movie would be what she expected, but we watched it together anyway. (I had already seen it a couple times.) My friend was flabbergasted, as she couldn't identify any phrases, humorous scenes, or references that she had ever heard or seen her daughter's group use. She didn't like the movie, either, and was actually checking to make sure that it was the same movie her daughter had recommended.I feel the same way. Frankly, this movie is boring and pretentious. I love most of the Coens' work, but not this film. It goes into a category, along with ""Young Frankenstein"", of movies about which other people make a fuss and I just don't get. Maybe I'm slow.Anyway, if your idea of fun is watching a laid-back dude drink White Russians and a lot of unnecessary one-dimensional characters get layered on, go ahead. It's just not my cup of tea.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Simply Beautiful,"It's a travesty that most critics only read The Big Lebowski at its most superficial level and called it a modern take on a Raymond Chandler potboiler. I simply can't begin to perceive how one could sit down in front of this cinematic pop-poetry, as it plates gold on the silver screen, and not feel so incredibly alive. The dream sequence Busbee Berkley musical numbers are unique and awe-inspiring; the humor is rich, subtle, and clever in the way it satirizes politically correct arrogance; the free-flowing story avoids (even pokes fun at) nonessentials like plot points and pay-offs. But what really makes this film such a masterpiece, such a panacea, is the incredible humanism, the care that the Coen brothers put in developing The Dude (Jeff Bridges), Walter (John Goodman), Donnie (Steve Buscemi-tremendously endearing), and Brandt (magnificently played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman). Looking at the films use of Sam Elliott to play The Stranger, who constantly rambles about the many wonders of The Dude (among other things), it is clear that the film is an ode to a Dudist way of life. And in a time where so many film promise that they have the answer to the worlds problems and end up as slick, stylistic show-off films, what more could one ask for than a good-hearted film like this? Not to mention the performance by Jeff Bridges, which ranks among the best performances of the nineties; he has a relaxed slouch, a goofy smile, an enthusiastic dance, and his buttons can only be pushed by Walter, who John Goodman plays with charm and fury. The Coen brothers have always been considered 'cold' filmmakers, but there is nothing here but warmth and humanity (as is the case with the Coens' Fargo). What we have here is one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema and if you can't see that, grab a White Russian, hit the bowling ally, and find your inner-Dude as soon as possible.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A wonderful film...with the word f#@$ used 102030841 times!,"I tried watching this film on TV a few years ago, but I made the mistake of doing so with my kids nearby. In the first 10 minutes of so, I heard 'f#@$' (a word you are NOT allowed to use even once on IMDb) dozens of times. Realizing that the film was NOT family-friendly, I turned it off despite all the very positive reviews I'd read for it. However, considering I've seen all the Coen Brothers films except this one, I knew that eventually I'd get back to seeing it. Nearly a decade has passed, and I finally got around to seeing this cult favorite.Considering that there are nearing 1000 reviews for this film, I won't bother discussing the plot--it's been explained to death. Besides, the plot, believe it or not, is not all that important. As a mystery film, the mystery is figured out early in the film. So, despite this, why is the film so good--good enough that I gave it a 9 and many consider it their favorite film ever? Well, the Coen Brothers' bizarre and surreal style really make this film and off the top of my head I can only think of two of their films I liked better, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY (their most underrated film) and OH BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (their film that gets better with each viewing). This is very good company, as these two other films are absolutely brilliant--and I consider THE BIG LEBOWSKI to be much more interesting that the much ballyhooed FARGO (which, inexplicably, won two Oscars--despite not being among the brothers' best films because it's way too normal--sort of like a Coen Brothers film for those who don't get the more bizarre Coen Brothers films).What, in particular, did I like? Well, the characters were THE best part of the film--as only the Coens can create such quirky and unique characters. Simply put, there is no one like Lebowski in any of the thousands and thousands of films I'd seen before--and uniqueness is something I value most in a film. The alcoholic, lazy and hopelessly pathetic guy is like no hero you'll ever see in a film! The usual quirky characters are here as well--in spades! What I also loved were the little movies within the movie. When Lebowski got knocked out, you got to see his bizarre dreams that were more like films than dreams--particularly the one later in the film that just killed me it was so funny and stylish. Believe it or not, the dream is a phallic-filled song and dance film...directed by a famous porno director (though without actual nudity). It just has to be seen to be believed and only HUDSUCKER PROXY had stranger and more entertaining interludes. In fact, I found myself laughing out loud at this great scene...and a few more.Overall, a highly imaginative and wonderfully quirky film with very little plot and gobs of cursing. NOT family-friendly or a film to show your mother (unless you DO want to give her a heart attack), but still well worth seeing. Oh, and by the way, the version often shown on TV recently is an edited version with many of the expletives removed. The original actors provided alternative words for the f-bomb and it's done reasonably seamlessly. Frankly, I don't think it hurts the film and you still get to hear words like penis which have not been changed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Scrumptious Je Ne Sais Qua,"How mysterious certain films can be. They become addictive. I've seen Lebowski at least a dozen time and most of the times by accident. It was on TV or a friend is watching it and it is enough to catch a glimpse to be hooked, completely hooked. Last night I saw it on purpose with a couple of friends and I think I'm stating to realize what is it - A unique combination of talents all looking in the same direction --- The Coen Brothers are, probably, the only ones who know what they are seeing and the rest just trust their vision. Totally. Jeff Bridges is miraculous. His character is unique, never seen and at the same times is all of Bridges characters put together. I love him in this part and I love the Coen brothers for writing it knowing, I'm sure, that Bridges was going to give it that real, totally real surreal kind of life. Philip Seymour Hoffman, comes in to do what he does best, being memorable and then, of course, John Tarturro, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, delicious, each one of them - I'm pretty sure The Big Lebowski will be around for centuries and it will always have something to say even if we don't know exactly what.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

It's about this guy, ""The Dude"", excellently played by Jeff Bridges, who gets an unexpected visit from two thugs who soil his carpet.

"Coen film with thrills , emotion , musical numbers and humor with tongue-in-cheek","The Big Lebowskiv(1998) is an enjoyable film by Coen Brothers that packs thrills , dry humor , action , wonderful songs and numerous cinematic references . Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a stuck-in-the-70s stoner who insists on being called The Dude and loves to go bowling . He suffers a beating at the hands of thugs who are after money owed by a snutty wife who ruined some debt collectors. Being wrongly mistaken for a millionaire (David Huddleston) and along the way Jeff attempts to be compensated for his spoiled rug . While enlisting his bowling buddies (craxed, irascible John Goodman, and nice Steve Buscemi) for help while trying to find the millionaire's missing wife (Tara Reid). They figured he was a lazy, time-wasting slacker !. They were right !. Her life was in their hands. Now her toe is in the mail !. Times like these call for a Big Lebowski !. It takes guys as simple as the Dude and Walter to make a story this complicated... and they'd really rather be bowling. Lebowski: Not a man, a way of life !An amusing and funny film in which our starring is drawn into kidnapping , attempted scamming of payoff money and more bowling . Starred by some rare characters suffering several Coanesque adventures ; what the protagonists encounter along the way are a number of surprising situations and weird roles that , when all is said and done , seem like just that individual incidents that never really add up to a whole plot . While this may seem like plot-a-plenty , it's mainly a showcase for the Cohen brothers' unique texturing of style and quirky but deep roles . Includes the Cohen's pithy dialogue , it looks and sounds marvellous . The film may not have the enigmatic elegance or emotional resonance of Barton Fink or Fargo , but it is still a prime example of the Cohen's efoortless brand of stylistic and sstorytelling brilliance . The highlight showcase is a stunning musical-bowling-fantasy sequence that would have made Busby Berkely proud . Main and support cast are pretty good . Jeff Bridges gives a sympathetic acting as the ultimate L. A. slacker Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski , mistaken for a millionaire of the same name and seeking restitution for a rug. Co-stars John Goodman as a fun and loud Vietnam vet who takes any opportunity into grossy obscenities. David Huddleston as the wheel-chair-bound millionare of the same name who assigns him to recover his sluttty wife performed by Tara Reid . While John Turturro steal the show as a pervert rival bowler who loves skintight lilac jumpsuits and polishing his ball.Thanks to Roger Deakin's gleaming camerawork the film expand a colorful and luminous cinematography . T-Bone eccletic selection soundtrack and agreeable score by Carter Burwell . This fun and entertainining motion picture was well written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen . They have shared these duties on all of their films, but Joel has always been listed as director and Ethan as producer . The first Coen brothers film where both he and brother Ethan Coen are given directing and producing credits was Ladykillers (2004). Both of whom are part of the prestigious group of individuals to have won Oscars for writing , directing and producing in the same year, for the film No Country for Old Men (2007). Their career is splendid from first film : Blood simple (1984) to Arizona Baby (1987), Miller's crossing (1990) , Oh Brother ! (2000) ,Barton Fink (1991), the great Lebowski (1998), The Man Who Wasn't There (2001) , Intolerable Cruelty (2003) , Burn After Reading (2008) , A Serious Man (2009) , True grit (2010) ,among others .

"Goodman and Bridges, Oh My!","This is one of those movies I never got around to seeing. It is one of the most delightful black comedies of all time. Watching the byplay between the frenetic John Goodman and Jeff Bridges is priceless. The plot is all over the place and we are played once in a while, but the excitement is in the journey, not the end. Bridges' character is the laid back, sixties protest type who is accosted one day (a case of mistaken identity) as a couple of thugs beat him and one pees on his rug. This sets in motion and effort to find the man who shares his name and get his rug replaced (he ultimately steals one of the man's rugs). This sets off John Goodman (a poster child for anger management). They become involved in a kidnapping drop and I can't begin to explain the rest. Suffice it to say, these guys have a great chemistry and all Bridges can do is watch the dominoes fall. Goodman has made a career of playing lovable psychos for the Coen Brothers. This may be his masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
My favourite Coen brothers movie and one of the most entertaining and original comedies ever made!,"My favourite Coen brothers movie changes over the years as I watch and rewatch their amazingly original and consistently surprising oeuvre. When I first saw 'The Big Lebowski' on its original release I enjoyed it but thought it was a bit of a slight ""fun"" movie with less depth than many of their previous works. Now, a few years and several viewing later, I have come to realise just how accomplished a movie it is, and it has become one of my all time favourite movies. Other film makers have attempted to weave together various genres, styles and images in a similarly eclectic, postmodern fashion, but few do it as seamlessly and with such wit as Ethan and Joel Coen. 'The Big Lewboski' is an extremely smart film, but it doesn't shout ""look at me! Aren't I clever?"". It sucks you in from the get go, and bottom line it is FUNNY, and as it is a comedy that's what counts the most! Everything about the movie is perfect, the script, the direction, set design, costumes, and the wonderful soundtrack (one of the most brilliant ever assembled, it includes lesser known Dylan and Elvis Costello numbers, Creedence classics, and songs from cult favourites like Yma Sumac, Captain Beefheart, Moondog, Esquivel and garage gods The Monks). Plus of course the actors, who are well cast and virtually flawless. Jeff Bridges ('Fat City', 'Starman') IS The Dude, and it's impossible to think of anyone else acting the role. Coen regulars John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Peter Stomare, and Jon Polito are all on board, as well as Julianne Moore ('Boogie Nights'), David Huddleston ('Capricorn One'), Philip Seymour Hoffman ('Magnolia') and Sam Elliot ('Mask'), even surprise cameos from Ben Gazzara ('The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie') and singer Jimmie Ray Gilmore. I can't fault 'The Big Lebowski', it is one of the most original and entertaining comedies ever made and a genuine modern classic.

A Perfect Strike !,"Recently given a one night cinematic return to mark 20 years since its initial release. ""The Big Lebowski"" remains on the highpoints of the Coen Brothers remarkable career of excellence.Their farcical homage to Raymond Chandler stars Jeff Bridges, as ""The Dude"" whose real name, Jeff Lebowski drags him into a plot to ransom the wife of his namesake, played by David Huddleston. Blackmailers come to the wrong address, rugs are pissed on and threats are made. Eventually the ""Big"" Lebowski chooses ""The Dude"" to be the bag man for the ransom drop off. A decision that all involved soon come to regret.Twenty years has allowed me to watch ""The Big Lebowski"" a few times, and to be fair it's a film that improves with each watch. The plot is nothing special, in fact it's almost non-existant. The character revolve around each other and at the end of it you're no wiser as to who, if anyone, actually kidnapped Bunny (Tara Reid) or what happened to the $1M dollars. . But you come to appreciate that the plot isn't as important as the characters and what characters they are. Jeff Bridges gives a career best performance as ""The Dude""....

"boe_dye sez: it wasn't funny, it wasn't not funny, it wasn't much of anything really","Certain movies you can sort of understand why they are cult classics, other films such as this one, seem to be funny and intelligent because someone said it was funny and intelligent and therefore must be funny and intelligent.I suppose you could find deeper meaning in this, or perhaps the meaning was right there on the surface. But like many of the Coen Brothers films that I have watched I either like them or I don't.The ones that I liked usually have a strong story behind them, the ones that I don't like seem to be more of a ""day in the life of"" story about people who really don't seem to matter and about events that no one really cares about.Maybe there is some type of amusement in trivial matters, making bored college frat boys feel more intelligent then they really are, but I need something deeper for intellectual stimulation.For my comedy, I don't need slapstick or pie in the face humor to make me laugh. Cynicism, witty dialogue, sarcasm, commentary and so on, not one line random events that happen out of no where with no real context and then expected to be funny.(which is not to say that slapstick pie in the face humor doesn't make me laugh at times...) A very random film with very to little no substance to it.

The Deadbeat Lebowski,"How can anyone not dig The Dude? In a world where energetic go-getters are idolised and looked up to, it's nice to know that there are fat, indolent, scruffy, pot smoking, beer drinking bums out there taking it easy. Or they would be if people would leave their rugs aloneThe Big Lebowski is a film where the plot is entirely inconsequential; it doesn't matter. It's just a mere device to set The Dude on his way. The joy is in watching him interact with all the weirdos in Los Angeles and in listening to the dialogue  the script is the most quotable since Withnail and I. Therefore it's the perfect film to just sit back and absorb.Picking a favourite scene in a film that is jam packed with great moments and wonderful lines of dialogue is a near impossibility, but you'd be hard pressed to beat the scene with the Malibu police chief. ""I don't like your jerk-off name. I don't like your jerk-off face. I don't like your jerk-off behaviour. And I don't like youjerk-off."" And then to cap it off he throws his mug at The Dude's head. Brilliant! And making it even funnier is the scene that immediately follows it where the taxi driver throws The Dude out of his cab.But another favourite is Jesus. He only has two scenes but both are hilarious. (I hope the Coens make 'The Passion of the Jesus.') And I love the flashback where you see him knocking on doors to tell his neighbours that he's a pederast. Especially good is the way that a large, bearded man with a dirty shirt answers the door (I always crack up at the breath Jesus takes when he sees the man  I also noticed, for the first time, that Jesus in that flashback is visibly showing in his tight jeans; he's not a small guy).But then there's the scene where The Dude first meets Maude Lebowski (excellently played by Julianne Moore). ""I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but"" And I also like the little dig at the porno film they're watching: ""The plot is ludicrous."" But the comment isn't really aimed at the porno film; the film is talking about itself. It knows the plot is nonsensical but it also knows that it doesn't matter  it's best to just let it wash over you.Mentioning porno has reminded me of Jackie Treehorn. Is there a better visual gag in modern cinema than The Dude scratching a notepad for a message or telephone number only to find a cartoon of a man with a gigantic erection? Well, maybe there is, because even earlier in the film there's the moment where The Dude spends a long time making a homemade device to keep intruders out only for him to forget the fact that his door opens outwards instead of inwards  he nails a bit of wood to the floor, props a chair up to the door handle to keep people out and the very second he walks away, the door opens and the chair comes tumbling down. Pure genius!And Jackie Treehorn's brainless goons are brilliant too. ""You're not dealing with morons here."" Oh yes we are. But the film's all the better for it.But I'm not sure what my favourite line in the film would be  again it's almost impossible to pick just one. But ""I still jerk-off manually"" would have to be up there, as would virtually every line Walter spews (""The Chinaman is not the issue""). However, if I was forced (at gunpoint) to choose, I'd have to go with a piece of Dude wisdom: ""Fortunately, I'm adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regiment to keep my mind, you know, uh, limber."" And The Dude's reaction when Maude tells him that she's trying to conceive is magnificent.Yet another brilliant scene is the Larry scene. Walter and The Dude are trying to get information out of some kid but the kid just stares impassively at them, so Walter destroys his car  or what he thinks is his car. Now at this moment I could quote the real dialogue, but the TV version dialogue is perhaps even better. ""Do you see what happens, Larry? Do you see what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps?"" It's even better than: ""Fun you, melon farmer!""Then there are the nihilists. ""We believe in nothing, Lebowski. Nothing. And tomorrow we come back and we cut off your johnson."" But try as they might to intimidate, the only scary thing about the nihilists is the techno music they listen to. Well, that and their obsession with the male member.But I could quote lines from The Big Lewbowski all day. I just dig the film so much because it puts a goofy grin on my face; its stupidity is remarkably intelligent. Plus, in the end, it's actually quite heartfelt  if the film's about anything, it's about friendshipwell, that and smoking pot, drinking beer, bowling and keeping hold of your johnson. Yeah, the world's a better place with The Dude in it.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Arguably the Coen Brother's funniest work, with a superb lead in Bridges","The Big Lebowski, whether you laugh during the film or not, is assuredly one of the most laid-back of the nineties. I don't mean that by saying that its main fan-base are slackers or hippies or other, but that the whole tone of the film has that air to it. The plot the Coens construct, which is as wonderfully convoluted as a 40's mystery tale (the kinds of stories they get inspired by- The Big Sleep was most likely their title goof), almost gets in the way of the main character and his friends' lives. ""The Dude"" Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) has a good, if devoid of ""meaning"", life- he bowls constantly with his crazed, Vietnam-vet friend Walter (John Goodman, also very note-worthy) and quiet friend Donny (Steve Buscemi, a fine performance based mostly on reactions), with the occasional setback or weirdo to confront him (i.e. John Turturro's Jesus, a highlight in the film's most absurd moments). Enter in a group of deranged ex-musicians turned nihilists (which include the likes of Peter Stormare and Flea), a pornographer, and a rich man with the same name as Lebowski and his family, and the Dude's cycle is turned upside down, though not knocking into his chemical intake.On top of The Big Lebowski, at the core, one of the most odd, off-the-wall, and creative of the Coens' scripts, with a interesting story and dialog as real as it is sometimes insane, the casting is near perfect, if not so already. It's been said by the Coens that they write some of the parts specifically for the actors, and it shows because it's pulled off. Aside from some usual Coen regulars that don't disappoint, Bridges, for lack of a better term, displays his versatility in taking on this role. Often his roles are of the normal-Joe or the businessman, but what the Coens see is that with the right character he can be funny, and make the people around him just as funny. Not to say there aren't serious parts in the film, where he's put into a rut of conflict by way of the plot. But by the time the audience starts to shift its mindset, another strange, surreal, and/or hallucinogenic bit is kicked in.Throw in some unique production design, and Roger Deakins' expert eye on the scenes (will there ever be another film that captures bowling the way this film does, or at least in such scope and lack of subtlety?), and The Big Lebowski ends up as a cult classic. Not the kind of film that could really play for long in a multiplex (it made back its budget during its run, but not by much), yet one that will continue to have at least a little relevance in not just the indie crowd and Coen fans, but with the kinds of movie viewers who like to have a film on during a party or get-together. In fact, I'd say this beats films like Dazed and Confused and Mallrats as being something that can appeal to a younger (and older, depends) viewing crowd with its ridiculous set-pieces and still be a considerable artistic achievement. Look at it this way, think of the silliest, though smartest Cheech and Chong or Three Stooges film you've seen, and when filtered through a mindset that's loaded with European and film-noir influences, and you'll get The Big Lebowski. Not to mention it's one of the most quotable comedies of the 90's, and has a toe-tapping soundtrack. A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Entertaining,"'The Big Lebowski' is entertaining.Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are a fun duo, I even would've enjoyed this 1998 flick more if it was just those two for the whole near 2 hours.

Speaking of 'Prison Break', Jonathan Krantz is also in this!The film starts like a house on the fire, I did find the rest of it - particularly the middle portion - a little (emphasis on 'little') less as the story is stretched out a tad, though all in all it gave me a good time and I'd happily rewatch it no doubt.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Is Maude based on Hepburn fron Suddenly Last Summer?,"I just saw the Tennesse William's film Suddenly Last Summer the other night and I found there to be a distinct similarity between Katherine Hepburn's character Violet and Julianna Moore's Maude from The Big Lebowski.  Now I don't think that Maude is a copy of Violet but if you listen to the way she talks and the way she leads a conversation you can hear a distinct similarity between them.  The best part of the movie to make this comparison is when Hepburn is showing Montgomery Clift around her son's garden and the way she talks about flowers and her niece Catherine (Elizabeth Taylor) and then compare that to when Maude first meets The Dude and she is talking about art, the female form, sex, and her step mother Bunny.  I don't know, maybe it's just me.  For other Cohen Brother inspiration check out The Alan Ladd/Veronica Lake film ""The Glass Key,"" as inspiration for ""Miller's Crossing,"" and check out Akim Tamiroff as Uncle Joe Grande in ""Touch of Evil"" as a model for several characters that Jon Polito plays in a bunch of Cohen Brother's movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A lifestyle film of the aging hippie,"The Big Lebowski is a rare comedy in that it makes you laugh at the reasons for the Dude's behavior rather than at the absurdity of the situations he is in.  It's not a detective/comedy and it sure as hell isn't a bowling comedy; it's a lifestyle movie with wonderfully written characters.  Jesus is a perfect example of comedic genius with a flat character.  He's a pedophile bowler that has the ability to intimidate guys like the Dude, who probably doesn't really even care enough to be intimidated. But that's the type of conflict that this movie deals with.  The Dude and Walter never really learn any lesson or go through any major character changes.  You must keep in mind that this movie is just a crazy story whose main purpose is to express the comedic traits within the characters.  Fans of character conflict should love this aspect.  Those looking for a buildup and climax may not appreciate the story so much.  The whole detective story is given to the audience blatantly.  But, like the Dude, you become wrapped up in the craziness of all the distractions from the cast of characters such as Autobahn that are thrown into the mix.  So when the story ends, you feel like the Dude; someone who just drifted along as everything sort of passed right by you. But worrying about all of it would be very un-Dude.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Very Funny, But Not Film Noir - The Big Lebowski","I have been reviewing the top 100 film noir movies of all time (or 100 of the best, if not the best). And for some reason, this film was on the list. Believe me when I tell you that this movie has about as much to do with film noir as the original Frankenstein has to do with comedy. It is as funny as hell; and there are numerous outstanding performances. Among them are Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is hilarious, John Turturro, who is about as Hispanic as I am, but still very funny, Julianne Moore, who is a first-rate actress with a great sense of humor, and, of course, Jeff Bridges, who has his role of a lifetime in this film.I am a big Buscemi fan, but I did not find his role that ..satisfying. And the content for John Goodman's character was overly offensive to Vietnam Veterans (particularly the buddies with their faces in the mud lines). Goodman, who is a fine actor in both straight and comedic roles, was good in this one, despite the unfortunate dialogue he had to spew about Vietnam vets. The stereotype of the crazed Vietnam veteran was also not helped by this portrayal. Most Vietnam veterans are not crazed; we are relatively average.I do not know what Roger Ebert was drinking when he reviewed this film, but to classify it as noir is almost as silly as the film itself. Yes, there are mild noir elements in the film, but you could say the same thing about Steve Martin's Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, which was not as funny as this movie, but had about the same noir content (which was about none). Seriously, folks, how many of you consider Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid a noir classic?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

That Rug Really Tied the Room Together,"Acting is one of the most key elements to success or failure of a film. Some film types can survive without superb acting. These motion pictures can entertain the viewer with special effects or intense action scenes. A film based on heavy dialog and back-story can not survive with out excellent actors. One such movie that meets the dialog-based criterion is The Big Lebowski. The film follows Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) and his two close friends through a not so normal chain of events. The story is augmented by the supporting characters Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi). Written by Joel and Ethan Coen, the creative forces behind Fargo, the intriguing story succeeds because of the actors' impeccable skill.As with many other films by the Coen brothers The Big Lebowski is an odd array of out of the ordinary characters slapped right in the middle of an improbable situation. The Dude is an unlikely hero living in the city of Los Angeles who becomes embroiled in a botched kidnapping. This is not the average kidnapper comedy that has been seen a thousand times before. The Coen brothers take a fresh look at an old tired subject. The story they have created is intriguing and entertaining, but the true entertainment comes from the unique characters. Walter, played by John Goodman, is a Vietnam veteran who seems to have some parts of post traumatic stress syndrome. Donny, another one of The Dude's close friends, is a quiet unassuming character who often interjects into conversation, but no one pays close attention to what he says.As well as these characters are written, they would not be as effective had they been played by other actors. This effectiveness of acting can be seen in the opening scene at the bowling alley where the supporting characters are first introduced. This scene is comprised of Donny, Walter, and The Dude sitting at their lane in the bowling alley discussing the attack on The Dude by some hired thugs (7min 25 sec). The Dude is approaching the situation in his usual lackadaisical way. Jeff Bridges conveys The Dude's overall demeanor in his laid back, sauntering, walk. Although being laid back, Bridges is direct in his speaking showing that The Dude is not the average confused old stoner. Bridges facial expressions during this scene show The Dude is distressed about the loss of his rug which 'tied the room together.'Donny seems to be an outside observer in this scene and throughout much of the film. Buscemi conveys his character's attention during discussion by following the flow of the conversation with his head. He looks from The Dude to Walter and from Walter to The Dude depending on who is talking. He may seem to be paying attention, but his asking of simple questions dispels this assumption. Another technique Buscemi uses is while he is observing the conversation he furrows his brow as if in deep thought and contemplation. This look of concentration is juxtaposed with the look of confused happiness, an empty smile, Buscemi uses when Donny makes a point in the conversation. These techniques which are introduced by Bridges and Buscemi early in the film are used throughout the entire picture.Although Bridges and Buscemi do an excellent job of introducing their characters traits to the viewer, Goodman superbly shows his character's inner traits. Throughout the conversation it is apparent due to dialog that Walter is becoming upset. Goodman conveys this anger with facial expressions and body movement. In the early part of the conversation Goodman puts on a stone face to show that Walter is firmly set in his position. The Dude begins to agitate Walter as the conversation continues. Goodman shows this agitation by furrowing his brow, leaning forward while talking, and turning progressively redder. As Goodman continues, his speaking becomes more staccato and flustered. When The Dude refers to one of the attackers as 'the china man,' Walter continues on his tirade momentarily then quietly addresses the non politically correct nature of The Dude's comment. Changing from this aggravated manner of speaking to a more politically correct and lower tone shows that Walter has some sudden mood swings and a short fuse, as he returns to his tirade quickly.This scene exemplifies the acting skills of John Goodman, Jeff Bridges, and Steve Buscemi. The characters in this story have been given interesting and entertaining dialog by the writers, but it is up to the actors to make the characters exude a certain feeling or trait. In each of their roles the three main actors add a level of feeling to the characters that is lacking from many of the offerings of the dark comedy genre. Goodman's portrayal of Walter as the 'know it all' with a short fuse is downright hilarious. Jeff Bridges steps out of his usually serious persona to portray a character as laid back as they come, 'quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles county.' Steve Buscemi is as entertaining as ever. His depiction of Donny, the character to rarely speak, adds depth to an otherwise bland side character. After viewing this film one can see why actors who can actually practice their craft are worth their weight in gold.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"This is just, like, my opinion, man","At first glance, The Big Lebowski appears to be a film about a man seeking compensation for a soiled rug. For that reason, I delayed watching it for years, anticipating that it would be difficult viewing.In actuality, The Big Lebowski is a pleasure to watch. This is largely because it allows the audience to inhabit the headspace of the Dude, who moves through life unperturbed by external events and material losses. In seeing the world from the Dude's perspective, the viewer is encouraged to avoid getting caught up in the frustrations of daily life and instead cultivate inner contentment, or at least a more laid back attitude. In some ways, the film is disorienting because of the many repetitions in dialogue and setting. I believe this is a conscious choice by the Coens, intended to bring the audience further into alignment with the Dude by emulating the echoes and flashbacks that would be rife in the mind of a 48 year old stoner.Some critics suggest that in seeking compensation for his rug, the Dude is expressing a latent desire for order and meaning. I disagree with this interpretation. The Dude's uncharacteristic attachment to the rug is what embroils him in a string of calamitous events that test his equanimity. In my view, this is intended to convey that suffering is caused by attachment to material objects. The Coen brothers have rejected the notion that the film is conveying any particular message, so there is no definitive answer here.This film inspired me to try my first White Russian (or as it is jokingly called in the film, a Caucasian) the following day. Unfortunately, I had an allergic reaction to the beverage and fainted in my driveway before being taken to hospital.

The tremendous dependence on a single expletive and its many forms became dull and boring after the first five minutes during which it was used about 100 times. The two scenes in which a topless woman appeared were obviously inserted just so she could be shown, but there was no point other than that one. The scene in which a Corvette was destroyed was completely predictable, and it unfolded in a strange way, and then faded away.Julianna Moore was the best part of the film, and Joe Pesci's talents were wasted on a trivial part for which he clearly had no enthusiasm.Jeff Bridges practiced in his role for his academy award as the character was identical.Once again, Hollywood insists that all drug usage is good, lack of moral character is good, drinking is good, and being a bum is good if you have a heart of gold.The film was long, too.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Respectable Raunch,"The Coen brothers (Joel and Ethan) are the most innovative and, perhaps, the best filmmakers working today. Or they at least rank along side the likes of Martin Scorsese and rising director star Quentin Tarantino. Think about it: ""Blood Simple"" was the best film of 1984; ""Raising Arizona"" was the best film of 1987; ""Miller's Crossing"" was the best movie of 1990; ""Barton Fink"" was the best movie of 1991; and ""Fargo"" was the best movie of 1996. Now comes their latest effort, ""The Big Lebowski,"" which, while it isn't in quite the same league as the above films, is still one of the most thoroughly entertaining movies of 1998.It tells the shambling story of a man named Jeff Lebowski, who calls himself The Dude (Jeff Bridges). The Dude's apartment gets broken into and a thief urinates on his rug. He finds out that the criminals were not looking for him, but looking for the OTHER Jeff Lebowski, the disabled millionaire (played by David Huddleston). That's all I can tell you. The rest is really too bizarre and complicated to put into words; but it's bizarre and complicated in the best ways of the words.Still, what I'll remember most about ""The Big Lebowski"" is the outstanding number of utterly terrific performances. Bridges delivers the best performance of his career and probably the best of the year as a bum lie-about who just wants to be left alone. John Goodman is the real comic gem here as the forever-loudmouthed Walter, The Dude's bowling partner and best friend. Steve Buscemi co-stars as the dimwitted, bug-eyed Donny, the third bowling partner; there's a small but interestingly offbeat spot for Julianne Moore; and John Torturro stops in, as Jesus the bowler, for what is probably the best walk-on performance in years. If you are a Coen brothers fan or like humor that is distinctly offbeat, you have found your movie.

The script is funny although it's not one that would have you on the floor crying with laughter. The comedy is enhanced with excellent delivery and such memorability. There was a few scenes that had me desperate for air from laughing. Particularly the ending scene and the scene in which the dude nails a block of wood to the floor and put a chair against it for protection. Only to find it's an out swinging door.

I Was A Bit Underwhelmed By This Film...,"First of all, I love the Coen brothers. Just about every one of their films is stunningly written, with enough wit in their dialogue to rival Tarantino in his 'Pulp Fiction' form. Stunningly directed, riotously funny and brimming with unique and colourful characters, their films are always a pleasure to watch.Jeff Bridges portrays Jeffrey Lebowski, a man who'd rather just be called The Dude. However, when criminals mistake him for a rich Jeffrey Lebowski (The Big Lebowski), a misinformed break-and-entry results in The Dude's prized rug getting urinated upon. ""That rug really held the room together,"" a dejected Dude remarks, and so he goes to visit The Big Lebowski, whom he considers responsible for such an unpleasant occurrence. Little does The Dude realise that his visit will bring about considerable more trouble than just a soiled rug...'The Big Lebowski,' like most Coen brothers' films, is certainly a funny and reasonably well-written story, however, I found myself slightly underwhelmed by it. A lot of the time, it felt like weird characters were simply thrown into the mix simply to be weird, without serving any real purpose. I'm yet to work out the reasons for including the Stranger (Sam Elliott), whose cowboy-type character narrates the the beginning and the end of the story, with a brief cameo appearance somewhere in the middle. The completely unnecessary breaking of the ""fourth wall"" at the end of the film just seemed out of place with the rest of the story. And how did the Stranger even know about the Dude's story, having just exchanged a few words with him at the bowling bar? It beats me, but perhaps I'm just completely missing the point.However, these grievances aside, it must be said that there are many genuinely funny moments in this film, most of them arising from John Goodman's perfectly-played character, Walter Sobchak. With stunning comedic timing, the Coen film regular (Barton Fink, O Brother Where Art Thou) hilariously spouts out his well-written dialogue, which usually (for no apparent reason) references Sobchak's own service in the Vietnam War, or otherwise belittles his under-appreciated and often-ignored bowling partner Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi).'The Big Lebowski' is a funny film, and well worth your time. However, I was simply unable to take it seriously as a film (nor should I have tried), so I couldn't rate it any higher. It just didn't have the professional class of the Coen brothers' other films...",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
He's The Dude man!,"The story's message is very simple as in all Coen Brothers' movies, 
the symbolism is so subtle and exquisite as in all Coen Brothers' movies, and every character with or without an arc or a sub-plot has a thing to do in the movie's plot or at least make you appreciate the movie even more than you do, but despite all that the redundancy of using the allegory by using many characters and sub-plots with the fast pacing could make you feel the movie's story is very sophisticated and convoluted even it's not. Also, I found some characters haven't been merged well with the plot (even they are very meaningful like the rest of the characters as I said). That being said, these issues didn't bother me at all as I was so invested in each character and I really enjoyed every second in the movie.Jeff Bridges maybe give the best performance in his career. It's really a shame he didn't get an Oscar nomination for his vivid and stellar performance in The Big Lebowski. 
John Goodman was great, and he had a wonderful chemistry with Steve Buscemi as well as with Jeff Bridges.
Philip Seymour Hoffman didn't have a lot of time on the screen but he was so hilarious.Roger Deakins did an awesome job as usual and crafted not just a beautiful cinematography but also a very smart and shiny one that has aged (and will age) very well.The soundtrack maybe is one of the best soundtracks ever put to movie. It's a very very underrated one.The Big Lebowski is a delightful ride.

I do not get it.,"Absolutely unwatchable. Tried it twice, figuring one attempt wasn't sufficient.I am not offended by vulgar language, but when it is such a major portion of the dialogue, it had better be with good reason and to great effect. Neither is the case, here.These characters are the types of people that normal people with lives pass by numerous times a day without taking any notice. There is a reason for that. Folks like that are uninspiring, dull, and generally useless to the world they inhabit. Centering a movie script on them is going to make you a dolt or a genius, depending how sycophantic your fan base is. It seems too many people checked their good judgment at the door - not only giving this movie a free pass, but pumping up the votes to the extent that this turd rates in the Top 250.

"A celebration of the ultimate man, nay, the ultimate dude","I'd heard a lot of bad press about this movie. Not as good as Fargo, was a much used phrase. I wasn't overly impressed with Fargo, the atmosphere just didn't click for me, but anyway, that made me a little apprehensive about this.It's easily better than Fargo, IMHO, and it's right up there with Barton Fink or Miller's Crossing. A true comedy classic with so many memorable lines and characters, but it's the movie's atmosphere which is so truly joyous, a wonderful celebration of basically doing nothing. Achieving one's goals is important, yes, but it's okay to set them low, is what I perceived this movie to be saying. As long as one is basically a good guy, then that's enough. Well, that's what it seemed like to me, and it was expressed so beautifully in the stunning cast of grotesques, lovely music ( although more Burwell would have been nice ), and the trippiest, funniest, most absurd dream sequences you've ever seen. Great stuff.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great Movie if your in the mood for stupid comedy,The movie manages to be a lot of things and once and they all contradict each other. the movie is simple yet not. the amount of characters that show up for 30 seconds in this movie and never come back is also astounding. i'd recommend this movie to mostly everyone i'd see but there is absolutely no guarantee everyone is gonna like it. but if they do like it. they're gonna like it a lot. 8/10,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Excellent dark comedy meets neo-noir,"Too many reviews to really say anything new here, but it's no exaggeration to say that this film is an institution in and of itself. Such a twisty, entertaining and hilarious plot with literally every actor/actress giving some of the best performances of their lives. As usual for the Coen brothers, the cinematography, soundtrack and direction are all wonderful. At the same time ""The Big Lebowski"" is a paean to Hollywood, LA noir (a sub-genre with some excellent precedents), greed, and selflessness.You can watch this film on many levels - pure entertainment, a deeper set of character studies, and even a parable on American society that holds true to this day.The Dude is an iconic character and worth watching TBL for alone, but there is so much else going on that - if you haven't already seen it - I won't spoil for you. If I have any advice to offer, it's don't read any reviews or plot summaries prior to watching for the first time. I wish there were movies like this still being made.Also, by no means are the following films the same as TBL, but you might like them if you enjoy this.* Chinatown* Inherent Vice* Under the Silver Lake* L.

"El DUDErino, Where's my Kahlua? or my rug, man...in the parlance of our times","I first stumbled onto this movie in 1999 and happened to catch it again recently, and it just still makes me want to grab a glass, pour that Kahlua and add milk and vodka to join Jeff Bridges for oat soda and a slacking good time of a convolutely escapist and trashy experience with the odd character 'heroes' of LA. But this film is not as great a film as it is rated as it lacks truly redemptive qualities of reconciliation, or say, tying together a greater purpose behind it, let alone a great plot like say its parallels with Raymond Chandler's 1939 novel, The Big Sleep, of which it does no justice to in being loosely related. However, in another sense, it's greater purpose can be looked at differently: that since its the ultimate slacker film, it has no need for a greater purpose in the first place. But, that's just like, my opinion, man. Let's say, just like the rug that 'held the room together', Bridges, the Dude, in an oddly engaging way, was the only thing that held the film together for me. And save also for an unbelievably spaced out and unconventionally witty and nihilistic (which is ironic considering the brilliant Coen brothers seemed to be mocking nihilists) script, not the plot, the film is one of the most anti-establishment in terms of relativism.Of course, there is a certain sad genius to it all, owing in some sense to the elements that lie in the film's references to double crossing and pseudo complications, of course, with updated time-lines (1991- Sad'm and I-raq) and anti-yuppie achievement ethos coupled with unconventional 'heroes', that is complete with the standard issue oddball fest of characters in Coen Bros parlance (they seem to be competing with Fellini for numbers of colorful characters). This film's best bits are in fact not the parallels with the Big Sleep but its unpredictably predictable plot directions which may be part underbelly psychological black comedy and part pseudo film noir laced with double entendres. The plot is not the main steal, rather its almost a straw man, as it is just a vehicle for the hilariously zany dialog between characters' to platform itself. Want to know just how insane the dialog was? Read the memorable quotes from the film on the Internet. There are even parallels in this film that might lead some to speak of a religion in 'Dudism' and its enlightenment of non-ideals, and I bet there are some crazed converts out there right now, lost in its futility. Nonetheless, because of these slacker ideals and the Dude's apathy or value system (relativism) toward life, and however I feel about the futility of it all, obviously, the 'Dude' character must have been classic enough to warrant such attention.In the story, The Dude obviously steals the plot, for without him there is no impetus, after all, the plot is that he is forced out of slack jawed Bohemia as a result of his rug getting micturated on by a pornographer's thugs whose boss wants cash owed by the young trophy wife of a rich tycoon who is his namesake. Hilarity ensues under series after series of incredulous circumstances when the Dude asks the Bigger Lebowski for compensation and in turn gets the Big L offering a 'cash' job for him. The dude loses the 'cash' only to find he the had been duped in a 'ringer for a ringer' when the paraquat tycoon wanted his porn acting wife dead and handed him an empty briefcase. The Dude assumed the wife kidnapped herself, and then later discovers that nihilists want a share of the money and are out to kill him. Big L's daughter gets acquainted with the Dude as she opposes the plan, and a PI trails the Dude looking for the wife, who in the end, had just gone away for the weekend, in a shock Hitchcock-esquire secondary macguffin on top of the basic macguffin of the 'rug'.Some unique film techniques are also used in this film, including blending soundtracks from previous scenes by way of songs being played on radios, or having dialog repeated, such as when the Dude constantly rehashes phrases he heard in the previous scenes (from Julianne Moore's character, Bush's speech, etc). One of the most quirky bits of the film can be described by a phrase from the Dude yet again- occasional 'acid flashbacks'- spaced out hallucination scenes where the cannabis smoking Dude flies through the bowling lane, or over LA. Making the bricolage plot even more colorful is the character of Walter, played brilliantly by John Goodman, who is a highlight of the film- representing a Vietnam scarred war veteran who associates events in the world with the horrors he has experienced. Yet, what is interesting about Walter is that it seemed he is modeled as a possible cross between the Jewish German Walter Kaufmann (the irony again) and an anarchistic gun crazy war machine- a rambunctious combination that results in lines like 'at least the Nazis had ethos' and so on. Coen fave Steve Buscemi's character adds the fragile dimension by asking the obvious questions and being constantly told to shut up in a reference to their previous hit, Fargo, before dying off unceremoniously. Likewise, many of the other characters are borderline offensive to the mainstream yet one can't help but crack up in wake of their absolutely crazy antics- the visual gag that saw the Dude trace pornographer Jackie Treehorn sketching a giant erection was an absolute nut-job and case in point. The stranger has a memorable cowboy cameo just for 'style' while Da Farino's scenes were a study in comedic nothingness. And that's what this film is- nothingness that served no purpose- I mean, as I said, it's the dude, man. El duderino for those who think brevity is...but most important now, don't forget to sip that white Russian while you slack off watching this.By Stephen Thanabalan",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A very good comedy,"The Coen Brothers were inspired to make a comedic spin of the 1946 film ""The Big Sleep"" starring Humphrey Bogart. Instead of a competent detective however, they got a incompetent bowler thrown into the situation. The funniest thing is instead of smoking cigarettes like Humphrey in ""The Big Sleep"", the dude smokes joints. Walter played by John Goodman is also excellent. Every scene he is in is practically carried by him (Pulling a gun on Smokey, the money drop at the bridge, fighting the nihilists). His constant unrelated reminders that he saw his buddies die face down in the mud in Vietnam are also very funny. The supporting cast does good too (Buschemi, Seymour-Hoffman, Moore). Highly recommend this very funny and entertaining film.

His Dudeness is Great!!!,"The Coen Brothers have a unique sense of humor which they incorporate in every one of their movies. The Big Lebowski features Jeff Bridges in the leading role of 'The Dude' or 'His Dudeness' or 'El Duderino', whatever you like better. Easily one of the coolest movie characters ever created, 'The Dude' is an unemployed guy who passes his time by playing bowling and does not give a damn about what others think of him. There happens to be another Lebowski who is a millionaire, so a couple of guys mistake the dude for him when they are looking for a payoff.Now, the eccentric plot revolves around how 'The Dude' manages to deliver a million dollars to the kidnappers of The Lebowski's wife, that is the millionaire Lebowski.The movie is filled with incredibly hilarious dialogues and some outrageous actions by the characters. The cinematography is fantastic and there are certain dream sequences which have been captured magnificently. The Big Lebowski has all the ingredients that are required for being a classic that will be remembered for decades to come.

The Dude abides,"The Coen brothers do have a special talent for magnificent opening scenes. The opening scene of ""The big Lebowski"" is very akin to the opening scene of ""No country for old men"" (2007). We see a prairi landscape and we hear a voiceover talk with a somewhat smoky old voice.But then all of sudden the city of Los Angelos appears and the voice over (quote) ""lost his train of thought"" (unquote). This is no wonder because he is introducing Jeff Lebowksi alias ""The Dude"" (played by Jeff Bridges). This character is somewhat puzzling because it seems to be a somewhat outdated hippie. When the voice over says that he is ""The man for his time and place. He fits right in there"", he could not be more wrong. ""The Dude"" still lingeres in the Woodstock period, while his friend Sobchak (John Goodman) sees everything through the spectacles of the Vietnam war.""The big Lebowski"" has a great cast but it really is the film of Jeff Bridges. Bridges is a great actor with an imposing career. As a young man he was already convincing in ""The last picture show"" (1971, Peter Bogdanovich) and more than 10 years after ""The big Lebowksi"" he was still shining in movies like ""True Grit"" (2010, Joel & Ethan Coen) and ""Hell or high water"" (2016, David Mackenzie).A funny fact is that while in ""The big Lebowski"" a kidnapping is combined with a rather dull hobby like bowling, in the previous Coen film (""Fargo"", 1996) kidnapping is combined with an even more dull hobby (collecting stamps).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Say what you will about the tenets of national socialism - at least it's an ethos,"Simply the greatest slacker film ever made. The Coen bros. script is intelligently written, with characters which, although larger than life, are both believable and hysterically funny (particularly the vitriolic John Goodman). The plot centres around the theft of 'the Dude's' rug (Jeff Bridges), and his subsequent quest for its return, which takes in nihilists, modern, improv. dance and, of course, bowling. Steve Buscemi plays a timid 'Donnie', constantly under the thumb of the domineering, Vietnam obsessed 'Walter' (Goodman). Whilst it is hard to pick an outstanding performance...John Goodman is stellar, consistently funny...but watch out for Jesus. Also, Flea has a brief cameo. All in all, a fantastic film, one of my all time top ten...I guess that sometimes there's a film which, well, it's the film for it's time and place.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Has character,"Ehm...they did not finish the story. Were we not supposed to notice or were we not supposed to care? Towards the end, Big Lebowski had about 5 or 6 story threads going, but left 2 of them loose, one of which was a relatively major one. All in all, the story ends up being kind of disappointing, though the narrative itself is not the central focus of the movie.The story is not very important because this movie thrives on characters and style. The Dude and Walter Sobchak, the main personalities played by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman respectively are unforgettable. Yes, Steve Buscemi is there with them, but he doesn't do a lot.All the characters in this film are eccentric. On the one hand, that is what gives this movie its colour, but on the other hand, his approach can feel somewhat superficial compared to simply having believable people who are different from one another in a subtle but perceivable way. You and I could come up with some crazy personalities that would be memorable, like a guy who makes racist jokes every time he appears, but that would be easy and lazy. While the Dude and Walter ultimately do work as characters within the frame of this motion picture, others do not.There are certainly humorous moments throughout the film, but there are equally few jokes that face plant. The quality of the dialogue is all over the place - can be pretty good, pretty stupid or both at the same time.There are a number of fascinating scenes, primarily the ones where the Dude is knocked out or drugged. The rock music complements the 60's aesthetic and the Dude's and Walter's 60s persona. It is safe to say that the film was going for a specific style and nailed it. It is only unfortunate that it is so much more style than substance.Big Lebowski is like the weird friend in your party who is awkward and sometimes ruins things, but he's grown on you, and you know that the party just wouldn't be the same without him. In that aspect he is very much like the main characters of this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The characters are strong and you know what they mean, regardless of whether you might agree with them or not. In this sense (character complexity) the movie is simple, but it takes this simplicity through an exquisite path of interactions and decisions.

The Big Bust,"I recently saw an interview with Jeff Bridges where he commented that he has become personally identified with ""The Dude,"" the character he plays in this movie. He also noted that ""The Big Lebowski"" has developed a cult following. The interviewer added some praise. That, together with the high rating on IMDb, convinced me to give this a shot.Early on I realized that the story was not to be taken seriously. This movie is a series of loosely connected comedy sketches (well, some hardly connected at all). The result is an absurdest comedy that had very few laughs for me.I did not find The Dude at all appealing as a person. How much is there to admire in someone whose life goals seem to be bowling and drinking white Russians? I do give Bridges credit for inhabiting the role. John Goodman's character really grated on me--his passions seem to be bowling and the f word.The positives: the scenes with John Turturro gave me some laughs; the scenes filmed from within a bowling ball were an interesting curiosity; some non sequiturs were worth a few chuckles.I guess one person's humor is another person's tedium.

A True Masterpiece,"This movie is sort of like a circus minus the clowns and the freak show; everything about it is attractive and entertaining.

The comedy comes in from all sides, whether subtle, witty, or straightforward. The Coen Brothers use stereotypes and wording like Van Gough used a brush. It is one of those few movies where almost every line is quotable and easily recognizable. Unlike most comedies (if you could call it such) the story is both followable and enjoyable.

Gets better with every viewing,"The Big Lebowski is simply a joy to watch, and gets better with every viewing. There's simply so much to see, from the absurd musical sequences to the sociopathic behavior of John Goodman's character Walter Sobchak. Just trying to make sense of the convoluted and completely ridiculous plot is a game onto itself. The movie has an enormous amount of quotable lines and the dialogue is some of the Coen brothers' finest.The characters are all imaginative and memorable, with Jeff Bridges and John Goodman wrestling for the best part. Goodman's Walter Sobchak is easily one of the most unsympathetic and frankly crazy Vietnam-vet characters in cinema, what with him constantly referring to his battles in Vietnam or spouting obscenities at everyone in sight. But Bridges' the Dude is just as charming: writing a cheque of 0,69$, crashing his car after dropping a joint on his lap and constantly drinking white russians. Even the small characters like the side-splittingly hilarious Jesus Quintana, the police chief of Malibu or the black taxi driver you will laugh at time and time again. The amount of small but memorable characters is almost too much to count.The movie has some issues, though. Because of the narrative being so convoluted and not being the point anyway, the film feels at times like a series of isolated sketches than a consistent whole. It can also be very confusing for first time viewers who will try to follow the plot. To fully enjoy this movie one has to be in a certain mindset.Recommendation: Like all Coen brothers films, The Big Lebowski is not for everyone.

The Dude endures.,"Like true heirs apparent of the great Billy Wilder, Joel and Ethan Coen can take any genre and place their own idiosyncratic DNA on it that stands head and shoulders above anyone else's. In the case of THE BIG LEBOWSKI, their follow-up to the Oscar winning FARGO, they tackle the urban milieu of Raymond Chandler.... albeit one through a drug hazed lens. It has become such a cult classic that there are Big Lebowski conventions in bowling alleys all over the world, where attendees arrive dressed up as their favorite characters.The cult status isn't limited just to conventions. In 2005, and I'm not kidding here, a religion was founded called Dudeism, also known as the Church of the Latter-day Dude, with over 200,000 ""parishioners"" devoted to the philosophies of its protagonist. If that wasn't bizarre enough, two species of spider found in Africa are also named in honor of the movie, the anelosimus biglebowski and the anelosimus dude. Even the Coens couldn't have seen all that coming.After almost three decades in the industry, Jeff Bridges has the role of a lifetime as Jeffrey ""Dude"" Lebowski, an unemployed yuppie slacker whose laziness is the stuff of legend. A former 60s radical, the Dude writes cheques for amounts as small as 69¢, smokes marijuana on more than a regular basis, is constantly late with the rent money, and enjoys bowling with his buddies Walter and Donnie. He's ingested so much pot in his life that he hardly comes up with his own sayings anymore; he just recycles other people's comments. ""This aggression will not stand"". ""The parlance of our times"". ""The Dude abides"".Returning to his bungalow one night, Dude is accosted by two thugs who mistake him for another Jeff Lebowski, a crippled millionaire whose trophy wife Bunny owes a lot of money to their boss. Realizing their error, the two leave his premises, but not before one of them relieves himself on Dude's beloved rug. It's an absolute travesty of epic proportions because....man, that rug really tied the room together!Commiserating at the bowling alley with Walter and Donnie, El Duderino is convinced to seek compensation for his rug from the other Lebowski because it was his wife they were looking for. Besides, the millionaire can afford it. Needless to say, the meeting between the dual namesakes does not go well, as the Republican ""Big Lebowski"" and His Dudeness could not be further apart in politics and lifestyle.Later on, the Dude is contacted by Big Lebowski's private secretary Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman) because it appears that Bunny has been abducted, possibly by the same goons that befouled Dude's rug. Skeptical, but enticed by a a generous fee, His Dudeness agrees to be a bagman with the ransom money. Against all logic, he allows Walter to tag along for the exchange as a bodyguard.Being a Vietnam vet, Walter has a hair trigger temper that explodes without warn, to be followed afterwards by contemplative calm. Convinced without a doubt that Bunny arranged her own abduction to extort money from her husband, Walter not only brings a gun with him, but also a valise filled with dirty underwear to use as a ringer. Thanks to his hair brained scheme, they manage to lose the undies, the ransom, and the Dude's old rust bucket of a car before the night is over....and oh, yea, and no Bunny!Feeling low, El Duderino's spirits pick up when he's contacted by Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore), the Big Guy's daughter. Maude is an avant-garde artist with a refined education and slightly clipped accent who, with her father, is
a co-trustee of the Lebowski Foundation. Apparently, the ransom money belonged to her late mother's charities and was intended for philanthropic use only. Suspicious of her much younger stepmother's kidnapping, Maude is convinced that the former adult film starlet is ""taking her father for the proverbial ride"", and hires Dude to recover the missing money, for which he will receive a handsome finder's fee.Overall, THE BIG LEBOWSKI is one big hoot, and that's like, my opinion, man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Big Lebowski,"The Big Lebowski is undoubtedly a movie you love or just like. It's whiteout a doubt a good movie. With a dynamic and rollercoaster ride story, fantastic acting, and a great set of actors and characters. But for me, besides a few funny moments, I didn't fall in love with it, and find the latter half of the movie much weaker the more convoluted it becomes.Directing is strong, creative stuff as well, the dream sequences are fun, though sometimes overstay their welcome. That said on a technical level some lovely transitions and smooth movements, aiding to the general feel of the story. By all means it's a not bog standard movie, it's very well shot. Pacing was fine, though again the latter half just adds too much to the mix.Acting and characters, the main strength of this movie (+writing). Everyone preforms their best. Shoutout to Turturro ''Jesus'' as one of the funniest and side characters and great performance (as expected, he never fails). Bridges and Goodman though, what a great combo. Goodman was fantastic. Walter as a character was infuriating, so excellent and a testament how to do a dumb character. Bridges of course is perfect. Never failed. Just fantastic all around the main hook. And oh yes, Sam Elliott.. perfect.The writing made for some iconic lines still relevant today, and if you're like me and haven't seen the movie yet some scenes just suddenly line up and you think ''I know what's coming'' but also some scenes don't and those are the funniest of the bunch. Just great writing all round, dialog writing. For the story, it's not that solid, it's convoluted, takes huge shortcuts, and all in all feels very secondary to the rest. If anything holds the movie down for me it's the story, it was neither satisfying, mysterious nor engaging enough. Imo a story with less elements that pull the Dude out would've been better. The Malibu scenes for example are wasted time. Also the blue beetle scene.Music is fun and dynamic. Nice and versatile and keeps the pacing in tact. No main score though, just known music. VFX, there's some and most of it is fine, greenscreen is noticeable but it kind of fits the style of the music that it isn't all slick and perfect.Not a movie a fell in love with and hopefully a Coen brothers movie will be able to capture me at some point.

"""This Aggression will not Stand Man""","I had been wanting to see ""The Big Lebowski"" for a long time, until I got a clean copy from it in the Blockbuster.Even though the film is superbly managed into the deep terrains of black comedy, satire and portraying the ultimate ""exaggereta"" model of the lazy American, slaking in his filthy environment; it's a repeated exercise in form, and it uses it's style too often to provoke a sense of depletion, excess and tiresomeness.Even that, Jeff Bridges does a brilliant performance (snubed by the Academy because of the fact of being a comedy role) and hilarious sidekicks like a temperamental John Goodman and a Latino stylish bowler like John Turturro.""The Big Lebowski"" is a good comedy, with a slick, smart script, recommended for the audiences that do not target comedies in a mass-like way and enjoy acid and dark moments and laughing out loud, man.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Affectionate stoner comedy,"I've never been a huge fan of American stoner comedies; as somebody who is staunchly anti-drugs, the type of humour in these movies doesn't appeal and I usually just find them dumb. Not so with THE BIG LEBOWSK, the cult classic movie by the Coen brothers; this one's well-written and features an endearing cast of typically kooky characters in a plot that is very reminiscent of the Coen brothers style.Jeff Bridges plays the likable lead as an exasperated chump who refuses to lose his mild-mannered world view despite getting mixed up in a plot involving reclusive millionaires and revolutionary weirdos. It helps that he has a fine supporting cast, in particular John Goodman who is cast completely against type as a far-right nut job who word has it was modelled on John Milius. Steve Buscemi is also a delight, even though he doesn't appear much; I tend to find everything that comes out of this guy's mouth to be completely hilarious.The script is incessantly profane and yet, as in a Tarantino movie, the bad language has a natural flow and rhythm to it; it never feels forced or unpleasant. The oddball plot flows along nicely and there are few slow spots or mistakes along the way (an excruciating turn from Julianne Moore unwisely attempting a British accent being my only real problem with this). THE BIG LEBOWSKI, although not my favourite Coen brothers movie due to the subject matter, is a lot of goofy fun nonetheless.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A wonderful and very funny movie,"The story of the big lebowski is as difficult as funny. It begins with a lazy man in Los Angeles who's parents named him Jef Lebowski, but he prefers if people call him ""the dude"", played magnificently by Jeff Bridges. One evening two men come into his house and confuse the dude with Jeff Lebowski, a millionaire, where they want to steal from. One of the two ""pees"" on his rug and the dude wants a new rug. That's where the trouble starts. His bowling-mates Ronny (Steve Buscemi)and Walter (John Goodman)try to help him but do more harm than good, Jeff Lebowski's wife gets kidnapped and the dude has to help her back. But is she really kidnapped, is she really his wife and what's doing Maude Lebowski(great role by Julianne Moore)in all of this? Between all this adventure they have to play a tournament and might meet the incredible Jesus (John Turturro), who is a great bowler but ""also a pervert"". The movie contains hilarious scenes and unbelievable trips and is packed with great one liners. The dude is an anti-hero who does the things his way and most of the time, that's very relaxed. It's also relaxed for us as a viewer and the dude at some way is even inspiring. Maybe the Coen brothers made with Fargo a better movie, i was caught immediately by this one and since then i seen it over and over again but i never got bored. The film is based on a friend of the Coen brothers, who called himself the dude and Jeff bridges did nothing more for to make this movie then to eat and drink. ""the easiest preparation i ever had for a role"" as he said. It proved that he did his preparation well and its actually strange he didn't even get an Oscar nomination for it.

The Movie to End All Other Movies,"This my absolute favourite film of all time. I love most of the Coen brothers' work, but this is their masterpiece. I love films that have a strong sociopolitical message but are not melodramatic and instead bring it in a more fun or subtle way. This film delivers great commentary in promoting pacifism and nihilism, but at the same time it's a hilarious comedy, and a parody of the neo-noir genre (even the title itself is a nod to neo-noir, referring to the 1946 noir classic ""The Big Sleep""). And most importantly, it does all those things perfectly.""The Big Lebowski"" is a film about nothing, but that's kind of the point. Like in film noir, the plot is overcomplicated. Even the Coen brothers themselves have admitted to not even being able to entirely follow it. It's about the journey, man. The crime in this case is very ironic and satirical. Our 'detective' is a slacker who calls himself ""The Dude"" and spends his days bowling and smoking weed. Our crime is that said Dude is the victim of theft: his rug has been micturated upon and stolen. And that makes The Dude very upset, because it really tied his room together. Much potential for comedy in that plot, and the script more than delivers. Almost every line in the film is laugh-out-loud funny and the actors in the film all have brilliant comedic timing. Superb casting.In this film, the Coen brothers seriously criticise the war. The Dude's sidekick, Walter, is a Vietnam war veteran and look what it did to him. The poor guy is seriously disturbed. It is even mentioned that The Dude's disabled name double, Jeffrey Lebowski, is in a wheelchair because of the war.
The film also conveys the message that money doesn't buy happiness (which is a theme the Coen brothers have played with in most of their films). Almost all the characters (even the self-proclaimed 'nihilists') are after money and nothing good comes of it in the end.
In the end, the Coen brothers are promoting The Dude's pacifist and abstemious lifestyle.""The Big Lebowski"" is a perfect film that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good comedy. Everything in this film stands out, from the acting to the writing to the music to Roger Deakins' fantastic cinematography (those dream sequences!). 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Humor is not the strength of this movie, the other things do","I like the way coen brothers write and direct this movie. He always made ""above average films"" in his history. In this movie, he try different thing, it's to make a comedy genre films. But i think he specialize at character depth. Every movie he made such as ""no country for old men"" and ""true grit"" have very strong lead character depth in the films. And he also success in ""the big lebowsky"", the characters depth portrayal (Dude,Walter,Donny,nearly all of the actor and actress) were very exceptional and convincing.Some people said the best thing from this movie was it's humor, they said it's clever. But not for me, this movie has more artistry inside. the strenght of this movie definitely not from it's humor, but from the other things such as character performances, photography, rich script, art-decoration, and music although they're not reach a word ""superb"". We can't compare the humor from ""the big lebowsky"" with ""monty python and the holy grail"" (most intellect comedy), TBL was nothing. But when you see the performances, it is unbelievable. Dude portrayal was astounding even dude was a hard role to play but he did it, and the supporting all took part also. the music really match with the genre of the movie. The script was soft and light but it's clever, not too much badwords like comedy genre movie nowadays.For me, this movie has good entertaining aspect.

Not perfect but wonderfully imaginative and humorous,"When a case of mistaken identity results in a Chinese man urinating on the rung of Jeff `The Dude' Lebowski, the dude looks to his millionaire namesake to compensate him.  When the man's young wife is kidnapped, the dude is brought in to help drop off the money and get her back.  However when things go wrong he begins to see it is not as simple as he was led to believe.Although they can often be too clever for their own good (well, sometimes  not often) this is one of their cleverest and most imaginative out and out comedies.  The plot is unnecessarily complicated but only serves to give the film a larger than life feel as one unusual event follows another unlikely one!  While it all very much comes to naught, the delivery is the key.  In terms of laughs it is lighter than one might expect from a comedy in the imdb top 250, however it delivers a constant state of amusement as well as some laugh out loud moments  it's just not that type of humour is all.However the dialogue is very quotable and funnier the more you know it and understand the lines.  What makes it feel much more imaginative is the many inspired scenes that run through the film  mostly dream sequences set up as big musical numbers  but also the sheer weight of unusual characters who come to life so easily and are very funny to watch.  Part of this is with the cast of course and they all pretty much do a good job.  Bridges is simply made for this role and fills it so easily.  Goodman gives a great performance and steals many of his scenes while Buscemi does good work but in a much different role.  Character actors like Huddleston, Hoffman and Stormare all give good support while Turturro is incredibly memorable despite only having a few minutes of screen time.  I wasn't sure about Moore but she was OK and didn't slow things too much for me.Overall this is one of the Coen's most enjoyable comedies to date.  I know Intolerable Cruelty is out soon and I'll see what that's like, but so far this film just has so much creative energy and imagination that, although all a bit much and not a perfect film, it is very hard not to enjoy.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
It has its flaws but it is also extremely entertaining and one of the Coen Brothers' best films.,"If you were a fan of ""Fargo,"" you might just like ""The Big Lebowski,"" a bizarre comedy whose hero (if that is the appropriate word) is played by Jeff Bridges as a spaced-out junkie who lives in Los Angeles, unemployed, with a trashy apartment and few belongings. His name is Lebowski, but he is known by his friends as The Dude, and he prefers that moniker rather than his birth name.Every evening Dude goes bowling with his best buddies, Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi). Walter is a Vietnam veteran, and in his perception, all incidents relate to the war. ""What does the Vietnam War have to do with anything?"" Dude asks him at a fragile moment in both their lives. Instead of disputing, Walter gives him a big bear hug.The story begins with a humorous and self-aware voice-over by the narrator, played by Sam Elliot in a few recurring cameos. He informs us that Dude's adventure started on an eventful night not very long ago, when a duo of criminals broke into his house in search of The Big Lebowski, a local millionaire who happens to share Dude's last name. After dunking Dude's face into a toilet bowl and realizing that they've attacked the incorrect individual, the pair of idiots urinate on Dude's rug and flee the apartment.Dude figures that the only man truly responsible for the incident is Lebowski himself, so he makes a trip out to his mansion and is informed by Lebowski's assistant (portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman with the perfect amount of nervousness) that Lebowski's wife has been kidnapped and is being held for ransom. Suspecting that she is in the custody of the two men who attacked Dude, Lebowski offers the slacker a chance to be the courier of his ransom fee. ""Her life is in your hands,"" Lebowski tells him. He promises him some cash to transport a briefcase containing the money, and Lebowski agrees to help him out.Unfortunately, the kidnappers never receive their ransom, and Dude's car is stolen, along with Lebowski's money. It just so happens that Lebowski's unfaithful wife owed some money to a trio of German nihilists, as well as an adult filmmaker and an assortment of other odd creatures, and now Lebowski is being targeted for the cash. Everyone seems to think that the briefcase is in his possession, and he is threatened that he will lose his ""Johnson"" unless it is returned. Fearing for his life (and more importantly, his Johnson) Dude takes comfort in Walter, who tracks down the 15-year-old teenager who stole the car and the briefcase and has apparently bought a sports car with a small portion of the briefcase's contents. ""See this Tommy? This is what happens when you mess with a stranger!"" Walter yells at the boy as he single-handedly demolishes the sports car. We all anticipate the obvious punch line far ahead of time, but the result is nevertheless extremely funny.The Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, are extremely gifted filmmakers. They burst onto screens across the nation in 1984 with their indie classic ""Blood Simple,"" which starred Frances McDormand and Dan Hedaya, the former of whom would later star in ""Fargo"" as the bumbling police officer Marge Gunderson.As usual, the Coens fall back on their quirky characters for comic relief and enjoyable antics, particularly Buscemi, who is one of the best character actors in Hollywood, and who also manages to be funny in whichever role he chooses - despite having to say anything funny at all. In ""Fargo"" he was the blundering kidnapper, Carl, and in ""The Big Lebowski,"" he lets his hair part across his head and hang low across his face, completely changing his entire pattern of speech. He's the goofy little squirt who tags along with Dude and Walter, and manages to repeat everything they say and ask questions about discussions long after they have ended. ""You're like a child who has wandered into the middle of a movie and wants to know what's going on!"" Walter tells him. ""What's your point, Walter?"" he asks. But it's the innocent nature of his tone that leads us to like him, and it's Walter's crazy antics that makes us feel attached to him, and it's The Dude's trademark humor that makes us enjoy watching him. The Coens have succeeded at making a great comedy with characters that actually have their own characteristics.But it is the Coens' eloquent use of proverbial language that is really what elevates the film above all else. The script is wonderful and witty. This has some of the best dialogue I have ever heard, ranking up there with ""Pulp Fiction"" and the work of Elmore Leonard. Walter's rants consume much of the dialogue, which I think is fine.""The Big Lebowski"" is a movie with considerably large structural flaws and weaknesses. Yet the film seems to know this, letting the audience in on the secret during the introductory voice-over narration. ""Aw, I've lost my train of thought,"" we're told, as The Stranger mumbles on about the movie's plot. And towards the end, we're all told by The Stranger that he sincerely hopes we enjoyed the story, even if it's nothing special. Yup, that about sums it all up. ""The Big Lebowski"" is a movie with a lot of joy, wit, and wicked humor: three reasons you've got to see one of the most enjoyable films of the past decade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Let the good times bowl!,"The Coen brothers reached what may have been their zaniest with ""The Big Lebowski"", about stoner Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) getting mistaken for a tycoon (David Huddleston), leading to complete wackiness; needless to say, the wacky factor dominates. Along with Jeff, there's his slacker friends: the motormouth Walter (John Goodman) and the loopy Donny (Steve Buscemi). As for the side characters, I liked Maude's (Julianne Moore) remark about conception, and the narrator's (Sam Elliott) note about Saddam Hussein. It's just a great, hilarious, even humanizing movie. Also starring are John Turturro as a sex offender, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as a servant. FYI, when John Goodman said all that stuff about Judaism, you may have thought that it was total nonsense given his character, but it was all totally accurate.To think: John Goodman starred in four movies within two months.

Enjoyed most of the movie but did not appreciate the neocon propaganda peppered throughout!,"Think what you want of Saddam (I think of him as a traitor to his people) but the fact is he was a paid CIA employee dating back to 1959 (probably earlier), when he was part of a CIA-authorized six-man squad tasked with assassinating then Iraqi Prime Minister Gen Abd al-Karim Qasim (who was an asshole as well but he was our asshole until he made a fatal mistake and he in CIA terms had to go). The first attempt failed but eventually in February 1963 Qasim was killed in a Baath Party coup which was followed by an orgy of bloodshed. The leftists were all murdered and the lists of those to be killed were supplied by the CIA! Saddam eventually became dictator of Iraq and we played him like an instrument. George Bush Sr. needed to look strong so April Glaspie, (our Ambassador to Iraq) when approached by Saddam regarding Kuwait invited him to invade Kuwait by stating the following: ""We have no opinion on your Arab-Arab conflicts, such as your dispute with Kuwait. Secretary Baker has directed me to emphasize the instruction, first given to Iraq in the 1960s, that the Kuwait issue is not associated with America."" We were setting him up to make Bush Sr. look like a strong leader. Anyone who spent the least amount of time reading between the lines knew this at the time, yet a horrible slaughter ensued that was so freaking unnecessary, but hey ""money trumps peace"" (quote from George Bush Jr.), in reality actually it's really more than just money! Okay enough of my rant to sum it up I loved the movie but cringed at the unnecessary propaganda that conveniently predated the release of the PNAC position paper! The performances were magnificent especially Jeff and John. I encourage everyone to watch it but be aware it's really a propaganda piece designed to get you ready for the next Iraq war!

Classic Comedy with Some Terrific Performances,"Big Lebowski, The (1998)*** (out of 4)""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) gets mistaken for a millionaire Lebowski and soon he's pulled into a big mystery when that rich guy's skank girlfriend is kidnapped by some unknown men. Soon The Dude must try and figure out who's pulling all the strings but of course in between his bowling league and dope. The ""plot"" of THE BIG LEBOWSKI is probably the least important thing because as a mystery it really doesn't work for a couple reasons. One is that it's too easy to figure out what really happened and the second is that you really don't care too much. The movie works because of the terrific characters and I don't think it's an overstatement to say that they're some of the most memorable of any film of the decade. The screenplay by the Coen brothers works so well because the characters are so well developed and they've gotten some incredibly talented actors to bring them to life. Even the smallest parts in the film feature a fair number of known actors including a few who would go onto win Oscars. The entire film goes around Bridges who is pitch-perfect as The Dude. This laid back type of character is one Bridges had been playing for decades by this point but add in the dope, the strange dialogue and the supporting characters and you can say you've never seen a lazy bum like this one. Bridges is just so believable in the part that you not once feel as if you're seeing a performance but instead you're seeing a real loser caught up in the situation. John Goodman plays his Vietnam buddy and it's a real shame that he gets so overlooked because he delivers perhaps the funniest performance in the film. Countless movies have done the ""crazed Vietnam"" bit to death but Goodman comes across so original that you can't help but feel that he's one of the best who has ever done it. I just love the way he's able to go from calm to psycho and back to calm in the matter of seconds. The supporting cast is just as impressive with Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, David Huddleston, Tara Reid, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John Turturro are all terrific in their bit parts as well. The chemistry that the supporting players have with Bridges is another strong selling point. Another major plus is the soundtrack, which features the likes of Bob Dylan, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Elvis Costello, Santana, the Eagles and many more. I think the one downside to the film is that since the mystery doesn't work, the extended 117-minute running time feels a bit too long and you can't help but feel that the story could have been wrapped up in less time. With that said, there are countless big laughs to be had here and it's certainly true that you never know where the comedy is going to come from and that helps keep the thing moving. The performances, especially Bridges and Goodman, makes this film a true cult classic.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

John Goodman performs in as close to a leading performance a supporting role can be. Jeff Bridges steals the show, as he was intended to do, and portrays possibly the best character ever filmed--The Dude. He integrates the intended simplicity of The Dude's lifestyle, with the chaotic complexity of his philosophies and personality. Absolutely a must-see for anyone who gives a damn about breathing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The best of Coen?,"The Big Lebowski is a good movie , I do not think the best of the Coen brothers , plus the script is excellent, and the cast not to mention , Jeff Bridges is excellent , the cast still has great John Goodman , the soundtrack is great , the best scenes are in the bowling alleys in my opinion , have a fun character who is Jesus , and has excellent dialogue , the picture is good , the pace can sometimes be tiring , for a comedy film , I admit that I do not I gave a lot of laughs , I really liked the movie plot, cast and scenes in bowling alleys , plus it's a good movie, the Big Lebowski has Excellent dialogue and fine performances , more is not the best of Coen , at least that's what I guess.

Iconic Character and a Peerless Film,"Joel and Ethan Coen have done so much so brilliantly, but nothing more improbably wondrous than encasing a former 60s radical in a sweater and pajama pants and transforming him into an easy argument for the most iconic character in modern comedic cinema. So goes The Dude as he appears in ""The Big Lebowski.""Mixing the once-disparate ingredients of dark comedy, stoner flick, and L.A. noir with telltale signs of the classic buddy movie, it's likely the genius casting of Jeff Bridges as the leisure-adamant Jeffery ""The Dude"" Lebowski that most acutely prescribed greatness for this one-of-a-kind film. The opportunity for an iconic performance was sure to have gone unrealized if placed in lesser-skilled hands, and Bridges' middle-aged, self-realized Dude is set into full motion by terrific fellow slackers of their own unique brands: Endearingly hostile Vietnam vet Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and the charmingly carefree Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi) team with The Dude to squelch the machismo-driven bowling game of convicted  Jesus Quintana (a remarkable John Turturro). Yet when a pair of arm breakers mistake him for a SoCal fat cat who shares his Lebowski surname, The Dude seeks out this supposed ""Big Lebowski"" and demands recompense. ""The Big Lebowski"" then begins its next-level ascent to wildly creative zeniths, mixing surrealist fantasy, bowling, and suspect private eye work into a joyously burlesque stew. We dial straight in to The Dude's laissez fare mindset as he wanders into an ensemble of wonderfully sketched characters placed throughout fascinating scenes.In their interviews, the Coen brothers downplay what they surely must know they achieved with ""The Big Lebowski."" In Bridges' manifestation, we do see the idler -- but we also see the possibilities of a truly carefree existence realized only by living comfortably in one's own skin. And that, perhaps, is this comedy's most aspirational of its many achievements. ""The Big Lebowski"" has a seat on the rug in the highest tier of uniquely great movies. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful.""

"A Confusing, Yet Entertaining Satire","The Big Lebowski was a movie where going in all I knew was that it was a comedy, and it is definitely a hilarious movie.

April 20th - 420 Observed,"The Coen brothers strike gold again. This time with a hippy twist in Los Angeles, when the unsuspecting, self-medicated, ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), gets mistaken by shady debt collectors, as someone else and in the process, his rug gets soiled. Seeking payback for the rug, he goes to the real Lebowski for restitution, but accepts a deal to make the payment exchange to the debt collectors for the millionaire Lebowski. He enlists the aid of his bowling pals, Walter (John Goodman) and Theodore (Steve Buscemi). From there they screw things up and get into a conspiracy involving Lebowski's missing wife, Maude (Julianne Moore), porn producers and nihilists.What Bridges, Goodman and Buscemi come up with is one of the best comedy trios seen in modern film. The patter that is thrown around between Bridges and Goodman is hilarious. You can feel Goodman's Walter, irritating Bridges' ""The Dude"" throughout the entire film. There also are other plot arcs that involve a colorfully, overly competitive bowler named Jesus (John Turturro) and the oddly eccentric life of Moore's millionaire Maude. Her encounters with the Dude are always interesting.This film comes with a great soundtrack that helps propel the drug-induced wacky life of Jeffrey Lebowski. I didn't even get to mention the narrator and the Dude's conscience, Sam Elliott? All Sam has to do is start talking and he's already doing a great job. This is such a funny, good film. It is the ludicrousness of the whole situation, that the Dude has to face, that creates the comedic energy that makes this another Coen classic.8.9 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
This film actually gets better with age,"I occasionally go back and watch old favorites and am frequently disappointed in how they haven't held up.The Big Lebowski is one I've watched a few times since its release and liked it more with each viewing.

My fifth favorite movie of all time.,"The Big Lebowski was a great movie with probably the best cast ever assembled.  Add that to the fact that it was made by the Coen brothers... was God informed that something like this was going on?  John Goodman should at the very least be considered for an academy award for Best Supporting Actor for this.  And you know what the best part is, the movie teaches you that when you're life's going to pot, you can just say ""Forget it, let's go bowling.""",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Unexplainably entertaining,"This movie means absolutely nothing, goes absolutely nowhere; the pitch hovers somewhere around vulgar, and every character is a flake.  How, then, is it so entertaining?Jeff Bridges holds the thing together like glue.  He plays the unflappable Dude -- who gets flapped aplenty -- with such wit and grace that he pulls off plenty of schtick, making this cartoon utterly believable and convincing.  (Oh ho! -- he writes checks for less than a dollar!  He smokes a joint and says ""bummer""!  He lives to bowl and yet never rolls!)  The Coens were dead right to cast Bridges; any actor who misstepped would have sunk the ship.Even still, a quarter or more of the scenes don't work, but what does is very entertaining, very funny.  Probably as much foul language per frame as GOOD WILL HUNTING, but at least here it seems to make sense; the Coens don't cram it into everyone's mouths unilaterally.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A good quirky and a worthy movie,"The plot is that Two goons visit the Dude's home in search of a debt, thinking he is Jeffrey Lebowski, a wealthy man with the same name. The Dude seeks retribution and a new rug when they desecrate his house and pee on his rug. He encounters a diverse group of people along the road, such as Maude Lebowski, a rich woman who ends up being his unusual ally, and his closest buddy Walter Sobchak, an unpredictable and violent man.The Dude is portrayed brilliantly by Jeff Bridges, who captures the character's easygoing demeanor and philosophical outlook. As Walter, John Goodman excels, bringing a humorous touch with his fierce and frequently violent personality. Maude, played by Julianne Moore, is a noteworthy character in the movie because of the depth and complexity she brings to the role.I would definetlty watch this movie again and would also recommend my friends!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Mess, featuring tasty bits","What probably happened was, the Coen brothers had a bunch of cool visual and story ideas they didn't know what to do with, and they decided to make a movie out of these disparate elements. The result is a bit of a mess. You can just hear the Coens saying, ""Hey, what if there was this guy who's the ultimate slacker? And what if there were these guys who thought they were nihilists but were just a bunch of pathetic poseurs with exaggerated German accents who played geeky German electronic music on a puny ghetto blaster? What if-"" - by this point they're already laughing themselves silly, and they're right: this stuff is very funny. But it doesn't add up to anything.This is easily their most disjointed film (their only disjointed film, actually), and their least involving. But it's worth seeing once, if only for the wonderfully conceived central character (Jeff Bridges in a pitch-perfect performance); for Steve Buscemi's skillful, subtly hilarious puppy-dog performance; and for moments such as the narrator saying near film's end that ""it's good to know the Dude's out there"", a statement made humorous by the fact that the main character couldn't be less of a hero.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Trying too hard to be quirky - and failing.,"I love the Coen Brothers work.I watched all their films, and Fargo was in many ways the best.However, their latest effort - The Big Lebowski - I found almost unwatchable. The Coen Brothers' films have always, shall we say, been quirky. This hasn't got in the way of good acting, a great script, an interesting plot, a relevant musical score, or excellent cinematography.However in this film, the quirkiness got in the way of everything else. The plot is awful; the script is dire, with the dreaded 'f' work appearing at least once every five seconds (I'm not anti-swearing, but I do get intensely bored of hearing the same dialogue over and over again), the acting is uninspired - Buscemi is totally wasted, Bridges is irritatingly whining (though Tuturro is great, in a small part), the score is unmemorable and the camerawork is dull, except for the dream sequences, which seem forced, irrelevant and pretentious.I couldn't wait for this movie to end.

Speaking of plot, it might not be a kind of conventional comedy as we already know, and the beyond belief executions that it offers us through the movie will persuade you about my opinion.

"Fun, Coen Brothers style","Bowling buddies Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) and Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) get involved in an increasingly complicated plot involving a homonymous millionaire (maybe), kidnapping (maybe), a briefcase full of money (maybe), and a desecrated rug (definitely). The film is a deft blend of straight-faced humour, farce, and satire with some surrealistic dream sequences thrown in, and may be one big 'in' joke to the Coens, who based many of the characters on people they know.

"""Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.""","WHAT I LIKE:
I believe everyone has a little bit of The Dude in them; I know I have it. This film is funny without ever trying to be; which is a big contrast to the over-the-top comedies of the '90s likeDumb and Dumber (1994)andAce Ventura: Pet Detective (1994). The comedic nature of this film is more in-line with films like Bill Murray's classic,Groundhog Day (1993); with a pinch of stoner element, a dash of crime mystery and a spoonful of subtle political undertones thrown into the mix. On top the that, the visually-stunning representation of a stoner's psychedelic journey and the sharp (witty) dialogues are also worth mentioning. Most of the actors and actresses in this film are acting heavyweights; so you don't have to worry about bad acting. Strong performances overall; especially by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman.WHAT I DISLIKE:
I am not going to lie; this film does lack a little in the plot department; which was redeemed by the quirky humours and the strong performances by the cast. This film is meant to be a quirky, idiosyncratic comedy; instead of a highly-analytical crime thriller that many had hoped for. This film is laid with a complex theme; deceit ciminality and death; which were swiftly diffused by the situational comedies.

Because this is once for every 50 people that told me this movie was the funniest most entertaining movie EVER.

Let me be very very clear: It's not funny. At all. It's mildly amusing in parts but of the six people I watched it with, no one laughed once. Not once. I don't think it's a spoiler to tell you the language is sickeningly bad. Up there with Team America bad. Like Scarface bad. There is one reason and one reason only that this movie is popular: College aged men (or guys who wish they were college aged) own the DVD and watch it repeatedly. After watching the movie once (and not laughing), they then watch it repeatedly memorizing the movie. They sit around the DVD owner's sectional couch elbowing each other before each ""big"" scene almost spilling their friend's beer and yelling, ""HERE IT IS! HERE IT IS! HE""S GONNA SAY IT!"" They then laugh at how clever they are. They're part of ""The DUDE"" club and they are very, very special indeed.This is the most unfunny movie I have ever seen.

YOU ARE WATCHING IT WRONG,"If you are watching this movie and think it's a bowling movie, you're watching it wrong. If you're watching this movie and think it's a stoner movie, you're still watching it wrong. If you're watching this movie thinking it's about a mystery movie, a whodunit movie, or a mistaken identity movie, you're STILL watching it wrong.....because ""we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski..."" Yeah, this movie is on a completely different category. I mean, I can't even describe it. What I DO know is that this movie is supposed to be funny and it's a completely different type of comedy.Let me explain what I'm trying to say. Everybody knows about movies that are ""So bad It's Good"", like the movie The Room, for example. I mean, if you watch the movie The Room thinking it's supposed to be a drama movie, or a suspenseful movie, or a ""dark comedy"" movie, then you are watching it wrong. You don't watch that movie for its love story, you watch that movie because it's so bad it's good. You watch movies like that because you want to make fun of it. Now let's get back to The Big Lebowski. It's not a ""So Bad It's Good"" category.....FAR from it. While you watch The Room to make fun of it, The Big Lebowski is a movie that makes fun of you!So what does that mean, the movie makes fun of me? Yes, it's teasing you, it's making you think it's a bowling movie, but it's really not. You don't even see the main character play a single game! This movie is making you think it's a mystery movie, but it's really not! There is NO mystery! That's what makes this movie hilarious. That's the reason this movie barely makes any sense......because it's NOT supposed to make sense in the first place! It's the ultimate anti-joke. It's a plot that makes fun of plots, a comedy that makes fun of comedy, a punchline without a punchline.What so genius about this movie is that it's NOT self-aware. It's a comedy that doesn't hold your hand, it's like you either get it or you don't. If you don't get it, then it's WORKING, because you're not supposed to get it! Throughout the whole movie, every time you see the 3 main characters together, you'll notice The Dude has all the questions, Walter thinks he has all the answers, and poor Donny walks in and is still figuring out what the question is! If this is your first time watching this movie, you are like Donny. If it's your second time watching this movie, you are like The Dude. If it's your third time watching this movie, you become like Walter, because now you ""think"" you know all the answers...So in conclusion, this movie is nothing like all the other comedy movies such as The Hangover, or Superbad, or even The Room. It's a totally different type of comedy, and it grows with you the more you watch it. That's the reason why people tell you that you have to watch it again, because, yes, you are watching it wrong.....and when you realize this movie is intentionally trying to not make sense, then it becomes hilarious every single time you watch it.....and it's SO quotable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
You mean coitus?,"The first Coen brothers' movie I saw was ""Fargo"" and, to be frank, I didn't enjoy it very much the first time. The experience with ""The Big Lebowski"" was more or less the same. Fortunately, I watched it a second time before I returned the DVD and... my life changed. I immediately started building my own personal Coen brothers' collection (starting with, of course, The Big Lebowski). I have easily seen this movie more than a hundred times by now. In fact, I can replay the entire movie in my head if I need to!Some general suggestions for Coen newcomers: You have to allow yourself to be transported into the ""Coens' World"" before you can fully appreciate their movies. The guys have a quirky worldview and a rather twisted sense of humour. They also have a gift for writing fast, funny, quotable dialogue.Transporting one's self to the Coens' world isn't very hard: this can be accomplished by watching, for example, The Big Lebowski about 2-3 times (say within ten days).What you will get out of this movie: Several memorable quotes which will be a source of endless amusement throughout your life. And, if you watch it often enough, you'll also end up leading a more ""relaxed"" and enjoyable life. A word of warning: Don't overdo it! Overexposure may well diminish your enjoyment of the movie. (I'd say that 20 is a safe enough number of times that you can watch this movie. And then maybe you can continue to watch once or twice a year for pretty much the rest of your life.))Everything I wish to say about this movie has already been said and been said better. (If you're already an ""achiever"", do read other users' comments, they are great!) If you were waiting for one more recommendation before you rent it, here it is: Watch it!

Staggering,"Crisp, elegant, and tightly-plotted, with no loose ends. The titular protagonist of this thriller is a heavyweight business tycoon, a Korean veteran war-hero, disabled but not crippled, with a charming daughter and a devoted second wife, famous for his charitable enterprises. He has an alias, who might be known as the Sherlock Holmes of Los Angeles, an amateur gentleman sleuth with the professional well-honed acumen of someone with a naturally keen intellect. This is no dud, but a man of intrepid action, ably supported by the Alley Irregulars, a couple of great-hearted associates who help him solve the mysteries at the centre of the epic, and who bravely face up to a gang of demented blackmailers and foul extortionists. There are many twists and turns and surprises along the way. What was the significance of the phantom kidnapping? How did the Hollywood big-shot producer get involved? Why did the Police Chief put his hat on before throwing a right hook? Why was the central piece de resistance of the tastefully furnished, state-of-the-art apartment micturated upon?The acting throughout this gripping tale is stellar, the dialogue is courteous and refined, but unfailingly witty. There are a number of Dali-esque dream sequences, possibly owing something to Busby Hitchcock in one of his more surreal moods. Two animals, a marmot and a Pomeranian, play significant roles as the enigma unravels. Several forensic crime investigators are called in. There is also a sagacious Western narrator, acting as a sort of Greek chorus, lucidly explaining the intricacies of the background to the interplay of the characters.Make sure you see this masterpiece before you die.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A fine piece of quality comedy entertainment,"""The Big Lebowski"" is a hilarious movie. It makes you laugh scene after a scene and that makes it a fine piece of quality comedy. It has a rather bizarre story which sometimes gets a bit silly, but it's still enjoyable all the way through. The story tells about a man named Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski. He is accidentally mistaken for a millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski and this leads him to things he wouldn't want to have experienced. With his bowling buddy Walter's help he tries to get things right but is constantly failed in his tasks, mainly because of Walter's strange personality and anger issues.The best thing about this film is the characters and the role performances done by the actors. The characters are just great, they're vivid and they all have odd personalities and different ways of interacting. Jeff Bridges plays the character of ""The Dude"", a total looser who would have preferred bowling instead the things he accidentally mixes up with. Bridges is so real in the role, though the character itself is so surreal, sort of an ignoring person who pretty much defines stupidity. Although Bridges is superb in the role I thought John Goodman was more entertaining in the role of Walter Sobchak. The character of Walter is just so bizarre. He is a Vietnam veteran who constantly deals with his anger issues and thinks he's right when it comes to solving things, yet being pretty much wrong in every case. Trying to help ""The Dude"" he just makes things worse and doesn't even admit that he's been wrong. I've never really found John Goodman as entertaining as in this movie, so thumbs up for that. There are also other characters worth mentioning; The always enjoyable Steve Buscemi as Theodore Donald 'Donny' Kerabatsos who never seems to be able to speak up his mind as he is always bothered by Walter. Being a bowling buddy of ""The Dude"" and Walter he still remains as one member of the group and there is some sympathy showed towards him in the end. Julianna Moore is also in a so surreal role, the role of Maude Lebowski who is obsessed with sex, the British daughter of the real millionaire Lebowski. We also see for example Philip Seymor Hoffman and Peter Stormare in one of the roles.The screenplay's very well written, written by Ethan and Joel Cohen it definitely mixes up everything from the beginning till the end. This what also makes the plot a bit confusing at parts. You really need concentration, as there is constantly this fast dialog between the characters and it's just impossible to know what is important for the plot and what is not. There is just so much fillings in the dialogs that it gets a bit messy. The directing pretty much does the same, directed by Joel Cohen. It can be described from what I described the plot and the dialogs. Being precise, entertaining and swift it also blends up with the story so well, making the whole movie this one big entity where the main theme is never lost. Although it does get a bit confusing it's still that definite quality and you just can't go wrong with that.""The Big Lebowski"" is a good movie, it's nothing phenomenal but it's definitely something worth watching if you don't want to watch something that serious, as it just does include these irrelevant and silly, yet hilarious parts which in their way are simply one crucial part of the movie. You will laugh, if not because of the great jokes or the dialog, then the odd silliness it has inside it. Great characters, superb role performances, a plot that evolves to something you couldn't have imagined and a guaranteed laugh-packed ride. ""The Big Lebowski"" does what it needs to, it doesn't have to exceed that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Coen's wit on display here,"The Coen's most endearing film perhaps, the Big Lebowski was unappreciated upon release but since has garnered a massive following. Jeff Bridges plays the ultimate slacker- Dude whose sole purpose in life is to laze around in his room smoking pot or go bowling with his strange friends- a militant gun lover played by John Goodman and a meek fellow portrayed by Steve Buscemi. One day he is mistaken for another man (a very wealthy man) with the same name by a batch of inept crooks who take his rug forcefully. What follows is a bizarre, offbeat tale of mistaken identity and revenge. This is a typical offbeat Coen's film ably supported by Julianne Moore who, for once, chooses to tackle a funny role (and has a hilariously surreal dance sequence with Bridges).",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Not as good as people say,"I have to say first off that this movie is not as good as people said it was, in fact I found it to be very disappointing.  The humor is subtle and in my opinion barely existant.  John Goodman was the main reason I continued to watch the film as he offered a character whose unpredictability sparked some interest in a almost uninteresting plot.Its not a bad film, it just never seems to go anywhere or offer anything. I'd recommend to watch it if you have the chance with nothing better to do, just for the sake of seeing a movie that isn't trash.  However at the same time, don't expect a masterpiece of cinema or a great film.The movie isn't funny for the most part, but I guess that depends on what makes you laugh.  In the end though, its safe to say I won't be watching this movie again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A great ride in a laid back mood,"The story is so nicely lightweight that the whole case is actually dismissible from the entire movie. All those crazy antics The Dude does, and the stupid practical jokes that his responses make is just hilarious. I really like the marmot gag and the ash spreading gag, they are very entertaining. The character building is also very strong. The Dude, Walter and Donny are nicely three sides of a coin, the lazy no good bum, the overly strict and cranky hot-head, and the cowering coward ready to run from anything that shows the slightest sign of danger. The acting overall is quite nice. Jeff Bridges proves his acting prowess in role here as the lazy bum. John Goodman really inserts the crazy comedies from his lines and character role. Having Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare really adds very nicely, while Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hoffman complete the angles needed for the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Best Film Ever, Am I wrong?!","That's right. 'The Big Lebowski' is the best film ever and by reading many of the other IMDb comments I can see I am certainly not alone in that opinion. There are a few reasons why I happen to believe this to be numero uno. The dialogue in this film surpasses even that of 'Pulp Fiction'. Almost every line of the script is pure gold and if it does not bring the merest chuckle out of you then you are rolling around on the floor in fits of laughter.Obviously the 'Dude' is a legendary creation, played to perfection by Bridges, but just outshining him is Goodman as Walter. He is quite possibly the funniest character to be portrayed on screen. You only have to go to the memorable quotes tab on the column to the left to experience just how funny this guy is. His constant bringing up of the Vietnam war into literally any topic of conversation never ceases to be funny and the scene he smashes up that blokes car shouting 'You see what happens when you f*** a stranger in the ass!' is the best of all the classic scenes that make up this masterpiece.This is the one film I don't think I will ever get tired of watching. And if for some bizarre reason you don't like it, check your pulse you may very well not be alive.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Pretty pointless but funny at times,"A stoner called The Dude is mistaken for a millionaire who shares his name, the big Lebowski. This rich man's wife owes cash to a goon. She is subsequently kidnapped and the big Lebowski assigns The Dude the task of being the bag man in return for a load of money. The mission is screwed up, however, when The Dude's friend Walter joins in and messes things up. This leaves The Dude in a shaky position where he has to attempt to reclaim the money.This is a defiantly pointless film. It's a crime-comedy with very little emphasis on realism. It's played for laughs pure and simple. It benefits from an impressive cast. Jeff Bridges is good in the lead role, with some funny support performances from John Turturro as a sleazy bowler and Philip Seymour-Hoffman as the big Lebowski's personal assistant. Although I found John Goodman a little overbearing and annoying to tell you the truth. It's a highly stylised film, which you would probably expect coming from the Coen brothers. It isn't always as funny as it thinks it is though, although there are admittedly a number of very funny moments. It was nice to hear some good sounds in this one though. In particular a couple of ultra-cool laid back tunes from early 70's Italian movies, namely Piacere Sequence by Teo Usuelli (taken from the giallo 'Amuck') and Traffic Boom by Piero Piccioni (taken from the comedy 'All Screwed Up') - the latter of which was the soundtrack to the film within a film here.Its story-line is very unfocused, maybe that's the point I suppose but it certainly means that in order to enjoy the film you need to be able to overlook this. It's surely no coincidence that lots of people say they weren't too keen on this film the first time they saw it and it took subsequent viewings to appreciate. I myself am pretty much the same and this no doubt explains its lukewarm performance at the box office and then it's slow-burning success on home video. Having said all this, despite being an entertaining film, I still find it kind of hard to understand the real appeal of this movie. An amusing enough flick for sure but not a grade A Coen movie in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
It's okay,"This is a 50/50 movie for me, it's just another movie I'm not happy I watched or sad if that makes sense. I get that why so many people like this movie, it's funny sometimes, and I guess for others funny a lot of the time, but for my sense of humor the comedy here is just alright. I just feel like it is a pretty pointless story, and even some of the characters are pointless. The start did get me a little bit hooked, it was intereesting to see how it would play out after the guy got mistaken for someone else. But it did lose me pretty quickly, seeing as the people there were just literally there, too much talking as well and the movie was in general too long. Someone being drunk isn't that interesting for me to watch for more than 5 minutes either. Again, it had funny moments and lines, but that just isn't enough for me unfortunately. Another overly hyped movie I just can't get myself to like that much, or that I felt like I was missing out.

Just OK,"NB: I've only seen this film once, and it may be the type of film that grows on you the more you watch it. However, at this point I don't understand the raves. The Coen brothers are incapable of making a boring film, and this was no exception. Whether it's a great film (Fargo, Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men, Miller's Crossing, to name a few) or merely a puzzling one (Barton Fink comes to mind), their films are inventive, interesting, and memorable. Lebowski is closer to Barton Fink than the great films. There were many wonderful scenes, lines, and performances. However, to me, the overall effect was less than the sum of the parts. Even putting aside the numerous plot holes (because this film was clearly not about its plot), I found myself waiting for some narrative thread or theme to tie together the nearly random eccentric scenes. I left feeling the movie was strange, interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying. It wasn't a waste of my time, mind you, but no way should it be ranked as high as it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Completely original and unforgettable.,"There never was before and there probably never will be a film quite like The Big Lebowski. It has a typical film noir story arc mixed with a couple of stoner characters and a hip setting in the early 1990s Los Angeles that creates a great atmosphere to watch the action unfold. This is Raymond Chandler on vacation; relaxed and willing to stretch out and let loose.When it first premiered, this was quite a misunderstood movie. People couldn't believe that this was written, produced and directed by the same team who made that brilliant crime thriller Fargo from two years before. Yet, this kind of movie shows how creative and daring the Coen brothers are. They don't try to make just one kind of film; they branch out and try different ideas until they hit upon one that works. And they had to know from the start that a character like the Dude would work. With the wonderfully laid back Jeff Bridges in the title role, the Dude abides as one of the greatest of all movie characters, perhaps the Coens have ever written and one that will be remembered for ages.Of course, where would the Dude be without his able partner, Walter Sobchak, that Vietnam-crazy, screaming Jew who takes his bowling almost as serious as his religion. John Goodman gives perhaps his most memorable performance and it is a great one; thoroughly entertaining as well as very funny. And then there is Donny, played with sweet naiveté by Steve Buscemi. Donny doesn't do or say much, but I think he represents the audience; just there for the ride and seeing the story unfold only because he enjoys the company of the Dude and Walter despite his constant yelling at him.This is a movie that could be discussed and analyzed forever in terms of its plot, dream sequences and ways it adheres to old-fashion storytelling with modern film making. But perhaps the Coens simply wanted it enjoyed on its most basic level; as the story of a man called Dude who had his rug peed on and sought destitute for it. And that is because that rug really tied the room together. This is a completely original and unforgettable movie that must be seen by any Coen brothers or modern movie fan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

An impressive depth of dialogue that requires a rewatch,"I had seen this movie once before and got way more out of it when watching it recently for the second time.I think the complexity of dialogue is one of this movie's most fantastic aspects. Ironically though, I think it's also the reason I didn't like the film as much from my first viewing. I think this is also where the movie's rewatchability comes from. The dialogue is written in an extremely non-linear fashion. Often much of it has to be filtered through to follow the plot, as there can be so much going on in a scene. Upon my rewatch I was able to better follow and inspect what was going on in the more dialogue heavy scenes and when you're no longer struggling to just follow the plot, you can really appreciate the intricacies the Cohen brothers wrote into these conversations.I found the chaos of these dialogue scenes very humorous and you really get to see the dynamic of the Dude's friend group through these scenes. It's hilarious watching everyone talking to each other, yet so caught up in their own heads at the same time.The story and wildness of the tale is captivating and the wacky premise with which it starts draws you in quickly, especially with the way the Dude and his pals respond and react to the events that befall them.Julianne Moore's role in the film is one of my favorite and in my opinion most mastered storylines of the movie. Her introduction is particularly memorable and impressed into my brain.The narration in this movie fits well throughout and towards the end became one of my favorite parts of the film. It brings a whole new path to reflect about the movie on and does a phenomenal job at wrapping the narrative in a meaningful and expansive way that adds to the movie at the same time as it encapsulates it.The dream sequences provide nice intermissions to the story and are also hilarious as well as visually a joy to watch.My biggest complaint about the film has to be the potential for it to cause confusion in its complexity, but this is also what makes the movie so great and makes it worth watching again.

Hugely entertaining!,"Pacifists vs. nihilists comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen is predictably (and amusingly) weird and lively, and so full of comic tension and malice that it is nearly irrelevant the 'plot' (as such) does peter out after the first hour. A bearded, unemployed, pot-smoking holdover from the '60s becomes entangled in corruption after he's hired to be the ransom-courier in a kidnapping. As the Dude, Jeff Bridges gives his all to this loose, shaggy character; the Dude is not just a textbook hipster, slacker or fish out of water, he's a laid-back guy cartoonishly naive of the craziness inherent in this new generation's loss of morals, and he's so generally good-hearted that he's blindsided by violence and craven villainy.

Star turn is not Jeff Bridges (hippie Lebowski), but his bowling buddy John Goodman who puts in an amazing performance as a damaged and deranged Vietnam vet and some of his lines are laugh out loud funny - especially how he deals with a fellow bowler who has ""stepped over the line."" A little scene that stands up to the best of the funny business in Pulp Fiction.Maybe if you want to be harsh they do turn this in to a bit of a variety show that goes from the bowling alley small-talk, to surreal dreams scenes, to the tale of a how a pair of dimwits try to dig themselves out of a hole. Four letter words come thick and fast and you wonder whether we really need them. This is - after all - a silly comedy. Why cut off part of the audience? Equally why is Roger (the dim one) only called The Dude throughout and never by his first name?Good entertainment and sure to become a cult - if it is not already.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The Perfect Crime Comedy,"This film stands the test of time very well. It is laugh-out-loud funny and has an outrageous messy crime story. The plot is creative and unique. Gangsters attack a man, because he happens to have the same name as the real man they were looking for. After the mishap, he seeks reparations for his rug that was soiled in the process, only to find himself strewn in the mess even further.The Coen Brothers are masters of their craft, creating a genre-busting film with witty dialogue, comedic irony, subversions of expectation, a perfect soundtrack, and acting that gives life to the characters.

A true comedic masterpiece,This movie is one of just a few comedic masterpieces.  If you don't believe me just watch the scene with Jesus in it bowling.

Jeff Bridges plays The Dude - a seriously stoned bowler who is dragged into a web of deception when mistaken for the Big Lebowski. All the dude wants is his rug back, but he goes through a lot to get it.The main characters in this movie are all larger than life and quite insane. John Goodman, John Turturro and Julianne Moore all produce excellent performances, due in part to the excellent script. It has to be one of the most quoteable films ever.This is one film that needs to be watched a few times as the whole atmosphere is a bit incoherent, and it seems to make a little more sense with each viewing.Its worth seeing just to check out John Turturro in a purple catsuit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Very entertaining,"I had waited a long time to watch the infamous cult classic ""The Big lewboski"". I was sort of afraid that the Coens has made a very raunchy film that didn't fit in with the rest of their filmography. I had a blast! This is definitely one of their more light-hearted films, and it's a straight-up comedy. It had me laughing my ass off in many scenes. It is known as a 'stoner' film, and it is raunchy in a way without being too aggressive or without leaving a bad taste in your mouth. I was glad about that, because the Coens always seem to find a good-hearted approach to all their films, and I'm glad did this too. The star of the film was John Goodman, who had me laughing around 80% of the time he was on screen. Very enjoyable to watch. The film's isn't 'incredible', but it only adds strength to their resume that I have seen.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Oddball comedy/mystery,"This was a freaky film. It took me a while to get going on it, but when I finally got into the thing it became very enjoyable and I began to get the comedy angle.

The Coens at their best,"I have always liked the work of the Coen brothers and to tell the truth, I found that THE BIG LEBOWSKI did meet all of my expectations - and more.Many commentators are disapointed with the movie because they find it very difficult to follow the plot and/or the characters are not fully developed and/or too many characters, etc..Well - these things are what you would expect from a drama and THE BIG LEBOWSKI is not that at all. It is not FARGO - it is a comedy with a great deal of surrealism. There are no higher moral issues and no lessons to be learned (besides: never spread the earthly remains (ashes) of your friend against the wind!).The three main characters are all great. John Goodman is perfectly cast as the ""can't-get-over-it Vietnam vet"" Walther and the scene where he jumps out of a speeding car with a Uzi in order to pursue the kidnappers is slapstick at its best.The best scenes though are the ones with The Dude, Walther and Donny arguing what to do with The Dudes personal problems.

Pure dudeness all over the place,"""The Big Lebowski"" is probably the crowning achievement in the Coen brothers' careers. The flick is hilarious, well-written, and overall engaging. I will admit that the film can be a bit scattered at times, but in the end everything just links up to form a comedic masterpiece.The film's plot is simple: Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) otherwise known as the Dude, is an LA deadbeat who one day is mistaken for a wealthy figure with the same name by two hoods. They wreck his home and urinate on his rug, and seeking revenge Jeff becomes embroiled in a shady kidnapping situation involving the other Lebowski.Starring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi and a number of other notable actors like John Turturro and Seymour Hoffman, there is no lack of excellent acting. Goodman portrays Walter Sobchak, a foul-mouthed, quick-tempered, but utterly hilarious Vietnam vet who is part of the Dude's bowling team. Buscemi is Donny, the neglected third member of the team who is treated like crap by Walter. Turturro and Hoffman are a flamboyant bowler named Jesus and the other Lebowski's assistant respectively. They all fit into their characters perfectly.I'm not as affected by profanity as some others may be, so I didn't have a problem with the dialogue, which can be pretty filthy at times but still funny. The film isn't for everyone, but everyone needs to see this comedic gem at least once...",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Dude, let's go logjammin'","Greetings again from the darkness.  I have fought this for quite some time, but must now give it up for the greatness that is ... the Coen Brothers. Bad pub made me stay away from Lebowski on its theatrical release, and am just now getting around to it.  What a gem! Truly brilliant casting and the Coen's now customary bizarre dialog make this one something special.  Who, but the Coens, would cast Steve Buscemi as a former surfer or Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers) as a nihilist?  Yes, we expect perfection from Jeff Bridges every time - here he delivers.  Is he a slacker or just a decent guy who doesn't wish his rug soiled?  Bridges perfectly captures the spirit of the dude.  Goodman is his usual over-the-top self, only moreso.  His dialog seems at time pulled straight from ""Casino"", if you f** know what I f** mean.  The beautiful Julianne Moore seems a bit disinterested in her role until her wonderful scene for improving conception.  Philip Seymour Hoffman again shows why he is absolutely the best young character actor working today.  Tara Reid (""Cruel Intentions"" and ""American Pie"") has a brief yet effective role as teh trophy wife with confusing intentions.  David Huddleston steals his scenes for the first time since ""Blazing Saddles"" and Coen regular, John Turturro is terrifically offbeat as Jesus the wonder bowler.  Sam Elliot lends a touch of class as the stranger, and don't miss Aimee Mann ('til Tuesday) and Ben Gazarra.  Another aspect that we have come to expect in Coen movies is a wonderful soundtrack.  Lebowski provides us with Dylan and Costello along with the wonderful work of Carter Burwell. This movie begs for repeat viewings, but do brace yourself for the boundary pushing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Nobody fucks with the Jesus!,"The Big Lebowski probably is the most funny movie of all time. 
You can argue that the plot is weak, that there is not much of a story going into it and there is no real ending. But there is no need in that.
The complete asymmetrical built is the movies style.
At the end of the day, it is Jeff Bridges performance as ""The Dude"" that makes this movie that great. Every scene he is in, is directly becoming funny. John Goodman's Walter is the perfect opposite as a character but also outrageously funny. The story is built with delightful irregular and unanticipated scenes that cause the effect of a rare novel, where you check out how many pages are left and hope they are more, not less. 
With all this bullshit happening in the life of the Dude, the movie describes his task, to remain the coolest dude on the planet, regardless of what will happen.

Funny peculiar,"'The Big Lebowski' tells an enjoyable shaggy dog tale with Jeff Bridges playing the shaggy dog - slacker dude Lebowski, who gets bizarrely caught up in a kidnapping scam.  There are lots of laugh out load moments, but this is a very peculiar film, varying between downbeat black comedy and pure stand-up, interlaced with self-knowing references to numerous different styles of movie making and peppered with a pointlessly astonishing expletive count.The Coen brothers are very clever, but sincerity is never their strong point, and, although it pains me to diss any film with Townes van Zandt on the soundtrack, the net result is rather unaffecting. And it's not that I don't like weird movies; but 'The Big Lebowski' (in defiance of its hero's philosophy) seems to try just a little too hard.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Nice work of art,"This is a really funny movie. I like the personality of the dude. He makes me feels like he dosen't care about anything at all. He dosen't mind at all that he's unemployed, he dosen't get angry when people call him with swear words. He stays perfectly calm when his car was dragged away. He's always careless and takes nothing to his heart. You can't just use regular swear words like scumbag, punk or pathetic loser on him because the dude takes them to a whole new level in every respect. The dude is such a shameless person, that his story and style can remind me of people's stereotyped, dull and ignorant behaviors. If you identify with the dude's personality, this movie will make you think about whether you're reacting too aggressively and emotionally at times, that at the most of these times, you don't have to give a dam about things.

It is laced with so many swear words, yet this doesn't give the dialogue any additional kick.  I have nothing against swearing in movies as long as it accomplishes something. The fact that nihilists feature prominently in this movie makes sense since the whole movie is pretty meaningless.  No real plot, random and incoherent dialogue, just a loser of a main character (Jeff Bridges), and I really didn't care if he lived or died.Obviously the ""genius"" of the movie eludes me.

"funny, but not altogether satisfying","I enjoyed many parts of the movie - quite a lot, in fact.  Jeff Bridges as the laid back ""luzer"" dude was brilliant. John Goodman, a 'Nam Vet', more than did his character justice. Some of the situations were really funny and made sense.  Some made no sense and were funny.  Other situations just made no sense. As a whole piece, it's a really flawed movie.Most of the situations revolved around the whereabouts of $1 million in ransom money. The ingenious plot twists usually hang together, but not always. What was the point of the volkswagon dectective? What did that contribute? Nothing - it was just another point of confusion. The nihilist gang (which at least provided some funny dialogs) never fit with the rest of the movie, which was irritating. The cowboy narrator never fit, either; although I found his folksy drawl to be comforting.This movie does a seriously poor job with it's female characters. The male lead characters are well developed, and most of the male secondary characters are well drawn also.  The women characters are all flat and bizarre - more like creatures from outer space than real people.  The millionaire's ""trophey wife"", Bunny, is a dumb blond ho. The adult daughter Maude comes off as mechanical and inhuman.So, we have flashes of brilliance interspersed with a fair amount of gimcrack movie making. There is no ending, to speak of - the story just stops for no reason.  Many situations set up earlier are left dangling and unresolved. In fact, the whole thing about what happens to the missing million dollars is just forgotten.I think most people will find something to laugh at and something to like when they watch this movie.

"So a Jew, an annoying guy and a Dude walk into a bowling alley...","So there's this dude who lives in LA – wait – not ""this dude"", ""The Dude""The Dude (Jeff Bridges) is a bearded slob. His casual hippie-esque drawl is peppered with profanity and he calls almost everyone he meets, male or female: ""Man"". When ""dressed up"" he might wear a t-shirt and shorts, this is not often. Standard attire is an open robe and slippers.The Dude hasn't worked for some time and he lives a simple, meagre existence in rented accommodation with few friends. His only non-negotiables are bowling and White Russians, an alcoholic beverage.The Dudes only known friends are his bowling buddies, members of a league team, a league that they take extremely seriously. (There are many scenes in this film set in the bowling alley during play, however we only see one of the team ever bowl, three bowls from memory.) Speaking of the team, aside from The Dude we have Walter (John Goodman) and Donnie (Steve Buscemi).Walter is loud, opinionated and obnoxious, not exactly a winning combination, but he is loyal to The Dude and even though he frequently gets it wrong he seems to want to do the right thing. He treats Donnie with disdain and almost always brings everything back to a Nam story.Donnie is the opposite, simple, friendly and curious, he is always questioning and inserting randomly pointless comments into proceedings (""I am the Walrus"").The fun starts with a case of mistaken identity, a message made for a Lebowski is served to the wrong Lebowski being The Dude's AKA, this leads him in turn to the right Lebowski, specifically the Big Lebowski for a chat.The chain of linked but totally unpredictable events that follows this simple mistake are realistically largely irrelevant to your enjoyment, aside from facilitating the introduction of various characters and providing The Dude and often Walter with a purpose for a short time. The convoluted plot is often broken up with insane yet totally entertaining dream sequences, generally bowling related and short sequences involving red herrings and bit characters, not the least of which is named The Jesus.Highlights though include:A ransom request leading to a botched payoff. - German nihilist pornographers - An inconvenient stolen car - A freaky naked feminist who paints via flying fox - A moustachioed cowboy narratorThe banter is often hilarious (and always profane), the ridiculous situations are often hard to follow but this never seems to matter anyway, and the cameos and brief go-nowhere scenes make the film even better (More highlights? ""Nobody f*cks wit De Jesus!"", The Dude's use of spy techniques at the home of the Pornographer brings hilarious results that are not what The Dude – or anyone would expect.)Though you will be relieved to know that come the conclusion of the film the bowling team does make it to the finals or maybe that was a spoiler?Final Rating – 8 / 10.

"Suspicions confirmed, unfortunately.","There is a youtube.com video somebody laboriously strung together of all the numerous eff-words in this movie and the order in which they appear. The thing goes on for at least two full minutes. And it is very, very funny. Trouble is, the entire movie is little more amusing than this little clip. Only it lasts much longer. Too long, in fact. For years I had put off watching The Big Lebowski. After seeing various snippets of it, I began to develop suspicions that the entire ordeal might not be worth the time to watch it. Unfortunately, my suspicions were confirmed after a recent viewing of the whole thing.The story, and I use the word ""story"" loosely, deals with an ex-hippie loser trying to get revenge and restitution from those who urinated on a rug in his tiny apartment. A case of mistaken identity causes Jeff Lebowski to be assaulted by goons in an early scene, and his home and possessions violated. Lebowski, played wonderfully by Jeff Bridges, has been mistaken for a seemingly wealthy man and he feels that the real target of the assault at least owes him for the rug. Lebowski goes to the man's mansion to ask for restitution, but ends up getting involved in a kidnapping scheme involving the man's trophy wife. Nothing else must be said about the plot. You just have to sit back an experience the rest. My guess is that many people, whether they will admit it or not, may find this movie a tad bit tedious. Yes, it is full of talented and funny actors, and yes it was made by the Coen brothers. But the plot involving nihilists, hit men, eccentric performance artists, bowling alleys, and god knows whatever else is just too much to take in one dosage. My guess is the Coens were just bound and determined to tell some kind of story about ""The Dude"", and the plot of that story was ultimately inconsequential to the actual act of telling his story.As mentioned earlier, Bridges is pretty funny as ""The Dude"" Jeff Lebowski. This is one of those roles an actor doesn't have to do a lot for. No trips to the gym, no chiseled abs like in Against All Odds. Heck, he even used some of his own clothes. The rest of the cast is pretty good, too. They just aren't always sure how best to use them. If anyone out there doesn't know who John Millius is, trust me... John Goodman nailed him. Tara Reid ten years later seems like a casting mistake though. Back then I guess someone thought she had talent.The Coens are living gods in the minds of many. For my money, they are pretty hit and miss. They've given us duds like O Brother Where Art Thou, and the Ladykillers. Little gems like Raising Arizona. Stellar efforts like Fargo. And maybe the best film I've ever seen, No Country for Old Men. But The Big Lebowski is a slight miss for them.

Review: The Big Lebowski (1998) - Interpretations,"The movie represents a wisdom tale of original sin.""The Dude"" is an egoless carefree state that represents innocence, the Garden of Eden, Gods will and/or Gods order.The Cowboy represents God. Lebowski represents man. The rug represents either A: women or B: materialism (I have not been able to deduce which one yet).The movie begins when The Dude abandons his carefree state and begins to seek the rug. At the point The Dude begins to seek the rug he is rejecting Gods order, and thus, becomes Lebowski. Lebowski is cast out of Eden, by God, into the Land of Nod, where he wanders encountering lies, violence, treachery and deceit.At the end, Lebowski has learned his lesson and regains Gods favor. He says, directly to God, ""The Dude abides"" and God repeats it to the audience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"A quirky, fun movie","The Big Lebowski is a hilarious, quirky movie from start to finish. For years, my parents have owned it on DVD, but it wasn't until around 2016 or 2017, that they finally allowed me and my older brother to watch it. And ever since then, it's been a favorite of both of ours. In fact, we went together to see it as part of a special summer event at a local movie theater, and we never get tired of it!Set in 1991 Los Angeles, the movie centers on unemployed slacker Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski (played by Jeff Bridges), who, like me, loves bowling. One night, a pair of thugs, mistaking him for shady millionaire Jeffrey ""The Big"" Lebowski (David Huddleston), whose much younger trophy wife Bunny (Tara Reid), owes money all over town, invade The Dude's home, assault him, and do number one on his cherished rug. Wanting compensation for his rug, The Dude approaches the other Lebowski, who has a job offer for him; Bunny has been kidnapped, and he needs a good bagman. However, when The Dude's overzealous and hotheaded bowling buddy, Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), wanting to keep the ransom money for himself and The Dude, fakes the ransom drop, and to make matters worse, The Dude ends up losing the briefcase soon after, things fall apart very quickly.The acting in this movie is tremendous. Jeff Bridges is fabulous as The Dude. John Goodman, as usual, is a pure delight as Walter. Steve Buscemi is great as The Dude and Walter's dimwitted bowling buddy, Donny Kerabatsos. Julianne Moore is flawlessly refined as The Big Lebowski's daughter, Maude Lebowski. David Huddleston (may he rest in peace) makes a great villain as The Big Lebowski. Tara Reid is fittingly sultry as Bunny. Philip Seymour Hoffman (may he also rest in peace) is great as Brandt, The Big Lebowski's right-hand man. Even John Turturro is a treasure as rival bowler Jesus Quintana, even if he only gets two scenes. Everybody else is great in their roles. And yeah, I know this seems like a lot of characters, but almost all of them contribute to the plot in some way.The Big Lebowski is also filmed fantastically, and not only shows off how beautiful Los Angeles looks, it even gives us a good look at the bowling alley's pinsetter. It also boasts some great special effects, especially in the dreams that The Dude has when he's knocked out on two occasions.The writing is just terrific. The whole movie is essentially a shaggy dog story, that revolves around The Dude being abused and blamed for stuff that he can't control, because he simply manages to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and constantly gets tangled in conflicting information between certain parties. And yet it all works, and is spun into a truly hilarious experience. The best part is that it doesn't rely on slapstick, gags or punchlines for its comedy. It's all just sharp, intelligent fun.And lastly, we have the music. Interestingly, this movie doesn't rely on an instrumental score. In fact, only two special cues were composed by Coen Brothers regular Carter Burwell. The rest of the time, the movie relies on mostly pre-existing songs cleverly chosen by the fantastic T-Bone Burnett, including ""Just Dropped In"" by Kenny Rogers, ""Lookin' Out My Back Door"" by Creedence, and especially sharp use of ""Peaceful Easy Feeling"" by the Eagles. It should also be worth noting that the movie also uses two versions of the song ""Viva Las Vegas""; a soft ballad version by Shawn Colvin in the end credits, and in the movie itself, a rock version jokingly credited to ""Big Johnson"" (my theory is that it was by T-Bone Burnett himself).Everything considered, The Big Lebowski is a quirky, clever and hilarious movie, and easily the best the Coen Brothers have ever created. Watch this movie, and whether you like it or not, which I guarantee you will, The Dude abides!!!!Oh, and one more thing... ""MARK IT ZERO!!!!!!!!!""",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One  of the best Coen's !,"Hey, I just rented this movie as it was a Coen's movie, but I must say, I never felt attracted to the story, the looks or the first impression the movie made on me. I had to start it 4 times and by the 4th time I got over the first 5 minutes .. and boy was I hooked ! this is definitely one of the best of the Coen Bros., with a magnificent performance of Jeff Bridges (I think his best !) but also Turturro, Goodman, and Moore are a delight to see. The story unfolds in several layers and gets more interesting as the movie progresses.. but it's mostly the types that are put down which are hilarious, but still recognizable. I recommend this for any night for a movie-lover !",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Worth a watch,"For some it will become their favourite movie, for others something deep and existential or just be a lot of quotes and likable characters with no ultimate goal nor point to it.For me it's an interesting slice of life film with magical realism and satire. Going really broadly on themes of art, religion and overall point of existence. Overarching theme of trying to survive, just live life without hurting others, enjoying what you have and counter points to that. It has a (intentionally?) scattered and poorly paced plot, interesting characters who really bounce off each other and a lot of conversations.

Oddball Comedy With Extremely Quotable Dialogue,"This movie is one of the few comedy films that I have watched that has succeeded in getting me to laugh scene after scene. This film is a perfect demonstration of the comedic genius the Coen Brothers have; they are masterful at creating dialogue that is not only humorous, but also very memorable (""The dude abides"", ""Obviously, you're not a golfer"").The memorability of the dialogue in this movie is also due in large part to the performances of the stellar cast. Jeff Bridges was absolutely made to play the laid-back Dude, and to replace him with any one else would be a disservice and a travesty. John Goodman also knocks it out of the park as the gruff Walter and I found his performance to be just as memorable, if not, even more so than Jeff's. I could genuinely not imagine anyone else playing these two characters because of how much they embody them.Every scene in this movie is like its own comedy vignette, which makes it very rewatchable. The crime-related main story of the movie takes a back seat to the various strange and comical encounters and exchanges that the Dude happens upon throughout, so if you're watching this movie hoping to have a complex narrative about blackmail, fingerprints, and what not, you might be disappointed. Nonetheless, I feel like the crime aspect taking a back seat was a good choice for what the Coens set out to do in trying and gave the film less of a ball-and-chain to drag around.If you're looking for a comedy you can watch your friends on the weekend, you might skip the Hangover and choose this comedy classic instead.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Classic in Every Way,"Once again, the Coens go and make an original picture that is hard to match anywhere else in entertainment. Speaking honestly as far the story goes, The Big Lebowski is to movies the way Alice in Wonderland is to books. It is really like no other movie that I have seen before. True it does seem to go all over the place, but in the end there are no loose ends that are left untied. An achievement that you don't see much in the mainstream due to the fact that they hope to make a sequel.After watching and laughing within the first five minutes of the film, I had to pause it every now and then to control myself before continuing. There's so much in this film to love that it is no surprise that film has gained a cult following. What I personally love about this film is how the Coens picked actors that actually looked like someone that you would find walking down the street or inhabiting the suburbs of America. Jeff Bridges just nails his famous role as ""The Dude"" and is part of the reason I think people like this film. The entire film is pretty much about an average guy thrust into this random stream of events and he's still trying to figure out what the hell is going on.If you haven't seen it, watch it.

It Gets Better Every Time I Watch It,"What began as a confusing fever dream slowly grew into one of my favorite comedies of all time. The Big Lebowski ages like a fine wine and it gets better every time I watch it. I start connecting plot points that first appeared scattershot and random, discovering new punchlines that add a whole new layer to the movie's already hilarious abundance of well-time jokes and character moments. This is easily one of the most quotable movies of all time. Every line of dialogue is so sharp and perfectly timed. Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are absolutely hilarious and have amazing delivery of even the most mundane conversations. The Dude and Walter are some of the funniest characters I've ever watched onscreen. The rest of the cast are also hilarious, whether it's the magnificent bowler Jesus, the laughably incoherent German nihilists, or even the gleefully unengaged Donnie played by Steve Buscemi. I love the movie's groovy soundtrack and soothing narration by Sam Ellliot. The movie's outlandish imagery and quick-shot gags are iconic and the film's philosophy of ""dudeism"" is oddly profound.

the Dude as Christ figure?,"Now I am not one of those who like to read too much meaning into everything, and no bible thumper either, but I couldn't help noticing the following similarities between the Dude and JC:the obvious physical similarities..hair, beard, sandals and loose-fitting plain clothingthe simple and impoverished lifestyleboth are 'baptised' early in the significant part of their histories.both have visionary dreams.both turn the other cheek (this is the Dude's most noticable trait..no matter who beats on him or what indignities he suffers, he never offers anyone the slightest threat or violent reaction).both have close associates who tend to take things a bit too far.both are called to self-sacrifice in the promise of reward from the ""big guy"", who ultimately let's them down and proves to be less than he appeared.both are importuned and tempted by a whore, to whose feet they pay homage.And finally, what about the Sam Elliot line at the end, about the Dude out there 'layin' back fer all us sinners' ?I wouldn't want this to distract from the simple of enjoyment of yet another Coen Bros masterpiece of dark comedy, but I can't help wondering if this is just my imagination or if the brothers actually did this on purpose.If so, they tipped us another little clue by throwing in an almost demonic character named Jesus...not pronounced Hey-soos either :)",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Summary,"Have you ever been told a story before that was so out there, and funny that you couldn't help but laugh? However when it was all over you stopped to reflect on the movie that you just saw and realized you had no idea what you just saw? This movie is the story of Jeffrey Lebowski and his run in with Jeffrey Lebowski (The big Lebowski). In a variety of plot twists and turns with fake kidnappings and a pornographic producer looking for his payday, somehow unfolded in it all is a movie. Mostly considered to have darker films, the Cohen Brothers take a swing at humor. Even though they very much succeed, it all goes back to how much this movie makes no sense and goes nowhere. With their more serious movies they have first and second acts with conclusions and all. With The Big Lebowski things just sort of happen and then nothing at all. By watching the movie you get embraced into their world as if going on a vacation. You go there, and then you leave  you might have some fun, and some laughs, and you might not. Whether your experience is good or bad however, the discussions to follow the film will be anything but boring. Even if you didn't like the movie at all, the quotes you will be saying in the months to come will be ever lasting and unforgettable.

The Coen Brothers flex their versatility with weird and zany,"John Goodman and Jeff Bridges are an absolutely fantastic duo in The Big Lebowski. However, I want to talk about the direction of the Coens' for this film. The writing also reminded me of Thomas Pynchon's Inherent Vice a decent amount, and I definitely mean that as a positive.However, the Coen brothers' direction is for me what brings the other components of the film together. The film's weird psychedelic scenes, the slow motion bowling with John Turturro, and the wonderful use of space, particularly with the houses of the two Lebowskis, all add comedic, eccentric depth to an otherwise still funny movie. The trip The Dude takes when he lays down on his floor on his rug and starts flying is one of the psychedelic scenes that comes to mind. it feels so odd, but in another way, entirely right. John Turturro's (Jesus Quintana) character does not have much to him other than the beautiful slow motion bowling scene, but man is that enough. Finally, I got to thinking about the disparity of space between the two Lebowski places. The Dude's place is relatively small, but it's there that we go on a trip (and Treehorn's place, but that's for another time) that opens up to the whole city. Whereas when we are at The Big Lebowski's place, The Dude, Brandt, Bunny, and almost anyone who enters looks small in comparison to the space of the house. It's an interesting dichotomy that truthfully may not mean much, but it's something small (I guess pun intended) that makes the direction of the movie more special. It's also just a legitimately very funny movie that really does thrive off the duo of Goodman and Bridges. It's weird and it's frequently nonsensical, but it's still worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Dude...,"It's nice to see a movie where the protagonist is even lazier than you. Jeff Bridges excellently portrays such a 'hero', the very lazy Dude Lebowski who deals with stressful situations by swearing and drinking. He has no particular powers or gifts--he is, instead, refreshingly honest.However, he doesn't shove this honesty in your face. Overall, Bridges provides a unique performance, which is built by other name actors like Julianne Moore, John Goodman, David Thewlis and Philip Seymour Hoffman (who's also just awesome).Don't expect too much of this intellectually, and the dream sequences are a bit strange, but otherwise this is a great, funny sort of rainy day movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Entertaining but ""slight"" Coen Bros. fare","I have long been a fan of the Coen Brothers films, and I admit I was hugely disappointed with the Big Lebowski when I first saw it in the theaters, especially since it was the Coen's first film release since  the incredible Fargo and many viewers (like myself) had high expectations.So I avoided viewing it again for a few years until I got the urge to complete my Coen Bros. video collection and I hoped that with the passing of some time my opinion would change. It did for the better.Granted, The Big Lebowski is still no Fargo, and I still think granting this film a higher rating than far better Coen films is awfully gratuitous, but at least it can be viewed and appreciated on it's own terms now instead of having the critical and commercial triumph of Fargo looming overhead. Unlike films such as Fargo, Barton Fink, or Oh Brother, Lebowski plays as a loose, far less structured, and meticulous affair. The Coen Bros. quirkness abounds, but seems to be devised more for pure pleasure than imagery of any deeper, metaphorical meaning. This actually makes it unique among Coen Bros. films, because one gets the sense that they just wanted to make a straight forward (for them, at least) comedy about a character thrusted in a weird predicament that's incongruous to his persona. It does seem to play a bit forced, however, as if the Coens felt that they needed to uphold their trademark stylizations, and the dialogue does get a bit wordy and tiresome after a while. It entertains on a fairly basic surface level, whereas other films in the Coen catalog (such as Barton Fink) have an incredible amount of depth and are far more thought provoking. There's nothing cryptic or profound here, the depth of the film lies in the filmmaker's vision and the character development, but not so in a storyline with any underlying hidden meanings or moral lessons.Overall an entertaining and engaging film, but definitely not the best Coen Bros. film nor ""the funniest film ever made"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Probably my favorite comedy of all time,"I'm not a big fan of comedies in general because the humor is always corny and almost condescending to the viewer. Modern humor in films is always this sarcastic, annoying, predictable thing that just frustrates me and makes me want to not continue watching.The Big Lebowski is the complete opposite of that. The jokes are well made, very funny and rely on the contrast between the varied and memorable characters and the events that unfolds between them. The story is also intriguing and keeps you engaged during the entirety of the film. It's a relaxing, fun and hilarious film that I've watched many times and plan on watching many times in the future.I would highly recommend you watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

When the crime genre is combined with comedy, Coens creates a mystery film where you never really know what will happen next.

A Quirky yet Profound Odyssey,"The Big Lebowski,"" a film directed by the Coen Brothers, is a cinematic masterpiece that defies easy categorization. It skillfully weaves together elements of comedy, drama, and noir, creating a unique and brilliant concoction.The film's plot, while seemingly intricate, is a tour de force of absurdity. Jeff Bridges' portrayal of ""The Dude,"" a laid-back, White Russian-loving bowling enthusiast, is nothing short of iconic. The narrative follows The Dude as he finds himself mistaken for a millionaire named Lebowski, leading him into a tangled web of kidnapping, mistaken identity, and existential musings. The Coen Brothers' knack for crafting intricate plots with a veneer of chaos is evident throughout the film, but it's the journey, not the destination, that truly captivates the audience.The ensemble cast is where ""The Big Lebowski"" truly shines. John Goodman's Walter Sobchak is a tour de force of over-the-top machismo and misplaced loyalty, providing both comic relief and a touch of pathos. Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, among others, bring their A-game, each adding layers of depth and humor to what could have been mere caricatures.Beneath its comedic exterior, ""The Big Lebowski"" delves into profound themes of identity, nihilism, and the American Dream. However, the Coen Brothers manage to critique society's obsessions and failures with a light touch, making the film both entertaining and thought-provoking. The visual style, with its 90s aesthetic and the dreamy, almost ethereal quality of certain scenes, complements the film's thematic depth.The music and atmosphere further enhance the film's impact. Carter Burwell's score, combined with an eclectic soundtrack that ranges from Bob Dylan to Kenny Rogers, creates an atmosphere that's both nostalgic and vibrant. The bowling alley scenes, in particular, become a character of their own, pulsating with life and providing a backdrop that's both mundane and profoundly symbolic.Criticisms: Some viewers might not appreciate the film's unconventional pace or its meandering narrative, which sometimes feels more like a collection of loosely connected stories rather than a tightly woven plot. The film requires a high tolerance for the absurd, which may not appeal to those seeking conventional storytelling or straightforward comedy.Conclusion: ""The Big Lebowski"" is not just a movie; it's an experience. It invites multiple viewings, revealing new layers of humor and meaning each time. For those who connect with its offbeat humor and philosophical undertones, it's a near-perfect slice of cinema. However, for others, it might be an acquired taste. Nevertheless, for those who ""get it,"" The Dude remains one of the most memorable characters in modern cinema, making ""The Big Lebowski"" a quirky yet profound odyssey worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Big Lebowski,"The Coen Brothers go back to their quirky black comedy roots of Crimewave and Raising Arizona.The Big Lebowski is a stoner comedy fantasy with larger than life characters.Set in the early 1990s during the time of the first Iraq war.Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is the Dude. A middle aged stoner unemployed waster. The antithesis of Reagan's America.His apartment is broken into by two thugs who mistaken him for the millionaire Lebowski. One of them urinates in his rug which upsets the Dude.The Dude loves ten pin bowling and he has strangely weird friends like the loud and gung ho Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) as well as the timid and silly Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi.)The Dude sets off to find Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston) who is a wealthy man in a wheelchair with a much younger trophy wife called Bunny.When Bunny goes missing and is feared kidnapped. The Dude is called in by The Big Lebowski to deliver the ransom money and learn if the kidnappers are the same thugs who broke into his apartment.Walter wants to double cross the kidnappers by keeping the ransom money. The Dude speculates if the kidnaping is a scam by Bunny who was in debt.The drop off goes wrong and the ransom money is stolen. The Dude later meets The Big Lebowski's daughter Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) who tells him that her father is not as wealthy as he makes out to be.Despite the far out absurdist comedy and the fantasy sequences. In his heart this is a neo noir counterculture comedy thriller of mistaken identity and double crosses. It is the Dude who figures out just what is happening but needs Walter for the muscle when more nihilist thugs turn up.It has acquired a cult status mainly because of the performances of Bridges, Goodman and John Turturro as Jesus Quintana the stylish bowler who exposed himself to an eight year old girl.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

8 - Great,"This movie is a beautiful mess. First and foremost, it's a laugh out loud hilarious farcical comedy with an pleasantly odd sense of humor and a penchant for satire. It's also a crime drama with some mystery and mind bending elements. The acting is great and the directing has a level of meticulousness and polish to be admired.It has a way of making a simple story needlessly complex and adds unresolved plot threads on top of unresolved plot threads with a badge of honor.

The Big Lebowski is what America is, at least if you're looking at it from the view of a Coen Brother.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
This is Just Like My Opinion Man,"The Big Lebowski is the 7th film written, produced and directed by the Coen Brothers. The script was written in the early '90s around the time they released Barton Fink. In the meantime, they wrote, produced and directed the box office bomb, The Hudsucker Proxy, as well as the critically acclaimed and Oscar award-winning, Fargo. They waited as long as they needed to get Jeff Bridges and John Goodman in the cast and it paid off big time.Similar to The Big Sleep, The Big Lebowski takes a convoluted plot to extreme measures. Both films include a wealthy, handicapped millionaire, promiscuous young women, blackmailers and pornographers. Both films make us connect characters to one another and piece together a scattered plot.Taking a large step back from everything that happens in The Big Lebowski, the story is essentially about nothing. There is no money in the briefcase. There is no hostage. The nihilists believe in nothing except money. The Dude is not seen bowling. The Dude has no job and we don't know how he makes an income. Walter uses Shomer Shabbos as an excuse to do nothing on Saturday even though he's no longer Jewish. The only reason The Dude gets involved with Lebowski is due to his rug and agrees to work with him for just a small portion of the ransom. From the beginning, The Dude, Walter and Maude assume that Bunny kidnapped herself to extort money from Lebowski.The bowling alley is the safe haven for The Dude and his team. Walter takes the bowling league very seriously. He threatens a bowler with a gun for stepping over the line and gets him to mark zero on his scorecard. When bowling rival Jesus Quintana (John Turturro) confronts the team, Walter reminds them he's a sex offender that exposed himself to an eight-year-old. Throughout the story, The Dude shares his news to Walter and Donny at the bowling alley. The mysterious man most likely overhears their conversations which is why he can narrate The Dude's story. He's seen talking to The Dude at the bowling alley's bar and appears again at the end. He never introduces himself, but Sam Elliot's resonant accent and thick mustache make his character memorable.The script is very funny and explicit. The Dude and Walter's dialogue often clash but it doesn't get in the way of their friendship. The script was written specifically for Jeff Bridges and John Goodman's characters. Jeff Bridges is perfectly cast as The Dude, he's often misunderstood and spacing out in his own world. Unlike previous Coen Brothers films with Steve Buscemi, Donny can barely get a word out before Walter tells him to shut up. Julianne Moore puts on an interesting accent as Maude, that isn't distinct to any one place. Maude's giggly assistant, abstract artwork and sexual nature make her one of the funniest characters in the film. She's the centerpiece of the Gutterballs dream sequence as a sexy Viking surrounded by bowling pin dancers.The soundtrack is great and it's referenced throughout the film. The Dude and Walter are listening to Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Run Through the Jungle"" when delivering the briefcase. The cops who look for the car are worried the tape deck with Creedence would be stolen and are relieved when they find it still there. The song used in the opening credits, ""The Man in Me"" by Bob Dylan is used again when Maude knocks out The Dude and takes back the rug. They play the Rolling Stones song ""Dead Flowers"" by Townes Van Zandt after Donny's death.The directing by Coen Brothers is very well done. Many of the cast members are reoccurring from previous films they've directed. The film's structure was influenced by detective fiction writer Raymond Chandler. The cinematography by Roger Deakins made the scenes look contemporary with the time period and the dream sequences to look bizarre. Deakins worked on previous Coen Brothers films such as Barton Fink and Fargo, as well as The Shawshank Redemption. The editing is impressive, especially during the dream sequences. The first-person camera shot inside the bowling ball as it rolls down the lane for a strike looks very sharp. They use pan and zoom shots frequently to go from a wide view of the setting to the subjects. They use long takes, the most impressive coming in the final scene, that finishes with a strike.At the time, The Big Lebowski was one of the Coen Brothers highest budgeted films at $15 million. It grossed just over $46 million worldwide. The Big Lebowski can be enjoyed on many viewings and it succeeds as both a comedy and a crime film. I highly recommend this film to adults.4/4",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Not outstanding (as a Coen brothers movie) but still worth watching.,"To point out the less obvious, John Goodman has already played a nutcase character in other Coen Brothers movies: ""Raising Arizona"" (As the prison escapee) and ""Barton Fink"" (as the arson-murderer). In this, he plays a disgruntled Vietnam veteran. And Steve Buscemi, for the hundredth time, plays a pedophile. It's starting to look a little tacky and routine. Maybe, now that the Coens received Academy Awards for ""Fargo"" they should reconsider to hire other actors?Well, I marginally recommend this film. It seemed like another version of Fargo (kidnapping, ransom) only this was stranger and Fargo was much better. There's really little to recommend about in this movie, but it was one of the better films to be released in the early '98 year. Worth seeing once.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Charming and outlandish drama.,"I've seen this movie about 15 times. To say that it is 'hilarious' is pushing it a bit. I think it has it's moments; funny it is, but ""Groundhog Day"" it ain't...To say that it is the greatest movie ever made: now THAT is hilarious!""The Big Lebowski"" is the pothead/college clever guy/film student anthem that always seems to find it's way on DVD into every one of the aforementioned's film collections.The amazingly talented Jeff Bridges portrays a dude named, well, The Dude, who shares the same last name as a crippled millionaire who is involved with some shady characters. The Dude suffers for this, but he and his sidekick, 'Nam Vet Walter, manage to come out looking like two diamonds in the rough amongst a host of wealthier, shallower individuals.Not without some awesome lines and scenes, ""The Big Lebowski"" stumbles through 'a few weeks in the life of' The Dude in his adventure. By the end, we are satisfied and we basically learn that people who bowl in bowling alleys, sleep in low-rent apartments and drink White Russians all day are people too. And sometimes they are better than the wealthy and the elite.Only problem is, if you didn't already know that, what you need to do is drop out of college, stop having mommy and daddy pay your bills and join the real world.

"Yeah, well. The Dude abides.","Maude Lebowski: What do you do for recreation? The Dude: Oh, the usual. I bowl. Drive around.

""Sometimes you eat the bar, and sometimes, well, he eats you.""Some driving around in a comedy of errors where John Goodman really shines as Walter Sobchak. With friends like that, you certainly don't need enemies. We also meet really colorful characters like Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore), who just wants The Dude's seed; Bunny Lebowski (Tara Reid), the porn star turned gold-digger; and, of course, The Big Lebowski (David Huddleston) and his faithful servant Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman).

weird and boring,"If you like quirky, and John Goodman, then rent Raising Arizona instead.The plot begins with Jeff Bridge's character being mistaken for another man with the same name.  The other man's wife apparently has a lot of outstanding debts and the ruffians who pay Jeff a visit urinate on his rug before he finally convinces them he's NOT the rich husband they're looking for.  He's simply a bum known by everyone as ""the dude"".  The dude decides that if he simply visits the rich guy with the same name, he can probably talk him into replacing his rug, since technically they were supposed to have urinated on the rich guy's rug instead.  The rich fellow, however, tells the dude that his wife's been kidnapped and asks the dude to carry the ransom money to them.Why?  Good question... and from there, the story gets even more confusing and pointless.  Which, the filmmakers freely admit.  On the DVD version, the filmmakers frankly state that the confusing plot takes a back seat to the quirky characters we get to meet.  Oh joy.They even admit that when one of the actors asked what his character's motivation was, or why he was even in the story - they didn't have an answer for him.  They say this laughing (at the viewers?).Anyways... the only positive thing I can say about this movie is that the visuals and transitions are unique and creative, and that Jeff Bridges proves again that he's such a good actor he can even come out shining when buried under a pile of feces.  His portrayal of the dude is priceless - and he doesn't dance half-bad either.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"I'm not sure if it was top 250 good, but I still had a few good laughs","I'm not sure why, but lately, I have just been hearing reference after reference of The Big Lebowski lately. Not to mention my sister telling me how funny this movie is and that I should definitely watch it. Well, my sister just handed me the movie and said she would not speak to me until I watched it. Some ultimatum, huh? Well, I did watch it immediately.The Big Lebowski over all was a funny film. I had more than a few good laughs. I think my favorite running gag was between John Goodman and Steve Buchemi and how John just keeps telling him to ""Shut the F up, Donnie"" and finally his last line to him is ""These are bad men, Donnie"", I'm not sure why I found it so funny, maybe it was the way it was said. It just played off so well. Also the Jesus gag, the Spanish bowlers were hilarious. Not to mention a few other scenes of The Dude getting knocked out.But still, I'm not too sure if I found this movie to be funnier than other comedies I prefer.

Obnoxious characters swamped in a story that is much too pretentious and complicated for its own good,"Here are the highlights of ""The Big Lebowski."" The opening scene with Jeff Bridges, as a never-do-well being comically ambushed by two men in his home, one of whom urinates on his living room rug. Mr. Bridges again, dropping a joint on his crotch while he's driving and careening into a trash can. Mr. Bridges yet again babbling absolute nonsense, trying to fake his way out of a jam. Mr. Bridges, yes he, being bonked in the head with a ceramic mug.You would think that these moments, coupled with the fact that Mr. Bridges plays the lead, would make ""The Big Lebowski"" a deliriously funny comedy. But alas, it's just valiantly unsuccessful. For Mr. Bridges is far more interesting than the dopey character that's been written for him by his directors, the much-lauded Joel and Ethan Coen. And those highlights were predominantly jabs of slapstick: the only truly funny moments in the film, much more than the pseudo-insights of American culture and pornography. Another great moment, this one featuring John Goodman, has him bashing up a would-be perpetrator's car with a crowbar, only to have a neighbor (the real owner of the car) come screaming out of the house, taking the crowbar, and bashing in Mr. Bridges's car instead.In other words, when the writer/directors go for simplistic and old-fashioned slapstick, coupled with their terrific wide-screen techniques and misc en scene, really works. It's the rest of their pretentious sense of humor that does not work. For once again, they have nose-dived into a pool of complexity, stretching out for something they don't quite have the understanding to reach. They have the ideas; what they lack is the patience to compose it in a way that not only communicates their ideas to the audience, but make it fascinating at the same time. For example, they add some pornographic subtext to the game of bowling (they might just be the only filmmakers to ever do that) but what exactly it means comes up very fuzzily. As is the show-stopping moment where Mr. Bridges goes into a drug-induced hallucination with him and Julianne Moore in an unnervingly peculiar bowling/sex extravaganza. What exactly, do I mean? I'm not sure, and I am not about to watch the film a second time, because it had me restless thirty minutes in.Mr. Bridges does a nice enough job playing a character so sloppy and whiny that it borders on the ridiculous. And not in a good way. It's funny to have him cry out ""I'm the Dude!"" the first few times, but when it happens again and again for two hours, it really wears thin. As does John Goodman screaming at Steve Buscemi ""Shut the (expletive) up, Donny!"" Speaking of Mr. Goodman, he pours a lot of energy into his role, and I guess I cannot honestly say his performance is bad, but it became tiring seeing him on-camera after a while. The fault lies in the character, who is much too obnoxious and redundant to be funny. Mr. Buscemi gives a much more likable performance for a much more likable character, but is hardly on screen. How sad is that? Well, not his denouement.Surround these characters with a lumpy story far too complicated for its own good and you've got a dull picture. ""The Big Lebowski"" is clearly aiming to make commentaries of such, as demonstrated by Sam Elliott's out-of-the-blue appearances here and there in the picture, but they become lost in a pretentiously muddled screenplay.The Coen brothers are good directors. They have great craftsmanship. A key moment is when the camera takes a bowling ball's point-of-view as it thunders down a lane. Slow-motion shots of the pins scattering, though gimmicky and seen before, are also fun to look at. So they can direct; they have talent! Immense talent. But they really do need to hire somebody to rework their screenplays, for that is where they fall short more often than not. Come the end of ""The Big Lebowski,"" I was not pondering over what Sam Elliott had just said in his closing speech, and what it had to do with all that happened in the two hours before, but instead, this.In the scene where Mr. Bridges and Mr. Goodman are having a would-be sentimental moment by the ocean, who was that character I saw walking on the hill crest in the top-right section of the screen?",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Hey!  Easy does it!  There's a beverage present here, man.","The funniest part of this, 'down and outers' comedy is, that I know several guys, that if you took and rolled them into one, they would equal the Dude, Jeffrey LeBowski. that's pretty scary. I don't even think that they have seen the movie, but who cares?Jeff Bridges is so stinking versatile I can't believe it from a reel-live slacker extraordinare to (The Big LeBowski 1998) a reel-President- (The Contender 2000) with out skipping a beat. For all intensive purposes this movie would be a real waste of time, but this was a side splitting whimsical good time!! From Julliane Moore as the egocentric, emotionally-sterile 'Maude' who was a suspicious investigator, to the best friend (Goodman) who's religious nationality 'changes' because of his 'Ex' who dumped him cold. But as long as he can 'bowl' with the Dude, all his other short-comings, just seem to go by the way-side. But through it all, he (Goodman's character) was a loyal buddy to Jeff and a decent friend, even if he could acquire 'fingers' by 3:00...with nail polish. In all fairness though, LeBowski as a 'private' investigator, reminds me of a quote from 'Dirty Harry' where Harry states (after the 'demise' of a man who is a victim of his own stupidity and greed) 'A man should know his own limitations.' and in this case, having Jeffrey investigate is just as swift as letting the 'fox' guard that Ole' hen house. This was a 'slackers delight' and watching someone who is as good a player as 'Bridges' play a tremendously convincing 'Loser' is just a rare treat. In the comedy section, this one is an ever so often player. Just one that you 'havfta see' every now and again.

A great piece of cult movie making,"If you see any ""greatest film lists"" or if your looking for top award winners, you will never find The Big Lebowski. Film critics will not praise it, as it doesn't really have any underlying message on life, love or the dangers of drugs or whatever. They would feel ashamed to admit that this is one of the best films ever. Fortunately, thanks to the regular film viewers on IMDb, The Big Lebowski gets the praise it so rightfully deserves, and a cemented place in the top #250.It offers so many things. It has the usual brilliant Coen Bros script, with its twisting plot and humour. It has so many unusual and wonderful characters. It really is one of the funniest films ever. They could have easily taken the script and made it into a good thriller. But the Coens made it into so much more.The characters are just brilliant. Jeff Bridges is great as ""The Dude"", who never fails to have a drink in his hand, and ends each sentence with ""man"". John Goodman puts in a terrific performance, as a Vietnam veteran who turns into a raving lunatic at the drop of a hat, but ""doesn't roll on Shabbah"". My favourite performance comes from Steve Buscemi, despite only having a relatively small part. He maintains a rather puzzled expression throughout, only to interrupt conversations at random intervals. The Coens could have easily left Donnie out of the film, but it's little additions like him that make this film great.There's so many great quotes and scenes in the film, and showing the dreams in the weird mind of The Dude such as the scene with the flying carpet, just adds a bizarre yet wonderful quality that most comedies don't have.At the end of the film, after viewing all the wacky characters, danger and plot twists, The Dude brings to your attention that all he wanted was his rug! This just adds to the comic approach the Coens went for, and The Big Lebowski leaves you feeling happy and warm inside, as you have just witnessed such greatness on screen.When I look at the fact that The Big Lebowski won just 1 (minor) award, it just proves that there is no justice in the world of film, and I find it hard to swallow that such genius can go unrewarded.By my reckoning this is one of the Coen brothers finest achievements to date, up there with Fargo and Miller's Crossing, and believe me, that is some achievement. Their unique and clever scripts show they have so much more imagination than most screen writers, and despite the fact they haven't made a really great film for a few years, I hope they are just laying dormant and will give us another wonderful film such as The Big Lebowski.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Allegorical Genius,"The Big Lebowski is rare in the world of motion pictures. It's like a well written book (like Dune or LOTR) in that you can walk away with something new from it with each repeated viewing. The Cohen brothers put a lot of thought into their films, and the Big Lebowski is no exception.Talking crap about a movie is the easiest thing to do, and I've read a few reviews that have done just that about Lebowski. In these people's defense, it's easy to jump to this conclusion because at first glance, it appears to be a meaningless film. But if it were meaningless, why set the film during the first Gulf War? Why do a period piece set 7 years before the movie's release? Because they're playing with allegory here, trying to say something about America.There is much evidence of this. The perceptive viewer will note that we're dealing with clearly cut characters that embody archetypes of American culture. We're also dealing with events that mimic the political and sociological landscape of 1991. In addition, most period pieces splash nostalgia all over the screen, but there's hardly any in Lebowski. This movie is a humorous, tongue-in-cheek statement about the health of the American character circa 1991.But even if you take the meaning of the movie out of the equation, The Big Lebowski is a top notch film. The characters and their interactions in the movie are entertaining. The direction plums the depths of their potential and brings it out for us to enjoy. The scenes work to promote the themes of the movie and give us a good laugh in the process.

Not their best work,"I'm a BIG fan of the Coen Brothers. I've seen all of their movies, and while The Big Lebowski was a pretty good film and was basically very entertaining, I would rank it right near the bottom of their movies. I thought Bridges and Goodman were very good, but there just wasn't anything in the movie that really grabbed you and held your attention, as there is in Blood Simple, Barton Fink, Miller's Crossing, Raising Arizona, Fargo, even The Hudsucker Proxy. Although I was essentially disappointed, if this is one of the worst of the Coen Brothers offerings (and I think it is,) that's not too bad of a thing, because it's still a pretty good flick. One of the reasons I'm such an admirer of theirs is the fact that their movies really are not only unique compared to other popular movie makers, but they are truly unique from each other. They are very inventive, really as good as we have today.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
This ol' movie really ties the collection together.,"Jeff Bridges is perfect as Jeff Lebowski, a.k.a. The Dude; he's an ageing, amiable slacker who doesn't do much with his time besides bowl. When he's mistaken for a rich man (David Huddleston) with the same name, he's hired by the rich man to deliver a ransom. Things go from bad to worse in a hurry, in large part because The Dude frequently involves his loud, abrasive buddy Walter (John Goodman), a crazed Vietnam vet, in his actions.In terms of the overall Coen brothers filmography, this is relatively minor stuff. It goes on a little too long, and wasn't always terribly funny to this viewer. It also feels self-indulgent at times. And yet, Joel and Ethan here craft a twist-laden, elaborate story that does have some good moments, as well as a highly profane script and an eclectic soundtrack. (The Dude hates The Eagles, but is a big fan of CCR.) Its quotes certainly entered the public consciousness in a big way, with Bridges quickly becoming a pop culture icon in his role. ""Well, you know, that's just like your opinion, man.""The main reason it worked to any degree (at least for this viewer) was because of its impressive and well-chosen cast: Sam Elliott (as a friendly narrator), Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi (as in ""Shut the *beep* up, Donny!""), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, Peter Stormare, David Thewlis, Flea, Ben Gazzara, Jon Polito, etc. John Turturro is such a hoot as a bowler named Jesus that it's too bad that his screen time is so limited.""The Big Lebowski"" is a truly character-driven comedy that does wrap up in a typically amusing way, and it shows that its main character can't just be dismissed as a non-thinking deadbeat; he knows when he's been used.

A Humorous Dark Coen Brothers Film,"Today I saw ""The Big Lebowski"" for the first time. Somehow I missed this movie in 1998 and never saw it on DVD in the years after its release. About the only thing that I knew about the film was that Jeff Bridges was ""The Dude"". Now I know the rest of the story.Before moving on, I'll offer up this quick disclaimer: This is in no way a family friendly film. That should be expected from the Coen Brothers, but since I went into it not knowing what to expect at all, and my only perception of the film being that it was mostly a comedy, I thought that it might be somewhat lighter than most of the Coens' stable of films. And it was. But there's still language throughout the movie, along with some fairly adult themes at points. Several times along the way I found myself feeling that this was the Coens' answer to ""Pulp Fiction"" (the chasing of the brief case, the remark about the quality of the In-n-Out Burger, the fact that Bridges dresses like Travolta and Jackson at the end of PF, etc.).The film is quite funny, in that dark style of humor that the Coens are known for. Sometimes the humor is so prevalent that it becomes banal. Nevertheless the film does feature quite a few good laughs. But then mixed in with those laughs are the odd Coen Brothers moments, such as what I'll call ""the ear scene"", in which the mixture of humor and horror blends in a way that challenges the viewer's comfort.My main beef with this film is that it doesn't end with a resolution. Yes, all ends well (Spoiler alert, but ""The Dude Abides""). Still, you never find out what happens to the briefcase or whether it had money in it (another similarity to Pulp Fiction). The situation with Bunny sort of gets forgotten, too. All in all the ending of the film just felt anticlimactic to me.I nevertheless did enjoy the movie, though. It is what it is, a Coen Brothers film that makes you laugh all while pushing boundaries. Still just as there are Elvis people and Beatles people, I think that there are Coen Bros. people and Tarrantino people, and I'm a Tarrantino person. So I think I'm going to go with 7/10 stars.

Perhaps the funniest scene in the whole movie is Moore's character flying overhead to squirt paint on her abstract art... after reading that her character was influenced by Yoko Ono, it couldn't be more hilarious and true. I did love the cinematography and lighting, as well as the frequent dives into psychedelic episodes. The transitions into those scenes were especially well executed. All in all, the characters were casted near perfectly, and the constant juxtaposition of a stoner and Hollywood drama sequences was hilarious... that's what works with this movie. The bare concept is so hilarious that the entire movie is just soaking it all in, and even then it isn't overdone.

it's a waste of time.right DUDE?,"I was quite interested in watching it.I thought it would be a 2 hours of laughter marathon.In the end i realized i didn't even laugh a single time.the whole story is hardly bears any meaning and there were some jokes i didn't get at all.One more important point is IMDb has been very poor in case of judging comedies.I just found ""Monty Python and the holy grail"" the same boring as Big Lebowski.So,don't be fooled by rating like me.My rating is 1(aweful)",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Priceless!,"A typical Coen movie - plot intertwined with sub-plot intertwined with another sub-plot intertwined with seemingly genuine and lovable characters (as well as 'love-to-hate' characters). What's not to love about the Dude? I aspire to be more like him everyday, and even if that's the only thing you take away from this film, it would be well worth it. This guy introduced me to 'White Russian' ('Caucasian') cocktails - vodka, Kahlua and cream. Try to keep up with the plot, learn to love Donnie but overall, enjoy the laid back humour and classic 'one liners' that you'll be repeating over and over...and over..and over again!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The rug really ties the room together!,"As bowling movies go (and fortunately there aren't many), I think we have to admit that The Big Lebowski has it all over Kingpin (which itself was pretty good).  The Dude, Walter, Donny, Brandt, Maude, Bunny, Jesus, and even The Stranger & The Nihilists are all very memorable characters, and you'll laugh pretty much all the way through.

Another timeless classic of the 1990s,"Before I delve right into the review I have to say that I am great bowling fan and play it from time to time with some of my friends. Yet, I didn't saw THE BIG LEBOWSKI until last April, and when I finally did, I knew I would have loved it. As there are to date 1401 reviews I'll be short.Jeffrey Lebowski known as the Dude (Jeff Bridges) is a slacker that spends most of his days in his robe and going bowling with his friends Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Theodore Donald Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). One day the Dude is assaulted by two enforcers sent by an adult movie kingpin Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) despite they realize after a rug accident that they got the wrong man with the same name. After various accidents and misunderstandings, the Dude and his pals will do everything for giving the ransom money and go out of the mess.I'll talk about what I loved: Jeff Bridges gives probably his greatest performance of his colorful career, and he nailed the good-hearted slacker part well. John Goodman is also great as the obsessed Vietnam war veteran and Steve Buscemi? He gives his usual likeable performance as the guy with always the right catchphrase in the right moment. The rest (Julianne Moore, Peter Stormare, Flea, Ben Gazzara, Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is good but not as great as our three heroes. The soundtrack is very 1990s and the script witty and full of funny moments.So, if you still haven't seen this movie, rush for it if you have the chance because it's one of those classics with a huge enjoyability factor. My only warning (and also my friend Martin Hafer said it), but still is very minor, is the language that might be too rough for younger viewers. Still, a real must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Powerful Characters Fooling Around. ♦ 65%,"John Goodman's character impressed me more than the Dude did. Because he is funnier & deep.Following the story of how a slacker and his bowling club friends fall into a parade of crime is written with humor in mind. The characters are very different & genuine from each other. The boldness is another thing to consider. Great music playing as the background score, there are few moments when it comes to total laugh out. The thought of these sequences will make you laugh. Improbable situations deliberately brought out by the characters will feed you with story, narration & food for thought.Lengthening the plot a bit and shut-up ending makes me feel not totally satisfied by the dude & his chums. I'll rate a humble 6.5/10 for the gang and the eclectic characters, music & setups. Very impressed as this is my first film by Coen Brothers. Steve Buscemi is good while Jeff Bridges is cool as hell.BOTTOM LINE: Extremely funny for people who can relate. Moderately funny for people who enjoy logical scripts.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Real Quality!,"The Big Lebowski is a movie to watch again and again - and yet enjoy its subtle humour and great atmosphere everytime. The Coen Brother's truely are great filmmakers - constantly providing us with witty, original scripts and deep memorable characters.The Big Lebowski - as with all the Coen films - is driven by sharp dialogue and excellent characters. The 'Dude' is the personification of laziness acted to perfection by Jeff Bridges, always wearing the same tatty clothes and hilariously drinking a milky White Russian ""Hey man i got a beverage here!"" We first meet the Dude in a shopping mall - with milk on his moustache - hilariously writing a cheque for 69cents! John Goodman is the Jewish Vietnam veteran Walter Schobchek - taking every opportunity to shout about his dead 'buddies' from the war and shout at Donny (Steve Buchemi). Donny is a quiet man with very little impact on the narrative - however the comedic relationship between him, Walter and the 'Dude' is a charm.The atmosphere created here gives superb viewing, with top notch cinematography and genuine, if obscure, relationships between the odd characters. But what you will remember most from this film are the hilarious quotations - ""F*** it dude, let go bowling"", ""Well thats just, like, your opinion man!"" and ""Obviously your not privy to the new s**t, man"" to name just a couple.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"One of the most original, unique movies of recent years. *** (out of four)","THE BIG LEBOWSKI / (1998) *** (out of four)By Blake French:The Coen Brothers are an artistic breed of their own. They add a twisted touch of humor to every project. They create imaginative characters, memorable stories, and ingenious dialogue. They have explored the lives of poets, hillbillies, cops, mobsters, adulterers, killers, and now a loser.That's right, ""The Big Lebowski"" explores the life of a big-time loser. A lazy, uninspiring, unemployed loser. His name is Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), who lives in the moment and wears a goatee, a beer belly, a ponytail, and a pair of oversized Bermuda shorts. He lives to bowl, drink White Russians, and to do drugs. (Character: What do you do for recreation? The Dude: Oh, the usual. Bowl, drive around. The occasional acid flashback).The Dude's best bowling pals, Donny (Steve Buscemi), who is never allowed to finish a sentence, and Walter (John Goodman), who is stuck in the past, diddle with the Dude as he goes with the flow, inhibiting not a care in the world. Until a porn king confuses the Dude for another person with the same name of Lebowski. Thugs invade the Dude's house, plunge his head into the toilet, and pee on his rug. They leave after they realize they have mistaken his identity.However, the Dude wants a new rug. Walter and The Dude take a trip to the rich Lebowski's. They get more than a rug. It appears that someone has kidnapped Lebowski's daughter and the wealthy bigwig wants the Dude to deliver the ransom money. The Dude agrees, and, of course, chaos ensues.Some of the material falls flat. A subplot about a bowling maniac named Jesus (John Turrturo) goes absolutely nowhere. Fortunately, many scenes work wonderfully, featuring original ideas, thought-provoking metaphors, experimental camera techniques, and eye-popping cinematography. I especially enjoyed how the film explores the Dude's dreams with sequences bursting with color, imagination, and peculiar images.Audiences will remember ""The Big Lebowski"" as one of the most imaginative films of the decade. The Coen brothers create an odd assortment of unique circumstances and characters. The quirky characters have lots of fun with the unbelievably profane, (Screenit.com informs us that the movie uses the ""F"" word 250+ times!), but strangely amusing dialogue.What does it all add up to? Well, there is plenty to think about and plenty to laugh at, but we do not leave with a powerful feeling of satisfaction. ""The Big Lebowski"" may resemble the spirit of ""Raising Arizona,"" another wildly funny comedy by the Coen's, but this movie's does not quite work as well. Both contain the same zany style, but that film felt inspired by plot. ""The Big Lebowski"" lacks plot. A string of amusing predicaments does not necessarily account for the absence of story.If the film would have followed a clear, comprehensible story, it may have been more involving, but that's clearly not what the Coen brother's wanted. Even before the opening credits begin, the film's narrator (Sam Elliot) explains that this film is about the Dude's adventures. It's not really a narrative of the Dude, but an examination of his reaction to life changing events. By the end of the movie, we sense the Dude has learned from his experiences, and because of them, he is a better personwell, kind of.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
great movie,"this is a great movie with no flaws (my opinion of course) also the performances were impeccable. although no awards or nominations were given it was still great. this is a movie you can watch over and over again. and still laugh every time. but this movie is not for some people like those who are contradictical of bowling, drugs, kidnappings, crime or nudity, it received and deserved it's r rating. that statement is mabey the only negativity i'll do on such a great film. but to e honest i almost didn't see this, on account of i thought it would be completely different, and because of no nominations of any awards, but this movie actually has made me think outside of the box for movies why else would i see malibu's most wanted.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Dude's Alright,"I didn't see The Big Lebowski upon its original release but more recently i decided it was time I checked out what seems to have become a major cult classic for many. In the folks I spoke with I think it's the actual character that inspires, excites, and evokes such devotion amongst them. This I can kind of understand. But with the film as a whole there's a bit of a divergence. The film itself is basically fine. With the exception of a few specifics the story isn't that original but what is unique in this story is the strong central characters (The Dude) reaction to/and handling of those situations and scenarios.

"A polarising, genreless film","My Dad absolutely loves this film; it speaks to him on a spiritual level or something. I personally don't understand the humour, and, when I do, find it too subtle to be funny. However The Big Lebowski doesn't fit into any other category of movie, so -- what is it?For me it was a disappointment, it having been so hyped up by my Dad. For others it was an absolute triumph, if you're into that kind of film. It takes a very specific person to enjoy a movie like that, but, if you do, it will certainly be one of your favourites. I guess it's much like Marmite, a kind of love-it hate-it situation. Personally I saw the funny side of it, and the reasons for it being such a cult classic, but it just didn't fit my style.Watch Fargo instead. If you've seen it, watch it again, and then think ""could the Coen brothers outdo themselves?"" If the answer is no, don't spoil your own opinion of them by seeing this film. If you think they could do something more out-there or interesting, sure give The Big Lebowski a go.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
a reluctant classic...,"This film still blows me away even after about 30 viewings! It is a blend of film noir/detective film(The BIG SLEEP, Maltese Falcon/All Through the Night)/comedy. The funny thing about it is you don't even realize that it is a detective film until you've seen it 2-3 times. I was loosely aware but it really sank in after the 3rd viewing! (i'm slow, i know) ""The Dude""(Jeff Bridges)is in just about every scene, if not every scene. You get so caught up in watching him, his ""laid backness"", and his compatriots that you forget they are actually involved in trying to negotiate a ransom drop and recover a kidnap victim.""The Dude"" is a reluctant hero along the lines of ""Rick"" from ""Casablanca"". Although not so self centered and altruistic as ""Rick"", it is evident from the start that ""The Dude"" would much rather be bowling and have a drink(a ""White Russian"", or as he called it, ""a Caucasian"") than have the responsibility of saving anyone's life.There may not be as many classic lines in this film as there are in the great films I compared it to above,but there are as many, if not more lines that get quoted by those who know and love this film.The last time I saw this(Big Lebowski) I kept asking myself what film does it remind me of the most?

Great moments...Eventually loses momentum,"Very offbeat, highly original movie that provides tie ins for mistaken identity, some effective and hilarious characters and off the wall situations. Unpredictable and free spirited, the ""Dude"", our protagonist gets caught in a web of intrigue. This intrigue seemingly and annoyingly takes him away from his happy life of apathy, unemployment and bowling. THE BIG LEBOWSKI is strictly Coen Brothers madness, in the vein of RAISING ARIZONA. The visuals, dream sequences, et al, are very funny and fit well in the movie. Unfortunately, the last half starts to slow down, as the characters start to seem repetitive in their reactions. The humor also waned, due to this, and the plot, not the film's strong suit to begin with, wears down with it. THE BIG LEBOWSKI is still yards ahead of most mainstream releases, yet we've grown rather accustomed (even spoiled) to expect so much more from the Coens. Recommended.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Funniest Film of All Time,"The first time I saw The Big Lebowski, I was incapable of speaking during the movie. It was literally so hilarious that I could do nothing but laugh during its running time; at some points, I was laughing so hard that I nearly fell off of my chair and tears ran down my face. I had already seen several Coen Brothers films before seeing this movie, including the masterpiece Fargo and the hilarious Raising Arizona, so I had high expectations going in. These expectations were more than exceeded; they were shattered by non-stop laughter. John Goodman gives perhaps the funniest performance in any movie I've ever seen and Jeff Bridges IS the Dude; nobody else could have played that role. The day after seeing it for the first time I watched it again, and it was even funnier than the first time, if that is possible. In the multiple viewings since then, I am still laughing out loud and finding new quotable lines. The Big Lebowski is rare in that it is not just hysterical but it is also smart. While I enjoy stupid comedies like Zoolander and Dumb and Dumber, it is so much better when the humor is both hilarious and clever. The Big Lebowski is the funniest movie I've ever seen and one of my all time favorites. I give it my highest recommendation: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The Dude abides ... and watches,"And swears a lot - and of course there is alcohol and other drugs involved too. I did not remember the small amount of nudity we do get to see - it had been way too long since I last watched this. And while I remember having issues with the humor in Fargo (the expecting the ""unexpected""), I know I really dug this. Still I have to rewatch Fargo some day - and then go on with the TV show they made too of course.But back to this - you cannot be easily offended. So much swearing ... so many weird characters (all played by really good actors most would say, even Tara Reid and her short stint in this work more than swell) ... so much craziness. And an episodic journey with his Dudeness. Jeff Bridges has done so many good movies, but this is the one movie he mostly will be remembered for. And he doesn't mind - why should he? Such a fun and over the top script and movie has to be cherished.There are so many iconic scenes, so many quotable things - from the STFU Donny, which is used so many times, to the ""this is what happens when you ... a man in the ..."" - something I can't write here, because the review would therefor not be allowed to exist. And then the iconic car missing scene. Which sprang the title for ""Dude where's my car"" ... at least that's how the story goes.The movie may be 2 hours long, but at no time did I feel the length of it ... wait, that may be a pun? Not as obvious as Jesus cleaning his (bowling) ball ... but still! Also nobody ... with the Jesus!

Its just not good,"I know this will get a lot of downvotes but... this movie is not good.I've tried. About six times now, I've seen The Big Lebowski, either most or in whole, and each time I wonder what people see in this movie.It is was never particularly amusing, rarely eliciting even the thought of ""Oh, that was funny"" much less an actual chuckle. The plot isnt really engaging, as it just sort of meanders through the content. The dialogue that is often lauded, is rather weak throughout the movie, with only a few of the scenes that have been meme'd to death being some of the few ""high"" points. The plot... exists.On a technical side, the sound isnt anything really praise-worthy, though I'm sure a lot of people will note the soundtrack itself, but that is addressed below.Nor is the cinematography worth mentioning with many shots being flat/center, with an occasional dolly shot thrown in to mix things up. Even when they had a chance to make things a little more 'wild', most of the shots are still flat/center (like the Dudes bowling dream sequence).The sound track feels almost ""obvious"", with certain choices feeling like they picked the most overly used choices they could find, or a close approximation.The clothing looks good/like a bunch of Goodwill stuff bought the day before shooting, which is what they were going for sure, but the only thing that shines here is the set design.Each locations ""feels"" right for its place in the story. The bowling alley is straight outta middle America, the Dudes house not only looks small, dingy, and in disrepair, but the overall choices for what went into the house clearly had a lot of thought put into it. When set design is a standout in your movie, somethings wrong. The only negative is that they made the overall space, especially the livingroom, a bit too spacious for someone like the Dude to actually have, but that is just a minor niggle.The acting is........ fine. It is not great, or even particularly good, per se, but the actors do their jobs well. Many of the characters feel one or two dimensional at best, with others being a single trait in human form. Even the Dude himself isnt much other than a stereotype of a 'cool loser' type.As stated, the few highs are whats already been meme'd to death, and even before that, they were more 'kooky/crazy/shocking' than actually amusing.(For example, John Goodman pulling a gun over a bowling foul was never amusing, but the scene following it, where they are having a conversation in the car as the cops rush the place, WAS slightly amusing, but could have been done to better effect)It does its best to get to the next scenes pretty quickly, which is a blessing in disguise, but it doesnt do even that in any particularly engaging manner either.I know this is a big favorite amongst the 420 crowd and certain others, and by all means keep enjoying this movie.I have tried many times to find merit in this film, even with perception altering legal substances, but its always been an extremely overrated film imho. I wish I could find what others see in this flick, but its just not there for me.Many people have stated this as their favorite movie. I've heard many different angles on why people enjoy it, but I still do not see what they do.Logjammin' was a better movie than The Big Lebowski.Sorry, everyone.Its just not a good movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Dude, the Name is Dude","I loved the Coens previous film, Fargo. I can see a lot of similarities between the two films. The Big Lebowski has a lot more humor than Fargo.

The cast is brilliant with John Goodman and Steve Buscemi as the Dude's best friends and bowling buddies. Julianne Moore is particularly memorable as Maude Lebowski.

Big is really BIG,"The style of noir, crossed with the era of the 60s and the Twilight Zone against the backdrop of the 90s, gave rise to the effect, on the one hand, of the multi-layered characters and interpretations, and on the other hand, accessibility for understanding by the ordinary viewer, and, consequently, recognition of themselves in the characters. And in fact, people like Dude, Walter and Donnie can often be found in various segments of the population in any country, whether it be the States or Russia. Infantile, psychotic, notorious and at the same time strangely charming inhabitants of the Coen universe suddenly gained a wide audience. And the plot, which in fact is not in the film at all, has gained vitality, as if in front of the viewer his own, albeit pretty stoned, everyday life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Phoning it in,"There are all sorts of ways to make a bad movie. Excrescences as diverse as Home Fries, Showgirls, Nothing but Trouble & Dune come to mind. After hinting at true originality with their first effort (Blood Simple), the Coens chose instead to coast and make a certain type of bad movie over and over.It's clear that they make more effort than most of Hollywood. But success can lead to a standard & safe approach to the work. The Coens return to the studio after each release and exert the exact same effort, making a similar movie, shifting locales, emulating the known favorites of a genre, changing a detail here or there, including the required amount of eccentricity that their fans expect. All signs are painstakingly arranged for the perception that it's a fine film. Your reaction has been engineered into the equation.But the Coens efforts are identical and the movies suffer from a debilitating sameness. It's as if they are most concerned that the production levels match from movie to movie. Rather than trusting themselves to actually see and evaluate each addition to the Coen canon, a devoted group of film nerds eagerly wait to observe what genre has been been fed though the Coen Bros movie-pooping-machine so they can be the first to declare it a masterpiece. The endless feedback loop of praise and regurgitation has pretty much stopped the Coens development.It's clear that it's turned into just a job. The Big Lebowski is the film one would make after coming to resent even the intellectual laziness that produced the previous half-dozen pictures; the lousy, pointless work that inevitably follows a bunch of easy raves.

"Most unique, most funny comedy I've seen","Possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen. Perfect character development and acting combined with an out-there but flawlessly-interwoven series of plots are the perfect combination for laughs. I can't get enough of this movie, and neither will you.This story follows three bowling buddies- Lebowski aka ""The Dude"" (Jeff Bridges), an aging burnout hippie with a carefree, laidback manner; Walter (John Goodman), a large Vietnam War veteran who approaches his daily life and philosophy as if he were still at war; and Donnie (Steve Buschemi), a dimwit follower placed mostly for comic relief. A case of mistaken identity gets the three caught up in the aftermath of a kidnapping, and watching their antics as they try to sort their way through the situation is as funny a thing as I've seen.I think the beauty in this movie is that there don't have to be any jokes or actual attempts to be funny to produce a laugh. The characters, just by being themselves, make the movie funny. Every scene where they're in the bowling alley talking to each other- there's no joke or attempt at humor, just a burnout, a dimwit, and a gun toter with post-traumatic stress disorder sitting there talking for five minutes, and I die laughing. Heck, there doesn't even have to be dialog! The scene where Lebowski is driving down the road smoking a roach- two minutes go by from start to end without an intelligible word of dialog, and I must have laughed 3 times. Or his reaction to being forced in the limo (""Watch out, there's a beverage here!""). He was being serious, and that by itself made it funny. Just by being themselves, the characters are funny and hence the movie is funny. Well, that and a few well-placed dream sequences!If you haven't seen this movie, drop what you're doing and run to the video store. You are in for a treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

For my money, this is the greatest comedy ever produced.This film not only provides non-stop laughter, but it teaches us an important lesson about life. We must adopt the Dude's carefree attitude. This movie teaches us that all you need in life are a few good friends and a recreational activity in which you enjoy greatly, in the Dude's case, bowling was what he enjoyed the most.

Much more than just a comedy - a genre-spanning masterwork.,"It's a rare thing when movies like this come along. It's the kind of picture where you'll either marvel at the highly woven plot and genre-hopping genius, or deplore it for being a completely random, stupid and unfathomable piece of crap.The Dude (Jeff Bridges) is an iconic, laconic slacker. Instantly likable, the Dude's own slant on life is that most things can be solved by taking it easy or going bowling. His partners in crime are Walter; a deranged 'Nam verteran (John Goodman in superb scene-stealing form), Donny, one of his bowling buddies (Steve Buscemi in an understated role) and David Huddleston as the title character, complete with assistant Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman, turning the smarm right up to ten). What starts as a simple case of mistaken identity and damaged property quickly becomes a roller-coaster tale of backstabbing and caricature characterisation which gets faster and more twisted as it reaches the final minutes.The first time I saw this I must say, it just seemed ludicrous and not at all humorous. I wasn't really sure whether it wanted to be a comedy or a surreal drama. After getting about two thirds of the way through I got up and walked out, convinced that this was the worst film in the Coen brothers canon. But on a second viewing I stopped taking this film too seriously and it was then the offbeat comedy and plot really came together.Ingenious, hilarious and unexpected you really don't have a clue what is going to happen, but the direction and cinematography make it seem like it was inevitable all along.

The Dude (as Lebowski calls himself and insists everyone else call him), is perpetually annoyed and irritated and at the world around him. In the opening scenes a couple of strong men break into his house and plunge his head in the toiled in order to obtain information from him that he has no way of possessing and his response is something like: ""Dude, what is your problem?"" Where a more natural reaction would by fury or terror. I think that sums him up pretty well. He doesn't care enough about all the stuff people normally care about, so his interactions with events and people are intriguing.And then he has the typical (perhaps even cliché, but you never get tired of that type of character) friend who will get you in the worst kind of trouble because of his utter lack of sense.Very funny.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The Dude just wants his rug back.,"From those that I've seen, every one of the Coen Brothers' movies has that peculiar charm; offbeat characters, an odd sense of humor, what-have-you. And then there's ""The Big Lebowski"", a different beast entirely. Get a load of this thing: it's a mystery yarn set against the backdrop of a bowling tournament, with more F-words than a whorehouse, a host of whacked-out characters and the protagonists are a stoner and his crazy Vietnam veteran buddy. It's also one of the most quotable movies ever produced. The magic is in the dialogue.But it's one of my all-time favorite movies because of the two leads. John Goodman seems to exist solely to keep Jeff Bridges in a state of perpetual exasperation, and their bickering never fails to send me into a fit of giggles.Also, if I can get Sam Elliott to narrate my life story, I'd call that a big bucket of win.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Classic Coen Brothers.,"After being beaten by thugs who mistake him with somebody of the same name, Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) confronts millionaire Jeff Lebowski on the mistaken identity, a confrontation that will lead to several bizarre and unforeseeable twists for him and his two bowling buddies, (John Goodman, Steve Buschemi).I'll be the first to say I do not see what all the buzz is about with this film. For some reason hipsters like to blow this up to be an absolute masterpiece, which is endlessly praised, quoted, and cos played. I like it a lot, but to me it doesn't stand out nearly as well as some of Coen's others, even though I still enjoy it. To me, it's a clever, fun, stoner comedy with a great cast and characters, but that's where it stops for me honestly.The characters are very colorful, Jeff Bridges is perfectly cast as the Dude, an icon that is mercilessly cos played, and he is funny in the movie. John Goodman as former Vietnam lieutenant Walter Sobchak is a great backup for The Dude as he mostly plays the muscle for all the predicaments they get involved in. Steve Buschemi's character was good overall, even though he doesn't get much screen time. What's great is that even the small roles in the film who get one or two scenes, still make an big impact on the film in the few scenes they're in. I can't very well make a Big Lebowski review without mentioning Jesus, the bowler for an enemy team of the Dude's bowler team, excellently cast by John Turturro, one of my favorite Coen alumni. Others like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore are also quite entertaining for the few scenes they are in.When I first watched it, I thought the plot was very bloated, lots of scenes and subplots that really go nowhere. Even though it adds to some funny scenes, overall it doesn't amount to much, but oh well. Regardless of my small complaints with this movie, it's a very fun, well made film with some entertaining characters, with some slight editing issues. Solid nonetheless",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Why didn't he just wash the rug?,"This story circulates around a bum like perpetual hippie apparently living on some kind of assets as the story makes a point of him being out of work. He's a lazy, viscously phlegmatic and self centered persona.Some ""hired help"" enters his home and almost flushes his head down the WC. The reason for this is not clear but obviously they mistook him for a different guy with the same name, The 'Big' Lebowski, who's enormously well off and sits in a wheel-chair. Some kind of revenge or threat. Anyhow, they pee on the hippie namesake's oriental rug. And thus the story starts rolling.Now, if you know anything about rugs you'd know that you can actually wash off pee. It's done regularly in Iran where almost every home is furnished up the walls in hand manufactured rugs and carpets, and where young kids might pee, or worse, on them.This picture, on the other hand, is not washable. After seeing it a dozen of times, I still don't get what it's all about.The story is too blurry and unintelligible to summarize.It's entertaining, though, and the soundtrack is great.I get the feeling that the Coen Bros really wanted to impress Tarantino, as TBL could well have been a comic book story, just like Pulp Fiction.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Your revolution is over Mr. Lebowski!,"I've lost count of how many times I've seen this film and each time it seems to get better and better. Yet, the first time I saw this film I didn't think it was a great movie since I didn't realize the true greatness of it (in fact, I think no one did). This is because the movie is not about the plot or about the message. This movie is great because of its characters, dialogue and aesthetics, things that are most appreciated with successive viewings. It's the little details that will make this your favourite comedy of all time.Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi are outstanding as the three bowling buddies and excellently supported by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore. In fact I think most would agree that Jeff Bridges and especially John Goodman gave award-winning performances. The dialogue is truly amazing. I mean how many movies are bestowed with so many memorable lines as this one? It is also truly unique. For a good-hearted and laid-back sort of film, to contain that many and different subtle references to cultural idiosyncrasies really says something. Finally, and I think this is what gives the movie defining cult status, it's the aesthetics. You can tell the effort made by directors and actors alike in carefully constructing each character. Each character has been embedded with a particular style and ethos which explain their way of going about things. Each character is both cause and effect of different generational prototypes mingling with each other in that psychedelic fauna that is The Big Lebowski.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

One of the greatest ever and the dude abides 9/10,"""The Big Lebowski"" is considered to be among the best movies ever made. The Coen brothers have wrote and directed a wonderful epic movie that has a huge fan base till this day. Centered around a figure called ""the dude"" who finds himself in an unlikely weird adventure consisting of neo nazis, thugs, a big scam, dirty undies and bowling. Jeffrey Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is the dude and the perfect example of an unemployed bachelor middle aged guy who's life style is mostly cannabis and bowling. Jeff Bridges gives what is probably his best performance in a movie ever, and it is known for being his most iconic role ever. John Goodman also gives a wonderful and amazing performance as Walter Sobchak and is mostly hilarious in the film. Gets all the good lines. The film stars other great and well actors: Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, John Turturro, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Sam Elliott. What I love mostly about the film is it's empty plot. Of course there is a lot going on but there are so many bizarre things happening that it doesn't matter anymore what the film's about, nor what are the films motives. In one opening scene you get an introduction to the character and how two thugs ruin his rug. In another scene the dude's car is stolen. Afterwards the characters go investigate a teenager and end up ruining somebody else's car. The point is that the plot is not important, the movie draws most of its magic from the characters and their interactions. Which to me is an important key role in movies to have characters who are fun and have many things happening to them. At the end of the day this is probably one of the best movies ever made and the dude abides on that. Now let's go bowling.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Big Budget Iconic Slacker Comedy,"It's a cult classic which I do not recall watching. At least in anything remotely approaching any snippets in excess of, say, five minutes. Now, I like a ""wicked good"" comedy along the lines the Farrelley Brothers make. That would not usually be a Coen brothers flick. Perhaps that why at this late date I've only now watched The Big Lebowski. It's the closest the Coen's may ever delve into a bit of Farrelley's territory. Is that good enough?It starts out as ""The Stranger"" , who narrates mostly, introduces us to ""The Dude"". Now, ""The Stranger"" is obviously Sam Elliott he of such singular voice that when he tells you what's for dinner all vegetarians realize they've been idiots. But I digress. ""The Dude"", Jeff Lebowski is an ""ultimate slacker"". He's a walking theorem of energy conservation comfortable in his own skin...and bathrobe. It goes with scant explaining that he has no need for those things that you'd find in a Louis Vuitton boutique. He's uncomplicated his life down to his house shoes. Suddenly that is rudely interrupted by the inconvenient fact his real name, Jeffrey Lebowski, is scarred by a very wealthy man complete with empty vessel family members who have screwed others as these types do. These ""screwed others"" want theirs and in an act of identity crisis confuse ""The Dude"" with the wealthy Lebowski. A violation based on this mistaken identity ensues upsetting ""The Dude's"" uncomplicated existence. As such the rich Lebowski owes the poor Lebowski, at a minimum, a new rug (see movie for rug facts). And now for the celluloid version of a left turn at Albuquerque. It's quite a visual nutty ride.

One of the Great Cult Classics,"The Big Lebowski is perhaps the most surreal film from the Coen brothers, who have made their careers on surreal, dark comedies. There are numerous diversions, but the main plot is a take on ransom films. The film would have been a massive failure if not for some key performances. Jeff Bridges is The Dude, a.k.a. Jeff Lebowski, who is mistaken for a millionaire of the same name whose wife owes money to a pornographer. The Dude is an unemployed layabout who bowls with his two friends Walter and Donny. Walter is played by John Goodman, who portrays the character as a short-tempered Vietnam vet who uses his military service to justify his behavior. He constantly yells at Donny (Steve Buscemi) for no real reason, and waves guns at minor bowling infractions. The Dude finds himself caught up in the Big Lebowski's ransom as the millionaire hires him to give the ransom to the kidnappers. The millionaire's aide is Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who plays a sycophantic named Brandt. Hoffman is the third most enjoyable character in the film, with his forced laugh and yes-man lines.The simple ransom goes horribly wrong and the plot gets ever more complex as more characters are added. This one of a few comedies that warrants multiple viewings just to understand it. There are enough quotable lines to be entertaining upon first watch but you have to see it again to discern the genius of the plot turns.The dream sequences take away from the film as they are too long and don't really move the movie forward or even introduce a side-plot. Still, the film is one of the best Coen films (not as great as Fargo, but what is?) and it remains a cult classic and one of the best comedies ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Funniest Movie Ever,"The Big Lebowski just might be the funniest movie I have ever seen. I think i have seen it at least ten times and it never gets old to me. I also love all of the characters in this movie. you have the Veitnam Vet, The Suirely annoying guy, and ""The Dude"". Jeff Bridges is the perfect actor for this role. This movie is guaranteed to make you laugh every single time you watch it. The Coen Brothers did a fine job on making the characters in this movie really come to life. The Story is good( and crazy). The Dialogue is hilarious. The soundtrack awesome, all the characters are amazing. The Coen brothers truly executed another masterpiece. I recommend renting this movie, buying this movie, or getting your hands on it because you will not stop laughing and you will love it. I hope that my comment on this movie will convince you to go and watch this hilarious movie",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I had expected more from the Coen brothers...,"Two of my favorite movies are Raising Arizona and The Hudsucker Proxy, and Fargo was pretty good too. I expected a lot from this movie but was somewhat disapointed. The plot was harder to follow than their other movies, and after seeing it twice it still seems kinda stupid. There were too many groups working against and with each other to really pull the end together smoothly. I think there was a lot of great acting, but it didn't really help the movie. But I think they are coming out with a new movie soon, so maybe it will turn out better...",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A comedy classic,"The Dude's rug gets destroyed after he gets mistaken for his millionaire namesake. This triggers him to start a quest to receive compensation and replace it. That's when we dive head first in an absurd, surreal world. There are endless twists and turns and the movie jumps from one weird place to another. In a couple of instances we even get to see The Dude's hallucinations and that's some next level stuff.This absolute insanity and how the main characters deal with that mess make The Big Lebowski such a legendary comedy.The Dude is larger than life, Coen's most iconic character. His daily routine includes goofing around, smoking weed and playing bowling. His attitude is inspiring and, besides all the jokes, provides food for thought. And he is in good company. Walter is always angry and ready to fight, as he suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a Vietnam veteran. Donny is a dumb but kind and innocent guy who gets the short end of the stick.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Wickedly funny for those with open minds,"Empirically, The academy have never been keen on giving their statues to comedy films. They've also been very harsh on Jeff over the years.How did Jeff not get an Oscar for his seminal role as the ultimate loser who is proud to be a loser.His timing is perfect. And comedy is as much about timing as anything else.This film has me laughing out loud time after time. I never get bored of it.I put this film in the same class as the finest Cary grant comedies and to be placed alongside the greatest comedian of all time is testament to Jeff's style, class and delivery.Closed minded people won't get this film.That's their loss and their right.The supporting cast never get in the dudes way.

Not watchable,"Sometimes the film is so good you have to say something. Sometimes the film is so bad you have to say something. Unfortunately it is the latter in this case.I finally started to watch The Big Lebowski. Great reviews everywhere. Have to watch it. It is one of Coen brothers movies. It is rated almost five stars in Amazon. It is rated 8.2 on IMDb. It has to be good, right?Not quite. I couldn't finish it - I had to stop watching it.In the beginning you see a resemblance in the style of this movie and a lot of Quentin Tarantino's movies. I don't know if Coen brothers are borrowing from Quentin Tarantino, or if it's the other way around, but there seems to be plenty of resemblance to this film and Tarantino's films in general.The best Coen brothers movie that they made was Fargo, and maybe it was so good because it was based on a true story. But for this, The Big Lebowski, it reeked of stupidity...but without comedy. It seemed to border on fantasy and improbability.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"A surefire comedy, this film is pure genius","The Big Lebowski is a brilliant comedy, but it also has a very unique plot. If you liked Fargo, you might also like this because it involves a simple plot, but involves several incidents that add to the story and make it funnier as it goes.There are several unique characters like the artist played by Julianne Moore, the Hispanic bowler named Jesus played by John Turturro, and one of my favorite characters is the boisterous bowler named Walter, who is played by John Goodman. The story is centered around a lowlife bowler named Jeff Lebowski, or 'the dude' as everyone calls him. One day his house is broken into and his beloved carpet is soiled, all because he was mistaken for a multimillionaire with the same last name as him. He tries to get help from the Big Lebowski, but doesn't get anything, until the big Lebowki needs help and the Dude and his bowling buddies decide to assist him. The result is an entertaining and wickedly hilarious trip to regaining the dude's prized possession.The plot is simple at first, until it gets more complex. The film requires more viewings to appreciate everything, but there is still plenty to like the first time you see it, such as the humor, the camera angle shown through the finger hole of a bowling ball, and the clever dream sequences. See this film once to be entertained, but see it several other times to realize the genius that was involved in it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"If nothing else, extremely entertaining.","Stars: Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, David Huddleston, Julianne Moore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Peter Stormare, Flea, Torsten Voges, John Turturro, Sam Elliot, Tara Reid, Jack Kehler.Many obviously consider this to be a classic. I don't consider it one, but I still found it very entertaining and was not disappointed. Our basic plot is stoner and loser Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski is mistaken for millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski, when men break in to his house and pee on his rug. To get the money for the rug The Dude goes to Jeffrey Lebowski, and ends up on a mission to find rich Lebowski's kidnapped wife. The movie is fairly fast paced, but that doesn't stop it from having periods of heavy clever dialogue, mostly between John Goodman as the ex-Vietnam veteran Walter and the Dude. Many of the film's most entertaining scenes are located in the bowling alley where The Dude, Walter and Donnie (Buscemi) talk about nothing and (of course) bowl. The backup cast is really good also, including Julianne Moore as the ""kidnapped"" wife and John Turturro as a sex offender bowler. Though I don't consider this to be a great classic film, it's still a good, fun movie with enough gusto to keep the whole thing afloat.My rating: *** out of ****. 113 mins.

Absolute cult classic,"The Dude. Although he is associated with almost only negative qualities, you can not help but love him. Compared to the other characters in the film he actually seems quite normal. The contrast between the calm, laid-back nature of the Dude and the extroverted or aggrassive nature of other characters is what makes the film so entertaining. This becomes especially clear in the legendary interactions and dialogues between him and his bowling collegue Walter. Every single scene of the film is crazy, funny and definitely unique. The scenes have a great recognition value, which means that the film is still extremely fun to watch even after several times. The film ist a cult classic and rightly so.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Stylish and exceptionally funny,"The Coen brothers make the kind of movies that i think you either love or hate. Their very special brand of humor and their weird characters make them an experience out of the ordinary.Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is called ""The Dude"" by his friends. He's an aging hippie living the comfortable life mostly just bowling. However one day he is mistaken for the infinitely more ambitious Jeffrey Lebowski, an industrialist of considerable wealth. The mix-up leads to a set of events among including among other things German nihilists and kidnappings.You have never seen Jeff Bridges like this before! I don't know what it is that the Coen brothers have, but they always seem to bring out the strangest things in the actors they use. Just look at John Goodman, as soon as he works with the Coens he shines like never before. Anyway, the very strange comedy that this movie presents is something that defies explanation. But i can say that i found it amazingly funny, well written and well played. And it's also a beautiful movie with high quality photography as well as cinematography.This is probably the funniest movie that the Coen brothers have ever made, in competition with ""Arizona Junior"". A hysterical mix between weird characters, weird comedy and great film-making. A must-see. I rate it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Hilarious and Pointless Masterpiece,"Hilarious, iconic, and by all means entertaining- The Big Lebowski may seem inherently pointless, but its a film that will never be forgotten. The film is ridiculously enjoyable, with great performances all around, especially from Jeff Bridges as 'The Dude' and John Goodman as Walter. The plot is messy, but adequate, and provides a very interesting line to follow- even if it isn't perfect. The direction is masterful, the Coen brothers do a fantastic job as always, and the cinematography is terrific as well. Very few films use its soundtrack as usefully as this one does, and I was very glad to hear such a great sound and thus resulting from it- a great atmosphere- from the film and was pleasantly surprised of its inclusion in the film. In the end, The Big Lebowski is a perfectly imperfect masterwork that will remain timeless and endlessly hilarious throughout the rest of its days.

One of the funniest films I've ever watched.,"Well, the film is simply quite brilliant. A very clever story with some very clever twists...some of the most quotable lines to exist in a film...some of the greatest actors...Steve Buscemi, for example, creates an astonishingly likeable and believable character with so very few lines in comparison to either Goodman as Walter or Bridges as 'The Dude'. The dialogue is quick and witty, as one might expect from any Coen Brothers movie and, arguably, every line in the film is immensely funny, due to the excellent writing and the excellent delivery by each of the actors. If you haven't see this film, you're in for a treat. And if you have seen this film, I expect you've seen it more than once. I really can't see any reason to dislike this film and would deem it one of the greatest filming achievements of our age. So, do see it. It's bloody good.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Just my opinion,"This film's strength is the waste fellow Dude/Jeffrey Lebowski who seemed to have captured a sizeable subpopulation and inspired a new religion ""Dudeism"".

Designed to start a cult,"First time I've watched it, I think I've fallen asleep. I've seen it several times, but in parts. Which is also rather funny, considering there is no story in this film, only a confused plot. And there are so much great scenes in this. It's hard to count them all. I just saw it altogether, and it's a must. Many of the actors have been seen in previous Coen brothers films (Goodman, Buscemi, Turturro, Polito, Stormare). They must have did something with their food, because they are stunning in this one. Especially Goodman, except for the fact that he's a using a four-letter word a lot.

See it Again,"The Big Lebowski is without question, my favorite movie.I would urge the masses of people here who seemed to ""get bored before it was half over"" to watch it again. Watch it again, and finish it this time. Remember a few things:1) Funny movies are not always written for 12 year olds 2) Some of them don't have any of the Wayans brothers, or Adam Sandler in them!I'm not trying to be harsh on these actors - I'm trying to point out that this movie is more than slapstick. It's NOT hysterically funny that the Dude carries a drink with him, and sometimes spills it. It's not hilarious to have someone pee on the Dude's rug. It's not funny when Walter explains how easy it is to obtain a toe, WITH green nail polish on it (ok, that was pretty funny).What IS funny is how all of this fits together. The world's biggest stoner solving a fairly complex mystery. The interaction of 3 long-time friends, who don't really get along all the time. The crazy plot twists that we can barely follow, much less having the Dude follow them after endless joints and white Russians.As the Coens said in the extended DVD - This is a buddy movie above all. The story of 3 friends of differing qualities, with VERY different outlooks on life.Watch this movie again if you didn't get it the first time. Then again if you STILL don't get it. And if you still don't get it after 3 watches - try the Farrelly Brothers -- the Coen Brothers probably aren't your style!10/10, without question.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Hilarious,"The Big Lebowski is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. Yet at the same time I love the movie because of its intelligent use of comedy in a situation that deserves alot.

I watched the film in complete silence only to laugh my ass off 2 hours later when thinking of the ""Fix their cable?"" line. In the end the movie has no point and ends with nothing happening. It is a series of events that accumulate into ZERO. In the end I was dumbfounded that I had wasted 2 hours of my life on this movie, only to reflect back on the time as well wasted. I know that this review completely contradicts its self, but so does the movie described in to. I would reccomend watching this movie with others to laugh about the jokes in the near future.

An offbeat and funny comedy drama. That's twisted and interesting a cult film that stands on it's own.,"After all these years I finally watched this acclaimed classic from the Coen brothers and I must say ""The Big Lebowski"" is a very unique film that holds interest and stands on it's own. The plot is interesting that takes twist and turns making you as the viewer think and that's really what a movie should do as you know that method is a staple of the Coen Brothers yet this film is blended with laughs to make it more enjoyable. Set in L.A. it focuses on the life of a laid back and down to earth common slacker Jeff Lebowski(Jeff Bridges)who's only enjoyment is smoking pot, drinking beer and hanging out with his friends and bowling. The two friends are a crazed Vietnam war veteran(John Goodman) and a lonely loser(Steve Buscemi). All of sudden this trio of bowling buddies will find themselves on an unexpected journey of facing crazy characters and being involved in an apparent kidnapping case that's tied to mistaken identity.So clearly this is a wild goose chase type of film that's unique as some of the scenes are strikingly visual and it's plot keeps you thinking also look for good supporting turns from Juilanne Moore and Phillp Seymour Hoffman. This is a film that will appeal mostly to the hippie culture and older people still it has plenty of laughs and it's creative enough to last in memory as a unique cult art cinema classic. So remember Dude ""The Big Lebowski"" is an offbeat film that strikes a unique score any film watcher will find it's plot very creative that's blended well with laughs! And the acting was in fine form as the chemistry of the characters made the film work so clearly this is an underrated classic to remember.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Watch it a few times before you judge it,"Like many other lovers of The Big Lebowski, I was baffled by this movie and didn't really care for it all that much after the first viewing, and didn't realize what a fantastic piece of work it was until I watched it again late one night on USA network while rocking a new born baby to sleep. Despite the edits and commercial interruptions, everything fell into place for me and I rented it again and watched it over and over, each time finding something new and wonderfully funny. I now own it on DVD and watch it at least once a month. And it just gets funnier each time.First of all, I'm surprised that I have never seen anyone notice that this movie is the Coens fractured version of a modern day Western. The tumblin tumbleweed, the cowboy music, and Sam Elliot's narrative at the beginning should have been a huge tip off. In addition, the structure of this movie broadly mirrors that of John Ford's classic horse opera ""The Searchers,"" though many of the elements are inverted. Most Westerns have a hero who is an outsider who only wants what is rightfully his (in The Big Lebowski, the Dude is a social misfit who just wants his rug back). Like the girl who was kidnapped by Native Americans in ""The Searchers,"" this movie has a girl who has been purportedly abducted by a group foreign to the settled community (German Nihilists). And like every western movie, there is a violent showdown at the end, though most westerns don't have a showdown anywhere near as funny (""Dipsh** with a Nine-toed Woman!...Anti-Semite"").But its not the amateur film school analysis that makes this movie great, its the acting, the characters, the dialogue, and the many twists and turns that are tied up at the end.The dialogue is richly funny, though you have to watch the movie several times to catch everything said, since the characters are constantly interrupting one another and trying to talk over each other. I think this is one reason that people who have only seen this movie once didn't like it. The humor in what the Dude, Donny, and Walter are saying to each other is killer, and its even funnier when you realize that none of them are really listening to each other.For those who haven't seen the movie yet, you might want to remember this. If you see it and don't think the movie makes any sense, remember that many people who love this movie didn't ""get it"" either the first time around.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Memorable unique comedy,"""The Big Lebowski"" has many scenes and lines that will stay with you. It has good cinematography and interesting characters, so it is fresh. I especially like the characters portrayed by Goodman and Bridges and their friendship. This movie is a reminder to me that for the many people out there without close family, your friends become your family. And these sorts of people, who you'll meet at the bar or bowling alley may have their own issues, such as Walter, but they are friends nonetheless, and even if you don't have a lot of assets, you can still have friends.So, for me, this film in a way celebrates the poor, the humble, those who are overlooked or called losers. Even though things don't exactly work out for the Dude and Walter, and I hated to see Donnie die, but life goes on for them just as it had before the story. They keep muddling thru no matter what.The negatives for me which hold this film back from a higher rating are the excessive cursing, vulgarity, and extended dream sequences. For these reasons, I give it a 7.0/10.0.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the Coen's most inspired comedies,"One of the Coen's most inspired films, this one draws on at least 3 different genres as it weaves its amusing tale of a confused attempt at blackmail that gets mucked up by the unintentional involvement of loser ex-activist Jeffrey Lebowski (Bridges, at his best).Bridges, Goodman, and Buscemi make a congenial trio, seeming at home in the bowling league they seem to live for, and Turturro makes a surprising and memorable appearance as ""The Jesus"".  The dream sequences, a Coen staple, were never more fitting or more funny, particularly when Lebowski goes from his flight over L.A. to a Busby Berkeley-esque production line full of Viking women led by Moore's dominating heiress.Even to its last bittersweet moments, this is a memorable dark comedy that brings all the Coen's best elements to the fore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Does not age well AT ALL!,"I saw this movie when it first came out and thought it was hip, funny, original, quirky and cool, as did so many of the gushing reviewers who have commented already. The problem for me is that this movie is NOT classic material, because it does not age well. In fact, I could not watch more than ten minutes of it on the second attempted viewing. Perhaps the problem was the fact that I lost count of the number of F-bombs in the first few minutes. When the opening dialog would be incomprehensible if all the obscenities were bleeped, you know you have a problem. When the slutty wife of the rich Lebowski (as opposed to Jeff Bridges' character) offers a ""bl*w job"" for $1000, it's no longer funny to me - it just makes me squirm.

Enormous fun,"Full of characters and wonderful, quotable moments. Great, memorable scenes. John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, and Jeff Bridges are outstanding.

This is one of those rare movies that actually lives up to the hype.Definitely a movie that deserve multiple viewings. Even has bowling.

The Occasional Acid Flashback,"The thing about movies made by the Coen Brothers is that I either love them (Fargo) or they leave me flat (The Big Lebowski). There is a thin line between comic and tragic, and here the lead characters never find it. As played by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, two dumber Polacks have never graced the silver screen. Yet, there is nothing Polish or Polish-American about these losers---""The Dude"" Lebowski and Walter Sobchak-except their names, and ""Sobchak"" is a very un-Polish spelling. There are a couple of assumptions that you have to make to laugh at the jokes in this 1998 film. One is that Polish surnames are innately funny and you should laugh when you hear one, especially when it is associated with intelligent thought or combined with an American given name (""Bunny Lebowski""). The only time you hear the word ""Polish"" in the movie is when The Dude explains to Sobchak that he is ""not even Jewish"": ""You're f---ing Polish-Catholic."" So why see this film? Because it raises a lot of questions, such as: What's so funny about stupidity? Why does John Goodman seem to be doing an imitation of Roseanne Barr? Would this have worked better as a cartoon? Why is ""Lebowski"" considered a ""jerk-off name""? Another reason is to watch Julianne Moore deliver another bizarre but intriguing performance. As Maude Lebowski, she leads The Dude, a burned-out hippie, into the only one of his lines that made me laugh out loud by asking him post-coitally what he does for recreation. As if it's the first time he's ever been asked, he thinks for a second, then replies, ""Go bowling, drive around, and the occasional acid flashback.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Reviewing it oddly,"I'm writing this review after scanning the negative reviews, here; those with ratings of ""1"".And... you can see where those reviewers are coming from. More precisely, they range from folks who obviously don't expect much from flicks, to more discerning types who nonetheless weren't able to discern something redeemable in TBL.So... I guess I got my work cut out for me. What redeems the act of watching TBL?To me, it's about a time. It captures a time and collective head-space. And it does that so very, very well that the flick deserves to be put in a time capsule so future generation will understand that prior head-space better.But... even better than that is how it seems to hint that the head-space has a univerality to it.

And perhaps that's the final beauty of the flick; what we expect from any/all narrative arts: On one hand, the characters are rooted in their milieu, but on the other, they reflect something universal.And...

Over time, reviews have become largely positive, and the film has become a cult favorite,noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".

This movie is amazing...truly a masterpiece.,"Detailed in every scene, rich characterization, diverse soundtrack, witty real life dialogue. This movie is God. I feel that it takes a lot from a movie to make me leave with a sense of satiation, but this movie does it for me. Wonderfully written and directed by the Coen brothers, it is yet another masterpiece from them. Another thing is, that this movie never tries to be funny. It doesn't have random quirky characters or punch lines, it all comes from the scenes, very naturally. 10 out of 10.

Flashes of brilliance interrupted by something or other,"All I have to add to the Big Lebowski discussion is my disappointment with it as a seasoned watcher of Coen flicks.  I appreciate the effort to do something completely ""out there,"" but there were two points when I expected an explosion of Coen cinema, and they never happened.When the Dude discovers he is being followed (by Jon Polito from Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink, no less)), I expected a classic Coen sequence -- a car chase of some sort, but not just a car chase, if you know the Coens.The other glaring omission was the bowling match at the end.  As they displayed in the dream sequence -- which was an MTVish disappointment, but still stylish -- the Coens can photograph anything and make it interesting. We sat through enough rambling -- we deserved that bowling match.  Is it possible some studio editor decided it wasn't necessary?Jeff Bridges is brilliant as the Dude.  It is not an exaggeration to say that he deserved as Oscar nomination.Bridges's performance is so realistic and convincing that John Goodman, who's normally great, comes across as gimmicky and schticky.  And I didn't think it was possible to waste Steve Buscemi -- because he's great even when he just stands around -- but he is wasted here.Rent Miller's Crossing instead.  The Big Lebowski is for Coen fans only, so that they can appreciate the quality of the other Coen films.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Coen Brothers out of control,"The Big Lebowski is a comedy film directed by Jeff Bridges, starring Jeff Bridges as an L. A. loafer named ""The Dude"" and John Goodman and Steve Buscemi as his sidekicks. The film is set in Los Angeles and follows the Dude, who spends his days in his small abode, knocking back White Russians and getting ready for his next bowling-league tournament. When two brigands break into his dump, mistaken for Lebowski, and take a warning piss on one of his rugs, the Dude is befuddled and upset. Inspired by this incident, he seeks out Lebowski, a wheelchair-bound, bitter rich man, to get restitution for his rug. Lebowski, who is wheelchair-bound, has little patience for the Dude, but coincidentally, his trophy wife has disappeared and he receives a ransom note for his wife's disappearance. The Dude is enlisted to make the drop, with 20 grand in it for him. The Dude, a bowling buddy, struggles with his lack of ambition, leading to mishaps and a series of berserkos. The film features a diverse cast, including Bridges, Buscemi, and Reid, all tackling various forms of human screwups. Bridges' tenacious demeanor as the Vietnam veteran is explosive and funny, while Buscemi's befuddlement as the third Stooge adds a fitting Larry-like befuddlement. Tara Reid's performance as the trophy wife is also impressive. The film's screwy textures, from Carter Burwell's music to costume designer Mary Zophres' wiggy duds, make it a richly rancid enjoyment. The raucously rattletrap musical selections add a pungent quality to the delirium, and musical supervisor T-Bone Burnett is praised for the screwy selections in this big laugher. ""The Big Lebowski"" is a film about Jeff Lebowski's equanimity amidst vicissitudes, including kidnapping, ransom money, pornography, a millionaire, a runaway girl, and the Vietnam veterans and Flower Power disagreement. The film is narrated by The Stranger, who observes that the Dude Abides and hears there is a little Lebowski on the way. The Dude is denied matrimony and seems to have no women in his life, except by lucky chance. The film explores themes of equanimity, societal norms, and the importance of a roof over his head, fresh half-and-half for his White Russians, a little weed, and bowling buddies. The film highlights the importance of a man's attitude and the value of a roof over his head, despite the challenges he faces.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I mean, I don't really mind unlikable characters, but when I start wishing them to just die so the movie can end faster, then I know something is very wrong. Or maybe that's what the directors were going for and if that's the case, I can just say congrats, because the totally hit the right mark...

It is a believable part and most importantly hilarious. He does it all, the laziness, the swearing, the acid trips. Steve Buscemi, also from Fargo, is great as Donny. His dialog, though few and far between, complements the dialog of the Dude and Walter. Which brings us to Walter, as played by John Goodman. I'm not sure who swears more, Walter or the Dude, but I would put my money on Walter. The point it is Walter who fulfills every stereotype you've heard about this movie. The rudeness, the nonsense, the lack of coherence, etc. Of course there are numerous supporting parts as well, the Big Lebowski, Jesus, etc. that only add to the film.

THE best comedy I've seen in my life,"AWESOME. Seriously, this was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I have no idea what it's about, but I liked it. I kind of detected a 'circle of life' thing...in the world of L.A. slackers, everything works out, man, don't worry. Donnie dies, little Lebowski is born. Thus it continues. But you don't watch this for the message. It's got an excuse for a plot, at least: Big Lebowski's wife owes money to crooks and is kidnapped. 'The Dude' Lebowski is mistaken for the millionaire by the same name and his carpet is pi$$ed upon in a misunderstanding. Seeking compensation for the rug (which really tied the room together) he ends up commissioned to deal with the crooks. Introduce a trio of Nihilists (with marmot), a half-crazed feminist painter (Julianne Moore), a porno film industry and a gay pedophile who's extremely competitive about bowling (John Turturro) and you've got it...the ultimate stoned slacker comedy. Jeff Bridges is far out as The Dude, and hilariously understated, while John Goodman is his psychotically violent 'Nam vet best friend, who carries a piece to a bowling alley, and John Turturro is forever etched into my memory as Jesus Quintana (spoken to Walter: ""You got a date for Wednesday, baby! Whoo!"" Walter: ""...He's cracking."") Steve Buscemi was adorably pathetic as Donnie, the third wheel. One of the best quotes: Donnie: Are these the Nazis, Walter? Walter: No, Donnie, these men are Nihilists. There's nothing to be afraid of. It was very memorable, with excellent characters which is basically all that made it worth watching...the Coen's signature style doesn't come through here like it does in Fargo, and it's not overly artistic (well...in parts maybe) but it's so funny! Excellent, excellent. Especially The Dude's stoned dreams (which feature Saddam Hussein renting out bowling shoes).",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Competent Narration!,"Even with my extremely circumscribed exposure to the Coen Brothers' works (it is only my second film after 'No Country for Old Men), I can vouch with definitive certainty that they are ingenious narrators and they know their craft well.Their tales may inherit banalities, but the storytelling does not get affected by those mere demarcations.Instead, their stories move ahead at a swift pace and establish characters and their surroundings with so much intricacy and conviction.As a result, we, as audience feel an instant connection, and that further develops our interest.""The Big Lebowski"" is no exception; the premise may come off as rudimentary, but the presentation keeps the viewers thoroughly invested.Furthermore, kudos to both John Goodman and Jeff Bridges as their hilarious acts made sure our attention was kept in check.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Instant classic.,"There are several things that can make a great comedy. You could, for instance, have some effectively planned and executed comical moments, a cleverly funny written script or some amusing characters that can make your movie. ""The Big Lebowski"" is however a movie that has this all in it.When watching a Coen brothers movies you always know that you are going to get something special and unique. Their comedy style and just overall way off film-making are very distinctive, which is not in the least also due to the fact hat besides directing and producing all of their movies, they also write and edit them themselves. So all of their movies are really being their movies, with some exaggerated characters, dark comedy and violence and lots of eye for detail with its filming, as well as with its writing.Thing that catches immediately the attention about this movie is how incredibly well written and layered the movie is. Just when you think that they can't possible throw in another story-line, with different new characters, they do and it also manages to work out well for the movie, which is all the more a great accomplishment. There is really a lot going on in this movie, even though its main character itself is extremely laid back and manages to get himself into trouble by basically doing nothing at all.Yes, the Dude makes this movie what it is and also makes it work out as well as it does. It's a great character, who basically seems like a left over product from the '70's and has made no attempt to adapt himself to the 'new' world or just normal society in general. He simply does his thing, which is bowling, driving around and having the occasional acid flashback. It's good that there are guys like him being around, who go against the flow and simply follow their own path. Not to be a rebel but just to simply do only the things he wants to and simply life his live without worrying about tomorrow or yesterday. Yes, Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski has grown into an iconic character already, which of course is also thanks to Jeff Bridges performances of him.But the whole movie is being filled with some real great and memorable comedy characters. All of them are quite over-the-top, which suits the world the Coen brothers create with their movie. It really has a dream cast and what is it with John Goodman and the Coen brothers, who always seem to bring out the best from Goodman. John Goodman always seems at home within a Coen brothers movie, no matter what type of role he ever plays.The movie does not only handle its comedy extremely well, it's also simply technically a very well made movie. The directing is truly great and it uses all kinds of different techniques and tricks, which help to give the movie a very special, warm and amusing type of atmosphere.But yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, my opinion, man.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Coens come through again,"The Big Lebowski is one of the funniest films I have seen in a long time. How the Coens manage to put every sort of character, plot twists, unordered sequences and musical interludes into a film and still make it work is magical to me.Jeff Bridges plays ""the Dude"" perfectly in this film opposite John Goodman as his buddy Walter. The duo are absolutely hilarious together and seem to play flawlessly off of each other throughout the film. Steve Buscemi plays a short but funny role as the spaced out friend of the Dude and John Turturro may have well stole the show playing the over-indulgent exposer/bowler Jesus.This film contains some of the most hilarious and wacky scenes that I have seen in a long time. These include: the scene in which thugs bust into the Dude's lair and dunk his head in his toilet and then proceed to urinate all over his rug, the scene in which the Dude writes a check for 69 cents, the scene in which the Germans bust into the Dude's lair and put a Marmot into the tub with him while he is having a bath and the fight scene between the Germans and the Dude, Walter and Buscemi's character.This film worked for me in every aspect except for the lack of a plot to guide the film and the overlong ending.

"Strange, Funny and Stronge Performances,","The Big Lebowski is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. With it's very goofy set up and even its characters, you wouldn't expect very big performances from the cast, but they all deliver superb acting, they were all taking a huge risk with this very unusual film, and they ended up making a good choice. My favourite scenes are definitely any one between Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, the chemistry between the two of them is terrific, they both play very unique characters, nothing like any of their previous roles. It's definitely longer than it needs to be, it's nearly too hours long, and with the story being as ridiculous as it is, this can get a little bit tiring after a while, but it is mostly entertaining and hilarious throughout. Very different and packs in plenty of laughs, I would recommend the Big Lebowski to anyone looking for a good comedy.A man must cope with being mistaken from a millionaire who owes a lot of money, and receives the help of his bowling buddies to seek revenge.Best Performance: Jeff Bridges Worst Performance: Tara Reid",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Fun for the guys,"I am one of those who think the Coen Brothers have done better movies than THE BIG LEBOWSKI. But I will give it this: This satiric tale of mistaken identity, kidnap and death has a Raymond Chandler-esquire feel that should certainly appeal to male viewers. Jeff Bridges is Dude Lebowski, who ends up being mixed up with a millionaire with the same last name (David Huddleston) who owes money to some very bad men. The Dude's best buddy, Walter (John Goodman) helps The Dude in his quest to find the senior Lebowski's hormone-crazed child bride (Tara Reid), who has done a disappearing act and may or may not have been kidnapped. The film is bizarre, to say the least, with Busby Berkley-type fantasy sequences, Bridges as a '60s burnout with long, unkempt hair and Goodman as an individual with serious anger management issues. Bridges and Goodman make the film worth watching, although their constant use of expletives may turn off some. They are supported in their efforts by Steve Buscemi as their strange pal Donny and Julianne Moore as the even stranger Maude Lebowski. Sam Elliott serves as the film's narrator and shows up in a brief sequence. This is quite probably Goodman's finest film, by the way.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I don't think I'll ever get tired of this movie,"Since I got the Big Lebowski on VHS several months ago, it's been in my VCR almost constantly.  This rich, multi-layered comedy just seems to get better with each additional viewing--perhaps because no matter how hard you puzzle over the film, you'll never quite be able to understand everything about it at once.  I equate The Big Lebowski to 12 Monkeys in that regard--both films are wildly entertaining on the surface, slightly ominous underneath, and have moments of pure genius throughout.Each of the Coens' films seems to be their take on a certain part of the country, in particular criminal activity gone awry in each area--with numerous references to their favorite movies thrown in.  The Big Lebowski seems to take L.A. head-on and show us the city as something ""every bit as stupefying as in any of those other places"".  If Fargo and The Big Sleep are combined with modern L.A., The Big Lebowski would be the result.Jeff Bridges and John Goodman seem to be perfectly cast because their back-and-forth banter is hilarious.  I actually can't think of a character that I would have cast differently--every character is memorable and thoroughly entertaining in its own way.  The way they play off one another and affect the Dude's travels is just crazy. There is some really great writing in this film and the soundtrack is really great (especially the dream sequences).  If you only watch the movie once, you're probably missing a lot of things.I tend to like movies that break ""conventions"", and this is definitely one of those films.  The main characters aren't glamorous at all, the film's only sex scene is hilarious in contrast to the typical hollywood scene, and there isn't a coherent plot that can be outlined in a nice simple layout that everybody will understand.  Just like the main characters, the film seems to bumble around aimlessly--but all the bumbling somehow resonates with coherence by the time it's all over.You'll either love this movie or hate it.  If you're offended by drug use (even though the film hardly glamorizes the use of drugs--it shows what happens to the ""Dude"" after years of drug abuse... he's an unemployed former Roadie for Metallica...) or profanity (I think this movie probably set the record for the use of the F-word--but it's always sort of melded into the conversation and you hardly even notice it after a while) this may not be the film for you.

Join a Bowling League,"I had a professor in college that used to always tell us, ""the world needs more bowling leagues."" It was a strange thing to say, I thought, in an Intro to American Politics class. This professor gave us the example of when he was in graduate school he and his wife joined a bowling league in their town. He said that it was a great way to meet new people whom you may have never otherwise thought of spending time with. He said that our society needed to relearn those social skills. After every viewing of ""The Big Lebowski"" I think back to this professor's recommendation to join a bowling league.""The Big Lebowski"" was always one of those films that was recommended to me to be included on my list of movies that I should see before I die. While I had already seen a fair number of Coen Brothers films, I was still a little hesitant to watch this one. I finally gave it a chance one rainy afternoon. I have to admit, the first time I watched it I thought to myself, ""what did I just watch?"" I laughed a lot, yes, but I couldn't wrap my head around it. As with many films I watch, I let it simmer in my brain for a while.A few months later I gave the movie a second chance. This time, at the end of the movie, I realized that I had just seen a piece of art. Every subsequent viewing I find that I like it more and more. In my opinion, it is the best performance by Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi of their entire careers. While I don't usually describe it as my all-time favorite movie, I have recently been coming back to this movie when in conversations with friends about truly great movies. I tell people to have patience with it. Don't expect to be satisfied with the ending...right away, at least. ""The Big Lebowski"" has aged extremely well, too.

The Big Lebowski is One Big Laughbowski,"There are many things to love about movies; the smell of popcorn, the taste of butter, the John Goodman moments, and of course, the Big Lebowski. If you like to laugh at one deadbeat stoner who has a passion for oriental rugs, and forgets to comb his hair, you will love this movie. It is written by the Coen brothers, who have wrote about a thousand great movies. Unfortunately they are dead now, but this movie is still alive. MY favorite thing about this movie, the reason why it gets 9 stars, every single line is mildly funny. Of course, you cannot laugh out loud at every single line, but you will find yourself giggling inside every time John Goodman opens his mouth. God, so funny. Watch this movie sober or not...your choice! Either way, funny as hell. At one point the Dude is tripping on a illicit substance...oh my god, the cinematography is amazing!!!

One Fantastic Movie,"I love the Coen brothers.  I once thought to myself, how can they top Fargo?This movie does it.  All the performances are great, and allow you to get a real feeling for the characters, even if, in cases such as John Turturo's, they are only on screen for a few scenes.  The script is amazing in that it keeps you guessing, introducing surprises all the way through, not just one Kaiser Soze-esque twist, but dozens of them.  And the direction is ingenious.

"Jeff Bridges is ""The Big Lebowski""","This is a truly unique and unusual movie-even for the Coen Brothers. Jeff Bridges stars in a role that has become an iconic character. He is phenomenal in the role. He is natural and funny and honest and very memorable. The story is a convoluted story of mistaken identity, a stolen rug, a kidnapping, and a lot of bowling. While Bridges is amazing in this, it is the supporting cast that shine. John Goodman is exceptionally good. Steve Buscemi is so underplayed he is fantastic. Julianne Moore, John Tuturro, Tara Reid, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and the rest are ""all in"" in this one and every scene, every line has meaning.

Almost perfect from the Coen Brothers...,"I'll admit I am a big fan of this film; I've loved it since I first saw it on a grainy rental video back in 2000. To me the Coen brothers have made two outstanding films, this one and Fargo (1996), and yes, I know there will be some disagreement out there about that, but it's only my opinion. Now, before I tell you why I think this is such a great film, here's a little bit about the plot.Jeffrey Lebowski (a.k.a. The Dude), is disturbed one evening when two heavies break into his house and demand money that his wife owes their boss. One of them urinates on his rug before they realise they have the wrong Lebowski This one isn't even married. The next day The Dude complains about this to his bowling buddies, Walter Sobchak and Donny Kerabatsos. They figure out it's a case of mistaken identity and The Dude goes to see the man they really wanted, another Jeffrey Lebowski - The Big Lebowski, who happens to be a millionaire. Leaving with a replacement rug, The Dude meets the young trophy wife, Bunny Lebowski. A few days later he is contacted by Mr Lebowski's assistant, Brandt, because Bunny has been kidnapped and they want The Dude to act as the bag man. I won't say any more, but that's basically the set-up. Throw in The Big Lebowski's artist daughter Maude (from a previous marriage) and some crazy German nihilists and you can see there's plenty to keep the audience amused and entertained.This is an exceptionally well made film with a great cast, a great score and some really different and enthralling dream sequences thrown in. To me it's almost the perfect movie, I say almost, because I like to leave a little margin for improvement. Great performances all round from; Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey Lebowski - The Dude, John Goodman as Walter Sobchak, Julianne Moore as Maude Lebowski, Steve Buscemi as Donny Kerabatsos, David Huddleston as Jeffrey Lebowski - The Big Lebowski, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Brandt and Tara Reid as Bunny Lebowski. Oh, and I almost forgot a stellar performance by John Turturro as Jesus Quintana.As I've already said, this is, to me, almost the perfect movie. I say that because I can only find one scene that doesn't add anything substantial to the story. It's the one where The Dude confronts the guy in the VW Beetle (for those that have seen it). Apart from that, an almost perfect movie. Very highly recommended.My score: 9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the funniest films ever made!,"While some criticize the coen brothers for making ""Lebowski"", I praise for they have given to me a film I can watch endlessly.

John Goodman will never have a role like this again and I feel that it is his if not also Jeff Bridges' finest work. Phillip Seymore Hoffman never ceases to amaze me.

The Big Lebowski,"The ""Dude"" (Jeff Bridges) just wants to go through life drinking and bowling so is a bit narked when two thugs break into his apartment demanding cash! They've got the wrong ""Lebowski"" but only discover that after they've micturated on his rug! Determined to get some recompense, he goes to the correct one (David Huddleston) where he is given short shrift but decides to help himself to one of the many rugs that dot the man's mansion and he also takes a bit of a shine to his young trophy wife! Days later, he is summoned back by the butler ""Brandt"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and told that she has been kidnapped and that he is to help them deliver $1,000,000 to the felons. He reckons she's probably behind the crime herself, but agrees - for a fee, and recruits his loud mouthed mate ""Walter"" (John Goodman) to help out. That's not all, though! It turns out that there's yet another ""Lebowski"" and she's his daughter ""Maude"" (Julianne Moore). She's an energetically enigmatic, quite ruthless, woman who points out that the cash they are proposing to use is actually not her dad's - and she needs it back. With the scene now set, the capers quickly escalate and no rug is safe! Bridges leads this ensemble cast really well here as the story lurches from one disastrous escapade to another, marrying some witty dialogue with some borderline slapstick and all held together via White Russians and the bowling alley. Moore is also on good form as is the less-is-more performance from an underused but amiable Steve Buscemi as the third wheel on their wagon ""Donny"". The plot itself doesn't really matter, it's largely incidental to the engaging efforts of all except, maybe, for a Goodman whose constant expletives lose their potency quite quickly as his character becomes a bit too boorish. It is laugh out loud funny at times and as a semi-satirical look at layabout life, wealth and drug crime it's well worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The Mistaken Identity of Dude.......,"In this eccentric comedy/crime film by the Coen brothers, they created an outstanding movie. The actors/actress in the film was perfectly unified in a great way that audience could build a vision of the plot. If you can handle the graphic dialogue used and suggestive behavior this is the right movie for you.The theme of the film is Jeff ""Dude""Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) discovers he is a victim of mistaken identity. Thugs were sent to his home by Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) to recover a debit; Big Lebowski's (The Millionaire) wife owes him. Before the thugs realize they have the wrong Lebowski and that he's the ""Dude"" they urinate of his rug; leaving Dude in disgust. Dude pays BigLebowski (David Huddleston) a visit to be compensated for his rug being destroyed. Big Lebowski filled with arrogance; felt he was there looking for a hand out. Dude felt the conversation wasn't getting anywhere and decided he would take a rug from Lebowski home to be even.When Bunny (Tara Reid) disappears (Lebowski's wife); Big Lebowski contacts Dude making him an offer to be the bagman. The only thing Dude has to do is deliver the ransom money for Bunny. Dude brings Walter (John Goodman) along to make the drop. When the drop goes to pieces it creates a ricochet of others trying to reclaim the ransom money. While home listening to the soothing sounds of the bowling pins being knocked down, he discovers 3 people standing over him. They knocked him out and he begins to hallucinate; the lighting becomes dark with bright lights in the sky as he floats in sky. During the hallucination Dude see the rug he confiscated from Big Lebowski's. He is woken once his bowling ball drops him back to the surface.After coming back to reality, Dude is greeted by a women flying through the air on a stripe line in the nude, Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore). Dude and Maude forms a relationship. Dude without realizing has been sized up to be a sperm donor of her child. Dude experienced many encounters because he was trying to clear his identity. After having sex with Maude and enjoy a marijuana joint, at that moment Dude realized the reasoning behind the mistaken identity fiasco. In conclusion, as a motif in the film ""Dude"" was the main character's name; however, it was used as a common word of expression during dialogue. Dude was able to regain his identity and continued being the old lazy, laid back, unemployed, and bowler from Southern California.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Black Humour at its very blackest,"The Big Lebowski is probably one of the best films in the category of dark comedy. The Coen brothers did a really magnificent job in all respects. Practically every aspect of the movie is flawless. The characters, the dialogues, the casting, the storyline, the settings and the plot itself.Where the main roles are concerned Jeff Bridges and John Goodman gave their best performance ever. The roles suite them so well, I doubt they will ever do better than they did here. Steve Buscemi is the only exception (he already gave his best in Fargo)Unfortunately, the Coen brothers never really recovered after the shock of making such an exquisite film and their later works are nowhere near as good. In fact I'd go as far as to say their film Intolerable Cruelty (2003) was a complete waste of effort, for maker and viewer alike.There is however one emphatic point about the Big Lebowski: it is not universal humour. To really appreciate it, one has to be familiar with the American way of life or at least have a basic understanding of US history, contemporary culture, slang and so on. For example the ambiance of the ""bowling culture"", words like ""undude"", ""bummer"", ""jay"", ""ringer"" ""His Dudeness""; Walter's (Goodman) constant struggle for people to respect his constitutional rights and the RULES etc.Overall I still have to say it is an evergreen classic, and a must see for everyone who believes they have a decent sense of humour and are not put off by a little cursing from time to time and let's face it: all the time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Dude Sort of Abides,"Spoiler alert: Some plot outcomes revealed.The Dude abides, but Sam Elliot rules. Jeff Bridges is classic as the former, a pot-smoking do-nothing seeking payback for a urine-doused rug. The latter plays a mysterious cowboy-like character who chides Bridges' hapless bowler about his language but likes his style. Elliot is The Stranger.The movie's theme is mistaken identity, the effect of drugs on less- than-normal people, and how clueless rich people can truly be. The flavor, flow and overall senseless meaning of the movie underscores what happens when you portray goofs and drug-users in conflict with money- minded wackos.The shock-and-awe factor of this movie is not unlike Bad Grandpa, a 2013 send-up of a horny old grandfather featuring the star of Cable TV's Jackass show. Both movies are disjointed, purposefully themed to be off the wall, and are surprisingly funny.In The Big Lebowski, Jeffrey Lebowski is a ne'er-do-well Los Angeles bowler who hangs out with his com-padre ""kegglers,"" Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Donny, formally Theodore Donald Karabatsos (aka Steve Buscemi). Donny's an often-insightful dweeb who dies near movie's end. Walter's an angry, sort-of-Jewish convert who at one point produces a Colt .45 semi-automatic pistol from his bowling bag. You quickly realize none of these guys are playing with a full deck.The Dude's brain is pot-fogged and White Russian soaked. Walter, at least, is capable enough to drive, but he mistakenly thinks he fought in Vietnam. And later he collects the then-deceased Donny's ashes in a coffee can, casting them into the wind near movie's end – and back on The Dude and him.Sad to say The Dude Lebowski is mistaken by porno-movie collection apes for a very wealthy man by the same name. That would be The Big Lebowski, a condescending seeming 1-percenter yet handicapped war vet. He's played by character actor David Huddleston. Well-selected as his sycophantic servant Brandt is the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman.The urine on The Dude Lebowski's apartment rug is dispersed evilly by a couple arm-twisting thugs owed money by the Big Lebowski's bimbo trophy wife. The Dude is angry, and goes to see his wealthy name-sharer seeking a new rug, or more correctly a handout for the wrongful retribution. Only in America would such a chance meeting end up in a job offer. Bunny Lebowski's (Tara Reid)being held for big money, but not really. Dude accepts the mission, recruiting his pals.It truly is Bunny the wife who owes the porno mobsters money, not the wheelchair-bound war-hero millionaire Lebowski.The Dude is tasked with paying ransom for Bunny, Big Lebowski's wayward and carefree wife. Along comes Donny and Walter for the ride, Goodman's guy complete with his skewed world view and free-floating hostility.You know Big Lebowski's trophy wife is out of the kidnap plot when you see that one of the abductors is dumb enough to whack off a toe to add urgency to the fake scheme.The three supposed heroes-turned-bag-men interrupt their bowling ""career"" to save Bunny. This includes a pin-slaying showdown between The Dude and Jesus Quantana (John Turturro). You know these dueling bowlers will meet again when Jesus implies that he will beat The Dude so badly that it will be like a forceful administration of anal sex.Why? It's the whole prevalent drugs meets greed and silliness theme driven home with an 8-pound figurative sledgehammer.Portions of this movie are too bizarre to believe. (That's why I mentioned Sam Elliott, who rarely gets credit.) There's even an old-time psychedelic-rock interlude by Kenny Rogers and the First Edition: ""I Just Dropped In To See What Condition My Condition Was In."" The song plays as the Dude floats down a dream-state bowling alley while spinning rotisserie style. He passes admiringly beneath the legs of skirted identically dressed comely females. No clear reason or plot tie. It's just done.The angles, camera perspectives and even dialog are intended to underscore a pot-hazed plot. The Dude looks up from the floor at several points, flops over a chair in The Big Lebowski's office, and slurps White Russians. Walter has wild ideas about conspiracies. And Donny is always quieted with the same idiotic refrain: ""Shut the F-- up, Donny.""The Stranger says he likes The Dude's style, yet he also assails the White Russian-fueled Lebowski for a potty mouth. Say what? Head on camera shots, and Elliot's serious demeanor, add to the zany disconnected nature that prevails throughout as the movie's cult-fan theme. So does the quirkiness of all the other actors, especially Walter. Several times he has to be reminded that, no, he wasn't in Vietnam.  And Donny's rodent-like appearance lends credence to Buscemi's character.Near film's end, The Dude ends up in bed with a porn-movie producer and actress intent on becoming impregnated with his baby. Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) is an acrobatic little minx whose relationship to any other Lebowski seems unclear.The Big Lebowski is a movie with great potential, as long as you don't take any of it too seriously.Because the point is: Life is short, don't over-analyze it, and enjoy. The Dude, as each of us, merely abides.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A total Coen Brothers misfire.  I was bowled over by how bad it was.,"Agreed, the enormously popular Coen Brothers are an acquired taste.  And the David Lynches of quirky slapstick must be considered a hit-and-miss affair, but diehard fans are almost always left hungry for more.In the indigestible ""The Big Lebowski"", however, somebody REALLY forgot to tell the boys that off-the-wall just for the sake of off-the-wall can REALLY be bad.  Like the equally indulgent and incomprehensible ""Mulholland Drive,"" this so-called entertainment misses at every step -- as spoof, satire, revenge comedy, whatever.Check out ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo"" to see real genius at work. Unfortunately, the Bros took a total sabbatical from creative filmmaking when they locked horns on this one.  I guess the success of ""Fargo"" went SO to their heads that they decided to test their core fans.  Are we now SO cool and SO popular that we can pass anything off as long as its weird?Obviously, from the looks of things, they can.  Oh, please, IMDB people -- this ""film"" is BOTTOM ""250"", not TOP ""250"" material.  It reminds me of the time back in the 1970s when Paul McCartney wagered that he too could throw out anything musically and have the gullible public eating it up.  And so he did.  He composed a new pop tune using the lyrics of ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"", of all things, and earned his next solid hit.  Ugh!  I fear for the future of mankind when stuff like this happens.A thuddingly dull, incoherent mess that purports to be a quirky comedy, Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, who play bowling teammates, are the primary victims of this highway robbery.  Sad too, because this could have been Goodman's night to shine (as he did in ""Raising Arizona"") and, God bless 'em, he does give it both barrels, but what can you do when you're given blanks? Always the professional, Goodman tries to act cool...like he's in on the insanity.  A sleazy Bridges too rolls with the punches as a pothead slacker named Dude who through a series of mistaken identities finds a way of making make some quick dough involving a porno king and mobsters.How can such a dazzling, eclectic cast, who are perfect for this peculiar type of movie fodder, be so abominably misused?  Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, Peter (""Fargo"") Stormare, Ben Gazzara, and David Huddleston in the title role are such pros and come off looking like rank amateurs.  The last vignette with narrator Sam Elliott on a barstool is the capper. Terrible...just terrible.There are two reasons only why I gave this ""BOMB"" a ""2"" out of ""10"" instead of ""1"".  John Turturro as a creepy bowler named Jesus literally comes out of nowhere and demonstrates the Coen Brothers at full potential. His freakishly hilarious scene (which, of course, makes no sense whatsover) shows exactly what can happen when the Bros assert themselves.The other reason is sentimental.  Much of the action takes place at the Hollywood Lanes on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, California, where I use to bowl every Monday night.  I loved that place as it holds many fond memories.  Out of nowhere the district decided to tear the place down in the summer of 2002 to make room for a school.  Opposers, like myself, felt it was a landmark and deserved to be protected.  Anyway, it's gone now.The good news:  Any time I get nostalgic for the old bowling center, I can always rent out ""The Big Lebowski.""  The bad news:  I have to rent out ""The Big Lebowski.""",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
It is a riot and well worth the time.,"""The Big Lewbowski"" is an absolute riot.  It is filled with slapstick comedy with bawdy overtones.  There is no need to think.  The film is easily digested, and it is a belly buster.  Jeff Bridges plays The Dude, a Lebowski with charm who is a Los Angeles hobo.  He is assaulted by thugs at the beginning of the film.  His bowling buddy, John Goodman, Walter, is hysterically funny.  They have adventures that test the limits of humor. One should sit back and relax and really enjoy the casual presentation.  The drama is charming.  The characters are lovable.  The cinematography is excellent.

A Hilarious Offering From the Coen Brothers,"There are very few comedies made after 1960 that can make me chuckle, much less laugh out loud but The Big Lebowski is one of them.  While I've owned the DVD and have seen this film many times I was able to catch a midnight showing last week at a local art house theater, and it was a hilarious experience.  The high hilarity was enhanced by the crowd literally chanting the lines (or that could have been the White Russians we all drank were flowing as freely as water), and the audience's obvious appreciation for this clever film.While the Coen Brothers deserve a lot of the credit for the direction and the brilliant script, a special mention should be made regarding the performances.  I would say that Jeff Bridges completely breaks from his `regular guy' type roles, but Lebowski *is* a regular guy, if you are a pot smoking, unambitious shlub.  Both Bridges and John Goodman turn out performances that are so colorful and hilarious that their mere presence on the screen sparks laughter.  The always fantastic Steve Buscemi also joins Goodman as a Coen Brothers repeat performer, and carries on the typical `Buscemi Coen Brother Character fate'.This is a hilarious, surreal and brilliant film that should not be missed, especially if you are a fan of the Coen Brothers' work.  It has been criticized by die hard fans and others for not falling into their typical genre, but all of the elements are the same, and while for me choosing a favorite Coen Brothers film is like choosing which child is one's favorite (it can't be done!) this is definitely one that I can watch repeatedly and not have it lose any of it's charm.--Shelly",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Gets better with repeat viewings,"One of those rare films that gets better with repeat viewings.Aside from the hilarious writing and acting, we have a homage to every Marlowe/Archer/Sam Spade film every made. The young out of control wife, the rich old disabled husband, the eccentric strong minded daughter, the sinister pornographer, the beach town sheriff...The premise of the film was: what would happen if you threw a man like the Dude into a typical L.A. film noir mystery? How would he cope? What would he do? Not much to base a film on, but it works.Throughout the film, Bridges in the character of the Dude drifts like a beach ball in a swimming pool, bouncing off the sides, going in different directions. Listen to what he says, recycling everyone else's thoughts and words. He is a mirror reflecting everything back.In many ways, he is infantile. His ""beverage"" of choice is a sweet milky White Russian. He listens to a recordiing of a bowling game while immersed in his tub, a womb like scene. The Dude avoids pain and suffering, which means he avoids growing up.Ah, the writing! In the beginning of the film, there is a scene in the bowling alley with Goodman, Bridges, and Buscemi discussing Bridge's problem. Those few minutes of dialogue are some of the funniest ever written, but the scene wouldn't work without the subtle acting and sharp timing.John Goodman owns the film; he takes his gift for comic acting to a new level. His character is full of rage and love -- he's a typical man. :)Also rare in the film: every camera shot adds to the drama and meaning. It's a visual feast.The Coen brothers scatter references and clues and jokes throughout the film -- only repeat viewings will show you the detail. Like the rug and the room, the Coens have really tied this movie together.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
They Will Never Top This!!!,"Never has a Coen Brothers film been so good and so cool all at the same time.   Jeff Bridges is the most underrated actor of his generation and the rest is history.  The Coen Brothers have never found it hard to create a bizarre story that doesn't seem so weird when you watch it and turn it into something promising and promising is way off when talking about the big Lebowski.   John Goodman is fantastic as Walter,  the retired Vietnam veteran that has never got over the war and is angry at every possible thing and person apart from The Dude (Bridges) and Donnie played by Steve Buscemi. They are three friends who are no hopers but live for bowling.   Nothing comes better not even women into their life than the Bowling championship coming up but in between the times they bowl they have to go through the problems of Peeing on the Dudes rug, a bag full of Walter's uncleaned Undies, a mistaken identity and just being the wrong place at the wrong time.The Dude one day goes home to fine two men waiting for him and to put his head down the toilet.  They tenement of The Dude pay them money without realising that the man they actually want is another man who shares the same last name as The Dude `Lebowski'.   as punishment they pee on his rug and he is most disliked to that so visit's the Lebowski that they were meant to find to demand another rug and ends up getting involved in more trouble than he bargained for.  The real Lebowski comes into trouble after the visit by The Dude when he young beautiful wife Bunny is kidnapped and enlists the help of The Dude to be the drop off man with the money.   Before you know it Walter gets in on the action and everything goes wrong to make this the most comical black comedy since the last one.   Great performances from Bridges, Goodman, Buscemi and a nice and perverted cameo by John Tuturoro makes this the best of all The Coen Brothers films.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Mostly Funny, but a Little Slow and Weird","The Big Lebowski follows a man who, after being mistaken for a rich man with the same name, seeks vengeance against the people who mistook him and peed on his rug.It's a weird concept, and that's where a lot of the comedy comes from. Most of the comedy here is pretty good, I found myself laughing a fair bit. A few jokes fall flat, and by the end the movie is just grasping at straws to get both a good ending and some good comedy in there, but as a whole it's a weirdly funny movie.The writing is pretty good too. While it is, again, quite weird and unconventional, it was fun to watch the characters awkwardly live their uninteresting lives, meanwhile balancing the whole rug situation. And the characters were pretty well written too. They were consistent and, there's that word again, weird.The Coen brothers have this way with their movies where they all tend to be quite unconventional and sometimes give off a bad vibe, like it's just too unconventional and thus sometimes hard to fully enjoy. Don't get me wrong I like their movies, they're just really different and not always in a good way, and The Big Lebowski is one of those movies.Moreover, it could be a little slow from time to time. The plot made little progress throughout basically the entire thing, and all the characters really stayed in the same place right up to the end.Overall The Big Lebowski is a good movie, but it's far from the classic people seem to think that it is. Sure, it's funny and mostly well written, but it's a little slow and overly weird, and not everything always works. In the end I'd still recommend it, but it's not as good as people seem to think it is. Not in my book, anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Perfect Film,"It's extraordinarily rare for a movie to forever change the landscape of pop culture with a single blow, but ""The Big Lebowski"" did just that. I can't speak to the nature of how this was received when it came out- I was only eight when it hit theaters- but I can speak to the nature of how myself and many of those close to me feel about it, and I can speak to its increasing relevance of it today. This movie is a masterpiece that has no equal simply because there is absolutely nothing else like it under the sun. The Dude (Jeff Bridges, ""The Fisher King"") abides; he has since 1998 and he will until movies no longer are relevant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Crush,"What I appreciate more is the poster, which completely lingers that smell.
A lot of humorous details, deliberately unintentional, coherently incoherent, and needless, all on the top, and mixed.

Every once in a while I see a film with a good vote..,"that I think to be nothing more than a piece of crap. This is one of those films. You Pulp Fiction was about nothing, but it was interesting nothing, whereas this is about really nothing and it sucks at it. This film is neither funny, nor exciting, nor anything that represents a state of entertainment. This film sucks. I'll never understand it's rating a 7,7 ????!!!!. I think the reason for the rating is that it was made by the Coen brothers. Why they get so much good ratings for their films? Hell I don't know. I though this was crap. Fargo was only average.

Coen Brothers at their best,"I loved this movie.The offbeat humor, the oddball characters, the dream sequences, and the intermittent philosophical musings of the mysterious stranger (Sam Elliot) all worked together to make a thoroughly enjoyable movie.While I didn't ""get"" FARGO, the Coen brothers crafted a movie here that I wish I'd made myself. It's really a gem...",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Flawless,"Two things shock me about reaction to ""The Big Lebowski"". The first being the iffy critical reaction to it when it was released following ""Fargo"", the second being that there are still people who don't love this movie. It's unquestionably a brilliant film on any technical level: there are no wasted shots, the 'dream' sequences are unbelievably gorgeous, the Coens' direction is confident and assured every step of the way, and their economy in telling the story is commendable, and the cinematography by Roger Deakins is superb.Going beyond the visuals to the film, I find myself even more bewildered by how anyone could not at least give credit to the Coens for this script, at least for its immaculate structure and remarkably efficient characterization. Humor is subjective, sure, but this movie employs so many different types of humor that I should think it would appeal to just about everyone at one point or the other. I consider it a blessing that there's not a single joke in the film which I didn't find funny. You can't explain such things further, every line here is just pure gold, and the best thing about it is that the film demands multiple viewings for one to properly appreciate how rich the humor here is.I'm struck by the similarity of this film to a later Coen brothers film, ""Burn After Reading"". Not only did both follow near-unanimously praised, Oscar-validated dramas with memorable characters and a dark sense of humor, but both were also met with positive-but-not-ecstatic reviews from critics. The biggest similarity however is the genre. ""Burn After Reading"" is a spy thriller with no stakes and ""The Big Lebowski"" is a film-noir with no real stakes and a bunch of pointless crime and destruction. There are differences which lie mostly in the execution of the concept, most notably in that ""The Big Lebowski"" features far better-developed and more sympathetic characters, as well as a stronger script in general. Moreover, while ""Burn After Reading"" is a spoof of the spy thriller, ""The Big Lebowski"" is more like a loving tribute to noir, most specifically Raymond Chandler.The dialogue is pristine and probably never matched in film, at least not in a comedy, the acting is consistently superb with only Julianne Moore not being absolutely excellent (though she's fine, really) and Jeff Bridges and John Goodman giving the best performances of their respective careers, and the film is a technical marvel. What's not to love? Like with many of my favorite films I've put off writing a comment for a long time, and now that I've gotten it out of the way I don't feel I've said all I wanted to say. Oh well. This is an absolute classic, and I have no issues with calling it the Coens' finest film to date and one of cinema's great masterpieces.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Neither the best nor the worst.....,"Excuse me all of you who loved this movie....I really don't understand what the hype is all about....... I'm sorry but.....allow me pinpoint some aspects.....Is the movie funny? Yeah, a little... it shows a lot of acid humor and sarcasm , which by the way I love....Otherwise, the movie lacks of consistency. or let me say, a spinal cord...it has great specific moments of excellence....although is not enough for pasting all of them into a unique brightness piece..... The storyline in general is poor...in my opinion.....sometimes I felt as if the movie has just stopped..... Look Burn after reading for instance.....it's the most great movie of Coen brothers.....I loved it!!! The main characters are great in The big Lebowski despite of their just passable interaction ....highlighting Jesus, who was by far my favorite character...appealing, flashy, arrogant and clueless at the same time... On the background I've enjoyed the subject, specially the greed, which is continuously at our side all the time.... live, and see how petty and greedy people are....

"point, shmoint...it's just funny","Don't try to figure it out, simply enjoy the ride. The plot to this movie isn't even that important: the way the characters react and the tone of the thing, that's what draws you into this piece. It is blissfully bizarre and probably belongs up there with Altman's The Long Goodbye and Polanski's Chinatown as a wonderful snapshot of Los Angeles wrapped in a private-eye story. Again, it isn't a riddle to be solved, just movie entertainment at its best. The initial ""mystery"" of this story is about as important to the final film as the initial ""who stole the truck"" business in the beginning of The Usual Suspects. Forget about it and listen to the Dude sponging-up vocabulary, Walter chastizing pascifism, and poor Donny always six steps behind, out of his element. Like all the Coen Brother's films, this one gets better with repeat viewings to catch every nuance in performance, dialogue, cinematography, etc.  Jeff Bridges gives his best performance since Fearless.

Jeff Bridges' performance of a lifetime,"To be honest, I'm not the biggest Coen fan out there. It's not that I don't like their unique style.

The humor is strong, DoP Deakins does a great job but for me the star of the show is Jeff Bridges as The Dude. Never before or after did Bridges played a more memorable role. It is his performance that makes it an enjoyable film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A brilliant portrait of a character and his friends,"Watching this film I got a very strong sense that the Coen brothers created a character and then everyone involved in the film found themselves falling in love with him. There's so much absurdity in this film, but at it's heart is a character whose realness (in the sense of ""keeping it real"") grounds it all. So many things test the Dude's commitment to his own personal ethic and, in what is essentially a romp, the challenge to his moral compass creates layers one can't imagine from a synopsis of the film.And it's all perfectly executed: Jeff Bridges is fantastic, John Goodman simultaneously aggravating and charming, the dialogue so snappy and the one liners so quotable. Then there's the sort of soundtrack that filmmakers can assemble when they're at the top of their game and direction that doesn't intrude, except when it wants to.I hadn't seen this film for years, but there's so much going on I'm sure I could watch it again in a week and not be bored.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
might have been,I enjoyed the story and found it comparable to Pulp Fiction in depicting the antics of low-lifes doing wicked things to wicked people.  At times it was hilarious.

The highest rated movie that I actively disliked.,"The Big Lebowski (1998) was written and directed by the Coen Brothers.It features some great actors: Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi and Philip Seymour Hoffman. However, in my opinion, their talents are wasted in this film.It's about getting high, getting hit, and getting out. Maybe it would work better if you watched it when you were stoned.This film has an amazing IMDb rating of 8.1. Everyone liked it, even the top thousand reviewers who rarely like any movie. I gave it a 3.0. It's one of those films where I say, ""Did those people see the same movie I saw?""The Big Lebowski is considered a cult classic, and you can't say you know movies until you've watched it at least once.

Shut the **** up Donny!,"I have honestly never seen a film like the Big Lebowski before.  Just like I have never seen a film like Fargo before.  Both were done by the Coen brothers and both were funny and strange at the same time.  And both had roles in them for Steve Buscemi, who can make a good film great, a bad film good and a weird film watchable.I can't say I loved this film even though I'm giving it an 8 out of 10. But what I can say is that I really liked it.  John Goodman and Jeff Bridges are so funny in this film.  Goodman has issues.  That's for sure.  He has many issues that he is dealing with.  But instead of dealing with them like a scarred Vet usually does, he deals with them in anger but a funny anger if that is possible.  He lashes out at his friends especially Donny who just doesn't seem to say any of the right things when Goodman is around.Bridges is excellent as well.  His character really just wants to get through the day and bowl and not have anyone pee on his carpet.  But of course none of that is going to happen in the strange world that the Coen's have created.What is not so great about this film is all the dream sequences.  They are confusing and they don't hit the right note.  They feel more like a nuisance.But this is a film that should be experienced.

"The Fun, Bearable Lightness of Bowling...","As guys, we've all been through this Bohemian times, where we could keep the same underwear for the week, and bed sheets for the month, when the toilet seat could be left open and we could do whatever we wanted in the bathtub without a nagging female voice interrupting our meditation. But now that we settled down, it's with nostalgic eyes that we remember the time we could be guys in the lousiest and laziest meaning of the world, and venerate the one who made this attitude a lifestyle, a state of mind, a philosophy. His name is Jeff Lebowksy aka the Dude, a name fittingly rhyming with attitude, and he's played by the namesake Bridges in the signature role his career much needed.Indeed, who needs motives, personal backgrounds, goals and all that screen writing hogwash when you have an attitude. The attitude makes the characters who make the film, and that's the way the Coen brothers have it with ""The Big Lebowski"", bizarrely overlooked at the time of its release, but whose brilliance blossomed in our minds after we got rid of all our preconceived cinematic notions and started to appreciate the laziest character of L.A. But while the Californian urban landscape is integral to the film's 'narrative', I think every man in a way or another can relate to the Dude, starting with his appearance. Basically, he looks like a bum, with his long leonine hair, his shaggy goatee, his Bermudas shorts, flip-flops and bathrobes, but here's a guy who (obviously) is the antithesis of the metro-sexual figure, and that's enough a reason to love him.What matters for the Dude is to go bowling with his team: Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Donnie (Steve Buscemi) and enjoying a White Russian cocktail. Walter is a Nam vet and the kind of friends that make you wish for enemies, and Donnie is the space filler who can't align three sentences before being told to 'shut the **** up"". You think it's crazy to hang out with such guys? I have a friend like Walter, and no matter how much of a bastard he could be, we 'forgot about it' while playing pool. Bowling, pool or poker, the point is that if guys were given the opportunity, they would pick fun and idleness as ways of life. And if it was up to the Dude, there would be no plot, two guys could beat and water-board him, he'd let them go the minute they knew it was the wrong Lebowski, but one committed a mistake, he peed on the rug, the one that ""tied the room together"".The film is set during the Gulf War, so when he shares his misadventure, Walter paraphrases Bush Sr. and tells the Dude that they crossed the line and he's entitled to demand reparation. If the Dude is the extreme of men's capability to live without rules, Walter is the total opposite and can't envision life without a sense of ethos. He can't play on the Shabbat day even though he's not Jewish, but like he says, just because he divorced from his Jewish wife doesn't mean he should give back the library card. Walter is so wrapped up in his self-righteousness (he point a gun on a player who can't admit he crossed the line) that he's the one who makes the plot move forward, much to the Dude's annoyance. Goodman is the Laurel to Bridges' Hardy and you can't count how many times the Dude realizes the nice mess, he's been gotten into. And the mess all starts with the 'rug' situation.So, the Dude complains to the Big Lebowski (the late David Huddleston) a tycoon who incarnates the American capitalist dream, and except for his legs, lost in Korea, he has everything: money, power, influence a philanthropic foundation and Bunny, a trophy wife played by Tara Reid. The Big Lebowski throws the 'little' one out of his office, but the Dude tells his spineless assistant (played by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) that his boss agreed to leave him a rug as compensation. And as far as he was concerned, all was well that ended well for the Dude, and he could focus on the next game with Jesus Quintana, a Hispanic Bowling champ played by the Coen regular Tarantino. Quintana makes quite an impression when he's introduced but the feeling is immediately (and hilariously) contradicted by the little back-story detail Walter provides.But we won't have much of Quintana, because there's more going plot=wise, Bunny is kidnapped, his worried husband hires the Dude as a negotiator, and Maude Lebowski, his daughter (Julianne Moore) takes the rug back (and many other things I wouldn't spoil) . Many critics point out the fact that there's not a real plot, and it doesn't matter, even the narrator (mustached legend Sam Elliott reckoned he's lost his train of thoughts) but I think there's one identifiable pattern in the Big Lebowski, the characters have an attitude, which means, they believe in something tangible. The Dude believed in bowling, Walter in bowling and ethos, Donnie in his friends, the Big Lebowski in principles, his assistant in the Big Lebowski so it's all natural that the closest to villains in the film would be nihilists. It's one thing to do nothing but being driven by nothing is beyond reason.And for all the mess, the Dude and Walter go through, they remains true to their nature and this contrast makes their interaction and situations so damn hilarious, I understand the film needed some musical interludes to let us catch our breath, one of them providing an unforgettable POV shot from within a rolling bowling ball. When knocked up, the Dude only cares for bowling, more than a game, a defining metaphor for the man who slowly rolls over the lane of life.

"Yes, it is possible for ridiculous humor to be meaningful","Some scenes are a bit too absurd, preposterous, but ""The Big Lebowski"" abides. That being so, the Coen brothers simply say to their critics, ""such is life.""Their film is about exactly that - the absurdity of life in that no matter how much we try and take things into our own hands, do justice or make people claim responsibility for their actions, that life will often sucker-punch us out of left field.""Lebowski"" is about a man of that name that goes by ""The Dude."" He's a completely miserable, low-life character played by Jeff Bridges that for some reason you care about. As the Coen brothers are notorious for, The Dude gets caught up with some bad people for no reason other than he shares the same exact name as someone who happens to have money. When two guys break into his home thinking he is the other Lebowski and one pees on his rug, it all goes down hill from there for The Dude.With a stellar supporting cast, led by John Goodman who is incredible in this film as The Dude's best bowling buddy and insane converted-Jewish Vietnam vet, ""Lebowski"" is original and deep-belly laughing funny. But not only that, the events of the film all say something important about when we choose to take action and when it might be best to let things be. The film's scenes are either funny and quotable, creepy and eerie or both. Usually both. All the gags, however, seem to have a point. If not in what their message is/how it contributes to the film, than at least in the way they grab your attention. Every scene in the film is effective in this way.""Lebowski"" is undeniable proof that comedy can have a purpose other than mere entertainment. It is a film with purpose beyond humor. It is both strange, funny and meaningful.

Steve Buscemi is funny in a minimalistic role as Donny, who is always one sentence behind everyone else. The Stranger (Sam Elliott) is a classic narrator, completely unrelated to the plot. Other unnecessary characters include the unnervingly funny Jesus (John Turturro) and the painfully awkward landlord Marty (one of the underappreciated moments in the film is his dance routine). Honestly, would the plot really be affected if the stranger, Donny, Jesus, Marty, Brandt, or Knox Harrington weren't in the film. What about the private detective at the end, or the fascist policeman. The plot need not be understood to enjoy the comedy gold of this film. I gave it the a ten on this website's ratings, and it is my personal favorite Coen brothers movie (right ahead of O Brother, Where Art Thou and Miller's Crossing).",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The Dude abides and so does this film.,"After the darkly surreal, snowswept landscapes of the Minnesota depicted in Fargo (1996), the Coen brothers have wisely opted for a different locale with The Big Lebowski. Set in Los Angeles (circa 1991 at the height of the Persian Gulf War), this effort from the inventive duo is a whimsical tale about a man known as The Dude.Jeff `The Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a laid-back kinda guy, an aging Hippie who spends his days drinking White Russians, smoking pot, and bowling with his buddies. One day, this all changes when two thugs invade his home, rough him up, and urinate on his rug. It seems that they have The Dude confused with another Lebowski, a rich millionaire whose young wife owes money all over town.Bummed at having his prized rug ruined, The Dude decides to contact the other Lebowski and in doing so becomes immersed in a very strange, convoluted plot that involves nihilists, a kidnapping, Busby Berkley dream sequences, British performance artists, and bowling.Sound a little strange? It's all par for the course with the Coen brothers, a clever filmmaking duo that loves tweaking existing genres to the point that they become something very different and distinctly Coenesque.This includes fully-realized characters, both major and minor, that have their own unique habits and mannerisms. Most films do not take the time to flesh out their respective worlds or the characters that live in them but this is not the case with the Coens.The Big Lebowski presents a world rich in detail and atmosphere and is subsequently populated by often a humourous and sometimes bizarre collection of characters that range from an obnoxiously narcissistic bowler named Jesus (John Turturro) to Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), The Dude's loyal bowling buddy who just happens to be a Vietnam vet with a short fuse.The cast do a great job in supporting the main character, played wonderfully by Jeff Bridges. He creates mannerisms and habits that flesh out his character perfectly. From the first time we see him, Bridges is The Dude. And even though he is a down-and-out loser, there is something undeniably likable about him, and this is due in large part to Bridges' performance.From start to finish, The Big Lebowski is an engaging comedy that is very entertaining and a lot of fun to watch. It is a visual feast for the eyes -- in particular, The Dude's dream sequences which are simultaneously hilarious and breathtaking. This is the Coens in top form.The Big Lebowski may not have the dramatic weight or substance of Fargo, but it has a distinctive charm uniquely its own. The joy of this film is in watching all the entertaining diversions, subplots and minor characters and how The Dude interacts with them all. You are not supposed to really care about what happens to the convoluted storyline or how it is resolved. That is merely window-dressing for the Coens to showcase this highly engaging world they've created. The Big Lebowski is definitely worth the trip.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I know that the Coen brothers set out to make a movie like no other and I feel like they have.  The movie didn't make me fall off my seat with laughter until I really thought about it for several days.  It took several viewings of the movie to catch everything that was going on.  I had to purchase a video so I could save money at the video store!  Each viewing revealed yet another detail that was missed previously.

The story might be a little complicated to understand at first.

99/100 (the highest review I've given movies),"I'm one of those sick people who actually didn't like Fargo all that much. The characters were boring, the plot was uninspired, and the sense of humor was irritating and pretentious (I guess I'm the only one that doesn't think boring dialogue about ice and snow between cops at a murder scene is laugh-out-loud hilarious).  The Big Lebowski, however, is ten times the movie Fargo is.The characters are just great.  Even minor characters get special quirks that make them far more interesting than the major characters in most recent movies.  And the protagonist, Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), is the kind of guy who wanders down to the supermarket in his bathrobe at night to write a 69 cent check for a carton of milk.  I'm tired of boring, ridiculously one-dimensional main characters who get close-ups every other second while using lines like, ""I'm not going back without my men!""  The Dude is an unlikely hero if there ever was one, and that is why he is a most refreshing and memorable one.  There's The Dude's best friend Walter (John Goodman), a well-read and impulsive Vietnam vet; Jesus, the purple -clad sex offender/bowler; Maude Lebowski(Juliane Moore), the feminist artist who speaks of ""coitus""; and a crazed group of ideologically-confused nihilists, among so many other great characters.  The dialogue is priceless.The plot is very unique and ridiculous, but it fits the movie absolutely perfectly.  The Dude and Walter get involved in a shady world of kidnapping , embezzlement, porn, reactionary cops, and just about everything else, when all the Dude ever wanted was compensation for a rug of his that had been urinated on by confused debt collectors who were looking for a different man also named Jeff Lebowski.There are so many great little touches in this movie.  The Dude's dream /blackout sequences are hilarious (complete with Saddam Hussein handing out bowling shoes and bowling combined with porn imagery).  The script is very clever  and the movie as a whole is an incredible experience.  The best part of The Big Lebowski is how strangely wonderful the whole thing is; don 't expect most moronic movie critics to understand it.  In a perfect world, The Big Lebowski would be in the AFI's Top 100 instead of Fargo.  It's the type of movie you never want to end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The script is super well done, really, for me, the Cohen brothers and Tarantino are the best ""ordinary-dialogues-writers"" out there, is just fantastic how cool every single one of those lines are funny, or meaningful somehow.And I think that my favorite thing about the movie is this, it's super funny, I laugh my ass of through the entire movie, but is also one of those films that you can watch again, and every single time it is going to have a different meaning. It's like a ""thing"" of the Cohen brothers I guess, this is the same with Hail, Caesar! and (of course) No Country for old men.

The Dude Abides,"""Somehow I rest easier, knowing the Dude is out there, takin' 'er easy for our sins.""

But The Dude's every other locution is the ""eff"" word!Yes, but in chaotic times like the American 1990s, the forces of decency and love inevitably must be found in some pretty strange places, podner.THE BIG LEBOWSKI is a romp whose chief goal is to make audiences laugh until they cry. However, along the way, the Great Themes all are broached: Love, Death, Greed, Perfidy, Betrayal, Forgiveness, Courage, Honesty, Ambition.I have watched LEBOWSKI merely four times, but I look forward to owning my own copy soon and watching it once a month. I've already memorized sections of dialogue. Flaubert said, ""Madame Bovary--c'est moi!""; I am inclined to say ""The Dude--c'est moi!""For those whose minds and hearts align with those of the Coen Brothers, surely this is their crowning achievement to date. No scene rings false, and the parts all cohere, even though one must watch the film several times before every detail falls into place. This is a consummate work of picaresque art which becomes a kind of DON QUIXOTE before it's over: utter compassion and realism underlie the delicious absurdities.Ye who have ears to hear: listen and laugh.

"A Bizarrely Winning Fargo Follow-Up Seen Best Through a Haze of Bong Smoke, Whether Yours or the Characters'","The Coen brothers' The Big Lebowski is a friendly, clumsy comedy about a man named Jeff Lebowski, who calls himself the Dude, and is illustrated by the narrator as ""the laziest man in Los Angeles County."" He lives merely to go bowling, but is taken for a millionaire named the Big Lebowski, with calamitous results. We all know people like the Dude, and so, supposedly, do the Coen brothers. They rooted the character in a producer named Jeff Dowd. Both dudes rely on lateral thinking much more than orderliness.The Dude is paid a visit by two enforcers who obviously have the wrong Lebowski, but before they discover that, one has already peed on the Dude's rug, sparking intense hostility: ""That rug really tied the room together,"" the Dude laments. John Goodman's Walter Sobchak leads the vendetta. Sponging lines straight from Bush 41, he declares that ""this aggression will not stand"" and insists the Dude ""draw a line in the sand."" The Dude drops in on the real Lebowski, leaves with one of his rugs, and soon finds himself solicited into the millionaire's conspiracies.Rich Lebowski, wheelchair-bound like General Sternwood and staring into a fireplace like Major Amberson, wants the Dude to deliver his wife Bunny's ransom. This plot is countered by Maude, Lebowski's eccentric daughter from a past marriage. Julianne Moore, who played a porno actress in the great Boogie Nights, here plays a largely dissimilar sort of erotic artist, swathing herself in paint and launching herself through the air in a leather harness. L.A. in this film is a menagerie of idiosyncratic characters. One of the funniest is a Latino bowler named Jesus. The Dude is prone to lively fantasies when he's punched out or knocked unconscious, which occurs frequently, and one of them turns into a musical comedy set piece featuring a beautiful POV shot from within a bowling ball.The Big Lebowski tears across all trajectories and never goes anywhere. That isn't so much a failing as its technique. The Dude, who rocks a lot of ganj,' swigs White Russians mixed with half-and-half, begins each day full of determination, but his devices steadily melt into a fog of lost chances and misconstrued intent. The atmosphere is set up right at first, when the narrator begins sufficiently well but ultimately admits he's lost his own gist, a droll curveball drawing our attention to the incidence of screenwriters who will never be unwilling to remove all support from us even after it has been literally soiled by a shaggy-dog-story character we may or may not ever see again in this chaotic plot.This could never equal its predecessor Fargo, but it's bizarrely winning, like its hero, played by Jeff Bridges with a goatee, potbelly, ponytail and Bermuda shorts so bulky they may have been scrounged from his sounding board and bowling partner, Walter Sobchak. Their other teammate is Donny, who may not be too sharp-witted, but it's difficult to know as he's never permitted to finish a sentence. Set at the time of the Gulf War, here are characters whose language was created by earlier times, Vietnam, flower power and the Twilight Zone. As with Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski shows us a protagonist whose doofus-y simplicity appears to be his sole defense from the real world. He and Walter's very idea of real life may be wrought by the narrow ways they have to express it. Bridges does more with his downcast physical expression than countless comics can manage by laying it on thick.From its opening credits, The Big Lebowski indeed appears and feels like a shuck-and-jive. That's why the recognizable premise of a staged kidnapping complete with betrayals is only outwardly commonplace. Crime and reason are not the concerns here. What matters is how hard-wearing the two or three characters we're most concerned for are, despite the misfortune generated by their own ineptness. The Big Lebowski---a surrealist farce cooked up by the unruly Coens out of odds and ends of the deep-rooted and the new-fangled, the philosophical and the primal, in a fraction of LA where heightened reality crashes with autistic character interaction---amounts to noticeably less than the sum of its frequently lively and entertaining parts.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Dude abides.,"Criminally under-utilized and overlooked actor Jeff Bridges shines here as 'The Dude' in this magnificent shaggy dog tale by the talented Coen brothers that improves in hilarity with every viewing.  The Dude is a truly inspired creation -- as far from your standard-issue hero as you'll ever find.  In fact, to be blunt, he's a lazy, drug-addled, feeble slob.  But his heart is good, his instincts true, and his shuffling persistence in the pursuit of justice is a wonder to behold.As usual, the Coens' regular supporting cast of loonies is perfection, with co-star John Goodman a standout as the John Milius-inspired Vietnam vet with a chip on his shoulder the size of Gibraltar.The plot doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense, with many bizarre stops along the way, weird bits of business, oddball musical fantasy interludes and bursts of manic action that will most assuredly test the attention spans of the straightlaced and unimaginative.  But if you loosen up and go with the flow, in the laidback manner of The Dude himself, you could find yourself having a lot of fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The perfect roommate movie,"I've never had a roommate who didn't like ""The Big Lebowski.""  It is quite simply a perfect film to watch with friends.  It's funny, fluffy, and it goes down really well with the mind-altering substance of your choice.Bizarrely, this now-classic film hit the theaters like a beached whale; it barely recouped its costs, and was generally regarded as a lightweight followup to the Coen brothers' acclaimed ""Fargo.""  I can see why people were disappointed, actually.  ""Fargo"" is a tightly plotted thriller, and ""Lebowski"" is shamelessly meandering lunacy.  But both films are masterpieces in their own ways.What's so great about this movie, then?  Without sounding too pretentious, I'd like to submit the theory that it captures the rhythms of modern, everyday life.  Think about it.  We all have stupid hobbies and annoying friends, we'd all rather get trashed than work, and we'd all be pretty hopeless morons if we were suddenly plunked into the middle of a tortuously complex film noir plot.  That's the genius of ""The Big Lebowski""; it puts the average schmuck into a Chandleresque world of intrigue, and the results are hilarious, in a rather strange way.I know lots of people who think this is the best comedy ever made, and I'm almost on board with that - Walter alone propels the film to greatness - but in the end, ""The Big Lebowski"" is just slightly too strange for me to wholly embrace.  Oh, it's great, four stars all the way kind of stuff, but after I watch a ""deeper"" comedy like ""The Odd Couple"" I feel more fulfilled, more enlightened about the human condition.

"""Bowling, Bungles, and White Russians: 'The Big Lebowski' - A Timeless Cult Classic""","""The Big Lebowski,"" directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, is a unique blend of comedy, crime, and a touch of surrealism that has secured its place as a cult classic.

His interactions with John Goodman as the volatile Vietnam vet Walter and Steve Buscemi as the mild-mannered Donny are the heart of the film, offering a perfect balance of absurdity and humor.The plot is a labyrinthine mix of intrigue and misunderstanding, inspired by the works of Raymond Chandler.

Masterful work in character and comedy by the Coens,"The Coen brother's pessimistic view of the world, where its evilness, selfishness and hostility are soaked in the quirkiness and alacrity of daily life, is never better portrayed than in The Big Lebowski. Lebowski (not to be confused with that Mr. Lebowski), is one of the most interesting characters in cinema, a jobless drifter who has nothing going on with his life, mistakenly placed amongst people and a society that does not appreciate the beauty of his character. The film portrays a nihilistic view on life, a showcase of how meaningless life is, just like the drama and conflicts that unfolds in the story. The life Lebowski leads might not appeal to everyone, but we should all learn a thing or two from the the way he speaks, deeply rooted in a socially unacceptable philosophy that upon second thought yields more happiness than most. Why take life so seriously when deep down it is such a amorphous ridiculous mess that points nowhere? Do you agree with Lebowski? How can you apply his philosophies in real life where the stakes both smaller and higher than in Lebowski's fictional world of 90s LA? These are only a few of the questions this film inspire in its audience. In a weird way, The Big Lebowski makes for quite a touching film, and the way it does so is to make you reevaluate the attitude with which you lived your life until then. How is the truth about life, hidden in plain sight, so simple and yet so easily shunned?Coen brother's directorion and Deakin's cinematography are both highlights, but in this film I find the script and character study more intriguing. After all, it is what this film's enduring legacy is built on, and from which a cult following and even a so called religion engendered. The Coen's brothers eye for the folly of society and the frustrated human condition shines in this modern classic. They write dialogue that is rich with dark humor and subverts clichés to deftly convey underlying messages. The Big Lebowski is another one of those definitive Coen films - subversive, funny, dark, thought provoking, perhaps even an exemplar at that.

Outstanding!!!  Very very funny!!!,"There are so many movies that lack in originality, and there are so many comedies that fall flat.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is like an answer to my prayers.  This is a comedy that works in ALL aspects.  Sometimes you have a comedy that's funny, but the writing's terrible and the talented cast is pretty much the only asset that keeps it moving.  This movie not only has a great cast, but it's wonderfully written (by those genius Coen Brothers), lavishly directed and contains a remarkable soundtrack.  Each and every character has a quirky, notable personality.  My favorite, though he only appeared on screen for about 5 minutes, was Jesus Quintana (played masterfully by John Turturro).  He cracked me up so hard!!!  And I love that scene where Jesus goes up to bowl, licks the ball for good luck and we watch in slow-motion as he hits a strike.  He dances in the lane and rejoices, while we hear a Mariachi version of the famous ""Hotel California"" in the background.  Only the Coen Brothers can make a scene work that smoothly. There are other memorable sequences, like the musical number called ""Gutterballs"" with Jeff Bridges being handed a pair of bowling shoes by Sadam Hussein and flying under the skirts of beautiful women.  You watch a scene like that, and you wonder why this movie didn't nab an Oscar for Best Art Direction.Ethan and Joel Coen have a great sense of originality, and that also showed in their other hilarious comedy, ""Raising Arizona.""  I loved that movie, too.  But I loved this movie twice as much.  Some won't approve of its maximum dosage of ""f"" words, but I was laughing so hard that didn't bother me one bit.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is one of those flicks that shows you what comedy is all about, and how to really form a good punchline with perfect timing and delivery.  As a bonus, the film is packed with stunning visuals. It's such a great movie to look at.  There are no cheap shots in this one. The dialogue is imaginative, yet realistic.  It's not the least bit pretentious.  You know, as you watch this, that this IS the way people talk. And that was also shown in ""Fargo.""  And I liked that even though the central character was a simple-minded individual, they didn't construct him like someone out of a ""Bill and Ted"" movie.  Jeff Bridges, who is perfectly cast, was extremely entertaining and I can say the same about John Goodman as his easily-angered friend who follows all the Jewish holidays even though he's not Jewish.I find it a tad appalling that critics have panned this movie and called it slight and forgettable.

Goodman is well known for his comic talents, but everyone in this movie puts forth a full effort in displaying their craft exercised to the fullest. I laughed out loud at more lines and circumstances in ""The Big Lebowski"" than I have in a long time during a movie.There are bizarre circumstances, absurd conversations, acid flashbacks, and entire characters that you may decide aren't really there. I anticipated the ""punch line"" in the strange little funeral that Jeff and John held for their friend, and still had a tummy holding laughing jag when it arrived. I had somehow missed this movie for quite some time, so I am certainly glad I finally watched it. If you are a fan of offbeat, irreverent comedies and haven't caught this yet, this time is nigh! Warning, after this movie you may experience strange sub-conscious desires to drink white russians and go bowling.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
when the dude is blathering about new things that have come to light you better listen,"Another Coen classic I dare say. Certainly one of the weirdest Coen films in my book. Jeff Bridges delivers a brilliant performance as ""The Dude"" but not only he, also John Goodman as Walter is unbelievably good. There's not one character that feels miscast or ""out of place"", not even the German nihilists. And then there is Jesus... When you think it can't get any weirder (unless you go see ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"") wait until Jesus starts to bowl. Now you may not like bowling but that's of no consequence because ""new things will come to light"" when you keep watching, things like beverages of a certain kind, rugs, toes, scribbled notes, car stolen, car found, a baseball bat, money lost, the Eagles, thorough doctors, sex, not necessarily in that order.The dream sequences are yet another part of this movie which in itself would be totally cheesy and boring for anyone to watch, but this time around it's the dude and you fly along with him. No questions asked.One cannot help but wonder though how the dude makes a living besides playing courier for ransom money? Maybe he acts as a jury for his landlord's dancing performances? Who knows? It's beside the point. The dude does what the dude does: Nothing, but that he does exceedingly well.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

El Dude.....,"This movie seems to be a Raymond Chandler type gumshoe film noir story, except the Philip Marlow protagonist is substituted for ""the Dude"". While Philip Marlow is a suave, yet tough private dick who wears a suit, the Dude is 40+ year old stoner who likes to bowl and wears mostly boxer shorts and a robe (also pays for items costing less than 1 dollar with a check). The story starts out with two henchmen breaking into the Dude's house (mistaking him for a man with a similar name) to collect a debt. Figuring out they had sought the wrong Lebowski, they leave a little reminder of the break in, namely they piss on his carpet (which held the room together). From here the movie takes some unexpectedly wild, yet quite comical turns. The Dude is usually surrounded by his buddies, Walter and Donny. Walter is a slightly unstable, Jewish (converted) ex-Vietnam veteran, while Donny is the proverbial 3rd wheel. This movie is just pure fun. I could not stop laughing the whole movie. The situations are just wild and the Dude's dealing with them is even better. I recommend watching this movie with friends, and with lots of Kahlua, Vodka and milk on hand (AHHHHH. Those white russians).",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Fantastic comedy.,"I really adore this film. The story is utterly hilarious, it's shot in a way that really brings out the humour. The characters are all pretty much larger than life, the slacker, the ticking time bomb, the young trophy wife, the pompous millionaire. The movie is sort of a parody of the film the big sleep but updated for our modern less refined times. As you'd expect for a comedy film the editing is great. I wasn't a fan of Fargo but this film just worked for me in a way that one didn't. The film can be rewatched over and over with you able to get the same levels of enjoyment from it.

"No, Dude, we don't mind if you do a J...","It's the little things about a Coen-constructed universe (read ""film"") that make me laugh, and ""Lebowski"" is no exception.Case in point:The Dude is lazy, has no job and lives, er, slacks in Venice Beach, where he painfully scrawls out a check for $.69 for White Russian fixin's--specifically Half-and-Half--at the local supermarket.  Not exactly the most intelligent mind on the planet.  Yet he knows the exact street in North Hollywood where to find the In-N-Out burger (for those who are LA-challenged, North Hollywood is about 20 miles inland and worlds away from the beach).  Makes you wonder if somewhere in that hazy melon of his he knows every location in LA County.  Of course he knows this.  It would be out of character if he didn't.And another:At Jackie Treehorn's Malibu beach pad, Treehorn grills the half-baked Dude as to where Bunnie Lebowski might be.  Suddenly the conversation is interrupted by a phone call and Jackie scrawls info on a pad while on the phone.  We get the requisite zoom-in close-up as the Dude watches from across the room.  Jackie excuses himself and exits.  The Dude as Philip Marlowe rushes to the pad and lightly traces onto it.  Instead of an address or any useful info about the aforementioned phone conversation, he instead traces a picture of an man, shall we say, standing at attention.  Of course he does.  Treehorn is the self-described ""publisher"" who created ""Logjammin'""...what else did you expect to find on the pad?!Now I'll concede that events like this can not possibly sustain a film, and I think ""Lebowski"" was lambasted because it is a film not about story, but about a collection of characters.  Funny characters. In fact, even the idea of taking a burn-out and dropping him in the middle of a convoluted Marlowe noir-like caper is enough to make me start laughing.Yes, the language is crude.  Yes, it sometimes feels like a collection of scenes strung together.  I will say, however, this film is incredibly funny and hits the mark again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Jeff Bridges plays a convincing White Russian- drinking stoner to perfection and John Goodman (a Coen brothers staple) is the main f-bomb-dropping perpetrator, with John Torturro (another Coen bros favorite) showing a true love for his bowling ball.

My Favorite Comedy,"This has been my candidate for the funniest film I have ever seen, ever since I caught it at a last chance theater late in its initial run.It was a small theater in a multiplex. Total attendance was myself (solo), a thirty or forty something married couple, two young guys, a dating couple and another group of two or three college students.A group dynamic soon established itself. We all became so sore from laughing that no one wanted to be the initial victim of the next gag. But each time someone would start laughing and we all helplessly joined in, EVERY TIME.We really did think we could hold out once, but the next thing The Dude dropped the joint in his pants and his Torino ended up sideways in the alley. After that we gave up on even trying. It was the most powerful bonding experience I ever had with strangers in a theater.I have always been completely high on Jeff Bridges' talent, wondering why he was not appreciated like DeNiro, Duvall, Hackman, Pacino, etc. It seemed odd to me that he will probably be remembered for playing this part, but now I think that might not be a bad fate after all. I think he is like Robert Mitchum - the best Hollywood actor alive, under appreciated because he makes it look so easy. Lebowski is the perfect example of that. It looks like a simple acting job but no one could have done it better, or even as well.To give the Coen Brothers their due, the one-two-three roll of Fargo-The Big Lebowski-Oh Brother, Where Art Thou may be unmatched in cinema history. And they keep getting better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Can't abide the Dude,","I finally broke down and bought this movie because of all the glowing reviews I'd read here about it. Surely a movie so many people liked and waxed lyrical about would be worth owning. The first time I watched it, I got to the dude's second encounter with Maude and turned it off just annoyed by the film. I watched it again and made it through to the end a few days later.I've only seen three Coen brother films, Raising Arizona (mostly hated it), Fargo (mostly loved it) and this one (still trying to decide). One thing you can say about the Coen brother's films is that they are complex. This one is somewhat of an homage to Raymond Chandler's LA based Philip Marlowe mysteries. I happen to love Raymand Chandler's works and consider him one of the most brilliant authors of the 20th century, so am somewhat disappointed by the Coen brother's thievery (their characterization, not mine) of his style.The Dude, like Chandler's Marlowe get's caught up in a web of intrigue and runs around LA meeting mostly unsavory characters that you can't begin to like. Marlowe himself is somewhat unlikeable, but not as unlikeable as the Dude. At least Marlowe is working while the Dude is motivated by primarily his own greed, first in wanting to obtain a new carpet for free, and secondly by increasing offers of money from the other Lebowski and the other Lebowski's daughter Maude.But if the Dude is unlikeable, most of the other characters are even less likable. John Goodman as Walter, is especially annoying, and most of his scenes are played out so over the top to be totally unbelievable. Most of the other reviewers talk about how ""realistic"" the conversations between Walter and the Dude are, yet gullibly laugh at Walter throwing himself out of a moving car with an Uzi wrapped in bubble wrap to go try to catch a kidnapper to beat the truth out of.Donnie is probably the most likable of the three friends, or at least maybe you feel most sorry for, as he is continually told to shut up by Walter. At least Donnie gets one of the most memorable lines of the movie when the Dude and Walter are talking about something that Lenin said and Donnie interjects, ""I am the Walrus?"" Of course the Coen brothers for no discernible reason kill Donnie off at the end of the movie.I don't know why the Coen brothers felt they needed Sam Elliot in this movie, but I liked it as a nice touch of surrealism. I didn't like the dream sequences very much, especially the second one. I also found the German nihilists very insultingly portrayed, kind of along the same lines as how the Germans in Hogans Heroes were portrayed. I'd expect better from the Coen's they are smarter than that.The film wasn't totally worthless, I did laugh out loud at points (the In and Out Burger fixation was hilarious, as was the 2X4 nailed to the floor as a doorstop that the Dude later trips over, for a couple of examples), but there were as many things that I found just downright annoying about the film as well.Far from a masterpiece, it's a badly flawed, albeit, amusing film.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

That rug really tied the room together,"Directed by Joel CoenStarring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Julian MooreWritten by Ethan and Joel Coen'""Dude"" Lebowski, mistaken for a millionaire Lebowski, seeks restitution for his ruined rug and enlists his bowling buddies to help get it.'Before watching this film, I knew it had somewhat of a 'cult' following but I never really heard any real noise about it. As the movie ended, I knew I didn't waste my time!Joel and Ethan Coen are great creators in the world of film-making. I've watched 'No Country for Old Men' and what I took away from that film was 'silence is golden.' But this film is an entirely different animal. 'The Big Lebowski' reminds me of 'Dazed and Confused' and 'Reservoir Dogs' in the way that it's so easy to relate to the characters that the Coen brothers superbly created. The writing is the strongest aspect of this picture. They speak in such a 'down to earth' tone that it seems like you're listening to one of your best friends speaking to you and it really helps the flow of the story. It's easy to read the characters and the atmosphere is shoved in your face, but not necessarily forced. It's brilliant. I salute the writers!The acting in this picture can be summarized with one certain name'John Goodman.' He stole the show. Period. End of story. Whenever his character was on screen, my eyes and ears were glued to him and when his character wasn't on screen, I was passionately awaiting an entrance. John Goodman's character has patience when everybody else's blood is rushing and he believes he knows the whole story without even knowing a shred of truth. He never looks back and never thinks twice. He was a joy to watch and I would watch the film again just because of him. Moving on, I had my doubts about Jeff Bridges at the beginning of the film. I didn't think he could pull off the character I was brought in front of in the beginning but as the film went on, he grew on me. I was buying everything he was saying. Great words with such a modern tone made his character just as enjoyable as Goodman's.The music in this picture met with the story at such a point, I was hypnotized. It had a 'Farelly Brothers' edge to it. At times, I thought I was watching one of their films. The music had such a 'good mood' atmosphere and it leaves you so relaxed. It's the kind of music you would have playing if you were going on a long road trip with a few buddies.'The Great Lebowski' was fun. I can't say that about a lot of films I've seen in my life. It's a film that's worth a second viewing and if you haven't seen this film, I strongly recommend you give it a look.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
BDOG,"BEST COMEDY EVER MADE!!! SIMPLE AS THAT!!!
Great story, great characters, great performances, ALSO ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED MOVIES EVER!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The best bowling comedy of 1998,"At a Conservative Party ccktail function sometime last year, after a few drinks the subject naturally got onto best films. The general concensus was that ""Withnail & I"" had that title of funniest, and of that there was little genuine argument. However, there was a small contingent of persons present who claimed that the Coen brothers with Lebowski, a then, recent offering, could possibly wrest the title from Robinson's hitherto safe hands. Though I should add that they voiced this opinion in a humble and respectful manner.An investigation ensued, and within a week I had located an establishment that was to play it, and set to my task, viz. a comparison with studious meticulousisity.To take the film as it stands would be the only way to treat it fairly because, to be fair to it, it is completely different to Withnail. It is a totally different kind of humour, and style of filming. Whereas Withnail features a kind of low budget dark, earthy and realistic humour, Lebowski has a certain elaborate feel to it, from the expensive sets and abstract scenes to the wealth of locations and Hollywood feel. But enough of the comparisons, I'm supposed to be writing about Lebowski here, so no more Withnail. But let it be said, they are both titled on names and concentrate on bums (or a bum).Lebowski tends to rely on seemingly obvious jokes and repeated lines and styles,(such as ""shut the F***K UP Donny"", ""I'll suck your c**k for a thousand dollars"" and ""Am I wrong?"") combined with a rewarding subtle blend of character-based humour, (such as Lebowski never finishing his lines, Donny never getting to say anything, Brandt's nervous mannerisms, and numerous self referential statements). Some people from the Dumb and Dumber school of comedy appreciation will ""get"" very little of Lebowski, and will not rate it. These are largely the same kind of people who thought that Mallrats was better than Clerks.The introduction to the film and, most importantly, to Lebowski is utterly perfect. The look at this supposed bum, and then at the till girl to put things in perspective, creates good empathy with the inner workings of the protagonist. He took his  choice, others take theirs. Great camera work and combination with Dylan provides the perfect setting to the bowling hall, and hence, the backdrop to the film. This style of filming is the Coen brothers at their very best, and blending of the title sequence into the story is done as well as anyone could do.This film is made of a combination of straightforward camera shots and dialogue with very little action (aside from bowling or driving). This is then juxtaposed with some very abstract scenes such as dream sequences and slow motion footage of (questionably) real situations. This technique often creates a very effective result though sometimes can become tiresome. The main crux of the film is set in the real world and revolves around The Dude attempting to repatriate his living room with a rug. This is largely done in a very ordinary fashion but with a great wealth of humorous conversation. Goodman provides many memorable sayings. Where the film goes at a tangent to this, but with immediate purpose in mind, it works very well. The best examples of this are the introductory bowling scene (as stated), and the introduction of the loveable Jesus. When these scenes are not so welcome is when they actively distract from the flow of the story and serve only to break it up in an undesirable manner. Still, without this experimentation we would have been without some of the film's most impressive moments.As The Dude's main opponent is The Big Lebowski, a disabled veteran with a personal achievement complex. He is acted out brilliantly by Huddleston, has an excellent vocabulary ( including micturate) and is a very aggressive character, especially towards The Dude. Looking after him is his faithful servant Brandt who has some delightful nervous mannerisms and peculiar gaits which work well with his characters speaking parts.The blend of humour is mostly based around slight subtlety on the part of some characters, and outright over-the-top acting on the part of others. Add this to some great visuals, though not over the top, and the result is a finely crafted humorous product. In all, though not as good as the all conquering Withnail, Lebowski does manage to better Fargo, and is certainly one of the funniest films in recent years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
nothing special,"I heard good and bad things about this before I saw it and now I know why. There are some fantastic characters in this, some great dialogue and funny lines (favourite - ""This isn't 'Nam, this is bowling. It has rules!""), good acting... But it doesn't add up to much. In fact the explanation for things is a bit of a copout. Furthermore, at other times the Coen brothers are just lazy - ignoring their fantastic talent with words they rely too often on boring and inane swearing. Swearing can of course be funny, here though it isn't. It's repetitive and dull. So this is an average film IMHO, a wasted opportunity, though it does have interesting bits. Julianne Moore even gives a dull performance. And you can always rely on her. Try other Coen brothers films - Blood Simple, their first, is possibly their best.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Its wit was ""with an anvil""- so clumsy, repetitive, and sophomoric. A few sight gags merited a slight smile. But it was so bad I stopped it after one hour. I was in a good mood- wanting to be entertained, but I felt insulted by what I perceived as a sell-out to Hollywood crotch/excrement humor and the humor of familiarity. If you hadn't recognized Turturro, would that bowling bit have been funny? even clever? Micturition, indeed. Even the the vet and the businessman were broad, 2 dimensional caricatures. Cartoons- just so the 12 year old kids would ""get it"". With an anvil.

When The Dude says that it's pretty obvious that he isn't a millionaire, they pee on his rug, which really tied the room together.I know it's not on Netflix yet, but it is totally worth the price to buy it.

Greatest comedy of all time,"You might not appreciate it the first time through completely but, every time after you will discover new humor every time.

Walter Sobchak is the friend everybody needs to have and Donnie, while out of his element, completes the trifecta of this Odd Couple. Sign me up for that bowling league so I can f with the Jesus.

A fun frenzy!,"From the get-go, the Dude comes off as a nonchalant guy looking to take in the most of life without extravagance. His pacific nature, along with his friends (who can be polar opposites at times) are lovable characters who all love to bowl. But in all seriousness, this movie revolves around the misfortune(s) of Lebowski: a lovable passive man who just wants to enjoy life, but is put in a whirlwind instead.From the bowling alleys to the bridges, going on this adventure is constant excitement and joy. You can't help but smile to see the Dude take what life has to throw at him in the best way he can. Lebowski is quite the man, and this movie's highs (literally) and lows certainly prove it is more than just another dull comedy.Watching this movie even after hearing about all its reviews, I was still quite impressed in every aspect of the film. Whether it just be scenes of playing at the lanes, or taking a relaxing drive outside, I can't overemphasize how much I enjoyed this film. I highly recommend The Big Lebowski since I'm sure it will put a smile on your face...and even give you a little something to think about.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Its not good,"Its not good- but entertaining, its a really dumb movie, not sure how its rated so high, its not worth watching if you've never seen it, you're not missing anything, there were a few funny parts that were kind of a ha ha moment, but not really laughing like a madman funny.That's about all I have to say about that.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Best Dialogue!,"The Big Lebowski has some of the best dialogue in any movie I have ever seen. There are so many one-liners in here it is hard to keep up. The dialogue is very crude, which of course makes this a movie that truly deserves its R rating. The dynamics between the characters all work out wonderfully. It is fun to watch all of them interact with each other and their opposing viewpoints. An example of this is the pacifism exhibited by the Dude that contradicts the war hawk attitude of Walter. It is hard to say who stands out more than anyone else.The plot of the movie is so simplistic, but yet it somehow works. I recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a good comedy that also has some good action in it.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Hail His Royal Dudeness,"This is the funniest movie I have ever seen, although I didn't have that opinion until after I had seen it about 4 times. It took my a few viewings to really catch everything. The key is that you have to watch this movie without really worrying about the plot. You just have to enjoy the characters and the dialogue, which in every scene, without fail, is as witty as any I've ever seen.It's the kind of movie you'll memorize, repeat parts of over and over, and watch over and over, enjoying it more each time. Every character in it has a unique charm, and despite the fact that they are all pretty much cartoonish caricatures, they all somehow have depth, and the interplay among them is just priceless.

The Definition of Clever Sarcasm,"I'm going to start off by mentioning this movies falls at #2 on my list of best movies of all time. I'll also mention that I live by dry sarcasm and underlying suggestion.Interestingly enough, I hated this movie the first time I saw it. Missing the first 10 minutes certainly didn't help, as I had a hard time following. However, nothing really stood out that I enjoyed.As I watched the movie ~25 more times over the next 10 years, I saw everything that I had missed in that first viewing. And it became entirely clear to me the pure genius and wit that goes into EVERY scene and EVERY line of dialog.This movie has the best character definition I've ever seen. Even though you can't necessarily identify with the characters, you feel as if you've known them for years within the first couple minutes of meeting them. Sure, they are stereotypical, but they are also brilliantly acted and portrayed, making them so believable.Goodman gives the performance of a lifetime. Walter is so over-the-top ridiculous, and yet so surprisingly content as such, one can't help but to laugh at how seriously he takes himself.And then there's Jesus. Everyone else does a top-notch job, but he steals the show. Two scenes, both equally outrageous. Costumed, acted and written to perfection.If you find yourself disliking this movie, watch it again (unless you're easily offended by the *F* word). Let every line of dialog sink in, along with the way it's delivered. When you find yourself laughing hard at your favorite parts, rewind them and listen to the reactions of characters that you may have missed because you were laughing so hard. They are equally as rewarding.There is so much to digest in the Big Lebowski, it deserves to be viewed a couple times a year. You will undoubtedly see/hear something you probably missed the previous time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Wow!,"This was the first Coen brothers film I saw and it was superb. I didn't really know much about it apart from it was supposed to be good and was made by these critically acclaimed brothers. I rented it out and watched it twice. I bought it within a week. The main characters - The Dude and Walter - are simply the best, funny and interesting and the supporting cast all put in good performances. The humour varies from sight gags to plots twists and back again. The music is also great, it adds to the overall feel of the film really well. Add to that, it's a film with bowling in and you cannot go wrong. One of my favorite movies of all time. SEE IT.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Iconic Character and a Peerless Film,"Joel and Ethan Coen have done so much so brilliantly, but nothing more improbably wondrous than perma-wrapping a former 60s radical in a sweater and pajama pants and transforming him into an easy argument for the most iconic character in modern comedic cinema. So goes The Dude as he appears in ""The Big Lebowski.""Mixing the once-disparate ingredients of stoner flick, L.A. noir, and dark comedy with telltale signs of the classic buddy movie, it's likely the genius casting of Jeff Bridges as the leisure-adamant Jeffery ""The Dude"" Lebowski that most acutely prescribed greatness for this one-of-a-kind film. The opportunity for an iconic performance was sure to have gone unrealized if placed in lesser hands, and Bridges' nearly middle-aged, fully self-realized Dude is augmented by terrific fellow slackers of their own unique brands: Endearingly hostile Vietnam vet Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and the charmingly carefree Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi) conspire with The Dude to squelch the machismo-driven bowling game of convicted pedophile Jesus Quintana (a remarkable John Turturro). Yet when a pair of arm breakers mistake him for an L.A. fat cat who shares his Lebowski surname, The Dude seeks out this supposed ""Big Lebowski,"" and demands recompense. ""The Big Lebowski"" then begins its next-level ascent to wildly creative zeniths, mixing surrealist fantasy, bowling, and suspect private eye work into a joyously burlesque stew. We dial straight in to The Dude's laissez fare mindset as he wanders into an ensemble of wonderfully sketched characters placed throughout truly fascinating scenes.In interviews, the Coen brothers underplay what they must know they achieved with ""The Big Lebowski."" In Bridges' manifestation, we certainly see the idler -- but we also see the possibilities of a truly carefree existence realized by living comfortably in one's own skin. And that, perhaps, is this comedy's most aspirational of its many achievements. ""The Big Lebowski"" has a seat on the rug in the highest tier of uniquely great films.

A complete waste of time,"I am thinking to myself ""what are you people watching?"" for those who found this film in the slightest funny. This was bad, just plain bad.The only positive comment I would have is with Turturro's character. He is the sole standout. I found myself getting very upset and hating Bridges' and Goodman's characters. If this was the directors' motivation, then they succeeded big time. I think that the actors - Buscemi, Turturro, and Hoffman - all got lulled into a false sense by the success of the directors previous film - Fargo. What a shame and bad move. The film totally misses its point of being this off-beat quirky comedy. I can't say it enough, it was painful watching Goodman's character say the same stupid line to Buscemi – over and over.

Coen Brothers next best.,"As a big fan of the brothers this ranks as my second favourite Coen brothers movie. It is absolutely superb. When I first saw it I was laughing so much that I found myself wondering just what the hell it was all about. Then I watched it a few more times and wondered just what the hell it was all about. Actually, it is a very finely crafted movie even if it looks as if they were running out of film and just tied everything up in the last reel. I am so glad it came out on DVD as it gives you the opportunity to pick up other bits and pieces that seem almost secondary (well, actually they are but who cares). Like in the opening scene where the Dude's head is shoved down the toilet after he bashed his bowling ball against the door jam. If you notice the dent left is still there all through the film. It's a small thing but one that make the whole movie a gem. Jeff Bridges IS the Dude (and a biliiant piece of acting to explain to the Big Labowski that she (Bunny) kidnaped herself). Both Goodman and Stevie are perfectly cast and Johnny T. is just perfect as the Jesus. Like Stone's ""Any Given Sunday"", this movie bases itself in a sport for which I have no interest but, boy, what a movie. I have to give this 9 out of 10 as it is only the Coen's second best movie. The first is, of course, Millers Crossing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I HATED this movie the first time I saw it,"First time I saw it, I don't think I laughed a single time.  Then I caught it on tv a few times, bits and pieces.  Then I bought it. .

A scene doesn't go by where it doesn't have at least 2 levels to a joke, if not 3 or 4.  Caddy Shack, Fast Times, etc, doesn't touch it.

"Watch it for more than five times, and you will find out why.","The pacifist Jeffery Lebowsky (The Duder) finds himself in the middle of a crime scene just because he wanted his rug back. Walter, his hillarious Vietnam veteran friend, tries his best to help him, which makes the whole story a masterpiece. The story is a bit confusing because you are walking by the team. You know nothing more than what the dude knows. So, even if you can not make sense of the story at the end, do not worry at all Because it took the whole movie for the dude himself too to figure it out. Just watch it again and again.

"This is just my opinion, man.","Jeffrey Lebowski a.k.a. The Dude, has been confused by kidnappers as the husband of their victim who happens to have the same name, and as a result he's pulled into the mess against his will to clear his name and to get to the bottom of things. With the help of his slightly psychotic friend Walter (Goodman), they do their best to solve the mysterious event. And it all started with a rug that tied the room together...Jeff Bridges as The Dude here was simply an astonishing surprise to say the least. Never would I have pictured him or even felt he was capable enough to pull off this quirky character. Hats off Dude, and sorry for underestimating you. John Goodman's performance as Walter was another pleasant surprise as the hardcore Vietnam vet who cannot forget his buddies that died face down in the muck. There's a certain chemistry between the two that would have been all but impossible to foresee before getting started. The casting crew must've known something I didn't because it really makes the film.What more can be said of the Coen brothers? They simply know how to keep it simple yet extremely entertaining and wholly original. It is a rather short film but never lets up when it comes to the laughs and the characters. Definitely one of my favorite comedies of all time and I know I'm not alone. The dream sequences alone are worth the rental.If white trash, Vietnam vets, nihilists, bowling, and smoking jays sounds appealing to you...then this would be a wonderful addition to your film collection. No room for improvement. 10/10""You mind if I do a jay?""",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Making Vit Der Funny Schtuff,"""The Big Lebowski"" is proof a screenplay doesn't need a story to make it today. Just create a couple of oddballs who have gloriously fractured conversations about any sort of bizarre thing, throw in a bunch of random stuff and an eccentric supporting cast, and don't worry if the plot doesn't actually go anywhere. Think ""Caddyshack"" with more cursing, a perfect film for regurgitating around a water cooler rather than watching on screen.Jeff Bridges is the Dude, Jeff Lebowski, who because of some confusion with another Jeff Lebowski whose wife owes money to a sleazy porn merchant, finds himself the target of two toughs who ""soil"" his rug. Trouble accumulates as he seeks restitution and is recruited to help rescue the other Lebowski's kidnapped wife. Complications ensue when the other Lebowski's daughter seeks him out for a sperm donation, a gang of nihilists threaten his johnson, a detective trails after him in a blue Beetle, and stuff keeps happening to his car. The worst part is the constant interference from his bowling buddy, Walter (John Goodman), who sees parallels with Vietnam for everything, blows the ransom delivery, and butts heads with a rival bowler with a sex-offender past.I don't know, that doesn't read funny. But the movie is funny, especially when Walter and the Dude bicker. Getting this across from writing dialogue excerpts is not possible, not because of the profanity so much as the delivery, which is how it comes together. If comedic acting got the respect it deserves, Goodman would have been nominated for an Oscar; his Walter is a brilliant contrast of sudden rage and anal nitpicking (""The chinaman is not the issue here, dude. I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, dude. Across this line, you DO NOT... Also, dude, chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature. Asian-American, please."") Even Goodman's presence, wearing pus-colored sunglasses and a perpetual scowl under a buzzcut, is a marvel.But Goodman's brilliance is in how well he walks the fine line set by the Coen Brothers in a typically challenging film for actors. Bridges is very good, too, but Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Turturro and other good actors are so mannered they become annoying.Also, the story lines just kind of meander with no direction, like the Coens are ridiculing you for attempting to care about how any of it turns out. Did the Dude ever get a new rug? Did he and Walter win the match against Jesus the child molester? What the heck was the point of the cowboy narrator? If you care enough to ask such questions, it's like you are just the butt of the Coens' joke? Who's the %$&@ing nihilists here?The film's weaknesses are evident even in the moments that shine, like a trio of musical comedy numbers done to music by Bob Dylan and Kenny Rogers. They are witty, vibrant set pieces that come in out of nowhere and charge quickly into various cartoony bits, but then meander and drizzle away, lamely explained as acid flashbacks the Dude keeps having when he is knocked out. They don't add anything to the story, but in that sense, at least they are consistent with the rest of what's presented.The Coen Brothers remind me of the '70s jazz popsters Steely Dan, two arch standoffish types who are expert entertainers and creative geniuses but somewhat handicapped by their acerbic pose. They don't like being mistaken for someone who cares. The Coens have made some terrific films, like ""Raising Arizona"" and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and some overrated ones like ""Fargo"" and this. It's a film designed to make people laugh, and that's nice of them, but when one of the big jokes in the film involves casually killing off one of the good guys, you have to wonder whether the joke is really on you.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Another gem from the Coen brothers,"The best comedy of the nineties.I loved the characters, John Goodman excels as the agressive Vietnam veteran hellbent on 'helping' the dude. Steve Buschemi underplays his role perfectly, and of course Jeff Bridges wears the dude's character like a second skin. The dialogue is cracking, the Coen brothers really showing off their masterful ear for language. It is a privelige to see how every line is delivered and timed to comic perfection. Then theres the Coen brothers labyrinth plot of ( surprise!) kidnapping, ransom demands, sex...The film is very imaginative, loads of offbeat characters - the stanger, Maude Lebowski ( a vaginal artist!), and of course the millionaire Lebowski. Even the direction has the obligatory Coen brothers slant ( we see the world of bowling through the kind of devotion and attention that Scorsese put into American Pool in The Color of Money).In a world of dumb comedies grasping in futility at the most obvious 'jokes', The Big Lebowski shows just how, well er, big it really is.

The Best Comedy FilM in the Last 25 years,"The Big Lewboski is among the best comedy films of all time, kind of. It has a very disjointed storyline, and is, at times, hard to follow (or comprehend). However, the writer allows enough latitude for the actors to make it work. The casting of Jeff Bridges as 'Dude' is central to the movie. I can't think of another actor that could have pulled this off as well as he did. It really tied the movie together.The Dude seems not to want anything but to be left alone. The uncertainty presented to him as the result of a case of mistaken identity (maybe) shatters the warm comfort that 'Dude' has spent his life creating and maintaining. It makes him very uncomfortable, and causes him to react accordingly. Walter is the Dude's salvation. He forces the 'Dude' to pursue the source of his discomfort. The more that Walter exerts himself, the better it gets. John Goodman's heroic, manic performance gave the movie the only sense of stability in an otherwise chaotic circumstance presented to the 'Dude'. Both Walter and 'Dude' are pretty intelligent, introspective and spiritual beings in their own rights. They just don't know it.I have no idea what Donny was doing in the movie, other than to have Steve Buschemi die in yet another Cohen brothers film. The dialog is wild. The Big Lewboski yelling 'The Plane has crashed into the mountain', Maudes discussion of the effect of vaginae on men, and all of The Jesus' scenes, down to his purple jump suit (The Purple Jesus) are bizarre. Everything coming out of the 'Dude's' mouth is very funny. Like 'A Night at the Opera' and 'The Producers' good comic actors, presented with the right opportunity, can take it over the falls.

Sometimes there's a film sometimes there's a film.,"Now it was sometime in the year 1997, after the powers that be at the Academy of Motion Pictures and Science had decided to give a whole lot of recognition and awards to a film called Fargo, that a couple of boys named Joel and Ethan (though the most common nomenclature simply called them the Coen brothers) were thinking of making their next film. Now Joel and Ethan knew they had done well with their last film, that aforementioned Fargo, and they thought that their next film should be big. A big film. A film so big that it might as well have the word big in the title. And they - and we're talking about the Coen brothers here – well they just so happened to come up with such a motion picture, a picture which managed to be big as well as managing to be well outside of any range of conventional expectations. And that very motion picture happened to be one now known as The Big Lebowski.Or something like that. In fact, the Coens have, true to form, resisted discussing the inspiration for or meaning of what can still be considered one of their wildest, strangest and most inspired works of cinematic genius in as adamant and heated terms as the debates speculating on the film's 'true meaning' or 'purpose'. But part of the genius of the film is that whether regarded as a caustic political allegory (it is worth paying attention to the brief snippets of early 1990s American political news shown and referred to regardless), a loving and witty send up of all the conventions of a pulp, Raymond Chandler style film noir detective story (with a knowingly incomprehensible, convoluted plot) or simply a remarkably strange comedy, the film works. For whatever reason, the precise cocktail (a cinematic White Russian perchance) of absurdly quotable dialogue, inspired and memorable character bits, bizarre dream sequences, slow motion musical interludes and occasional dashes of self-reflexive profundity, all fused together by the impeccable technical double act of Roger Deakins' sumptuous cinematography and Carter Burwell's obtrusively resonant music makes for a work of strange, clunky madness and perfection which never quite manages to do what is expected of it or hit a wrong note, no matter what inferences or expectations the viewer brings to the table.But the film's true genius lies in the fact that, despite its guided bizarreness baiting analysis, the most gleefully likely 'point' is that the film, like the ongoing in-joke of its nihilist antagonists, is ultimately not about 'anything'. The entire enterprise can be seen as an extensive exercise in 'talking a lot but ultimately saying nothing', much like Sam Elliott's mysterious Stranger's priceless rambling of a narration. One almost dares to believe that the Coens' true joke is all of the speculation, controversy, debates over the film and religions derived from it being ultimately unwarranted, as the film was crafted with no such motivations, or ultimately any motivations at all. And ultimately, perhaps the most poignant point that can be extracted from the film is that it doesn't need a point, as entertaining as it can be to try to impose meaning on the strange and hilarious string of events passed off as a narrative. The film functions beautifully simply as a chance to hang out with some lovable, hilarious and very memorable characters, to experience the thrill of a mystery haphazardly investigated (with the viewer continually left as befuddled as the characters), to listen to some great music and to ultimately learn, much like The Dude, to simply accept the absurdity of it all and simply exist and try to get through. And again, whether such an absence of point is truly the most satisfying explanation of the film remains a moot point – no matter what lens the film is examined through, it has never been so enjoyable to enter the gleefully odd, remarkably stylized world of the Coen brothers and simply exist.But the film's true joy lies in its collection of eccentric characters and equally off-the-wall performances. Jeff Bridges has never been better, inhabiting the laid back, drugged up and haphazardly heroic role of The Dude with an uncanny ease and magnificent comedic timing – a perpetually watchable triumph of characterization. Consistent scene-stealer John Goodman is equally priceless as faux-Jewish, rage-filled Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak, a bellowing, stubbornly illogical yet strangely lovable satire of the crass yet well intentioned Western stereotype. Julianne Moore similarly generates a performance which is outlandish, flat out hilarious and hits perhaps a little too close to home as an absurdist feminist visual artist. David Huddleston rants, raves, screeches and bellows to sublime comedic effect as the titular industrialist The Big Lebowski, and Steve Buscemi transforms clueless yet lovable into a work of art as the continually ""out of his element"" Donny. But sheer magic can be found just as much in the supporting cast, with Philip Seymour Hoffman as obsessively prissy personal assistant Brandt, John Turturro as grotesque, purple spandex-clad, gyrating, former pedophile bowler Jesus Quintana, Peter Stormare as a deadpan nihilist porn star and Tara Reid as the compulsively greedy and promiscuous Bunny Lebowski along with the innumerable supporting bit parts each demonstrating exquisitely inventive and staggeringly funny characterizations, all excelling during their respective moments to shine.Without question the film will not prove fitting for all tastes, and complaints have been raised of its being self-indulgently alienating and strange, overlong and aimlessly rambling. Yet for those generally attuned to the Coens' incomparably oddball frequency, The Big Lebowski proves about as inventive, fresh, compelling and insanely comical (as well as potentially thematically provocative) as a film can get, and even the articulated complaints against it somehow manage to work more in its favour than detrimentally. One of the few films which visibly improves from an already high standard upon each viewing, The Big Lebowski remains a cinematic comedy masterpiece. And yes, the Dude abides.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Dude Abides,"For so many reasons this is one of the best comedies you will ever see. If you enjoy quirky movies and a movie that will take your mind for a wild ride this is it. The cast is amazing. John Goodman steals the show as Walter. Between the Dude, the Stranger, and Jesus there are plenty of strange and hilarious characters. The story takes one turn after another and is in true Cohen Brother's form. I have seen this movie many times and still laugh out loud. Walter and the Dude go on a quest to replace his rug, it really tied the room together. In the process the Dude finds himself confused with the Big Lebowski who sends the dude on a wild task. In this movie each new character seems to top the one you just meet. Watch this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Iconic Character, Peerless Film","Joel and Ethan Coen have done so much so brilliantly, but nothing more wondrous than perma-wrapping a former 60s radical in a sweater and pajama pants and transforming him into an easy argument for the most iconic character in modern comedic cinema. So goes The Dude in ""The Big Lebowski.""Mixing the once-disparate ingredients of stoner flick, L.A. noir, and dark comedy with telltale signs of a buddy movie, it's likely the genius casting of Jeff Bridges as the leisure-adamant Jeffery ""The Dude"" Lebowski that most acutely prescribed greatness for this one-of-a-kind film. The opportunity for an iconic performance was sure to have gone unrealized if placed in lesser-skilled hands, and Bridges' middle-aged, self-realized Dude is set into full motion by terrific fellow slackers of their own unique brands: Endearingly hostile Vietnam vet Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and the charmingly carefree Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi) conspire with The Dude to squelch the machismo-driven bowling game of convicted Jesus Quintana (a remarkable John Turturro). Yet when a pair of arm breakers mistake him for a SoCal fat cat who shares his Lebowski surname, The Dude seeks out this Big Lebowski and demands recompense. ""The Big Lebowski"" then begins its next-level ascent to wildly creative zeniths, mixing surrealist fantasy, bowling, and suspect private eye work into a joyously burlesque stew. We dial straight in to The Dude's laissez fare mindset as he wanders into an ensemble of wonderfully sketched characters placed throughout fascinating scenes.In their interviews, the Coen brothers underplay what they must know they achieved with ""The Big Lebowski."" In Bridges' manifestation, we see the idler -- but we also see the possibilities of a truly carefree existence realized by living comfortably in one's own skin. And that, perhaps, is this comedy's most aspirational of its many achievements. ""The Big Lebowski"" has a seat on the rug in the highest tier of uniquely great films. - (WATCHED IT?

David Huddleston's greatest movie.,"This movie is a cinematic masterpiece. It is excellent in all facets of the production. Jeff Bridge and John Goodman are absolutely wonderful in this offbeat yet engaging story about a man who is caught up in a case of mistaken identity. However, the actor who deserves special praise is David Huddleston who gives one of the more memorable performances as the guy who causes all the problems. In addition to the excellent cinematography, this movie is a tribute to the bowling alley and perhaps to all the humdrum places that we often take for granted. After all, how often has a bowling alley been used as a setting for comedy or drama? Yet, in this movie, that concept works. After all, where else would you expect to find a dude who likes Creedence Clearwater revival and drives a beat up car? Julianne Moore is great too in this movie as is the rest of the cast. This movie is a definite must watch for everyone who likes high quality entertainment.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Very rewarding, if you allow it to be,  thats just......y'know, my opinion man.","The Big Lebowski is a movie which requires repeat viewings, to appreciate the characters situations and the humour which comes from their reactions or lack thereof, to these situations.The Dude is a manipulated man, the Coens have manipulated a man, to whom getting up and going to the toilet is far more a concept, than a reality.They have placed a reluctant, anti-hero in the middle of a plot he is forced to participate in. The characters he encounters within the story manipulate him, all for their own selfish ends and many moralise at him whilst they are pursuing their own nefarious schemes.The Dude abides this treatment, either through inability to challenge it, verbally or physically or in some cases through lack of understanding he is being manipulated. But as he endures the films indignities, he never wavers and in the end returns to his normal pattern of living.Whereas the go getters, the schemers, the users, the pro-active people have all been undone by the own machinations, hoisted by their own petards. The Dude is vindicated in his lifestyle, by default.We are all asked to participate to some degree in our everyday lives in the plotting or social mores of others we feel we have to answer to, the Dude reminds us to step back from time to time and let the cards fall where they may.Control, through opting out, thats why we love the Dude and thats why the Dude, is the Dude !",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Never gets old,"""The Big Lebowski"" is not the funniest surreal comedy, but is at least the weirdest film noir I have ever seen. It has all elements of a ""The Big Sleep"" kind of investigation, but with the most bizarre characters and a grotesque sarcasm typical of late postmodern cinema. The humor comes from the absurd situations and especially the quirky dialogues, but, as with most black comedies, it's more of a chuckling quietly to yourself rather than laughing out loud experience. As a whole, the film felt a bit too episodical if not even pointless at times: the Coen Brother pointed out that the plot is not the focus, but they could have done at least a little better in that sense. Once the case gets abruptly resolved, there is really nothing that ties all the scenes together, however memorable each individual moment might have been. It's an inimitably stylish, fun, and imaginative film worth its cult status, but no matter how many times I watch it, it's not as hilarious and groundbreaking as all ""dudeists"" keep saying.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

One of the funniest movies I've ever seen: A triumph!,"Yesterday, I decided to watch this famous movie from the Coens, which they made after their brilliant ""Fargo"". I had not much expectations, because I thought it's impossible that they made another movie as good as Fargo. Indeed, it's impossible and it will always be impossible, but when one movie from the Coens is nearly as excellent as ""Fargo"" was, it's definitely ""The Big Lebowski"".This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Pretty sure, the great actors make the movie as good as it is. I'm speaking, of course, about the best Jeff Bridges we've ever seen and the most brilliant John Goodman we've ever seen. Steve Buscemi has not such a big part as he had in ""Fargo"", but, thanks to him, there is a wonderful ""Running-Gag"", which is getting funnier and funnier the more the we hear it.

Buscemi is spot on as always, and the plot is amazing.The problems with this movie lie not in the work itself; but in its audience.  A lot of people will not like this movie simply because the first view only yields chuckles and chortles here and there and there are dream sequences.

Its funny but also a mess,"My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****.I consider myself a fan of the Coen Brothers, I loved both Fargo and Raising Arizona. I found The Big Lebowski to be entertaining but it had a convoluted storyline. Does This make it a bad movie? Absolutely not, and this is because of the wonderful dialogue the Coen Brothers have provided for us.The acting is one of the strengths. Jeff Bridges is absolutely perfect as The Dude. John Goodman is hilarious as Walter. Steve Buscemi really doesnt do much except get insulted by John Goodman. Julianne Moore takes a different kind of role and does well.To enjoy The Big Lebowski, you must do one thing: Forget the plot. You will hate the movie if you try to figure out the plot. It is a mess of a plot. At one point it gets incoherent, but that scene is one of the best in the film.The Big Lebowski is not a masterpiece, in fact its even really far from a near-masterpiece stature.

John Goodman as ""Walter"" and Steve Buscemi as ""Donny"" steal the show, and they are involved in almost all of the movie's best scenes.  If you're offended by cussing, though, DO NOT see this.

This very well may be the best comedy I have ever seen,"In my short 25 years of life I have seen a decent amount of movies, missing out on some of the classics from before my time, however I would still say that for the right sense of humor this movie is nearly perfect.This movie is very dialog oriented, which to some extent necessitates that you get to know the characters to really understand why some things are funny. I personally loved this movie when I first saw it but probably would have only a given it an 8. The more you watch it however, the more your knowledge of the characters from the fist viewing build very quirky and nuanced personalities that make the characters very real and yet surreal. This makes it that much better, when you hear some of the comments because you know where they came from, just as if you heard of something that a friend did and depending on who that friend was, it makes their actions that much funnier.There are flaws in every movie, but what matters is do they bother you or not, and I don't remember any that do, and I have seen the film at least ten times. Each time just as good as the last, and this is what makes this movie so special is repeatability. You can watch it and start it over right afterwords and laugh just as hard.John Goodman should have at least been nominated for a best supporting actor as he is excellent in this movie as Walter. Also, John Turturro is excellent as ""the Jesus"" in a limited role. Other actors turn in very good performances as well. I think you need the right sense of humor for this movie to work for you, but everyone that I do know that likes it, loves it and that makes it worth viewing, because if it does work for you, you will understand where the genius is located in this film and you will love it as well.I won't mention any details about the film, because thats what the film is for and frankly if I tried to summarize it it just wouldn't do the movie justice.See it sometime when you're bored, and hopefully you will see what I see in what I still say is the best comedy of the 90's",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The Dude saved my life,"I'll try not to repeat what has been said in other reviews, but this is a special movie for me.  I had gone through a very painful breakup and I was utterly miserable for two months.  One night, I rented this movie (seeing it for the second time), I laughed my fool head off, and things got better again.  Perhaps The Dude's final line in the movie (which I won't give away) provided me with hope and perspective. This is one of those rare comedies that just keeps getting funnier every time you see it.  Jeff Bridges, who is so good at intense, brooding roles, has unbelievable comic timing here. Some criticize the plot as overly meandering, and it is.  But the film's aura is compelling, and you just want to go along for the ride.Like some other Coen Brothers films, The Big Lebowski takes the archetypes of a particular genre and spins them in an utterly unique way.  All of the staples of the film noir detective story are here:  the LA setting, the kidnapping, the aristocratic client, the easily enraged sidekick, the femme fatale, the miscreants and lowlifes who impede the progress of the case, etc.  However, the lead is not someone with  an unwavering sense of purpose as is usual, but the role is instead filled by The Dude, quite possibly the laziest person in the world.  As the expression goes, hilarity ensues. Since this is the Coen Bros., the humor is obviously not like most modern comedies in which vapid characters say and do stupid things in predictable ways.  The Big Lebowski keeps you off balance with loads of witty dialogue, plot twists, and gags that absolutely blindside you.  Seeing The Big Lebowski will make your life better.

Probably my favorite movie of all time,"There's not much that can be said about ""The Big Lebowski"" that hasn't already been said. Not only is it a hilarious tale of mistaken identity and personal greed, but it is a landmark film in terms of style, character, and philosophy. It is on a very short list of truly essential films from the 1990's, and stands up to as many viewings as you choose to throw at it.One particular shining star is the main character, Jeffery ""The Dude"" Lebowski, played by Jeff Bridges. A perfect embodiment of the slacker lifestyle combined with the Zen mentality, The Dude carries the picture as the unfortunate victim of external events (""All The Dude ever wanted was his rug back""). Full of hilarious lines and deadpan reactions, Bridges ensures that no scene is without insight and comedy (even Donny's ""funeral"").John Goodman is also a high point, turning in what is probably the best performance of his career as Walter Sobchak. A Vietnam vet holding a grudge against the rest of the world, Walter lends his unique form of support to The Dude. The scene with Walter substituting a ""ringer"" for the ransom money is one of the greatest few minutes of film I have ever seen. Goodman really dives into the character, delivering the little idiosyncrasies that lend unquestioned authenticity to the character.There are plenty of other notable performances, including Steve Buschemi as the slow-witted Donny and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the tight-assed Brandt.

What in God's holy name are you blathering about?!,"There's really only one good part of The Big Lebowski, but it's a REALLY good part. It's one of those scenes that you see in a movie and you tell your friends about it for years, you constantly spout off hilarious quotes from that scene that you remember laughing so hard about, you develop inside jokes about the scene with the friends who were lucky enough to be there to watch it with you, and you may even begin to regularly consume certain types of alcoholic beverages that you saw enjoyed by the main characters in that scene. The earth-quakingly memorable scene (indeed, as I said before, the only good scene in the entire film) is the one that begins immediately after the opening credits and ends approximately 117 minute later just before the screen fades and the end credits roll.Not laughing? To hell with you, that's funny! And the movie's even funnier! Every character in The Big Lebowski is developed perfectly to serve the purpose of the story. These characters truly have personality, especially The Dude ('Who the f**k IS this guy?!'), Walter ('Donny, you're out of your league!'), and even Mr. Lebowski's geeky assistant, Brandt. They may occasionally be stereotypical characters, but they fit perfectly with the story, augmenting it even though it's already complex and interesting. This movie has an excellent plot line that is punctuated with endlessly hilarious dialogue ('Donny, you're outta your element!'), and peppered with well-developed and interesting characters. Jeff Bridges delivers a spectacular performance as the Dude, flawlessly capturing the slacker attitude and lazy lifestyle that that character lives. His love for White Russians has made that drink a staple at my house, and is now among my favorite alcoholic drinks.Yeah, big accomplishment, but that's the kind of thing that makes a movie like this even better. As a college student, I can see the difference between the slacker life that I lived in high school, and the extremely busy one that I live now. The Dude has chosen to perpetuate that lifestyle, living his life on the couch and at the bowling alley, constantly dirt-poor but obviously perfectly content with himself. The only time he is even the slightest bit upset is when something disrupts that lifestyle and his rug gets ruined. Clearly, a nice rug is not something that a person in The Dude's line of work (i.e. unemployment) can easily replace. He is even almost completely calm when the guys break into his apartment at the beginning of the movie, and doesn't really seem to be too upset until one of them p****s on his rug.The interactions between The Dude, Walter (John Goodman), Donny (Steve Buscemi), and, eventually, the Jesus combine to make some of the most amusing moments of the film, but it is enormously entertaining from beginning to end. There cannot possibly be enough praise given to this movie to do it justice. Watch this movie, you are sure to love it. And if you don't, watch it again, because you must have missed something.

Good but not a classic Dude!,"I first watched The Big Lebowski about 12 years ago and i was extremely underwhelmed by it . I liked it , sure , but i couldn't see what all the fuss was about. Since then i have had a love hate relationship with the Coen Brothers movies. Some of their films i really have not liked such as O Brother, Where Art Thou? and The Ladykillers and recently i have enjoyed the likes of No country for old men and Burn after reading , so i decided to go back and watch The Big Lebowski again and see if , with age , i had become accustomed to their humour and the answer is yes....and no.Jeff Lebowski is the victim of mistaken identity. Two thugs break into his apartment in the errant belief that they are accosting Jeff Lebowski, the Pasadena millionaire--not the laid-back, unemployed, stuck in the 70s Jeff Lebowski who calls himself the Dude. The Dude's first mistake is paying a visit to his wealthy namesake in the hopes of getting a replacement for his soiled carpet. But instead of a Persian loaner, our reluctant hero and his buddy Walter are swept up in a Coenesque comedy/thriller of extortion, double-cross, deception, embezzlement, sex and dope. It takes guys as simple as the Dude and Walter to make a story this complicated...and they'd really rather be bowling.There is no doubt about it that The Big Lebowski has some memorable moments. The characters are fantastic . Jeff Bridges as the Dude , Jon Goodman as Walter Sobchak and John Turturro as Jesus Quintana are the standout performers and they have the best lines in the movie.

Goodman is also outstanding as the wannabe Jew who is highly strung and aggressive and again the role is perfect for him. Now for the problem with the film. The plot. I really feel the story is too weak and at times a little too confusing . I know that's maybe the idea the Coens had when writing this but it does spoil it a little for me. There are times when i felt myself drifting because it was becoming too convoluted. Also the Julianne Moore character seemed unnecessary and became another distraction. The best way to explain the way i feel about The Big Lebowski is that the characters are far too big for what is a pretty lame story and at times they swamp it. I'm glad i went back to watch this movie again but i still feel it's not quite justified in the admiration it still gets.I first watched The Big Lebowski about 12 years ago and i was extremely underwhelmed by it . I liked it , sure , but i couldn't see what all the fuss was about. Since then i have had a love hate relationship with the Coen Brothers movies. Some of their films i really have not liked such as O Brother, Where Art Thou? and The Ladykillers and recently i have enjoyed the likes of No country for old men and Burn after reading , so i decided to go back and watch The Big Lebowski again and see if , with age , i had become accustomed to their humour and the answer is yes....and no.Jeff Lebowski is the victim of mistaken identity. Two thugs break into his apartment in the errant belief that they are accosting Jeff Lebowski, the Pasadena millionaire--not the laid-back, unemployed, stuck in the 70s Jeff Lebowski who calls himself the Dude. The Dude's first mistake is paying a visit to his wealthy namesake in the hopes of getting a replacement for his soiled carpet. But instead of a Persian loaner, our reluctant hero and his buddy Walter are swept up in a Coenesque comedy/thriller of extortion, double-cross, deception, embezzlement, sex and dope.

Excellent! More than entertainment!,"This was just unexpected! Such an amazing movie! Now why you should watch with your friends...If you expect a comedy just to laugh then you shouldn't watch. This is more than that, this movie talks about life, about irony and simplicity. Through simple scenes, thoughts, camera takes, and great act you will travel from well developed light comedy to some deep thinking about the way you face stuff.The movie is about who is the dude way of life and nothing more, so lets get to it.The dude is a simple guy and was interpreted perfectly, flawlessly. Everything he does you do with him, you feel with him, you think with him. You can see that he is not a simple character, yet you can grasp him entirely. And the most important about his character is that he is believable, real. This put together make you feel you can be him, can feel light as he does. That is what this movie is about, is about you going inside it and taste the ideas. Is about you freeing your mind and absorbing the entire set. And this is also why you shouldn't watch if you just want to laugh.I really don't have much else to tell you, I would easily spoil it all. This is about the experience not about the opinions and i write reviews for you to decide if you would watch, not to talk about it after the movie.

"The best, by the best!","This is my #""/¤)&#¤ favourite movie of all time. It's about a guy, named Jeffrey Lebowski(but almost everyone calls him ""The Dude""), who has been mixed up whit another guy, that is also named Jeff Lebowski, he is ""The big Lebowski"". The big Lebowski's wife owns money to a porno producer, and then The big Lebowskis wife is kidnapped! The Dude is being the currier to the money that they are giving to the kidnappers (that is 1 million dollars), but The Dudes best friend Walter Sobchak gets the brilliant idea that they can keep all the money for themselves.The Coen brothers has made a movie that is impossible not to love, the characters, like The Dude(Jeff Bridges), Walter Sobchak(John Goodman), Donny(Steve Buscemi) and so on, is so original that you laugh at them, just by looking at them, and that i tell ya ain't bad, That this did'not won any Oscar is a big mystery. I now many people does'not think this, and i now that many people do think this, that this movie is better then Fargo(also made by Coen brothers), i mean Fargo was brilliant and it's also one of my favorites, but i think this is a little better, as i said, it's my #/&)&=& favourite!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Pure Gold!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is pure gold! I love this movie! First off it takes place in the early nineties. Anytime a movie takes place in between the years of 1970-1994 its got my attention. Its also a comedy. I am a comedy freak. I love comedy, comedy is my life. This is real comedy, the funny stuff. One thing I love about this movie that I haven't heard anybody else say is that the movie had thee perfect music to it. Fantastic music throughout the whole film. My favorite characters were The Dude (Of course) Walter and Donny. I am a fan of all three of the actors who played those parts, Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi. Poor Donny was always being told to shut up by Walter. The Dude was mixed up in the other Jeffery Lebowski's problems and Walter threw his undies out the car window and wants them back from those Nazis. Those three pal's sport was bowling. I've actually enjoy it as well. Some other people I had noticed in the movie were Tara Reid as Bunny, Dom Irrera as the driver and Jack Kehler as Marty. I'm also fans of them. To wrap this whole thing up I want to say if you haven't seen this movie and you want to see a great comedy about a guy whos just trying to get by in life, watch The Big Lebowski starring Jeff Bridges.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Absolute waste of good actors....,"I'm not going to waste time explaining the plot because its the bare minimum of what you can even call a plot to begin with....Seriously this movie has great actors in it, but they were obviously just after an easy cash grab when they all decided to accept their roles for this movie, because all their acting talents are just completely and utterly thrown into a trash compactor and squashed up into a tiny cube. Even Flea (The bass player from the chilli peppers) plays a small role in this but would have been much more worthwhile to just stick to being a bass player than waste time on idiotic side projects like this...Why this movie has the cult following it does is beyond me. It literally must be for people who like movies that require no train of thought and dialogue that's riddled with F-bombs, and there are plenty on display especially from John Goodman's character.And what was the point of this movie having a Narrator? Were the Coen brothers just testing the water for Tommy Lee Jones character in No Country For Old Men. They continually use Narrators in their films when they are films that FLAT OUT DO NOT NEED NARRATORS! It's supposed to be a movie, not a wildlife documentary. You're not watching an episode of David Attenborough so drop it with the god damn narrators!!!All in all, I simply can't recommend this movie, it's full of pointless dialogue, annoying characters, great actors that have been degraded beyond hell and a bunch of non funny jokes that just don't fit where they belong.

Perfect Pick-Me-Up,"If only I could count how many times this film has been able to cheer me up, I could probably only then begin to thank the Coen brothers for this gem of a film.  Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and John Turturro fit perfectly into their characters while a stellar cast of supporting actors (Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, Sam Elliot) give quirky and hilarious performances.  The script is possibly the best coen script to date.  I know there was a backlash when this was first released with people looking for Fargo 2 but in my opinion this is the better film. Ten out of ten in my opinion, but for those who are offended by a few hundred curse words I suggest you steer clear of this one and rent...i don't know...goldmember or something.

This is the Cohen brothers crowning achievement. Many films are predictable and formula driven. This movie is unpredictable, each time I see it I see something new.

And Steve Buscemi's character, Donny, is very funny as the innocent victim of Goodman's temper. I can not picture any other actors playing these characters, or the other characters for that matter. The Big Lebowski has an excellent plot, something that most comedies seem to lack. This is a must see movie that will have you repeating some quotes from the film to your friends on a regular basis.

One of my favorites ...all time classic to be,"Well , when i first saw it I missed many parts or little details which made this masterpiece so much funnier , the characters introduced are so unique and original I was really impressed.. Maybe because this was my first Coen/Coen movie it hit me hard.Dude Lebowski is so lazy that at certain points he can't even think what to say so he copies what George Bush says ,or writes a check for less than a dollar..?This movie in a way makes fun of Jews , Italians , Poles , Germans ,Swedes ,Greeks , Mexicans but not in a vulgar way .I really loved the attitude 'the dude ' had when someone broke into his house smashing the door while he was smoking pot in his bathtub ...' hey this is a private apartment ..' Or the fact that he drank everyday about at least 3 white russians.Then in comes Sobczak , the dude's buddy and bowl mate .This guy is absolutely played fabulously by John Goodman . He is so fixated about rules and these  'rules' have been fought for by himself and so many other ' good guys ..in Nam ' . This fixation is so strong that at a certain point he points a gun at a bowling contestant because he went ' over the line ' but claimed otherwise .Or the fact that he argues with ' autobahn ' nihilists that ' these are not the rules  ! ...without a hostage there is no ransom '.Anyway simply the idea of introducing a character like Sobczak who is a pole who was in Vietnam , lives in the states and pretends he's Jewish (because his ex-wife was ) but really is a catholic  is absolutely hilarious to me..All the characters in this movie are worth mentioning but space runs out !I'd conclude that this movie is a rare type of low budget , non-Hollywood-mega-project movie that to me is at a higher level than many action-packed , super-fx ,multimillionaire movies that are coming out these days . I'll certainly look out for more Coen movies...",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Pass the Popcorn review,"I, usually, don't watch the same movie several times. However, The Big Lebowski is a big exception to that rule. Very loosely based on real people and stories, this movie is full of details, subtle references and jokes. In fact, it's impossible to catch them all in just one viewing. Every time I watch this masterpiece, I always find something new. Thus, the Big Lebowski has the biggest re-watch value I've ever seen in a movie. Another astonishing thing is that almost all of the dialogue in the movie (besides one sentence that was ad-libbed) was written in the script. Which is fascinating since the F-word or a variation of the F-word is used 292 times; the word ""dude"" is used around 161 times and The Dude says the word 'man' 147 times through the movie. With these two elements in mind, there is no doubt that the Coen brothers are absolutely marvelous screenwriters. And The Big Lebowski is their best movie to date.The Big Lebowski is a movie about an everyday lazy hippie-like guy named Jeffrey Lebowski aka The Dude. His misfortune starts when two thugs, mistaking him for another man, also named Jeffrey Lebowski and who is a millionaire, enter his house and try to extort money from him. They also pee on his rug. When they eventually realise they entered the wrong house, they just pick up and leave. The Dude, furious about his rug being destroyed, decides to take the whole situation to the millionaire Lebowski. From this moment on, one complication after another erupts. And the Dude gets involved in all kind of activities. The movie's narration is very film noir-esque: the movie follows the Dude in every scene and he serves as the audience's guide through the story. As a matter of fact, the movie's plot and characters somewhat follow the classic novel/movie The Big Sleep.Since the movie's plot, just like the one from The Big Sleep, can get complicated from time to time, one may find oneself, during the first viewing, in a position where trying to follow every subplot means missing the small details that make this movie so perfect. Not that it is wrong, but in order to fully appreciate the appeal of The Big Lebowski, repeated viewings are an absolute necessary; especially since The Big Lebowski is ultimately a comedy and much of the humour is in the details. The characters also a very strong aspect of the movie. There is plenty of them and each and everyone is memorable and great. Like I said before, the characters, and some of the situations they get into, are based on real life people (and their stories) the Coen brothers met in their lifetime. This unusual combination of real life absurd situations and film noir structure is what makes The Big Lebowski so unique and enjoyable.The Big Lebowski really has a cult status, it is generally adored by both critics and the audience. It even has its own multy-city festival, Lebowski fest. It can easily be found on most of the best comedies of all time lists. It also spawned one of my favourite soundtrack albums (featuring names like Bob Dylan, Kenny Rogers, Captain Beefheart and Elvis Costello, among others). Speaking of music, the bassist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Flea, also has a role in the movie. And The Big Lebowski features a fictional German electro band named Autobahn, which is clearly a homage to Kraftwerk – I found that to be a really nice touch. The only problem I have with the movie is the opening narration by Sam Elliott, which seems too pointless and long and it never suited me. Besides that, everything is top notch. It's a definite recommendation. Now if you would excuse me, I have to go make myself a White Russian.Rating: 9/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
taking it easy,"The Dude is one laid back fella, who breezes through life without a care in the world - except for bowling. But when the Dude is mistaken for another 'Jeffrey Lebowski', well, the Dude has some serious thinking to do.The Coen brothers have come up with another gem of a movie, one which may appear slow moving and lazy, but is never anything less than entertaining. This is due to the hilarious dialogue, and some class acting, especially from John Goodman as Walter. Goodman has always flattered to deceive in his film career, but finally he shows how great a comedy actor he is. You can't help but laugh at some of his lines and mannerisms - ""Bunch of f**** amateurs"", ""You're entering a world of pain"", ""Donny, you're out of your element"" etc.Like all Coen movies, some of the jokes will be missed the first time around. If you're after a great slice-of-life comedy, then look no further. I remember this film wasn't that well received at the box-office, but in Empire (UK) magazine's list of 1998 best films, it managed to come 2nd.9/10.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The Big Lebowski is a classic, one of the Coen Bros. best, but only recently have I noticed more people watching the movie and enjoying it. I think as more people see the movie that they may have missed the Big Lebowski will gain more respect.

The Big Funny Movie.,"This movie made me review my opinion on comedies. I've always been a fan of horror and sci-fi, and not really been in to comedy.

The look on Jeff Bridges face, when he is covered in ashes is priceless....So to sum it up...to those of You lesser fortunate who hasn't seen this movie yet, see it-it's great.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Allegory For My Life,"Overtly based on Raymond Chandler's classic novel ""The Big Sleep"", The Big Lebowski is my favourite work from the Coen Brothers, along with Miller's Crossing. When released in 1998 cinema-goers were baffled by the film, with most viewers not being able to even gather an opinion. However, once the film was available for purchase a cult following began to emerge, which has given birth to the annual Lebowski Fest and a so-called religion named ""Dudeism."" The world of Lebowski has become an element of modern pop-culture, while Jeff Bridge's character ""The Dude"" has developed into an icon of apathy. His days are spent bowling, drinking, experiencing occasional acid flashbacks and delving in pacifism.Conducting an exhaustingly (and intentionally) complex tale of a trophy wife's kidnapping, The Big Lebowski puts fourth a crime story as a means of making everything about the picture even more ludicrous than its characters. You see, the Coen Brothers routinely craft films concerning characters that have become swathed in absurdist situations. This is an ulterior motive; a means of clashing wacky diversities with an impelling sense of convolution. The Big Lebowski is about characters that are blissfully unaware of the complications which arouse due to their erratic behaviour. Jeff Bridge's protagonist The Dude (a.k.a. Jeffrey Lebowski) becomes apart of a kidnapping plot by accident. He unwittingly stumbles across the scheme after a contextual naming error, in which two house-breaking thugs urinate on his rug. In response The Dude seeks compensation from the intended victim who happens to carry the same name, hence the confusion. As you can see, I am rambling and could do with a ""Caucasian"" cocktail.The Big Lebowski has been apart of my life for many years now; I recall lapping up the dialogue to such an extent that I would unintentionally quote the film during everyday conversations and I still do. This boils down to a screenplay which will retain its status as one of the finest ever written. By no means is the script artificial or plagiarised, instead the breathtaking originality of it came as a breath of fresh air to the QT-laden dialogue which circulated throughout the independent cinema of the '90s. Exemplifying imagination and entertainment is the aim of The Big Lebowski; dumb, half-witted nonsense is not what the film illustrates, as some people have wrongly accused it of being. Oh, and I must not disregard a clear and present fact; Jeff Bridges offers one of the greatest performances of all-time.Do not dismiss this masterpiece as a senseless twaddle, as that would be an unfair accusation for such a multi-layered outing in confrontational, elaborate humour. This is comedy as an art form, and so is conducted on an ambitious scale of subtly intelligent, foul-mouthed wit. Except this is a farce crafted on a mesmerising scale of ingenuity and radiating charm. Characters like Walter Sobchak, Donny Kerabatsos, Jesus Quintana and of course the German nihilists are irrefutable creations of hypocritical hilarity. Throughout the picture The Dude encounters a vast array of sarcastically written characters, which are effectively caricatures of combined personalities. Stylistically, the film is crammed to the brim with stunning film-making procedures (e.g. the Jackie Treehorn section) which accentuate the confrontational wackiness of what could be hailed as a ""warped homage to film-noir."" For a film of the '90s, the soundtrack is punctuated with retro rock & roll from forgotten eras and in essence identifies a ""hippy"" stance.It might be worth noting that this review is just my opinion, man. Even so, that should not stop you from viewing a film which is destined to be regarded as something not just of the '90s, but of today's culture, too. Remember: abide by The Dude's -rational, whether you like it or not- philosophies. Simply take each day as it comes and try not to live in the past, stranger.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Keep'em coming, Dude!","If Fargo is the highest point in the Coen brothers' filmography, The Big Lebowski comes in a close second: it's a perfect hybrid of fun, mystery, irony and pure insanity, Joel and Ethan's most explicitly entertaining movie since Raising Arizona, and by far more accomplished.The plot, loosely based on Raymond Chandler's works (the title itself is an obvious pastiche of The Big Sleep), revolves around a former hippie, Jeffrey Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), who insists everyone refer to him as The Dude or, in extreme cases, something like His Dudeness or El Duderino. To call The Dude an underachiever is a euphemism: he's never achieved anything, in fact he spends his days doing nothing besides smoking marijuana, drinking White Russians or bowling with his ""friends"" Walter (John Goodman), a Vietnam veteran with a life philosophy like no one else, and Donnie (Steve Buscemi), who isn't actually allowed to do much since everyone constantly asks him to ""shut the f*ck up"" (whereas in Fargo it was impossible to prevent him from talking).The Dude's quiet existence is radically shaken up when he is assaulted for no reason by two men who even take the liberty of peeing on his rug. As it turns out, they mistook him for another Jeffrey Lebowski, the one mentioned in the title, a wheelchair-bound millionaire whose young wife (Tara Reid) appears to have been kidnapped by a band of Nihilists (led by Peter Stormare). Add a sleazy pornographer (Ben Gazzara), the other Lebowski's artist daughter Maude (Julianne Moore), the mysterious stranger (Sam Elliott) whose voice occasionally comments on the story, a child-molesting bowling champion (John Turturro) named Jesus (""That's right! Nobody f*cks with the Jesus!""), some freaky dream sequences and several mix-ups and it's no longer very surprising that The Dude needs absurd quantities of booze and pot to accept what's happening to him.As a matter of fact, what happens is actually the least interesting aspect of the film: the noirish premise is nothing but a MacGuffin, a cheap yet brilliant excuse to make all those wonderful characters interact with the Coens' trademark exquisite dialogue, the best lines coming out of Goodman's mouth (""This is what happens when you f*ck a stranger in the ass!""). The fine ensemble cast gives life to a singular group of pederasts, pimps, private investigators and slackers, above whom Bridges towers with a humanity that makes you want to hug him on the spot. The Dude, a revolutionary at heart even when there seems to be nothing left to fight for, is the brothers' most relatable and endearing creation next to Fargo's Marge Gunderson, and it's no surprise: in the twisted Coeniverse, they're as normal as they come.Overall, pretty much a modern classic, like most of the Coens' films, and, despite its dark streak, a bit of a feel-good movie, thanks to its oddly sweet and charming protagonist. As The Stranger points out: ""It's good knowing he's out there, The Dude.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A subtle call for peace.,"Like many I'm sure, I've watched this movie so many times, I can quote nearly every line. Needless to say, it is one of the most entertaining and laugh-out-loud stories ever told. But, watching it again recently, I was struck by a subtle theme that I hadn't caught on to before: this movie is very seriously advocating peace, in our lives, in our relationships, and on the world scene. It's a little bit discomforting how this ""comedy"" unintentionally reminds us that we are still fighting in Iraq after over a decade. Not to espouse my political views or suggest that this is a political film, but this film does focus our attention (via the Walter character) on our collective obsession with violence and encourages us to reevaluate our situation from the Dude's perspective: our communication lines are breaking down, ""new information has come to light,"" and like many of the characters in the film, we should be asking, ""WTF are we talking about?!""

"Amazing movie, a must see!!","This movie is simply amazing. I've watched it for the first time in 1998 or 1999, and to be honest, I wasn't very pleased. I thought:It's OK,quite nice, but nothing special. Three years ago I watched it again, and I found it much better. But that wasn't still it.Finally I watched The Big Lebowski for the third time last year and I was really amazed.Maybe I could say ""third time's a charm"", I don't know, maybe I was to young in 1998 to understand and enjoy the brilliance of The Big Lebowski or maybe it's that kind of movie which keeps getting better and better each time you watch it. It is one of my favorite movies, there's something magical about it.You can watch each single scene over and over again and not get bored. The dialogues are hilarious,but I am aware of the fact, that not everybody would like that kind of humor, but I just love it! Magnifficent performance from all actors, especially Bridges, Goodman, and Buscemi.But supporting Seymour Hoffman, Stormare or Moore are outstanding too. I' ve read that when Cohens wrote the script they had all these actors in their mind and You can see it on the screen! Simple ""A must see""!But of course, you know, that's just like my opinion man...Anyway the Dude abides!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Best first 75% movie ever!Worst last  25% !,"This movie is like a hot air balloon caught in a cyclone.  It is great to watch at first.  Every twist and turn is a delight and offers all sorts of unsuspected surprises.  You will gasp and laugh out loud.And then, during the last quarter of the movie, it blows itself inside out and the laughs, surprises, and the plot just vanish into thin air.  A real let down!  Poor and struggling beyond belief!A fantastic movie to watch with your loved one if you have no intention of watching it to the end.  Great for the laugh and feel good factor that leads you to the remote so you can abandon Hollywood and find your own moment of truth before the movie goes pear shaped.Follow my advice with this movie movie, especially your timing,  and you will get it all just right!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I Never Thought Perfection Would Be So Funny!!,"Before I met ""The Dude"" and the rest of the cast I wasn't sure if the Coen Brother's could ever top their Citizen Kane(Fargo). After watching ""The Big Lebosky"" I found out just how talented these writer/director's were. The Big Lebosky is a genre trend setting masterpiece. With dialogue so close to perfection I would not change a single sentence. This is a movie of pure clever genius and has tremendous replay and stay power. Mark my words when I say: You can watch it a million times, and you will never get sick of it.The story begins with the raspy southern drawl of ""The Stranger""(Sam Elliot) preparing us with narration as the ever schlepped ""Dude"" (Jeff Bridges, Jeff Lebosky) isreturning home from buying some milk at the grocery store.Upon arriving home he is greeted by a couple of Jackie Treehorn's (notorious pornography producer) looking for ""Jeff Lebosky"" After realizing that the""Dude"" was not in fact the right ""Jeff Lebosky"" (and one pee'd on rug and thus plot set up later)The Henchmen exit. Thus we are brought along on one of the funniest and darkest tales of redemption, slacking, anger, mistaken identity, and league bowling! I can honestly say the best ride of my life was on the not so righteousand lethargic tale of ""The Dude"" While he tries to seek reparation for the ""soiled upon rug"" in his living room, and finds himself in the midst of doing so, getting involved with so many different forms of deception, unwanted responsibility and paranoia as The Dude agrees to act as courier when the other millionaire ""Jeffery Lebosky's""(David Huddleston) kidnapped trophy wife ""Bunny""(Tara reed) allegedly gets kidnapped.Needless to say The Dude is in well over his head and Murphy's Law soon becomes reality to the motley crue of characters .This movie is so cleverly written you wonder just how the plot gets pulled off with such grace. And the answer to that question lays in the A. The dialogue B. The character development And C. The amazing acting from the entire castAs also starring ""Walter Sobcheck""(John Goodman) ""Theodore(Donny) Karabatsos""(Steve Buscemi)""Maude Lebosky""(Julianne Moore)Guest starring ""Jesus Quintana""(John Turtorro) ""Brandt""(Phillip Seymour Hoffman)ETC.And all these actors, no matter how small the part all make a juxtaposing impact On the all around greatness factor of this films hilarity and tightnessBut make sure you relax your face muscles the night before watching this moviebecause the best of the best in my personal opinion comes from ""The Dude and Walter""(Bridges and Goodman) as ""The Dudes"" Pacifism mentality counteracts with the Ever un predictable and over steam headed Vietnam veteran ""Walter Sobcheck""(Goodman)who will take any chance he can get to turn a conversation into reminiscing about his life in the war. With that being said Also turning in an unforgettable performance is ""Julianne Moore"" as ""Maude Lebosky"" the daughter of millionaire business man ""Jeffrey Lebosky""(Dave Huddleston)The on screen chemistry between these cast members is extremely memorable and sometimes confrontational, but always entertaining and clever. When you view it for yourself, You'll find yourself quoting and watching in awe,as these actors quickly become your bowling buddies and transform the silver screen into pure gold. this masterpiece of satirical cinema will intrigue your intellect and challenge your sense of humor and boundaries as The Big Lebosky will invade your personal space by remaining in your mind and everyday references of the films idiosyncrasies will become adjacent to your vocabulary. Pare all that with the groundbreaking camera work and all star soundtrack and you have a film that comes as close to perfection as you will ever find.All in all and pound for pound ""The Big Lebosky"" is a 10! A true Timeless piece of film. The Coens Sistine Chapel if you will.So ""Ever thus to the deadbeats"" that choose not to enjoy!!But hey "" that's just like... My opinion man!""By Anthony S.

"Simply put, this IS the movie that defines the 90's","Like I said in the summary, simply put, this is the movie that defines life in the 90's. The Dude, as the narrator so eloquently puts it, is the man for his place and time. Although he defines laziness, and The Dude is lazy, he is a hero. But what is a hero? I'll stop stealing lines from the movie and just say that this is one of the best put together movies of all time. It is a cult classic and I can't imagine why it's not more mainstream, but it is clever, original, and I must say that John Goodman as Walter Sobchak is one of the best characters to ever grace the big screen. If you've seen this movie, I'm confident you'll agree. This is one of the few films that can be silly and real at the same time. To put it bluntly, this is a must see if you haven't seen it, and if you have, watch it again; it only gets better!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Time and Place for Everyone; Even the Dude,"Intruders break into the modest Los Angeles apartment of Jeff ""the Dude"" Lebowski. He is roughed up, money is demanded of him that he does not have, his head is unceremoniously swirled in the toilet and the toughs threaten to return, but they have the wrong Lebowski! This simple case of mistaken identity leads to a comedy of errors involving a kidnapping, a million-dollar ransom, Jesus in a purple bowling suit, a duffel bag full of dirty undies, an attack ferret and even a spicy bowling themed dream sequence. The Dude is inept, lazy and hopeless, but there is a time and place for everyone. He is in way over his head, yet so is everyone else.
 
20 years after its release and the film still one of my all-time favorites. It was my first Coen brothers film. Their brilliance and originality is instantly recognizable. The story and characters are full of delightful depth and details, the writing is witty and consistently dazzling, there is never a dull moment, and on top of everything it is really, really funny. At times I could hardly breath I was laughing so hard. Among such moments is the confrontation with the ferret, the parking lot skirmish heart attack and the bowling rants and taunts of Jesus.
 
Finding balance is one thing the Coen brothers excel at. Each character has offsetting strengths and weaknesses, every setting is shown in wondrous light as well as the shadows, and nothing is beyond reproach. No one and nothing is put on a pedestal, or trashed without a fair fight. The casting of Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John Turturro is brilliant. The Coens have such amazing insight into the American character; rich and poor, country and city, women and men, and cultured or not. They cut across boundaries, religions, philosophies, regions and political persuasions, and they do it seamlessly and randomly as a tumbling tumbleweed and as unlikely as a bowling alley prophet!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Still as fresh as when I first saw it,"I had the luck of seeing The Big Lebowski during a sneak preview in late March of 1998 here in Belgium. The room was packed, and afterwards applause erupted. The entire audience stayed seated and clapped until the final credits rolled. Since then I've seen it numerous times. I introduced my little brother to it when he was 14, only for it to become one of his favourite movies too. Quotable, quirky, quintessentially Coen. 10 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
surrealy excellent,"yet another masterpiece from the coen brothers which I possibly their best! The film is about a case of mistaken identity for the 'Dude' (Jeff Bridges, perhaps the best character ever created) Lebowski which results in someone peeing on his rug and such a trivial spiralling off into a whirlwind of wacky adventures which is expected from the coens. The 'Dude' and Vietnam vet. Walter (John Goodman) who thinks he is Jewish, are the main characters and are great fun in the movie and of course the mostly ignored Donny (Steve Buscemi). the acting, writing, directing and somewhat bizarre cinematography are amazing, if you like creative drama- comedies watch this film, if you don't watch it anyway.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Big Slap In The Face,"I don't hate this film. I don't like it either. For me, it just kind of exists. It's understandable though why so many people enjoy this picture. There are quite a few chuckle worthy moments and the characters are quite funny in how quirky they are.The actors are rather charming and the Coen brothers are good directors. However, that doesn't make up for the fact that this movie adds up to nothing. Random events happen for no good reason, many of the characters are completely pointless and even the story is unnecessary as well. It starts off with this unique crime plot about ""The Dude""-a lazy bum-who gets mistaken for a millionaire with the same name as him. The Dude then gets caught up in this convulted scheme by German nihilists to blackmail the millionaire by holding his trophy wife hostage. But by the end of the flick I realized that absolutely nothing was at stake. I don't want to spoil it so I will just leave it at that. I don't mind if a story just wants to meander around aimlessly. Alice in Wonderland does that but at least there's a reason for it, they are in a dream like world that makes no sense. Here, they set up this world like its flesh and blood reality where things are run by rules and regulations but then some things will happen out of nowhere and lead to nothing-like the plot. You can't have a world run by both chaos and order. It just doesn't make any sense. That's The Big Lebowski. It feels like the whole movie is a big joke the Coen brothers are pulling on the audience. You are given a tour of strange characters that are tied together by a overly complicated plot that meant nothing in the end. I wouldn't recommend this unless watching a bunch of walking character quirks stumble around for an hour and a half sounds like fun to you. And if you do, don't worry you aren't alone.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Very Good, But the Ending is Weak","If the movie ended about 10 minutes early, it would have been excellent. I'm sure some people would disagree with me, but I felt that the last 10 minutes were a waste and brought the movie down. Other than that it's a great movie. The Coen brothers always end on a bittersweet note, that I feel is unnecessary and manipulative. It's like they are compelled to constantly pull the rug out from underneath you.In spite of this, this movie is extremely well made. The dialogue is hysterical (""Is this your homework Larry?""), the dream sequences are clever, and ""The Dude"" character is inspired. If you like this film you might like ""Jackie Brown"".

My Absolute Favorite Movie Ever,"This is a movie that (for me) can be watched over and over and over again and still find tiny details that you never noticed before. This and Fargo are my favorite Coen brother movies because of the environment around them affects the story. Now I know you can say the same thing about other Coen brother film or any film for that matter, but for me the snowy wasteland of Fargo, North Dakota and the suburban by day neon by night oasis of Los Angeles really make the films what they are (and in my perspective masterpieces!). Jeff Bridges famously plays his role to near perfection and in my opinion makes all of his other roles obsolete. This means whenever I see him in another movie as a different Character I only see him as the iconic role that he nailed in 1988. The Big Lebowski is my favorite movie and I recommend to anyone and everyone",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
So Gooooood!,"Overall I thought The Big Lebowski was a very good film in so many ways, rightfully earning its cult status amongst fans.The Coen brothers did a tremendous job in balancing the humour with the intense narrative, both which worked to great effect. The performances from both Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are some of the best I've seen in a comedy, once again it's easy to see why this film is adored by many. The script offers so many quotable words and lines and The Dude (played by Bridges) is the perfect character for this sort of script to thrive off.The supporting cast also with Julianne Moore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (God rest his soul) and Steve Buschemi all offered their class here. This is a film that has only gotten better with time and I loved all aspects of it.We should all channel our inner Dude and go bowling a little more.

I am down with Fargo, which seems to be the other popular fan favorite for the Coens, but it is still 4th best at best.

And the Dude is saying how he lost money today and how he was in a bad mood earlier. It's still in the beginning of the movie. I think it's right after he was with Maude Lebowski, and after getting out of this limo he gets forced into another limo finding the old lebowski and brent.

Another gem from the Coen brothers,"I'm not sure if I can add to what's already written. This is just a great comedy.

The Dude Abides...,"No matter how many times I see this movie, it never gets old. At this point, I've easily seen it more than half a dozen times and I STILL find myself laughing throughout. This movie was my first exposure to the Coen brothers and it hooked me. Set in 1990's Los Angeles, the film follows the Dude, an unemployed stoner with a passion for bowling, as a case of mistaken identity and a soiled rug lead to his involvement in recovering a kid-napped woman. Honestly, that little synopsis doesn't do the film justice and it'd really be best to just watch it.The characters are what make this film so memorable. Jeff Bridges as the Dude, what can I say. Since seeing him in this movie, I haven't been able to picture him as anyone else (made it interesting seeing him as the villain in Jon Favreau's ""Iron Man"", heh). He totally embodies this character, with his chilled demeanor and stoned investigating. Stealing the scene almost as often as the lead is John Goodman as the Dude's buddy, Walter. A Vietnam veteran who can't help but regress to 'Nam rants every time something grates on his nerves, Walter's attempts to help Dude in his predicament only make matters worse. These two characters alone (with, of course, credit to the fantastic writing of the Coens) fill the movie with infinitely quotable dialogue.Supporting Bridges and Goodman are a myriad of great talent. Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, Peter Stormare, Sam Elliott, and Philip Seymour Hoffman contribute to film though the one of the best supporting characters has to be John Turturro's Jesus Quintana. Despite only being in two scenes, his role as the pedophile bowler made for one of the best moments. My absolute favorite sequences in the movie have to be the Dude's hallucinations/dream sequences, particularly the GUTTERBALLS number. A great soundtrack, wicked casting, sharp writing, and constant laughs give this movie infinite replay value and it'll never get old.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Movie of the Year,From the very first frame this film just screams coolness. John Goodman's vietnam vet is the best thing i've seen in a cinema since Leo DiCaprio drowned.

I wholeheartedly recomened this film to any one with a brain.,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"There are uptight folks out there who don't get it, but they will.  Or not.","For fun, I wondered who would give this film a no star. I find it fascinating that when I see a great film and others see a terrible one, a Battlefield Earth, what causes the discrepancy? Is it perhaps they're humorless or lack the capacity to ""get it?"" The investigation was interesting. The reviewers seemed articulate much of the time and not mere trolls. Yet, they hated the Dude. The whole thing. Every character. They were bored. They felt it was stupid.So perhaps here's why a few people can't ""get"" the Dude: They just don't like him. They didn't like the characters. The nihilists ordering ""piggie in the blankets"" or a Vietnam vet whose converted to Judaism and watches his ex-wife's dog. The film has a wonderful backstory that invites you to fill in the gaps with similar characters in your own life and fiction. It's full of rich details but if you don't like one, or more, of the characters, then it's like listening to colleagues you dislike at work prattle on about their facebook posts. They don't get it and don't care and just want to leave.The genius of the film is that many people who don't see the humor on the first viewing a few years later see it again, perhaps on TV as their spouse or friend is watching it, and realize: ""I missed that the first time around. That's pretty funny and insightful."" Then they watch some more. Then more. Then they're hooked.The Dude is not for the faint of heart. You would NOT want the Dude to move in with you. He'd burn down the house because he forgot to turn off the oven but, hey, stop being so fascist about it will ya? But even if you want some distance between you and him, you come to love him and his troupe of characters that are simultaneously stereotypes, both in fiction and real life, and at the same time unique characters in their own right. The Dude says you need to stop being so uptight, relax, and get it. Or not. And when someone gets uptight and doesn't get it, they don't get it. And they are the ones who write 0 star reviews of this film on IMDb.A few years down the road, they'll have a few drinks in them and relax and watch it and then they'll change. Maybe they'll fix their 0 star IMDb review. Maybe they'll apologize to the Dude but the Dude is OK with that. He has far more important things to do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

What I enjoyed most I think about the film was its unpredictability in subtle ways.  I really had no clue from scene to scene what would happen.  A wicked sound track, totally fitting for the theme and pace of the film, no matter you're state of mind you'll be well pleased with its levity and gravity.  Without delving into each character it developed each, and gave you a feeling you knew each much deeper.   I don't think you'll see these actors in roles unlike this in any other film you see with them, that fact alone was really something wild.

I will always regard this film as one of my favourites,A film buff friend of mine recommended this film to me some years ago and his opinion is generally quite sound. This is the sort of film that I could watch every week and still find it superb entertainment. The film is an absolute barrel of fun throughout and the cast and crew together with the Coen brothers have produced a masterpiece. When the Monty Python experience came along in the late 1960's my dad and I used to watch it together. I was almost always helpless with laughter whereas my dad had various expressions on his face from bewilderment to boredom and suffice to say he never did not see the funny side of Python. This is another instance where he would probably be watching this film with a stony face unable or unwilling to grasp what would be so funny to me. Yes there is violence and sexual content but in my opinion it is all in context and not gratuitous but thats just my two cents. Like in a lot of other comedy films you either like them or not and I suspect that there are quite a number of people out there who just cant tune into the humour. I am fortunate in that I can tune in and apart from anything else this film stands on its own and not just a comedic exercise but as a fun story with a reasonable plot told in an unique way. I would highly recommend anyone watch this film because in my opinion there is so much to like and hopefully if you tune in you will not be disappointed,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Don't waste your time,"I am shocked that this movie has received such glowing reviews. I am more shocked that I watched the entire movie. I am shocked that Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, who have had such exceptional roles in movies and TV would lend themselves to this movie. Acting was so over the top in the pursuit of lampooning stereotypes, that I failed to see the humor. I suppose some of the action was meant to be slapstick but only seemed stupid. The movie was so gratuitously laced with obscenities throughout that it seemed to serve no purpose and lost its shock value after the first couple of minutes. The only redeeming value of this movie are some of the interesting camera shots like the bowling ball cam and some of the hallucinatory dream sequences (and the soundtrack). The Coen brothers have been asked if they came up with this storyline while under the influence.

In a world where we try to over-rationalize everything until we don't realize we're creating an altogether new problem which is a byproduct of an already existing issue, 'The Dude' makes everyone else look like a cartoon character or a caricature. To quote what the cowboy said which is basically we all need a hero for its time and place, or I don't know, I kinda forgot what he said. Umm.. Something to that effect.What makes the movie great is you see this guy who gets placed in this sticky situation and how he gets tangled up with all these characters being the opposite with the obvious, Walter, who happens to be his buddy. To see these characters tick is just plain hilarious. And what is also great is watching The Dude just floating through every conversation and every conflict inadvertently making almost everyone else out to be taking themselves too seriously. I did not see the point about the film the first time due to being delirious from working, but upon my second viewing of the film, I found it funny in a way that resonated with my outlook on life.I think we all yearn to be stoic in the same manner as The Dude, especially in a world in which a lot of people have their head stuck up their asses. To take no bullshit without feeling the need to protect a huge ego is an attribute that everyone should try to aspire to. 'The Big Lebowski' to me is not only a great comedy, but a great film that feels so human and I cannot help but smile with laughter and feel a sense of warmth from watching it. When there are so many characters in movies that feel like they are from an unattainable fantasy dream, we cannot help but alienated from them, and to have a film like 'The Big Lebowski' to bring these characters back down to a human level makes a movie that feels like real life, and at its core, is what makes this film a classic and a film that has a home in my heart forever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Coed Brothers Classic,"As it always goes for The Coen Brothers the visuals created are usually breathtaking, surprisingly for this dark comedy its no different. The subtly of their humor is always on point and they never seem to have to try that hard. No matter how many times i watch this i seem be wholly interested in the story. Jeff Bridges is here in his most iconic role and the addition of John Goodman is perfect, their chemistry is phenomenal. Its really the dialog and acting here that makes this film great and it never gets boring, some of the best writing The Coen Brothers have done. The Big Lebowski as a whole carries itself with such style thats really lacking in movies today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Modern Classic,"The Big Lebowski is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Seemingly pointless, it combines several methods into a sly blend. It's a comedy, but also exhibits western and noir attributes as The Dude navigates his entanglements. Meanwhile, the film sneaks in relevant social and political classism critiques. Plus, this is all unified by spiritual messages of surrender. These ingredients could've been messy, but the Coens find balance, subtly suggesting themes with potent details. Furthermore, the cast wholly embodies their eccentric characters. Thus, The Big Lebowski is a thoughtful journey that, fittingly, can be enjoyed without noticing its undertones.Technically, The Big Lebowski has cunning style. The precise direction captures an outlandish atmosphere and nonchalant tone. It rarely feels overtly artistic, yet there's a lurking sense of deeper meaning. The visuals provide hypnotic transitions, elaborate dreams, and dramatic montages. These moments are further supported by careful editing, which also keeps the runtime tight and punctuates comedy. The sound is symbolically abstract, the production is iconic, and the effects heighten the surrealism. Lastly, the music fuses humor with thematic weight. Overall, The Big Lebowski is a joyful and deceptively substantial experience, definitively earning its modern classic status.Writing: 10/10

A Film that really ties the room together,"When the world ends, and the world council are deciding which films are to be taken into space for preservation, this will surely be one of them. The Coen brothers truly are blessed with a talent so rare- the ability to make film after film, and have everyone be different.Try watching Blood Simple, Raising Arizona and Millers Crossing in a row and try to find any clues that they are made by the same people.This though, is while probably not the best film they have ever made (that accolade falling on either Millers crossing or Fargo) it is surely the  funniest and most entertaining.The great characters that the Coens seem to be able to pluck out of thin air are here in abundance, and even characters who have less than ten minutes screen time seem to be wonderfully fleshed out (most notably John Turturro's hilarious Jesus.)Jeff Bridges is The Dude, a man who has never achieved anything (apart from a brief stint as road manager for the Grateful Dead-who are apparently a bunch of assholes) because he's never tried. Happy to drift through life as a nobody, with only two friends in the whole world and a predilection for smoking grass.He is completely harmless, and so when he is suddenly thrown into a chandler-esque tale of kidnapping, carpet p***ing, nihilism, pornography and bowling, it is a mark of the Coens genius that they can stop it from being completely ludicrous and make this the first ever farce where the audience cares deeply about the man, The Dude.Jeff Bridges proves that he is either one of the greatest actors of his time, or a great raving pothead.The sense of confusion that comes from him is so real, he appears to be so helpless, that it is heartbreaking and side-splitting at the same time.He obviously needs help, needs to be guided through this, by a friend who comes in the shape of Walter Sobchek (John Goodman) the most inept, bumbling war veteran ever.Best summed up by The Dude himself (One of these days your'e going to have to accept that your'e a goddamn moron)Walter despite his best intentions ends up hurting the Dude more than he ever helps him, inadvertently dragging his friend deeper into the hole (I could have just been sitting here with p*** stains on my rug).With a plethora of other great oddball characters (Donnie, Maude, the titular Big Lebowski,the wonderful Jesus Quintana)the film merely reinforces the Coen brothers as truly great american film makers, who have made nine films and never a bad one, long may they rule.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Good Comedy With Iffy Rewatch Value,"The Coen Brothers already made a name for themselves after the release of their film's like Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, and most recently Fargo in 1996 at the time. So when The Big Lebowski came out I'm sure they were all over this film. The film is in no way bad, but it's definitely a movie that isn't for everyone. Besides the strange characters, the plot is equally as weird and is a little hard to elaborate. But really, the film is one to laugh out loud too. Both leads in this film are portrayed fantastically and are very funny when on screen alone and simultaneously. Bridges' character ""The Dude"" is one of the best characters in any Coen Brothers film.When it comes to Jeff Bridges, I don't know a lot. I do like him for his underrated role he played in K-PAX, but this is only, I believe, the second film I've seen with him. He's great at doing a Comedy film. When he gets into character with the LA slacker accent he can be a thrill to watch. He drops some funny one liners in this picture and is also accompanied greatly by John Goodman who plays Walter. When the duo appear on screen the laughs keep coming and coming and the humor rarely lets up.The plot involves an unmotivated slacker nicknamed ""The Dude"" (Bridges) demands Jeffrey Lebowski (The Big Lebowski) to give him a new rug after his was urinated on by two robbers who were looking for a person by the same name as ""The Dude's"" (Jeffrey Lebowski). His request is declined but he is contacted again when Lebowski's trophy wife is kidnapped and after a series of events The Dude and Walter must return the ransom in order to get the wife back.The Big Lebowski isn't really my type of film. The Coen Brothers never were my type either. I was never really into their films and am into a much more different tone of Comedy. This Comedy, while being well done and funny, is also a little bit of annoying too because of how long it is. The movie could be trimmed around maybe twenty minutes in my opinion. It doesn't need to span close to two hours. Sort of reminds me of Dinner for Schmucks how it almost runs two hours to say that since it's long it's better. Not true for any movie.One of TBL's high points are the character performances by John Goodman and Jeff Bridges. Both characters are insanely funny and very amusing to watch on screen as well. I am really fond of ""The Dude"" character and he throws in very amusing and clicking lines in the films as well. I enjoyed the end scene and the way the movie ended too. I guess what I'm trying to say is that The Big Lebowski has ups and downs, but really, it's a movie you need to try out. It may not be for everyone, but it does have it's share of humor.The last thing I need to say is this is a film I don't think I'd watch again. Various films I've reviewed recently I've went back to and rewatched again for the hell of it and some movies I even watch for an occasional third time. Naked Fear I've watched once more since I reviewed it and I gave Eve's Beach Fantasy another try and couldn't make it through the first ten minutes. I don't know if I can watch this film again just for the hell of it because I believe I got the full entertainment value the first time around. While it's well made, I'm sure I'll come back to it in later years, but not anytime soon, but clips I can assure you will be revisited. The Big Lebowski is a highly enjoyable film. While not being what I expected, it still had a great cast and various scenes with lots of humor. I think I can say, it certainly does abide.Starring: Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, and Julianne Moore. Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
So flippin' good.,"In spite of how brilliant this movie is, so few of my friends have ever seen it. I have never been in so many situations where my movie quotes have had to been explained. Clearly, this movie deserves far more recognition. It's the story of how a dude's rug gets pee'd upon and the cascade of events that ensue because of it.One of the great things about the movie is that when you are watching it, you know that there is something more than simply the story of a dude and his rug. Speaking of the dude, Jeff Bridges provides an iconic and by far the best performance I have ever seen from him. He is such a laid- back character who garners respect from all his comrades. You really can't help but sympathise with him. He spews some of the best lines heard EVER! John Goodman also plays one of the most memorable characters in existence. I feel that that is the thing that makes this movie so incredible. It's characters are immeasurably memorable (even Donnie who does almost nothing). I am going to need surgery to remove the memories of the movie (but I won't because it's excellent).Hmm let's see negatives. What did this movie do wrong. Perhaps you could argue that some of the characters come to nothing but you would be foolish because it all culminates with the brilliant line 'the dude abides'. It shows that so much has happened that at this point, Jesus (the bowler) doesn't to him. The investigator guy doesn't matter to him and most certainly the teenage car thief doesn't matter to him. I am really struggling here to find things wrong with this movie. The biggest criticism I have is on a purely mood scale. This movie is only watchable if you're in the mood for really thinking about a movie. If you're not just watch Anchorman.Clearly, I struggled finding anything wrong with this movie. There is so much to enjoy with the film and I am amazed that I had never watched it prior to a few weeks ago. Even saying it's great to think about deeply can be debunked. There is enough humour and captivating story for you to passively watch it. Just stop reading this review and go to Amazon. Buy the movie. Watch it as soon as possible.

A rare good comedy,"I know a lot of people who hate this movie.  I don't understand those people, but, what can I say?  I find ""The Big Lebowski"" to be, not simply a very funny movie (one of the funniest I've seen), but also a damn good movie in terms of character, story, plot, and themes.  So few people are interested in making good comedies anymore.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is like a gift from heaven.This movie is the rare combination of a film which I can rewatch endlessly, I always find something to make me laugh out loud (it's never the same thing twice), and actually holds up rather well to close scrutiny.  It's a wonderful goofball version of a standard 1950s film noir, updated, of course, and never taken seriously.  But all the elements are there.  It's a terrific spoof of detective movie, but it actually functions successfully as a detective movie.  [Compare to ""Airplane"", which is a riotously funny spoof of airplane disaster movies, but only works as a spoof, not as an airplane disaster movie.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is making fun of detective movies, but it also has a real mystery involved, and a real detective (albeit an unusual one) who actually solves the mystery.]Great performances make this film, and the cast is to die for.

for baby boomers - The Dude abides,"I'm not sure The Big Lebowski is for everyone, but for my money it's one of the funniest comedies ever, a very impressive production from the Coen Brothers.Over the years, the Coens have knocked my socks off. They have their heavy-duty films like No Country for Old Men, Barton Fink, and their satires like the Hudsucker Proxy - it seems as if they can do anything.This is a very, very funny and offbeat film with crazy characters, acid flashbacks, and bizarre situations -- a true baby boomer movie about The Dude (Jeff Bridges) whose name is Jeff Lebowski, who is mistaken for another Lebowski whose wife owes money all over town. Goons try to get the money from him; he winds up working for the other Lebowski when his porn star wife is kidnapped. Along for the ride are two of his bowling buddies, Walter, a Vietnam vet who, though not Jewish, observes the shabbat, and Steve (Steve Buscemi).

Undeniable,"The Big Lebowski, directed by Joel Coen and written by both Joel and Ethan Coen, is a cosmic convergence of absurdity and style that feels like a distillation of the Coens' worldview, amplified through the quirks of Los Angeles and a cast in top comedic form. It's a film of idiosyncratic, eccentric characters who stumble through misunderstandings and mistakes, each performance embodying the Coens' knack for balancing humor and existential frustration. Jeff Bridges' ""The Dude"" is a figure of aimless zen, a shambling counterpoint to John Goodman's unhinged, Vietnam-obsessed Walter Sobchak, whose performance stands out even on repeat viewings for its timing and nuance. Goodman injects an unpredictable, volcanic energy that contrasts so starkly with The Dude's pacifism, making their interactions as darkly funny as they are absurd.The film has become a cultural phenomenon since its release, with a cult following that has grown almost mythic. As much as I admire the craft of The Big Lebowski, I find myself uneasy with the extent to which fans have idolized its characters. The appeal of The Dude and his laid-back lifestyle is undeniable, but there's a disconnect between the humor the Coens intended and the near-reverence with which audiences have taken to emulating these flawed, ridiculous figures.In some ways, I actually think Hail, Caesar!-another Coen film often overlooked-does a better job with similar themes of mistaken identities and misguided pursuits, handling Hollywood mythmaking with a sharper, more self-aware edge. While The Big Lebowski remains an endlessly rewatchable film about miscommunication, chance, and the absurdity of American culture, other Coen films like A Serious Man and Hail, Caesar! Offer richer reflections on these ideas with a subtler punch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Another Coen Brothers cult classic.,"In the last year or so, I've tried to watch a few cult classics that had escaped my purview. I'm familiar with their cultural significance, and I can understand why they are beloved by many, but they aren't necessarily perfect films by any means. Movies like The Goonies (1985) and Mean Girls (2004) are mostly known via their memeable moments. This was why I already understood the gist of these movies before actually sitting down and watching them. The Big Lebowski (1998) was yet another cult classic that had these same strengths and weaknesses.First off, Jeff Bridges is ""The Dude."" If he didn't provide such a solid performance, I doubt this movie would have become nearly as memorable. However, what people might forget about this film is how weird it is. Many sequences left me scratching my head and wondering what the heck was going on. And perhaps it's this kind of ""stoner appeal"" that led it into its cult status. Then again, I have to remind myself that the Coen Brothers toe that line between serious drama (Fargo (1996), No Country for Old Men (2007), and True Grit (2010)) and comedy (The Hudsucker Proxy (1994), Burn After Reading (2008), and Hail, Caesar! (2016)).Of course, the comedy the Coen Brothers bring to the table is definitely of the dark variety, and The Big Lebowski has enough of it sprinkled throughout its plot that you have no doubt it's a Coen Brothers movie. And while it's fun watching The Dude piece together the predicament he finds himself in, the plot pivots and turns so hard and fast that it's hard to keep up at times. Ultimately, The Big Lebowski is an entertaining film and probably contributed to an increase of people ordering White Russians at bars for years to come.Another Coen Brothers cult classic, I give The Big Lebowski 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

There is no film around that better explores white Russians and bowling.,"The Big Lebowski is frankly a terrific entertaining film.  When discussing the Coens and their output usually people jump all over Fargo or O, Brother Where Art Thou?.  I cannot fault them for this, as these are great movies. But I have always been drawn to those films that follow the bigger hits. The Big Lebowski wedged between the aforementioned Coen Brothers movies fits quite nicely.  The plot doesn't really matter.  It assuredly does twist and turn and is incomprehensible at times.  As this film is a take on the film detective genre, most notably The Big Sleep which doesn't make sense either, this is extremely acceptable.  Take the Bogart character that has all the answers out of the plot and place a burned out broke bowler that loves white Russians in his stead, throw in John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Juliane Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffmann, and a funny, well-executed story and you have The Big Lebowski.

Mark that as an eight.,"It is a director's movie and again, the Coen brothers manage to leave their idiosyncratic stamp on this movie. Mostly intriguing, but sometimes weird, the Coens allow another story to unravel in a psuedorealistic world that they create in so many of their movies. Looking back at this movies as a whole, it seems like a rather mediocre product with crumbling storyline. However, if you have watched the Coens enough, you would know that they are more likely to deliver instantaneous gratification while watching a movie than give memorable product to be remembered later. So, while some subplots in the Big Lebowski stick out like a sore thumb, the movie succeeds in entertaining with some genuinely hilarious scenes. There are moments where sheer brilliance radiates from the scene construction and it is for these moments the movie has to be watched. In my early days as a Coens fan, I have made the mistake of trying to overthink their movies. It is mistake because retrospectively their movies may appear ordinary, but at the time of viewing, the Coens amazing audaciousness holds together. It may be viewed as a victory of style over substance, but it really is an effort to choose entertainment over reality. I did not take much home from Lebowski, neither did I think it was a perfect storyline, but it was thoroughly entertaining. And sometimes, that is all you need.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
just did not care...,"I love the Cohen Brothers. I've seen most of their movies way more than once. This one.. barely made it through once.All the characters were horrible! I wanted to reach into the movie and clunk ""The Dude"" in the head. John Goodman's character was unspeakably rude and stupid and offensive. What a waste of Steve Buschemi! The only part that was amusing was Julianna Moore's character-- mostly because she was doing a great impression of Katherine Hepburn. Now that I think of it, the dream sequences were surreal enough to be interesting, especially the bit with a POV of the inside of a bowling ball!My friend who recommended it replied to my objections by saying, ""Oh, maybe I forgot to mention that this is a movie best watched stoned."" Yeah... maybe. Do yourself a favor. Skip this one and watch Miller's Crossing again!",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Funny!,I just watched this movie last night and I can't believe that someone could make a movie out of this kind of person. I've seen the work of the Cohen brother's and didn't understand most of their movies. But for this movie I can say that it's hilarious. John Goodman plays a great role in this movie. This is a great movie to watch.-MICHAL,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Awesome comedy,For a lover of comedy this movie does justice as humor is well presented extraordinarily with these two main characters doing an exceptionally amazing job in delivering exactly what they needed to deliver. This is a very funny movie and is extremely entertaining. The story line is well articulated as it is not as discombobulated as of many other movies where one gets confused with the development of the story. It can be well followed and understood. This is definitely a great movie to watch and is a great entertainment for anyone who likes humor. It is one of the best movies to be produced during the timeline.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A comedic Masterpiece.,"This is by far the funniest movie I've seen in a long time.  It's also the most original and creative of the Coen Brothers' films.  If you like sarcastic humor, or flat-out violent in your-face comedy, I suggest this film.  Don't miss the hilarious scenes inside the character's local bowling alley, or John Goodman's hilarious performance, as a ""Jewish"" friend of the Dude.

I keep treating objects as women...,"One way to classify yourself as a film-goer is by identifying your favourite Coen Brothers movie.  I believe that in the future this will be a universal standard and all reviews will being with the reviewers preference is brackets under the title.  For example you might get (Fargo but closely followed by The Man Who Wasn't There or Miller's Crossing!!!).  This would enable everybody to make snap judgements on whether to read the review or not.I would imagine the Big Lebowski followers would be very much like the Dude. The go through life avoiding conflict and find it real hard to remember what the movie was all about afterwards.  Consequently their reviews will never be scathing but slightly lacking in detail.This films is a reaaaallllly relaxed Coen Brothers effort, following the Dude around the bowling alleys of Los Angeles in the early 90's.  Much to the Dude's dismay, he gets mixed up in an affair involving nihilists, ex-porn stars and conceptual artists that results in a soiled rug and a run in with a marmot.  Jeff Bridges is excellent in the role of the Dude and right now I can't help feeling this is going to be the part he's going to be associated with for the rest of this acting life.  The rest of the cast are just as superb notably John Goodman and Julianne Moore.I think the keep to this films success is the way the audience associates with the Dude.  He trundles through the film trying to work out what is going on while keep a certain distance from events which is pretty much what I was trying to do while sitting in the cinema.  This trick makes this possibly the most accessible Coen Brothers film to date and it's thoroughly recommended to everyone.Go see(The Hudsucker Proxy just over Fargo.)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Big Lebowski - 9/10,"The Big Lebowski follows Jeffrey Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) better knows as ""The Dude"" and the increasingly bizarre chain of events that unfurl after his rug gets pissed on.Jeff Bridges performance as the dude is brilliant. In a world of colourful archetypes, The Dude is almost the straight-man of his own story, his cavalier attitude emphasising the absurdity of the plot, making it that bit funnier.The Cohan Brother's philosophy of film making is evident through this movie, with all characters being memorable and unique, regardless of relevance or importance.The main antagonistic force of this film being leather clad german nihilists creates a hilarious juxtaposition between Lebowski's optimistic, almost Taoist, beliefs and the oxymoronic misinterpretation of Nichze's philosophy, openly mocking the angst fueled actions of those who ""just don't care"".Steve Buscemi and John Goodman's (Donnie and Walter) performances are standout, with both actors bringing a distinctly unique humour and energy to the movie.Full of interesting people, a pop culture goldmine with a story that is as relatable as it is ridiculous, The Big Lebowski serves as a masterclass in comedic storytelling.One of my top 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Bizarre...?,"The Big Lebowski. One of the more bizarre movies I've seen by a long shot, this follows swearaholic Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski who is mistaken and has his rug ""soiled"" near the start of the film. Going to the intended ""soiled-rug"" person, The Dude gets himself foolishly involved in a kidnapping case in which a womans toe is cut off. Him and his buddy Walter and idiotic friend Donny (Shut the F**K up!!) Try to figure it all out. This film mainly succeeds because of the characters; John Tuturro as a ludicrous child molester, Donny and Walter, the film's high point, always finding new hilarious dialogue to spit at the camera. Had it not been for some fantastic performances from Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, this may well not be the funny thriller/slacker comedy that it was. A memorable movie, filled to the brim with politically incorrect scenes and some unusually twisted phrases and comedy, The Big Lebowski scores big. But what do you expect if it's done by the Coen Brothers?Overall: **** out of ***** (4 out of 5)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Big Dud,"I just had the unfortunate experience of watching The Big Lebowski for the first time. All I can say is that I'm amazed at its popularity. It's hard to comprehend people actually like this overrated dud and claim it's funny and entertaining. As if the muddled and overloaded script and plot weren't enough, the characters aren't the least bit interesting to watch. Jeff Bridges' character is an unemployed loser, and for that reason alone, we're suppose to think he's ""really cool"". I bet slacker misfits must be the only ones who could identify with such character. Moreover, John Goodman's character is downright obnoxious. Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, and John Turturro are wasted in nonsensical roles. Plus, the laughs are few and far between. The cliff scene when John Goodman scatters Steve Buscemi's ashes but the wind blows them on to Jeff Bridges' face, is probably the funniest bit in the whole movie. Everything else seems forced. The music is forgettable and if you want a better display of Roger Deakins' cinematography, I suggest you see a better Coen brothers' film - O Brother, Where Art Thou? To think this film came from the same people who brought us Fargo and Blood Simple.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"The fastest, sharpest movie I've seen","I think I could see Lebowski every day. So far, I've seen it five times which just makes me want to see it more. My favorite Coen Brothers movie. I think they've improved with every movie (except The Hudsucker Proxy). In fact, I think this is the movie they had in mind when they worked up the Hudsucker Proxy. With all of the imagery, symbolism and themes all over the script, I think this movie is in some ways a tribute to complexity and coincidence.Only complaint: I want more of John Turturro as Jesus.This movie is electric. Watching it reminded me of getting an hour-long massage - I loved every minute of it, and was fearing the inevitable end of the movie. Karl Hungus, Walter, Donnie, Jesus & Liam, Maude Lebowski, everybody was sensational - but The Dude is the focal point. He should be an inspiration to us all.The more I think about this film, the more I believe it's my favorite movie of all-time.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A stoned bum is thrown into a strange kidnapping case and he is tasked with being a key component in getting back the kidnapped.,"The Big Lebowski is really it's own kind of film. It's characters are all strange but yet seem to fit in perfectly. There seems to be no line drawn in the sand to limit The Big Lebowski's creativity and bizarreness. Its main character alone has been such a draw that he has been the source of a new religion; Dudeism. The directors of The Big Lebowski, the Coen Brothers, are known for their unique filmography and outside-the-box thinking, but The Big Lebowski is certainly one of the movies that granted them that title.We begin our journey from the outside, starting with The Stranger. An old cowboy who already knows The Dude himself (Jeff Bridges). The Stranger acts as a character, narrator and audience member all at the same time. He talks tall tales about The Dude, and we are promptly dropped into his world. The Dude roams around L.A. and bowls in his free time, always scavenging for his next White Russian and couch to kick back on. The Dude walks back home one day only to find two henchmen waiting for him. One throws The Dude's head in his own gross toilet and the other unzips his pants and pees on his rug. It really tied the room together. One henchmen goes on to explain that the two are there to extort money from The Dude, calling him ""Mr Lebowski."" Only, they've got the wrong Lebowski. The two leave in an aggressive embarrassment and The Dude is left on his bathroom floor with a toilet-water-soaked head and sunglasses on.The Dude does some digging and eventually finds the real Mr. Lebowski in an attempt to get some money to replace his rug. The two meet in Mr. Lebowski's illustrious house, and The Dude leaves without any money but having tricked Mr. Lebowski's personal assistant, Brandt, into stealing a rug for him. As The Dude leaves he winds up chatting up Mr. Lebowski's trophy wife, Bunnie, as well.The Dude is a toker for sure. Always kicking back and lighting some J's, he proves himself to be The Dude time and time again. The Dude's casual mindset pairs well with his habit of smoking weed and in a good amount of scenes he is. However it's almost like he goes unchanged. There isn't a sober dude and there isn't a high Dude he just is, The Dude. It's the appearance of what The Dude is that makes him what he is, and weed is a strong component of that. Without the J, The Dude wouldn't be the same dude.The Dude goes back off into his exceedingly casual life and bowls with his teammates, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). However, not too long afterwards, The Dude receives an urgent voicemail left by Brandt requesting that The Dude come and visit, and it's not about the rug. Mr. Lebowski's wife, Bonnie, has been kidnapped for ransom. Mr. Lebowski and Brandt see The Dude as being in a unique position because they believe the men who captured Bunnie may also be the same culprits who ""soiled"" The Dude's rug. The Dude abides, and the rest is a crazy hilarious journey. It's like The Usual Suspects meets The Naked Gun. Jeff Bridge's performance as The Dude is one of the most recognizable in Hollywood. Him and a litany of other cast members won awards for their unique and charismatic performances. The acting is from another world, the characters are the strangest in the world, but all need each other to exist. It's almost a hallucinatory movie. The Big Lebowski is a must see for any movie fan and is sure to crack a few laughs and spark lots of curiosity. There's no better time to enjoy the turbulent journey of The Dude than now. The Big Lebowski is best served with a White Russian.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
to know the Dude is to love the Dude,"A simply amazing film with definite cult status, I can watch this movie over and over, especially when I need to be picked up...it's one of those movies that makes you feel safe and comfortable, just because the Dude makes you feel like everything will work out fine. The movie is hilarious, and there are so many great quotes and characters. It is also one of the few films that makes me think LA might be a nice place to live. The music is excellent, the dream sequences are inspired. I enjoy most Coen brothers films, but this one is truly special. It has such a good flow to it. Often, when I really like a movie, I enjoy the first half hour or so more than the rest. This one is entertaining from start to finish.

Gets Better With Each Viewing,"High on my list of desert island movies, Lebowski is an endlessly rewarding modern classic that seems to yield something fresh with every screening. Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi may have been able to carry this thing by themselves, staggered around a rickety old bowling lane with just a wardrobe and a copy of the Coen brothers' script, but when their performances are matched by a blindingly colorful supporting cast, a plot that swerves around like a drunken driver and the brothers' unmistakable eye for subtlety, the end result is pure magic. I could watch this three times a year and never get tired of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
My Favorite Movie.  Go rent it.,"There are so many things that I like about this movie.  First of all, I don't think there is another movie that has so many great quotes in it, not to mention that every character in the movie has their share of great quotes.  If you are looking for a movie to quote, look no further.Second, The Dude has the coolest style.  A guy obviously stuck in the Sixties, he carelessly and effortlessly slides through life without a job and has the best time at it.  A kind-hearted, innocent guy, he loves to bowl, get high, and listen to Bob Dylan.Third, the plot of this movie is excellent.  Dont be mis-led, there is very little apparent plot.  However, there is very much going on that is unsaid which makes the movie very complex and intricate.  To understand the motivations of the individual characters takes some concentration.  It took me many times of watching it to fully understand what each character had going on in his/her head.Fourth, the dialog is highly developed.  The conversations in this movie are so unlike most movies.  The characters continuously interrupt each other, change subjects, lose their train of thought, etc.  Such a refreshing departure from the cookie cutter Hollywood film.  But yes, there is an unusually high amount of obscenities.  However, this movie does not attempt to sugar-coat the vocabulary of real people, they keep it true-to-life.As with most of the other Coen brothers' movies, the underlying theme is this:  Something bad or illegal happens, and instead of the onlookers trying to help the victims, they decide to try to make a personal gain from the situation.A masterpiece!  10 out of 10.

"If you will it dude, such a great movie is no dream","Since I saw The Big Lebowski for the first time in the movie theaters over two years ago (I saw it twice in the theaters), I have probably watched it between 50-75 times.  I was awed by the overall atmosphere the movie conveyed upon first viewing, and was shocked that every subsequent time I saw it, it just got better and better.  Even to this today, I notice something new and different upon each viewing.Critics who complain that the movie doesn't have a plot miss the point. First of all, there is a plot, albeit a wacky and zany one (a Coen Brother's trademark), that many people may not fully understand on first viewing. Second, the plot is only there to serve as a background for the amazing characters, scenes, and dialogue that the movie focuses on.   The interplay between `The Dude' & `Walter' is absolutely hysterical.  Just one example that comes to mind (I could've picked just about any bowling scene)  is Walter commenting on the Gulf War, comparing `the man in the black pagamas' to the current adversary, `a bunch of f**eaters where towels on their heads, trying to find reserve on a Russian tank' while The Dude is painting his nails.I could go on and on about my favorite scenes, but I'd just have to recite the entire movie, because every single scene is so exceptional.  From the repeated dialogue (`this aggression will not stand', `chinamen', `Pilar'), to the incredible fadeouts and transitions (`that wasn't here toe, dude'), you really have to see it multiple times to understand just how incredibly well-crafted this movie really is.In my mind, The Big Lebowski is the best of the Coen Bros.' movies, outdistancing Barton Fink.  That is an enormous compliment, because I love all their movies.  It is also possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen, and holds a spot in my top ten movies of all time.Arthur Digby Sellers!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Big Lebowski,"In modern film, there are only a very few people who can be consistently counted on to bring out intriguing, odd movies.  Perhaps the two most prominent of these people are Joel and Ethan Coen, creators of such masterpieces of 'Fargo' and 'Blood Simple'.  While most of their previous work has been critically acclaimed, it wasn't truly until 'Fargo' that the pair became more universally known.  'The Big Lebowski' is proof that the duo have past a rare test.  They have transferred their concept of quirky filmmaking to the mainstream, while retaining their biting sense of humor. This film is truly hysterical, and at times poignant.  Its a black comedy that is truly a delight to watch.  Jeff Bridges and John Goodman have fantastic chemistry and the dialogue shows the biting satirical, yet overt comedic prose that the Coen Brothers have mastered in previous masterpieces.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the best films of the nineties!,"In 100 years time the Coen brothers will be remembered for Fargo as their 'classic' film, but their most celebrated film is not their best, Lebowski is the king of funny films. Personnally I find nothing amusing about slapstick comedy, the beauty of Lebowski(and all genuinly funny films, Dr Strangelove, Withnail and I, Annie Hall)is that it uses well crafted characters, intelligence and/or stupidity for reaching the child within. Lines such as ""she's gotta feed the monkey"" are just so off the wall that it never fails raise giggles, smirks and riotous rolling on the floor. The Dude and Walter are one of the best double acts I've ever witnessed, up there with Lemon and Curtis in Some like it Hot or Laural and Hardy. While critics are afraid to praise new films and rank them with the so called classics, I believe the Coen's will be remembered for this as well as Fargo, the same way that Orson Welles is remembered for Citizen Kane AND THEN Touch of Evil.

"shut the f*** up, Donny!","I saw this movie on terrestrial TV about a year ago after hearing so much about it. After watching it, not a day goes by without me laughing about a particular scene in it. It is one of the Coen's finest movies, and definitely their most underrated. Three actors make this movie a classic: Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and John Turturro. Bridges is a terrific actor who is extremely underrated (much like the film) and there is no actor who is more perfectly cast for the role of 'The Dude' than Bridges, who brings immeasurable panache to the role of, basically, a drifting stoner. Goodman, a Coen regular, is given his meatiest film role yet and he grabs it with both hands. Admittedly, he is given some terrific lines but Goodman fills Walter Sobchak with humanity as well as humour. Turturro is given the slimmest of cameos but his queer Latino bowler, Jesus Quintana, is without doubt the best cameo EVER in a movie. No question. Also, how can you not love a movie that casts both Sam Elliott and Philip Seymour Hoffman?",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The Dude abides,"Back in 1998 I rented ""The Big Lebowski"" based on the reputation of the Coen brothers's previous film (""Fargo""). Without any real expectations, my brother and I proceeded to watch it and by the end we were in agreement: We had just seen the funniest movie of all time. More than ten years later the film has aged gracefully and if it's not necessarily the funniest movie of all time then it's surely one of the top contenders.The film centres on Jeff Bridges, playing a slacker who likes to go by the name of 'The Dude'. 'The Big Lebowski' has the same name as Bridges's character but that's where the similarities end. After a case of mistaken identity 'The Dude' ends up acting as a courier for the other Lebowski, delivering ransom money to kidnappers. Naturally, things go about as wrong as they possibly could and hilarity ensues.The cast is top-notch. Jeff Bridges excels as 'The Dude' and he has great chemistry with both John Goodman & Julianne Moore. Throw in some Coen brothers vets like Steve Buscemi & John Turturro and add to that Philip Seymour Hoffman, Sam Elliott & others and you've got a cast that's to die for.The Coens deliver the goods with both the screenplay and the direction. There are a ton of hilarious, memorable quotes and the film's look is always interesting and attractive. They also make some fine use of music including Bob Dylan's ""The Man in Me"", The First Edition's ""Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)"" and a Spanish version of ""Hotel California"" by the Gypsy Kings. Overall, the film sports a much higher level of craftsmanship than we're used to seeing in modern comedies.In the end, though, the film's cult status must be mentioned. The film has attracted a loyal following but there are bound to be those that just don't 'get' the film. Since I am firmly in the 'followers' camp I strongly urge you to give the film a chance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
