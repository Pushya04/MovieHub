Gut and heart wrenching...,"I was one of the people who said I wouldn't go see this movie because I felt they were capitalizing on a national tragedy and the trailer gave me nightmares. But, my curiosity got the best of me when I read several positive quotes by numerous critics outside the US. So, I picked up a ticket for the 2:00 show.There truly are no words to describe the power of this film. The cinematography is excellent, albeit a little unsteady with the shaky lens thing going on. I found that the film very much followed the reports in the 9/11 Commission's book, as well as numerous others. They stuck to the facts and didn't add in any glorified scenes that weren't warranted. You saw the mass confusion as the various air traffic control centers tried to make sense of what was going on. You saw the events on the plane unfold as we think they did that morning. You saw ordinary Americans, scared and frightened, band together and try and keep that plane from hitting another target.Do we know exactly what was said between people on the planes? No. But there are survivors who had messages from loved ones on their answering machines and people who talked to them that day. The film is a little violent for my tastes, but no more so than any 'Blockbuster' fictional hit out there right now, and this is reality as we know it. Any discrepancies are not for me or you to decide, as those secrets are buried in Pennsylvania.When it ended, I've never seen a more still theater. You could hear people breathing as they pulled themselves together. This is something that happened to our nation, and while it shouldn't take a movie to make people remember, maybe it does. Maybe we have forgotten or chosen to ignore what happened that day, falling to politics and quick to accuse people who didn't prevent it. Maybe we are against this movie because it makes us uncomfortable, as all meaningful things should. Who knows? Not I.But, I do know that United 93 was done in a tasteful, respectful manner, and many of the families affected on 9/11 supported its release. Who are we to say otherwise? See the movie and then make your judgment call. You may find yourself surprised, just as I did.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Understated but powerful,"This movie approaches an incredibly sensitive subject in an entirely appropriate manner: with subtlety and understatement.The actors look like real people and talk like real people talk. There are no dramatic exclamations. Even the signature ""Let's roll"" line is stated almost in passing without any special significance being brought to it. The movie was utterly convincing in portraying how real people would have responded. There were no Bruce Willis or Wesley Snipe types amongst the passengers; they were ordinary folk in extraordinary situations, responding the best way they could.Kudos to the filmmakers for not allowing this to become an overwrought melodrama. Instead, we saw a glimpse into the confusion and pain of people in the middle of the events of 9/11. Because it was understated, because it felt real, the impact was much stronger and gut-wrenching.",8.0,Anonymous,History
United We Could,"Frozen, speechless, devastated. That's how I was at the end of the film and judging by the silence in the auditorium the whole audience felt the same. A remarkable achievement. Not a single cheap shot. Knowing, as we all know, what happened on that fatal September 11th. The time lapse between the first plane hitting the World Trade center and the second seemed interminable. The faces of the passengers, without even knowing their names, are still vivid in my mind. Extraordinary. Not to mention the terrorist's faces. So real, so human. Tears were running down my face as a chill run down my spine witnessing the terrorists as well as the passengers praying. God, seen through a different optical at different times for exactly the same reasons. The brave decision of the passengers to die trying to protect all of us is something that we in the ground we seem to have forgotten. We could all stand together as well in everybody's name for everybody's good. You see, here I am, inspired and aspiring to inspire.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"A powerful, tasteful and important film...","I saw this at a special screening. I have not stopped thinking about it since. A emotional and powerful film that I will remember forever. I can't fault anyone who doesn't want to see this film. But please put to rest any fears that this film was made purely to turn a profit and serves no purpose.For all those who were afraid that this film would be exploitive, propaganda filled Hollywood schlock, I'm sorry to say that could not be farther from the truth.Though for the most part I'm still at a loss for words I'll do my best to give you a short and sweet overview.Paul Greengrass has done the seemingly impossible by making a Hollywood film about this subject everyone is afraid to touch, but made it in such a way that it's hard to find fault, despite everyone's initial misgivings. No 'rah rah' patriotism. No veiled political stances. No cartoonish villains. No making the enemy sympathetic. Just a brilliantly executed look at what did happen and what 'might' have happened on that fateful day.What makes it more effective is that all throughout you don't recognize any of the actors. They may as well be ""real people"". You're never thinking to yourself, 'oh that's Nicolas Cage', conscious of the fact that it's acting. And come to find out, many of the air traffic controllers and military personnel are playing themselves! This makes it all the more real and draws you in and takes you back to that day.And when the passengers decide to fight back? There's no swelling of violins or slow motion shots. They don't have a rallying cry or 'lets do it for Uncle Sam' type speech to motivate everyone. No, these passengers were reacting spontaneously to the situation as it played out and were acting on their survival instinct. You can't help but think how you would react in that situation and makes it all the more compelling and powerful.I won't say this film is for everyone. It IS hard to watch at times. But I'm so glad I did see it. Very cathartic in a way. And trust me, this film couldn't have been done in a more professional, classy way. This feels genuine; of course they are going to 'profit' off it, but you get the sense that the filmmakers and everyone involved poured their hearts into this project and did this to tell a story. A more dignified and heroic story I don't think I've ever seen.",,Anonymous,History
The last 15 minutes will leave you speechless,"There are two reasons why people go to the movies. They either go to be amused, entertained or distracted from the pressures of the real world; it's called escapism. The other is to learn, experience, educate, inform and face what our world is all about. Films like Schindler's List, Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, All the President's Men, and this week another film joins that list; Paul Greengrass' visceral and heartbreaking United 93. Some say it's too soon for a film about 9/11 to come out, but I disagree. I think this film is a bold and important reminder of why we're still fighting to this very day, and it puts us up close and personal with our very enemy; face to face. I don't think I've had such a profound and sober movie going experience like this since I saw The Passion of the Christ, and when the film was over how did the audience react? Applause.United 93 is shot entirely with hand-held cameras to perfectly capture the realism of the events that happened that day. The film was written and directed by British filmmaker Paul Greengrass, who's previous films include 2004's blockbuster hit The Bourne Supremacy and the critically acclaimed 2002 docu-drama Bloody Sunday, and every frame of his vision is unflinching, intense and heart pounding from it's quiet beginning to it's nerve-wracking and stomach turning finale. The film is never exploitive of the events of 9/11 and always remains respectful to the memories of those on board that fateful plane.Everybody knows the story, and everybody knows how it's going to end, but that never stops the film from being suspenseful. The film is pretty much void of any character development, and the film never, not even for a second feels like a movie, it looks like a documentary. And I'm sure the way Greengrass has captured the shock, confusion, chaos and panic of that morning is how it must have gone down. The cameras cover the action from all perspectives; from the National Air Traffic Control Center, airport towers, regional air traffic stations, and a military command room where soldiers try to figure out if and when they have the authority to shoot down a necessary target in order to protect Washington. One of the amazing things about United 93 is its casting. The casting of the film includes a number of real life United pilots, stewardesses, air traffic controllers and military personnel, many of them actually playing themselves. The cast of passengers are a group of largely unknowns, which lends great respectability and reality. We are seeing these people for the first time, with no previous knowledge of them as actors and it only works in their favor.The film opens quietly with several hijackers going through their morning rituals, reading aloud from the Koran; praying to God and kneeling on the floor of their hotel room and then packing their things to head to the Newark airport. And from there we are introduced to several different air traffic controller technicians and we watch as they discover that two planes have been hi-jacked and eventually discover that they've hit the World Trade Center. These scenes are heartbreaking and feel somewhat surreal. But it's not until United flight 93 takes off that the towers are hit and the plane is up in the air when the terrorist's plans are set into motion.The final fifteen minutes of United 93 will leave you speechless and paralyzed, as a group of passengers plan to attack and over throw the terrorists and try to take back the cockpit. It's intense, violent and overwhelmingly inspiring. The film is a well done memorial, dedicated to those who were killed on September 11th, and I truly believe that the film was done with the utmost respect to those involved and with amazing passion and sensitivity to ""get it right"". Director Paul Greengrass does get it right, and I honestly believe that it would have been impossible for it to have been done any better than it is here. United 93 is absolutely amazing, and to see a better or more important film this year seems very unlikely, and I think this film should be required viewing for all Americans, but when they feel that they are ready for it, because this is as real as it gets. This film is responsible film-making of the highest level and the experience is both sobering and cathartic.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Devastating, Relentless and Ultimately CatharticEssential Viewing. Period.","A most cathartic experience came over me when I viewed the much publicized ""United 93"". At once speculative and realistic, the 111-minute film will surely bring back the pall of fatalistic inevitability one feels about 9/11, but its more defining characteristic is revealing the untapped heroism and humanism of people caught in the most malevolent of circumstances. Masterfully written and directed by Paul Greengrass, this relentlessly intense movie covers that fateful morning when United Airlines Flight 93 departed Newark for San Francisco with 33 passengers and seven crew members on board.As it turns out, Greengrass's heavy background in documentaries turns out to be a blessing in this treatment, as he tracks the subsequent events in real time and uses either under-the-radar actors or actual aviation personnel to play the real-life characters. Instead of focusing on the higher profile passengers to provide an emotional locus, which a more commercial filmmaker would have done, he encompasses all the passengers within the emotional purview of the film, including the four hijackers who killed the pilots and took control of the plane. The key dramatic difference is that we get to know not the people but the situation at hand. Consequently, we get a more realistic sense of the scale of the events that may have occurred on that flight. That's not to say it is any less devastating. In fact, the last half-hour is harrowing in the most personal sense as the inevitable becomes reality.The power of the film comes from its surprisingly apolitical perspective and the inclusion of the ground personnel trying to comprehend the scope of all the redirected planes that day, in particular, Ben Sliney who effectively plays himself that day, the just-promoted supervisor of the National Air Traffic Control Center in Herndon, Va. None of the actors stand out because the film cumulatively achieves a verisimilitude that simply knocks me out. The film also does not pretend to be the definitive version of what happened on the last few moments of the flight. In an emotional sense, it is rather moot as we are talking about degrees of detail at that point. This is truly essential viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Fourth Plane,"On September 11, 2001, a group of terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners on the American East Coast. They crashed two of the planes into the World Trade Center in New York, destroying it completely. Then the third plane hit Pentagon, the US defense headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. ""United 93"" is a film about what happened to the fourth airplane and its passengers.This eerie docudrama was written and directed by Paul Greengrass, a young Englishman certainly well suited for the task. For several years, Greengrass had successfully dramatized historical events for British television. His international breakthrough came with the film ""Bloody Sunday"" - a story of the ""troubles"" in Northern Ireland that won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival in 2002.""United 93"" was the first feature that directly depicted what happened during the 9/11 attacks. So, for Greengrass, it was essential to achieve the highest possible realism. The passengers were therefore played by unknown actors. But that came at a price. During the difficult shoot, some of them were injured, so the blood visible on their faces as they attacked the terrorists is authentic.Filming took place during the fall of 2005, onboard an old Boing 757 outside London. The location was chosen to shield the people in the movie team from the public scrutiny they might have received in the United States. And as usual Paul Greengrass shot the action scenes with a hand-held camera to create a higher sense of immediacy.""United 93"" had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City. To Paul Greengrass' relief, it received a positive reception from most critics. But above all, the director was happy that so many family members of the United 93's passengers attended the screening to show their support for his movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Horrifying to go through it, but I think that this is a very important film for generations to come","I was nervous to see any movie on September 11th due to the fact that in some ways I felt that it was too soon, seeing how we just had the 5th anniversary. Not to mention, I didn't want to go through that depression again and watch those horrifying events happen again, a girl at work had mentioned how she saw United 93 and World Trade Center, she said it was nothing like what you would expect of an action movie, it's more dedicated to those who lost their lives that tragic day.United 93 is a truly inspiring tale about the 4th hijacked plane that crashed in Pennsylvania. I remember seeing this on the news on September 11th, we heard so many different things, that it was shot down, the passengers gained on the hijackers, and to be honest I'd rather believe that the passengers stuck together and prevented more lives from being perished that day. These people were truly incredible and the thing that I loved about the film was that it was made to show that they were not victims, they chose to not be so, they knew what they were facing and unfortunately died trying.Another thing that I appreciated is that I think we did forget about those planes that were hijacked and the horror that the passengers must have gone through. We usually only think of the World Trade Centers when we think of September 11th. I could never imagine what thoughts were racing through those passenger's heads. It truly was devastating to just think what the families were going through when they received phone calls from their loved one's and having to say good bye. We can't forget those who were so brave to help others and those who unfortunately who crashed into the World Trade Center and Pentegon, nothing could be strong enough to say about them, my sincere condolences to the families.I was wrong about these films, they truly are important. Even though it's fresh in most of our memories, let's not forget those who died trying to save others. God bless the souls on Flight United 93, you truly are hero's and will never be forgotten.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Nauseated by the shaky camera work...,"I give this movie a 6 based on the fact that despite what was otherwise good solid work by the producers and actors involved, I found it ultimately unwatchable because of motion sickness brought on by the camera style.The story itself seemed true to all the reports I had heard over the years concerning the incident, and the dialogue and acting seemed very solid. I was watching with interest up to about the halfway point when I got nauseated thanks to the shaky camera work.Being a movie enthusiast, I know this style of cinematography has been popular for about 15 years. I first noticed it used on the NYPD Blue TV series. I believe that this ""shaky"" style has its place- it can be effective to create a frantic mood when filming action scenes such as those found in one of my favorite movie series, 'The Bourne Identity/Supremacy'. (Although a couple of scenes in 'Supremacy' left me a little queasy, they were quickly over with and that particular film settled down again where I could watch it).However, I see no good reason to use this style when you are filming a group of people in a flight control center where nobody is getting body-slammed or shot or punched in the nose. It actually loses its effect when over-employed and creates another effect: nausea.I never remember getting sick watching NYPD Blue, but my TV is not 60 feet wide, either. The girl I took to the movie was also made sick by this, and while she and I were out in the lobby recovering we could hear from the ladies restroom the sounds of another moviegoer losing her groceries.I would have liked to have seen the last half of the movie but the constant shaking of the camera made it impossible. I may be one of the few that it affected so badly but I know I was not the only one.",6.0,Anonymous,History
I couldn't stop shaking,"The terrorists prepare themselves and on September 11, 2001, they board United Airlines Flight 93 departing from Newark to San Francisco. As they prepare to take off, planes are being hijacked. Chaos break out in air traffic control. Once in the air, the first plane crashes into the World Trade Center. Four hijackers take over United 93 as confusion spreads. The passengers calling from the plane surmise the hijackers' plan and try to retake the aircraft.I saw it in a theater back in the day. Honestly, I couldn't stop shaking as I left. I had to take a few seconds before I start the car. It's almost ten years since then. 9/11 grows further into the distant past. Watching it again, I thought some of its power may have dissipated. I got a little blasé about it initially and then the terrorists break into the cockpit. The intensity comes flooding back. I'm shaking once again. I think the growing distance from the actual event has diminished the anxiety but it may always be there. Director Paul Greengrass is able to bring all of it out onto the surface.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Tragedy,"One of the most discussed things, when this movie was made, was the question, if this movie was made too early. How could someone try to capitalize on the grieve of others and so forth. But the families knew about this movie and as far as I know most of them wanted the story of their lost ones to be told. So why should we argue about this movie then?It's quite impossible that you don't know what happened on ""9/11"" at this point, but in a few years there will be teenagers and then adults who weren't born when that tragedy occurred or were too young to remember/realize what was happening. This movie will give them as near a picture of that as it is possible. The aim here is to keep it as real as possible! And that's why there is no political statement that is made here (neither for or against a view) nor are characters (= real people) glorified or being made fun of. It's almost a documentary. And that's why although this movie is good, it might be too hard for some people to watch/bare ...",7.0,Anonymous,History
I think the more people that watch this will understand a little more about human nature,"In 'United 93' we take a look at what might have happen to United flight 93 on September 11th. Of the aircraft that were hijacked on September 11th, only United flight 93 did not reach its intended target. This is the story about the events leading up to the hijacking and about the people who tried to save United flight 93.At first I did not want to see this film. I had no desire to see someone's interpretation of what happened. However, I am glad I did see it. This is probably one of the most riveting and intense films I have ever seen. It is a little slow at first. But, as you follow the events as they unfold, you become captivating in this movie.Several people have pointed fingers; wanting to blame someone for what happened. I think the more people that watch this will understand a little more about human nature. I do not think anything could have prevented these tragedies; we can only hope to prevent history from repeating itself.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A superb drama and tribute to those that died that day.,"On September 11, 2001, four commercial airplanes were successfully hijacked. Three of them hit their target. UNITED 93 is the story of the fourth plane that was successfully thwarted from achieving its goal.Its objective, to hit the White House, was thwarted by a group of individuals that were flying home to San Francisco from Newark on that fateful flight. The plane crashed in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.We know this to be true. But what Writer/Director Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday, Bourne Supremacy) did was take a sensitive and controversial subject and turn it into a drama that is both stunning and powerful. It brings to light the heroic actions taken by the passengers and crew to try and overtake a plane they knew was on a one-way trip to a terrorist act. We get insight of the real-time actions taken by the military, air-traffic and flight control personnel and how they tried in vain to take control of the situation (and ultimately grounding every single plane in flight that day).However well the movie portrayed the crew and passengers, I found the portrayal of one of the hijackers (the pilot) a bit discomforting. Hopefully, Greengrass had some inside knowledge to make the viewer feel some sympathy for him and that it wasn't done just for the sheer entertainment value.United 93 is a serious portrayal and memorial to those whose brave actions saved a Capitol but, unfortunately, was unable to save themselves. As the 5th year anniversary of 9/11 nears, take some time to remember these and the rest of those that died on that terrible day.",9.0,Anonymous,History
When the Contemporary World Changed,"On September, 11th 2001, four United Airlines American domestic flights are hijacked by terrorists. After the collision of two planes against the World Trade Center and one against the Pentagon, the passengers and crew of United Flight 93 unsuccessfully decide to struggle against the four terrorist to take back the control of the airplane.Last month I saw ""Flight 93"", a movie made for television that reconstitutes and dramatizes the moments of despair of the passengers of flight United 93 through the testimony of their phone calls to families and friends. ""United 93"" is about the same historic fact, but gives the big picture, showing how unprepared the authorities (flight controllers, military staff etc.) were for such an unexpected tragedy. The last moments in the plane are very tense and sad. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Vôo United 93"" (""Flight United 93"")",6.0,Anonymous,History
United they stand.,"There isn't a lot you can say about the story that you don't already know. Four planes all high jacked by terrorists each with specific targets. The first three hit the twin towers and the pentagon and the fourth, due to the bravery of the passengers was brought down in a field, this then is their story. Shot at times in an almost dogma/documentary style it looks rough and with close in shots giving a claustrophobic feel and amplifying the cramped conditions of the plane it adds to the tension well. It is a slow builder as we get everyone on the plane and get it off the ground, but once the 1st of the towers is smoking and no one knows why, the film really kicks in. There has been criticism that this film comes too soon, only five years, after the actual events of that horrific day. But whether it is made now or in twenty years time is irrelevant, to me the scar will still be raw. That day is etched in my brain forever and cannot be erased so I don't think it matters when it is made, just that it has. There are films made all the time about serial killers and true-life heroic deeds, this just happens to be both. This is one of those rare films that capture a moment in history for generations to learn from in years to come. Although not a pleasurable watch in an entertainment sense (unlike Fahrenheit 911 it does use footage of the attacks that made me hair stand on end still) it is something that everyone should see. One of the most interesting things about the film was how un-American it was there were no Rambo's or Schwarzenegger's here, but grown men scared and driven to desperation. Maybe it was because it was a British director? Or in telling tales of true life people are just more honest. Either way it shows us a group of people who did what they had to in the face of adversity. As it says in the film Gladiator 'whatever you do in this life echoes in eternity'. This is a poignant and moving tribute to anyone that was involved in that fateful sunny day on September 11th.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not much better than the TV account of the incident,"I heard Roger Ebert and other TV wonks go on and on about this movie and was expecting something dramatically more realistic and interesting that the TV rendition of the flight 93 story. While it is a compelling and gut wrenching account of the incident, I found it only a little better than the TV version. It emphasized (and I expect accurately) the bumbling of NORAD and to some degree the FAA..obvious that we simply weren't prepared to deal with this sort of thing. Can only hope that in the future, when the next terrorist act comes along, we'll do a better job. I also noticed that Hollywood took their usual slap at Bush/Cheney, suggesting that they were unreachable as the incident unfolded thus delaying scrambling of jets to intercept the hijacked airplanes..at the end of the movie, in the postscript, the facts in this regard were clarified.",7.0,Anonymous,History
United 93,"United 93 takes us back to the dark hours of the September 11th attacks bringing back anger, sadness, and fear but with thought a sense of hope, I say this due to United 93 showing us the events within the hijacked aircraft. Call sign United 93 with us already knowing the outcome of the first three hijacked planes this is the story of the forth, as the tagline reads Director Paul Greengrass was able to write and direct a movie that needed no explanation. But did require him to show us what by the end of the movie I had realised, was just how evil and inhumane members of humanity can be but still giving us the positive aspect. Being that when faced with destruction those with courage became the embodiment of the definition of humanity, defending others despite realising the eventuality of their lives being lost to protect and defend others. The darkest aspects of humanity were shown on that day but also the valiant aspects had emerged to, this is what I had taken away from United 93 this is what we can all realise after 1 hour and 51 minutes. Not the quality of the movie that was made, but the message that is being displayed, historical events depicting in film are like finding a four-leafed clover so finding the message within the movie is the objective set for the viewer.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A masterpiece,"The final scenes in United 93 have to be some of the most harrowing in cinema. What you witness is a frantic desire to live conflict with an insane desire to die. People become animals  rational thought gives way to instinct and barbarism, resulting in tragedy.One of the most despairing images in this magnificent film has to be that of the passengers desperately pushing and driving one of their number towards the cockpit. The guy they're manoeuvring is a pilot of single engine planes and represents their one small hope of making it out of this alive. Knowing full well what happened to the passengers of United 93, the desperation is gut wrenching. You know they're not going to make it and that these are the death throes of those on board.The agony of the final moments is amplified by the way that the pilot briefly manages to get his hands on the controls. Whether this happened in real life, no one knows, but it perfectly illustrates the conflict that occurred and the conflict that is happening now. Both sides desperately want to be in the driving seat but all the time things are spiralling out of control. In the end, everyone loses and nothing is gained.Something else I like about the final moments is the disturbing catharsis when the passengers overwhelm the hijackers. This is probably the last time in the 'war on terror' where things will be black and white. The hijackers are wrong and deserve the brutal response of their captives. After this, though, everything becomes hazy and muddy. The tragedy gets twisted and it becomes the fuel for political greed.But in that moment where the first hijacker gets overwhelmed and killed, there's a feeling of joy and exaltation that is primal. You're put in the position of the passengers and you feel the excitement they must have felt  maybe we can get out of this; maybe we can regain control. But it's a mass delusion. There's no turning back now. Things will never be the same.But what's also great about the film is that there's no flag waving. This film isn't a call to arms. It isn't a rallying cry. Instead it's a grimly realistic depiction of the chaos that ensues when barbarism overwhelms normality. When something this audacious and unexpected occurs, all the controls that keep the world in check go flying out the window.Some of the loons out there who want to believe in ridiculous conspiracy theories will point out that the response to the tragedy was too patchy and that communication couldn't be that bad. They've obviously never had a job. Sometimes it's hard enough to communicate clearly with someone downstairs in the same office as you, let alone in an office hundreds of miles away. Plus communication between governmental departments and agencies is notoriously poor. Therefore I can well believe that the response would be so impotent.But the tale that unfolds in air traffic control centres and at NORAD is just as engrossing as the one in the plane. Like the passengers in United 93, they're wrestling with the enormity of the situation. No one can quite believe that this is happening and the sheer scale of the attack is beyond their comprehension. As a consequence people continually try and come to more realistic conclusions.A clear, fast response also isn't helped by inaccurate information. When a plane hits the first tower, it's said that a small civil aircraft hit it. And then NORAD are told that American Airlines 11 is heading for Washington when it's actually hit the World Trade Centre. Yes technology is better these days, but we still don't live in a world where we have accurate information available at our fingertips the very second it happens. And it's galling to know that even the government has to get its updates from CNN.A chilling moment that occurs in the film is when air traffic control are trying to communicate with American Airlines 11. The plane is over New York and they're desperately trying to talk to the pilot. But then the plane disappears off the screen. But even though we know it's hit the tower you can still understand the confusion. Even though the flight has disappeared, who can imagine such a thing?Things only start to become clear when the second plane nears Manhattan. And then it's too late. People watching the smoking tower see the second plane crash into the other building. The attack is almost over before people can understand what's going on.And the only reason that the fourth plane didn't hit the Capitol Building is because United 93 was delayed. Sure some imbeciles can question why the passengers of that flight didn't take the plane sooner, but they didn't know what was going on. When you don't know what's going on, you're powerless. But once they hear about the other flights, they decide to act. And the one bright spot in that miserable day is that these passengers fought back and prevented further loss of life.But I really can't overstress how great this film is. There are no attempts to demonise. There are no attempts to play for false emotion. You're just dropped in this hellish situation and expected to deal with it. It just feels real.And very often it feels painfully real. The build-up constantly had me on edge. The tension is palpable. And then there's the heartbreak of people phoning home and the desperation of the attack on the cockpit. Paul Greengrass has fashioned a masterpiece here. He's made a film that is visceral and heartbreaking and that makes no concessions to the audience. It's one of the greatest films of the last few years.",,Anonymous,History
Life-Changing,"Probably the best movie of the year! This movie handles the many different emotions it brings to the surface in a professional and technically proficient way - it is one of the most well-crafted ""docu-dramas"" I have ever seen. We sit in the plane with the heroes of that day, we watch it unfold from the perspectives of the flight controllers and NORAD, we feel the confusion, the torment, and ultimately, the victory in the end. It is a great commentary on the human spirit and a great achievement in cinematography and editing. Paul Greengrass has opened up a dialogue that hopefully will never stop - a positive dialogue about that horrible day.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Powerful, gut-wrenching, emotional work","When the screening of ""United 93"" came to an end last week, several members of the San Diego Film Critics Society commented that this would be a very difficult film to review.I concur with those sentiments, but I had no problem giving this a high recommendation. It's not an easy film to watch, but I believe people should see it, if not as a tribute to those who died, then as a remembrance that due vigilance is constantly necessary in these dark times.Some may disagree and call it ""propaganda,"" but that is patently ridiculous.Based on the United Airlines Flight 93, the fourth U.S. jet hijacked on Sept. 11, 2001 (and the only liner not to strike its intended target), this movie has the intentional feel of a documentary, and is thus difficult to really criticize.Much of this reasoning is that the picture tells a straight enough story, with little or no dramatic embellishments (other than to speculate what exactly took place on-board the doomed craft) in real time, from take-off to its ultimate crash, approximately 90 minutes.What there is, however, is a moving, powerful, gut-wrenching, emotional work by director/writer Paul Greengrass (""Bourne Supremacy,"" ""Resurrected,"" ""Bloody Sunday""). Nevertheless, he will no doubt take some heat form some uninitiated film-goers who equate this movie with a piece of propaganda, but that could not be further from the truth.Greengrass plays it fairly even down the line, and cockpit voice recordings, as well as last phone calls from passengers and crew seem to indicate his vision of the plane's hijacking seem pretty close to factual.Of course, no one is going to know 100 percent of what happened aboard flight 93, since no one survived its ultimate crash in Shanksville, Penn. at 10:05 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001. However, this much is true: Four terrorists, led by Saeed Al Ghamdi (Lewis Alsamari), forcibly commandeered the aircraft and most likely killed or disabled the crew, Capt. Jason Dahl (J.J. Johnson) and First Officer LeRoy Homer (Gary Commock), as well as one or more passengers.One of the hijackers, Ahmed Al Haznawi (Omar Berdouni) has brandished a fake bomb, which keeps the passengers at bay long enough for Ghamdi to turn the San Francisco-bound craft east towards Washington, DC.Stunned by the events, but believing them to be completely isolated, the passengers are shocked to discover  via cell and air phone conversations  that planes have already smashed into the World Trade Center's Twin Towers and the Pentagon.They now realize this is not a hostage situation, that the flight is to be used as a missile against an unknown target, and they will probably not escape with their lives.It's then that the passengers, mainly Todd Beamer (David Alan Basche, ""War of the Worlds"") Joseph DeLuca (Ray Charleston, ""Out For A Kill""), Jeremy Glick (Peter Herman, ""The Treatment"") and Mark Bingham (Cheyenne Jackson, ""Curiosity""), attempt to retake the plane.And while these scenes are gripping enough, the real fascination (for this scribbler, at least) comes from the segments in which the various civilian and military air traffic controllers, as well as other technicians, come to the cold realization that something horrible and unprecedented is taking place in the nation's skies that autumn morning.The drama that builds as controllers scramble to identify possible hijacked planes (American Airline Flight 11 and United 175), and their investigation into 93's dilemma, is excruciatingly tense.""United 93"" also exposes some serious miscommunication between civilian and military authorities, with no one knowing much of anything until it is way too late.Another interesting touch is that Greengrass chose not to populate the picture with big names, which would have diluted the impact (in fact, several roles are actually played by real ATC personnel, recreating the positions they held in 2001 for this movie).This is not an easy film to watch, but I could not look away. And while some make scoff at the conclusions made by Greengrass, this is nevertheless a moving and thought-provoking piece of work.",9.0,Anonymous,History
It's hard to even find words to comment.........,"I'll start off by saying when I first heard a movie being made about this I was a bit annoyed. I was thinking it was just some stupid director/company trying to make a buck about a horrible day in the history of the United States of America. After finding out a bit more I shed my ignorance.My girlfriend and I decided to watch this film tonight, which I just finished about an hour ago. Throughout the whole movie I felt as if I was just seconds away from tears. I felt like crying from sadness, anger, and fear.....all together. What I saw tonight I don't even classify as a movie, at least not in the traditional sense.Well, as I've said I find it hard to describe the actual movie. Everyone knows what it's about. I don't think there was one minute where either my girlfriend or I were grabbing each other readying ourselves for what we knew was about to happen.I know this is all rambling, but I'll give you a lot of credit if you can try to write coherently after seeing this. This is a film that I suggest every American see. Whether or not you had the same feelings as I did at first. What happened on September 11 is a part of all of us, whether we accept it or not. And as horrible as it is to remember and see what happened that day, it's a good reminder of who we are, where we are, and most importantly - we aren't guaranteed any set amount of time in this life.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Does this movie make you feel like you were on United 93? Check my review,"This tragic true story is one of the most horrific movies to hit the big screen. It will literally keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Even though you already know how the movie will end, you still get that sick feeling in your stomach from looking at these horrifying events. There is that little voice inside thinking how the hell you would act in a situation like this one.Director Paul Greengrass who directed ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""Bloody Sunday"" says, ""It tells the story of the day through a meticulous reenactment of events in the belief that by examining this single event something much larger can be found- the shape of our world today.""This story is very upsetting for people like me due to the fact that I felt sick, queasy, and on the verge of throwing up. In my opinion the whole plot seemed pretty accurate to me, but since reviews are not just based on that, the reason I gave it a low rating is due to the acting and directing skills. This whole movie is filled with a huge amateur acting cast and if it weren't for the strong true full story about 9/11 this production would be garbage.See trailer of Flight 93 at http://www.flight93.net/index.php",6.0,Anonymous,History
Really Good,"I saw it and thought it was really good, you could get the feel of the tension and the emotions running the the passengers and their families, i would highly recommend it to anyone who wants the truth about what happened on the fourth plane that day in 2001. All the actors did extremely well in understanding what the characters felt and how they reacted, i thought it was also very sad, because you know their fate, and you know whats going to happen to them as they ask their families whether to try and take the plane or not. This film will put everything in perspective about the way the passengers felt and how they reacted, how they got together and formed a plan to try and stop the pilot from flying to and into its destination.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Typical!,"Over it was a good movie, but i just think it was awful that some one decided to make an entertainment piece out the whole ordeal, movies like this make me sick (pearl harbor). the acting was decent and well thought out. no necessary special effects were needed so thats a place i cant comment on. I found it honorable that they donated a percentage to the flight 93 fund, which was only for the opening weekend though. other than the fact that the making of the movie was too soon i cant say much of anything else. Who knew those heartless, shameless, money grubbing bastards in Hollywood could make such a sensitive and fabulous moving film? United 93 is a very straightforward, stripped down retailing of the events on that fateful day. How much of it is true or fabricated, I don't know, but I don't think that's as important as the love and care that went into creating this. It's almost never too soon to see such an excellent and stunning piece of film-making as this. This is clearly the first great movie of 2006.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Will be on my film of the year list, I'm sure of it","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsA re-enactment of the terrifying events abroad United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11 2001, as several suicide bombers took control of the plane and attempted to crash it into The Pentagon. Due to the courage and determination of a group of passengers, the plane never reached it's target but unfortunately all the passengers on board were killed. Juxtaposed with this story is that of those working in the control tower and their desperate struggle to maintain order and their sanity as the terrifying events unravel.The five years since the biggest act of terrorism America (and indeed the world) has ever witnessed have flown by. And film-makers (and potential film-makers) have actually shown an admirable deal of restraint in waiting so long before inevitably a film detailing these events was made. It's a controversial project that Paul Greengrass has taken on but from this, you get the impression no-one could have done it better if they'd tried.United 93 is such a brilliant film because I struggle to think of a film that has succeeded so well in what it was setting out to do before. Because of the subject matter, it could never be described as an 'enjoyable' film, but it re-creates what must have happened on board that flight so meticulously it is genuinely almost as if you were actually on board the flight yourself at the time. There's no Hollywood style sensationalism or sentimentality, those trapped on board and those scurrying around on the ground all behave as humanly and realistically as though they were re-enacting a story on Crimewatch, their disbelief and horror captured magically. Even the terrorists themselves are given a wonderfully human edge, as we see their fear and apprehension, without ever being made to pity them the way we pity the other passengers. Their brilliantly human behaviour makes the tension on board the plane absolutely palpable and, as I said, feeling as though you could just as easily have been on board the plane with them.It's a lot of little things that roll United 93 along. The opening featuring an overhead of the New York skyline at night as we hear Muslim prayers being sung by the terrorists in their rented hotel rooms gives a creepy and quietly foreboding sense that the big, bustling city where so many people are walking about minding their business and no one suspects a thing is under threat, the use of a digital camera, adding immeasurably to the 'real' feel the film has and the sudden ending which doesn't delve into the aftermath and make the film become sappy in any way. The film-makers set out to achieve a desired result and they got it spot on with this. If it's not still on my top ten list by the end of the year, something really brilliant will have to come along to knock it off. Never an easy or enjoyable film, but a brilliantly real one that genuinely plays as though someone recorded the events on board that plane for real and played them back to a shocked audience (though such a thing wouldn't be empirically possible, of course!) An absolute must-see. *****",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Devastating, but to what end?","I'm a fan of ""Bloody Sunday"" and a high admirer of director Paul Greengrass even though I see this film as far removed from a masterpiece.It's excruciatingly painful, at times very effective. Greengrass has a gift for enveloping an audience and providing it with a visceral movie-going experience. His hand-held camera is not the gimmicky trick of so many other directors, but a tool to drop viewers into the middle of confusing, horrific chaos.But is this enough to make the case for a great film or even an important one? Some professional reviewers have based their overwhelming praise only on how the film made them feel -- devastated, glum, fearful, pained. It made me feel those ways, too. But the impact of the film is in the name of what? There has not been a terribly persuasive review to seriously contemplate that question or at least make a convincing case for the answer.Greengrass has received a lot of points for what he didn't do in this film. It's not a cheap overtly exploitative film; it doesn't use big stars; it strives for the feeling of authenticity using many non-actors, some of whom were even part of September 11. That's an achievement and points to some real artistic and personal integrity on his part, but it still doesn't make a case for a significantly worthwhile film.""United 93"" should not be considered a masterpiece simply because Denzel Washington hasn't been cast as the leader of the passengers and the music doesn't swell up when they fight back.The film is deliberately stripped of all political and historical context to provide one director/writer's perspective of what could have occurred on United 93 that terrible day. The film's only relief from the claustrophobic plane interior is crosscutting to aviation authorities who are baffled over what is taking place.Everything about the film is ""experiential""; it's about what it might have felt like during those horrific hours. And nothing more.It succeeds in providing a feeling of naturalism by avoiding traditional sentimentality, played-up dialogue and familiar character background, but it would be wrong to buy into the idea that Greengrass doesn't have his own agenda.Yes, he goes to great lengths to recreate many physical details and moments: He has talked to the families and other key 9/11 players and reviewed 9/11 documents. But there are large gaps that he fills with scenes meant to prop up the ordinary passengers of United 93 as collective hero.Maybe they were, but all that happened on that flight and why it happened are not known. What we do know is that the passengers of United 93 realized that they would most certainly die had they not fought back. What we do know is that their dangerous effort was their only chance to survive.Did they fight back strictly out of self survival or to spare so many other deaths on the ground or both? Since the passengers' collective heroism is at the center of the film, there is plenty of speculation; we get scenes where the passengers kill terrorists and the group boldly breaks into the cockpit.When the entire justification for a movie is that we must never forget, the reasons for providing details that are not verifiable must be seriously considered. United 93 has taken on mythological proportions since September 11. I maintain that Greengrass does not mean to truly debunk that mythology but to give it more gravity.The movie's first half hour or so stirs up unimaginable dread in the audience. Greengrass does a masterful job in showing ordinary people preparing to take an ordinary flight. Since we know how it will turn out, the palpable horror builds slowly but surely. And since we do not identify with these passengers, we're simply waiting for a hell we know is certain to take place. It's unbearable, but is it justified? Is it enlightening or edifying in any significant way or does it simply fill us with visceral fear?Greengrass makes these moments even harder to take by the little pieces of conversation we overhear among passengers and crew. Many of them talk about children or trips they are going to take. The conversations have a non-movieish ring of ""ordinary,"" but they also become a piercing reminder of what these people unknowingly are about to leave behind or will never be able to experience. Isn't it possible that one of them also talked about the Yankees or the traffic or something that wouldn't blatantly remind us of a shockingly shortened life?Like ""United 93,"" other movies have focused on minutiae, but the best of them have built to something larger and monumental. ""Shoah,"" the marathon documentary about the Holocaust, is the best example. Director Claude Lanzmann asks detailed, mundane questions that build in mind and feeling of experience over the course of many hours. The enormity of the Holocaust slowly accumulates so that the movie becomes much ""larger"" than the questions that are asked.But ""United 93"" does the opposite. It doesn't build to something larger by focusing on mundane details. It removes political and historical context from a dark historic day and shrinks 9/11 down to making its audience live out a hellish last plane ride with ordinary people.With all context missing in this film, what then does it really say about 9/11, and is there any reason to take this trip with them? Greengrass is such a good filmmaker and has us so devastated that we can't stop shaking long enough to realize the answer to these two important questions are not that much and no.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Cliché Ridden Garbage,"All the glowing reviews of this make me question if I saw the same film as the rest of you.What I saw was chockablock full of disaster movie clichés and terribly annoying quick camera movements, obviously there to maximise drama and forcefully grasp at heart strings. This is attempted to such a degree that it becomes literally slapstick. How many of these passengers and crew narrowly miss missing the flight? Whether it be by being late, being transfered or almost choosing not to go? How many of these passengers and crew have small children, if not brand new babies? It seemed as though all of them did.I do grant that the terribly unsatisfying drama above connects events, newscasts, phone messages and conversations which are accurately replicated from the information seen on the many documentaries made about the horrific events of that day, but these alone do not suffice for a film.There is nothing to gain from this film (aside money for it's producers and some national pride). There is no moral to this story, No entertainment value, It's not informative.This event is an important one to be remembered as it has shaped the world in which we live today.

Public opinion will kill it,"This films gives us an insight at the lesser known aspect of September 11th, Flight 93's mysterious crash. The story is told excellently, with strong performances from unknown actors. This makes it all more believable, and leaves a bigger impact on us. Can you picture a famous figure such as Brad Pitt standing up against terrorists in such a serious drama? The problem with this type of film is that Americans, for the most, are not ready for this, and thus the film will be the target of much criticism trashing this movie, because it is too 'soon'. Didn't Apocalypse Now come out not a few years after the Vietnam war? The politics behind this movie will kill its reputation, and an excellent movie will be forgotten, much like last year's Jarhead.Overall an excellent movie, I'm really looking forward to more of these such as the upcoming World Trade Center. 8/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Powerful - Works like a gripping documentary,"If there were no political context to the story, this movie would still be a riveting suspense. From start to finish, it works like a well-made documentary, carefully focused on what happened and when. Throughout, the camera puts the viewer into the scene. The realism is complete.""United 93"" presents in fact two stories, unfolding simultaneously. The first concerns the events aboard the flight itself. The second concerns the reactions of flight controllers and military authorities on the ground. Many of these latter characters were played in the movie by the actual people. In both stories, the film carefully shows how all these people came to the realization of what was happening that morning. This is the film's leitmotif.I highly recommend this movie to everyone, regardless of political viewpoint. Without editorials, the movie simply tells the story. If it has any angle, it is the confusion and slow reaction of government employees on the ground. I don't think it is ""too early"" to make such a movie and I didn't find this movie exploitative. (""From Here to Eternity"" was made in less time, and no one claimed it was exploitative.) If art has a purpose, it surely is to engage a public conversation of events around us. This movie will certainly inspire discussion. As I walked out of the cinema in Montreal, people were already talking.",7.0,Anonymous,History
An important film for our time,"This film will tell the story of United 93, the last of the four hijacked aircraft of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. By accounts, this will be a very intense and well-told drama.By a quirk of fate Flight 93 was delayed on the runway at Newark airport for 45 minutes. By the time it was airborne, the other three planes had reached their intended targets. As a result, the forty passengers and crew on board Flight 93 were the first to inhabit our new and terrifying post 9/11 world.The terrible dilemma those passengers faced is the same we have been struggling with ever since. Do we sit passively and hope this all turns out okay? Or do we fight back and strike at them before they strike at us? And what will be the consequences if we do? That is why the story of Flight 93 continues to command our attention. Although we can only dimly understand what must have happened on that ninety minute flight, we can know from the two dozen phone calls and from the 30 minutes of Cockpit Voice recordings that it dramatizes and symbolizes everything that we face today.Made with the full support of the families of those on board, FLIGHT 93 will track in real time the dramatic story of what happened inside the aircraft as well as on the ground, as passengers, crew, Civilian Air Traffic Controllers and Military Command Centers struggle to make sense of an unimagined and unimaginable crisis.The film begins on a normal September morning at Newark airport. Crew members prepare for a routine commuter flight to San Francisco. They make safety checks, assign tasks, fuel the plane. Passengers arrive, check in, make last minute calls to colleagues and families before boarding the plane. As the cabin doors are hermetically sealed they all believe that everything is normal. That they are safe from the dangers of a turbulent world. But sitting in four first class seats right next to them is an Al Qaeda cell.And so as the hijack unfolds, the film moves between the passengers and crew in the air and civilian and military air traffic controllers on the ground as each tries desperately to avert the flight's progress towards the Capitol Building in the heart of Washington D.C.""Flight 93"" will take us through the events of 9/11 as they happen in real time - all the confusion, violence, courage and endurance of a day that changed our lives forever.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Intense and brilliant,"There weren't many notes you could take, whether it be in the equilibrious opening or the terrifying denouement, that can describe the feelings you endure along United 93. Ample publicity has been sold on Paul Greengrass' new movie, debating the veracity of its story and whether there was a need for it to be made in the first place. How soon is too soon? How long did America wait to tell of Vietnam's nightmares? You would have been forgiven for thinking it blasphemous to even entertain the idea of shooting a movie on 9/11, yet despite the controversy United 93 is here, and will attract an audience regardless (or maybe even as a result of) its negative press.Shot in real time, on digital camera, United 93 begins with showing us the terrorists making their final morning prayers, before setting off to the airport. There are no handsome grins, nor are there nasty frowns. These men, if anything, look more terrified than you ever could. Their intentions are hidden behind an obvious human front that continually puts them at odds with themselves. We then shift to the airport's other passengers, none of which are ever given an emotional edge to them. As the film goes on we visit the men and women behind the running of the airwaves  particularly those responsible for what should happen in case of emergencies. Many of the actors betraying these people are the people themselves, who were there on that tragic day. Using non-actors gives Greengrass' film an authentic breeze of dialogue and behaviour, that never seems forced or embellished. Whilst we never truly get a feel for any individual character we believe every word they say, and truly understand the circumstances they were put in as the tragedies unfolded. We learn how difficult it was to get in touch with the White House, when the people needed their government the most. We also learn of the confusion experienced as these planes went strangely off course before any conclusive knowledge of a hijacking had been established. But the film's biggest power lies in the chilling reenactment of the fate of flight 93. All forms of dramatic irony are completely dropped. We can feel an unease just by the soft, subtle touch of the film's score. During the opening the characters act like any man would in these types of totally conventional circumstances. Greengrass does not incorporate a view of hindsight for his audience, instead allowing the film to flow in the moment, with each passing event happening as the characters read it, rather than what the audience already knows occurred. It isn't a movie that allows much headway for dramatic convention, nor does it satisfy are needs for entertainment (which, perhaps, is what Titanic was aiming to do). All it ever tries to do, and what it achieves in great effect, is a tribute to the courage and bravery of of the passengers and staff aboard United 93.Paul Grenngrass' masterpiece is the anti-Titanic: there are no star-crossed lovers, no dastardly bad guys, no romantic journeys and absolutely zero poetic license. This is as frighteningly real as a movie gets. The characters of United 93 are so authentic it verges on the mundane at times. As the film is shot in real time, it certainly tests the patience of this eras' ever demanding audience (my idiot of a brother had the audacity to walk out after 30 minutes), but I urge all of you to stick with it. The characters aren't meant to have depth, nor are they meant to go through life-affirming changes. The film is a fine illustration, similar to the faux-documentaries that Greengrass directed in his native Britain, that documents the haunting ordeal induced by the passengers, and their subsequent bravery in attempting to foil the terrorists. The final sequence is one of the most terrifying set-pieces ever put on film, managing to raise every strand on my body to an electric edge, as the passengers desperately try to kick down the cabin door when, in one blisteringly quick moment of hope, you actually believed they can prevent it. That they can save themselves. And for this reason alone, it is a masterful piece of work, deserving of the highest praise a film can receive. Regardless of what your stance was before the film was released, United 93 is a film you have to see. You owe it to the people it illustrates, in fittingly faux-reality style, and whose bravery it commends. As a film reviewer all I could ever ask of a film is to work as a piece of art. That is all anyone should ever ask. It is, at times, worrying, distressing, haunting and terrifying. But never wrong.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"""United 93"" is a powerful and emotional film that stays loyal to the events and people involved in the September 11th terrorist attacks.","""United 93"" is the first big screen movie version of September 11, 2001. The film focuses on the entire terrorist attack however its main focus is flight 93 which was the last plane that the terrorists took over. This film shows what happened on that unforgettable day and how one flight of incredibly brave people stood up for themselves in an attempt to save their lives. A respectful and powerful film ensuesThis is probably going to be one of my shortest reviews ever because everyone in the world knows of September 11, 2001 and this film just basically tells the story of one flight and the people on board who stood up against the terrorists in an attempt to save their lives. With that being said, I will admit this movie was a lot more powerful than I believed it could be. The image of the two planes crashing into the Twin Towers is a powerful image, but at the same time it is overused and I liked that this film didn't make the Twin Towers its main focus.What I did like is that the film focuses on all the events of 9/11 however the main focus is on this United 93 flight. What this film did was it took you inside this flight and showed all the events that went on. From the four terrorists involved to the all 40 people who were on the flight. The story is very powerful and dramatic yet very respectable for those who lost their lives in this flight.The thing that made this film work the best is probably the no name cast because it made the film feel more authentic and believable. This is why I am having a problem with the second 9/11 film because it's being directed by Oliver Stone and starring Nicolas Cage. This film worked for a number of reasons but one of the main reasons it worked was because of the no name cast and a director who very few people know about. This really did make an impact. I bet you watch this same movie with Hollywood celebrities in place of the no name cast and you will feel like you're watching a totally different movie. That's why I predict the Oliver Stone project will fail.Another thing I liked about this film was that the director and writer Paul Greengrass took the time to ask the family members about whether or not he should do the film. And after he got permission from the family members, he did his research on the subject. The problem with many films that are based on true events and that Hollywood creates are very far-fetched and not like the actual event however with ""United 93"" I felt it was very realistic and very loyal to actual events. I am not saying that some of it wasn't probably thrown in for a dramatic effect but for the most part since the director did his homework and asked family members, I feel it's a generally a fact based film.In conclusion, I really can't say anything bad about ""United 93"" because it was a powerful, respectable, and emotional film based off of the tragic events. I think this is a film that everyone should see and it will probably be a film that will be shown in history classes for many years to come. I can't say that I loved this film because it's not that type of movie. I can't picture having someone say wow I loved that movie, lets watch it again soon. It's a great movie based on a dramatic piece of History that has changed the world forever. It's a must see for everyone.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""United 93"" is a 9/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
a harrowing cinematic experience,"I only recently saw this film on DVD as my partner refused to see it as the whole September 11 event had a big impact on him. I've never been overly sentimental about what happened. I didn't see it live on TV like many I know (including my partner), and as I am on the other side of the world I felt far enough removed for it to be little more than merely a shocking and surreal event. So I came to watch this film by myself, in a comfortable armchair, the day before I was to fly to Melbourne, and it left me devastated. As many have noted, the final 10 minutes are unbelievably tense. Yes you know the outcome, but the matter-of-fact, documentary-like way in which the events are presented allowed me access to this tragedy in a way I had previously been unable to manage. As the list of mistakes and oversights on the part of the Aviation authorities, airlines and military grows, so too does the tension, as the film marches towards it's inevitable conclusion. The helplessness of all involved and the seemingly naiive disbelief that something like this could possibly happen makes United 93 extremely unnerving. On display is some of the most remarkable sound design and editing I have ever seen. This is one of the most brilliantly constructed films I have ever seen. Greengrass should have received an Oscar for this film. And United 93 should have at least been nominated for Best Picture, if not taken out the category. I have never been emotionally affected by a film this way. And it achieves this effect without any exploitation or manipulation of events. Truly, this is cinema or the highest order and an important film to experience.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Ridiculous, a Total Work of Fiction","The makers of this film know about as much about what happened on that day as I do, which is next to nothing. We really don't even know for certain if anyone on that plane brought it down. If you really think about it, how incompetent would the military have to be to let this plane even approach Washington. Two planes had already crashed in New York. They had plenty of time to intercept this plane.A jumbo jet travels substantially slower than the speed of sound. Fighter jets can travel at Mach 2. Even if they didn't shoot it down, I would think it would have been shot down before it ever reached Washington. But if you think about it for a second, what better PR stunt for Washington is there than a ""heroic"" crew taking down a plane to save Washington. People, you're watching a PR stunt gone totally out of control. Some people have too much patriotism and too little common sense.As I see it there are 3 possible reasons the plane went down. Either the hijackers brought it down, the passengers took control and couldn't handle it, or it was shot down. Any way you slice it, I don't think the passengers did anything heroic per se. They tried to save their own lives but were unable to succeed. Brave, maybe. Heroic, no. The passengers took action to save their lives only when they knew it would be hopeless otherwise. Their actions were rational in their attempts at self-preservation. But it would be incredibly naive or incredibly patriotic (same thing) to view their actions as any attempt to ""save Washington."" People who think that need to get a grip.For the above reasons, this movie is simply a plane hijacking flick. Nothing more, nothing less. It certainly was not a good action flick. If you want to see a movie overflowing with fear and human emotion, this is the one for you. Just don't let that emotion get the better of you. This is a work of fiction, very loosely based on the events of that day.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Shattering and worth seeing,"""United 93"" tells the story of the one flight on 9/11 that did not hit its designated target because of the heroism of the passengers. Writer/director Paul Greengrass tells the story documentary-style, with many of the actual airline and military personnel taking part in the filming.There were many New York actors whom I recognized, but most people won't be cognizant at all that they're watching actors.Several things emerge as especially striking. The first is how completely blindsided we were and because the situation was so horrible, how long it took to realize what was going on. The second was the realization among the passengers, quietly growing, that this was it. The third is the no-nonsense activism of the passengers, who just weren't going to sit still and take it. What brave people they were.The most incredible part of ""United 93"" is the special feature where each actor meets the family of the person they're playing. To see how the families have coped over the years and what the film meant to them made for extremely emotional viewing.I noticed a few of the comments said that it was understandable if someone couldn't watch this movie, and of course, it is. I had to ask myself why I was willing to watch it. I guess because I believed that all the victims of 9/11 weren't victims at all, but very special people. You won't doubt that after you watch the film or the special feature.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Excellent, intense and shocking!","United 93 touched my heart many times. I'm from Sweden and when i saw the News that day, i was in shock. It wasn't just a act of terror to the US, it was an Act against the world. Even if I'm a guy and i didn't know anyone in New York, i cried. When i saw united 93 i 'felt it again. This movie showed me what really happened on that day, on that very flight. How the cold terrorists hijacked the plane and how the Heroic passengers fought back. To me they are true heroes. They probably saved thousand of life that day. This movie is a must see, even if it didn't have anything to do with you, see it. The fear of the passengers and also from the terrorists where shown with greatness from the producers. I will never forget this movie as for the day when it all happened.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Masterpiece,"United 93 (2006)**** (out of 4)It's really hard to judge this ""movie"" because I'm really not sure it was made for ""entertainment"" reasons. As technically brilliant as the film was, I think the power of the story is in the fact that it's all true and the viewer it overly familiar with the events. There was a lot of debate on whether people were ready for a story on 9/11 and I thought they were. After seeing the film I somewhat wished I hadn't watched it. The 9/11 events are a bit too sensitive for me and this film was pretty much too well made and there were several moments where I turned my head to the side not wanting to watch anymore. The theater had around 100 people there and I've never heard such a quiet crowd. Before the movie, during the movie and then after the movie. Dead silence. Since the film wasn't made for entertainment and it's hard to view it that way, I'm not sure what the reasoning is. I know it's very doubtful I'll ever watch this again but I guess the film does serve a purpose in the fact that we shouldn't forget what the passengers did. I don't think seeing this movie will make me remember any better so in the end I'm really not sure if it was worth sitting through because of the emotional level it brought me to.",,Anonymous,History
Finale weakened by use of Cinema Verite style...,"UNITED 93 would have been a much more powerful film if all of the airborne scenes aboard the doomed plane matched the clarity and intensity of the ground control scenes which are the most intense and best edited sections of the whole film. Instead, the director has opted for shaky hand-held camera movement and blurry fast-cut moments to obscure what happens when the passengers decide to revolt. This considerably weakens and defeats what otherwise would have been a brilliant film.After all the build-up to that final moment when the passengers decide to do something about their fate in the hands of hi-jacking terrorists, there is a distinct letdown in the way these moments are portrayed, in ""cinema verite"" style with intentionally shaky camera movement, blurry action hiding the possibility of viewing anything clearly. It's as though the camera is on fast forward for the whole uprising event without anyone able to make out what is actually going on.This, and the fact that we learn nothing whatsoever about any of the passengers--making them complete non-entities--is what ruins the film for me. Seeing them in a huddle whispering things like ""Two planes went into the World Trade Center"" is not sufficient dramatic device to make these events tangible to the average audience. Only those who were close to this event or had personal connection to it through relatives, will find this sufficiently chilling.A big disappointment to me as a film. I don't think the Academy will be voting this into the winner's circle at Oscar time.On the plus side, the music is dramatically appropriate and does add to the intense quality of many scenes. All of the control tower sequences are better staged and directed than the passenger moments when they decide ""to roll"". That is the film's weakest link. It ends with a whimper instead of a bang, defeated by the director's choice to use cinema verite style for the most explosive scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,History
As real as can be,"I was at the Tribeca Film Festival premier of United 93. This movie was thoroughly researched and filmed accordingly. ALL of the air controllers that speak are genuine and many were the ones on duty 9/11.The movie pilot, J J Johnson, is a United Airlines pilot. The command center scenes with Ben Sliney included real air controllersThe military scenes were staffed with real military personnel. Many of these people were on duty 9/11. This movie is real and authentic. The actors portraying passengers and crew were superb and unless you are willing to sit through a week long mini-series, this movie can't be beat.This movie accurately depicts how Tuesday, September 11, 2001 unfolded relative to the flight of United 93.

WARNING: anyone with motion sickness (Blair Witch style) Camera Movement!  TOO MUCH!,"I can only gave the movie a 7 out of 10, because, I missed about 40% of the entire movie due to dizziness from motion sickness.I recommend, don't spend the money, if this is going to be a problem for you. Wait for it on T.V..Aside from the dizziness due to rapidly shaking camera shots, I liked the film. I think almost everyone feels pretty sad at the end, and there were some sobs.The motion sickness, its the same thing that happened a few years ago with Blair Witch. For me, I'd say its about 80% of the severity as Blair Witch. One could say, it makes the movie look more like real life, rather than a Hollywoodization of the real event.

What took so long to make this needed film?,"There's no doubt that United 93 has hit a nerve  on the Left, that is.There's been a lot of whining about the trailer of the new Universal film ""United 93."" One theater in Manhattan even pulled it because of complaints.The phrase about this film that keeps popping up on liberal Web sites is ""too soon."" The strange thing is when the trailer aired at the Chinese Theater in Hollywood, the identical phrase was echoed.After seeing the movie, I have quite a different take. What took so long? I am grateful to Paul Greengrass for using his hand-held camera to create this starkly real tribute. Re-enacted in the film is the remarkable bravery of the passengers aboard the Boeing 757, which was headed for San Francisco on September 11, 2001, only to crash in a Pennsylvania field as citizen soldiers stepped forward to thwart the fourth would-be missile attack in the 9/11 terror scheme.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"very REAL, emotional, intense... WELL DONE!","OK, first off let's get one thing straight here... When Americans do something stupid (which under the Bush administration seems to be more often than not it seems - and YES I can blame the average American for Bush's actions... YOU VOTED HIM IN A SECOND TIME DARNIT!!!, although I KNOW, I KNOW it was a close election... but still!), I am readily glad to blast them on whatever stupid thing they've done this time. But this movie was profoundly REAL and moving and immensely well done, and is NOT AT ALL portrayed as some macho-American patriotic garbage. IF IT WAS, BELIEVE ME I WOULD BE ONE OF THE FIRST TO BLAST THE CRAP OUT OF IT!!! *I believe this movie stayed true and tried to portray (and DID portray) as accurately as possible (with the knowledge and evidence we know and have today) the events of that day as they unfolded... It was scary, intense, emotional, and VERY REAL!!! One of the most interesting scenes i think is when you see the passengers on the plane praying the ""hail marry"" and ""our father"" prayers (christianity) because they are scared they might die, while AT THE SAME TIME the hijackers (Muslims) are saying their prayers to Allah because they think they are doing righteous work (or whatever). I thought this was VERY poignant. The things humans do, say, and act upon (ON ALL SIDES!) all in the name of ""THIER GOD"" I think is total bullshit period!!! Allah doesn't want Muslims to commit murder and blow themselves and innocent bystanders up, and Jesus doesn't want Catholics to go on crusades and try and convert the world!!! Give me a *$%^ing break!!! Get a life everyone!!! Anyways, in terms of the movie... WELL DONE! 5 *'s Peace.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent!,"**** (out of ****) I saw this film at a free advance screening in Atlanta tonight and it was excellent-definitely one of the best films of the year so far. The tension and suspense are almost unbearable. The film's documentary style makes it seem like you are on the plane with these people. It was a very moving tribute to those who perished that fateful day. The opening scenes inspire a sense of dread as you see the passengers boarding the plane, as well as the scenes inside the FAA and NORAD centers which illustrated the almost criminal lack of communication between the two groups.Many people may choose to not see this film, and that is understandable. However, for those who are curious, be prepared for an emotionally draining but worthwhile look at what may have taken place that day.",10.0,Anonymous,History
But is it entertaining?,"This was definitely a film worth seeing, and very intense. However, it is a double-edged sword when you make the movie so ""documentary-like."" On the one hand, it treats the subjects with an enormous amount of respect, stays as objective as it can, and appears to be an accurate portrayal of what happened on that incredibly sad day in America. On the other hand, it's a little slow and dry, as there are no other ""dramatic"" sub-plots, etc. This film actually reminded me a bit of ""Downfall"" (Der Untergang) which came out last year and showed Hitler's last days. In the sense that it's extremely meticulous and informative. But is it entertaining? Not very much so. Someone could successfully argue that a film like this should NOT be entertaining, and I would probably agree with them. But if we're gauging our like/dislike rating on a ""satisfying film experience,"" I'm not sure United 93 deserves all the acclaim that it's getting.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This movie seems like propaganda,"I feel the movie should have focused more time on the missing wreckage in that field in Shanksville. Since this was a documentary style movie, a ""real-time"" account of what happened aboard F93, then I think it should have showed how the plane crashed. Surely, the flight data recorder could specify exactly at what altitude the plane ""flipped"" upside down and started its descent, nose first. Show the non-existence of wreckage, show the footage aired worldwide within an hour of the crash, showing nothing, no remnants of thousands of gallons of jet fuel. Show the crash scene up close. Show all the fire trucks arriving, with no fire to put out. This movie only suits to solidify the lie that a plane crashed where the gov't said it did, making it some kind of blasphemy to questions these people's apparent deaths.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A must watch!,My god! The last 15 mins of this movie alone makes it worthwhile your time. The climax is possibly the most thrilling and at the same time most sad and poignant few minutes committed to film. I was at the edge of my seat and could barely watch. Leaves you breathless. The craft displayed by Paul Greengrass in the final minutes is unmatched in its quality till date. The courage displayed by ordinary people onboard united 93 is to be saluted and remembered forever.,10.0,Anonymous,History
Painful watching but still a great movie.,"Its hard to rate this movie. Just as hard it is to watch. From a film critic point of view. Its outstanding. I actually wasn't impressed by Greengrass's Bourne Supremacy. The camera work was too shaky. But here, its done with a masterpiece touch to it. Like allot of viewers before me, it really felt like i was on that plane. Even the pre-hijacking process of boarding a plane and all the other things involved with flying is done very well. Which makes this feel even more tragic. I for the life of me can't understand some of the (very few i might say) negative reviews of this film. Reading the Yahoo movie section, there are quite a few nut-cases reviewing this. Anyone who lives in the NYC area can't possibly feel that way about this movie. The one image that still haunts me, is the scene after the flight takes off and the plane angles around Manhattan, and in the one window, you see the top of the Twin Towers. How many times i have flown from Newark and watched that same image. And know that it won't ever be seen again.",,Anonymous,History
"Respectful, tense, safe homage","I approached this film with some trepidation. The US is notoriously flawed, simplistic and introspective in it's international perspective. So I was prepared for a flag waving, navel gazing,sentimental tale safely geared for the home market. I was wrong to do so.Greengrass tells the story straight in real time, and produces a powerful, restrained tale.Several of the performances are by the real people on the ground, giving it an authenticity which is the hallmark of the production.The temptation to demonise the hi jackers is avoided, as is the temptation to flesh out the plane victims characters, and backgrounds, for dramatic effect. Balance wins here, dramatic effect however is reduced.The overall feel is one of a well produced documentary .As such it is a fitting tribute to the people who were unwilling, but heroic, participants in one of the most extraordinary days in modern history. The lack of sensationalism and judgement loses some dramatic power opportunities, but wins in terms of credibility. As an historic document of that day - it is a triumph.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Why do women dislike this movie?,"I have finally seen this movie. I had alternated between wanting to see it and avoiding it somewhat. I guess I knew that it would put me through the wringer again and probably tick me off mightily again. But in the end I realized that avoiding the reality of 9-11 and its results was, in some ways, being like the people who don't want to even think about or be reminded about what happened that day.My second concern was that it might be hyped-up or Hollywood-ized too much. I can emphatically state that that is NOT the case.I remember all the news coverage from 9-11 and how much it all focused on what the people on the ground went through. I always used to think about the airline passengers more, and what THEY had to go through. This movie shows just that.But - why, in every age category, do women rate this movie lower than men? I am curious what others think about this. I believe avoiding acknowledging what happened is a very poor way to deal with it. Do women tend to want to ignore the realities of 9-11? Is that it?This movie is by no means fun to watch, but it is very powerful - and, I believe, necessary.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Blakespot Reviews: United 93,"United 93, 2006 6/10, 4th out of 6 movies for 2006, 150th of the 2000's, 450th ranked movie of all timeThis film was very powerful, very moving, very emotional and very well made... but it wasn't really a movie. It is (to my knowledge) a very direct portrayal of the events of September 11th. Much of the first hour of the movie takes place not on the plane, but in air-traffic control rooms on the east coast, as they figure out that these attacks are taking place. The second half of this movie was very powerful. I was very moved watching the people on the plane as they knew that they were likely to die soon, as I think most people who remember September 11th would be. That being said, the first half of the movie was pretty darn boring. I think that the thing is, this isn't really a movie. There aren't really characters, or a plot, or dialouge. Their more just trying to show something that happened in the most direct way possible. That being said I'd still recommend seeing it once in your life.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Disturbinly realistic.,"When you think of 9/11, you immediately think of the burning twin towers. The WTC has become a sort of an almost symbolic icon for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Flight 93 and flight 77 (the plane that hit the Pentagon) are always sort of pushed to the background. ""United 93"" finally tells us the story of what happened on flight 93, the flight we perhaps know the least about and also probably were still are the most questions about. It certainly does justice to all the people who lost their lives that day and shows us an important story which we should never forget.It's very tempting to turn this movie into a sort of heroic and patriotic movie or a typical over-dramatized disaster movie production. Luckily this movie choices a realistic approach. It's an almost documentary like observation of what happened in the sky and on the ground in the control centers. It makes the movie look very real and therefor we can also feel the emotions, fear and confusing, almost as if we were present there that day. The shaky cam, the almost entirely non-experienced cast, it all contributes to the realistic aspects and overall feeling of the movie.The movie doesn't only focuses on what happened on flight 93 but also on the other event of 9/11, in between. Because of this you really get the feeling your back on that faithful day again and makes your re-life the day and remember your first initial emotions.Finally the persons of flight 93 now have a face and personality for the world. Not only the passengers and crew but also the hijackers as well. It makes the events of flight 93 so much more emotional, sensible and powerful. We see the people as ordinary people which we could easily identify ourselves with.But not only the persons are now a lot more clear and known to me but also the rest of the events set around flight 93, such as what happened on the ground in the control centers. It absolutely surprised and stunned me that absolutely no one on the ground was prepared for terrorist attacks or even an hijack. There were no procedures, the communication was poor and basically no one knew how to handle correctly, both civilian personal as the military. It makes you wonder what would had happened if the terrorist attacks were executed on an even larger scale, or what would had happened if America was under a surprise attack by a different nation. Judging by this movie, I don't think they could had prevented anything from happening if it really occurred. I for a fact know that here in the Netherlands it's standard procedure to immediately send out one or two F-16's to intercept a plane if it doesn't make radio contact and this was already the case prior to 9/11. Why didn't the U.S. had standard plans and procedures for this? OK of course the Netherlands is much smaller and doesn't have such a busy and full airspace as the U.S. so perhaps its not entirely fair and logical to compare it but what do I know. My point is that I was amazed that no one in the U.S. had any standard procedures ready for events like this and how completely unprepared they were for any attack on their own soil.Of course we will never fully know what happened on flight 93, so we will also never know how accurate this movie actually is. The movie of course takes lots of liberties and had to improvise a lot but it did this in the most realistic way possible. Paul Greengrass did a great job making this movie and he obviously did it for pure and non-commercial purposes, very much like his previous movie ""Bloody Sunday"" about the Irish civil rights protest march and subsequent massacre by British troops.Not a much talked about element of the movie (and understandably so) is the musical score by John Powell. I thought that it suited the movie and its feeling very well and it was a very subtle, beautiful score. An Oscar-nod perhaps next year for Mr. Powell?An important, powerful movie about an important event in recent history, which we prior to this movie knew yet so little about.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,History

Not many (any) great visual effects, not much action, not very much interesting dialog either. It gives us an illusion of the real-life events occurring as they did and cameras just following the action.Speaking of dialog, in the real world the hijackers had SOME dialog with the passengers? Not very much in this film...I can't really say I was disappointed. The film was everything I expected, in a good sense and in a bad sense.

A significant work of cinematic art about a crucial moment in U.S. history,"Java Man Reviews ""United 93"" (rated R). Written and directed by Paul Greengrass. Starring J.J. Johnson, Ben Sliney, Gregg Henry, David Alan Basche, Christian Clemenson, Becky London, Trish Gates, Cheyenne Jackson & Chip Zien. Running Time: 91 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW:This film follows the brief and fateful journey of United flight number 93 as it takes off from Newark, flies toward San Francisco, suddenly reverses direction while over Cleveland, aims itself at Washington, D.C. and finally crashes in a Pennsylvania field. Exactly what happened during these 91 minutes can never be fully known, but much has been reconstructed from flight recorders, cell phone conversations and interviews of key officials and family members. British writer-director Greengrass incorporates these facts carefully but relies on his own artistic integrity to fill in the missing pieces and provide us with a version of the ""emotional truth."" What we do know is that the passengers of United 93 transformed themselves from a group of strangers to a determined force that prevented the terrorists from hitting their intended target. According to Greengrass, ""they were the first people to inhabit the post-9/11 world."" The film also reenacts simultaneous activities taking place inside the National Air Traffic Control Center, airport towers, regional air control centers, and a military command room. Many of those who were on duty that day portray themselves, including FAA honcho Ben Sliney who ordered the shutdown of all U.S. air traffic.REVIEW: 4 out of 4 Java MugsLet's get one thing out of the way...this is not a ""Hollywood"" movie. There is no exploitation or emotional manipulation of any kind. Every detail of the story is told in the present tense; the narrative only knows what we would know if we were on the plane that day or in one of the flight control centers trying to piece together what was happening. There is no political posturing, no mention of Osama bin Laden, no patriotic speeches and no larger-than-life heroes--just an exhilarating account of ordinary men and women who are suddenly propelled into history and legend.Though an effective ""you are there"" account of what may have actually happened, the film is not a docudrama but an accomplished work of cinematic art. This is certainly the furthest thing from his mind, but Greengrass should be a front runner for a best director nod when the awards season rolls around. The casting is flawless; we have never seen these actors before, so we easily accept them as fellow travelers aboard the fated flight. Also, the flight center and military personnel who portray themselves are vital to the film's authentic feel. Fluid, hand-held camera-work and fast-paced, precise editing also contribute to a feeling of immediacy.This may be difficult for some to watch, but it does portray a crucial moment in U.S. history, a moment we can share as we experience this film --and relive a day we will never forget. What better way to pay tribute to the heroes of United Flight 93 than to create a significant work of cinematic art in their honor?",10.0,Anonymous,History
you know what will happen...,"but this movie was still entertaining. I liked how in the beginning we get a perspective of what the terrorists were going through as they prepared to take their own lives. The actions depicted on the airplane seemed reasonable with what could have happened. Once the hijacked the terrorists over take the cockpit in a very brutal fashion. All the passengers are sequestered at the back of the plane. They make phone calls and find out what has been going on with the world trade center. The high point is when the passengers decide they must try to overtake the hijackers. Unfortunately, we already know the outcome and that they did not have enough time to save the plane.I also liked the idea of showing what went on in the air traffic control rooms across the country. There were confused as to how many planes were hijacked and the military seemed to be disorganized. They couldn't get a straight answer from anyone in the beginning.FINAL VERDICT: Worth seeing. Tells a worth while story of true events that are still emotional watching.",7.0,Anonymous,History

United We Stand.,"Four planes were hijacked on 9/11. Two hit the World Trade Center in New York. Another struck the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. ""United 93"" is a heart-pounding, difficult, tight, taut and chaotic account of the fourth hijacked plane which was headed to the U.S. Capitol building, but crashed instead in an open Pennsylvania field as 40 seemingly ordinary people with nothing in common except a doomed flight banded together and sacrificed themselves to save other innocents. Brutally rough film that is to 9/11 what ""Battleground"", ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" and ""12 O'Clock High"" were to World War II combat in 1949 and what ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Coming Home"" were to Vietnam when released in 1978. Writer/director Paul Greengrass (a British film-maker who is best known for the ""Bourne"" series sequels) goes basically real-time here as he focuses on the disorganization and total shock of that fateful day five years ago. Trish Gates, as one of the flight attendants, Cheyenne Jackson, David Alan Basche and Christian Clemenson are all standouts, but the real stars of ""United 93"" are the camera and the hypnotic dramatic score. Memorable, unforgettable and destined to be an important addition to the cinema, ""United 93"" is a strong production all the way. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,History

A bit hard to read,"United 93 tends to reveal a lot of arguments about why 9/11 happened. While conspiracy theorists speak their minds and patriots vehemently try to discredit them, United 93 is a bit misplaced in this foray.It evokes such a wide array of emotions and responses that one starts to struggle with the true intent of the film. Are we supposed to hate Muslims? Are we supposed to blame the government? Or is this so implausible that this is just some attack to go against what the conspiracy theorists speak out about? It's an interesting quandary, but in the process, Paul Greengrass made a super-realistic film that will certainly spark debate (and in the case of my father, a lot of racist hate). United 93 will most likely be the definitive film on 9/11, even though the whole genre to this event has really yet to be touched. Until something more sinister is brought along, this will be a tribute to those that were in that plane.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The anti-Pearl Harbor,"Finally, a movie which doesn't load itself up with predictable melodramas and attempt to force an emotional reaction out of its audience. United 93 simply told the story as accurately as possible and let the viewers reach their own conclusions. Greengrass (writer/director) realizes that when making a movie about 9/11, it isn't necessary to evoke a reaction, instead he simply lets the events speak for themselves.The movie is done so beautifully simple. We know nothing about the characters except for what we learn about them from their actions on that day. There aren't any typical heroes like you would expect to find in the latest Michael Bay trash. Greengrass simply gives us everyday people in extraordinary situations.As hard as it may be for some to see this movie, I would recommend it to everyone as it is easily the most important movie made yet this year (that last sentence may lose credibility since there haven't been many other important movies this year).",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Terrible and important event, but ordinary movie","This is not a great movie, and this is very sad, because these terrible events deserve one. The cinematography is ordinary, looking to much like a movie for television. Sequences are badly assembled, showing suddenly shoes of a guy walking, insists on an earphone, and big shots on a glass of water. So directing seemed pretty bad to me.It is a pretty hollywoodian movie after all, with lot of insistence, lack of subtleties.People are so emotionally involved when watching those events that it seems that they just can't, for now, see the movie as it is, because we can read so much great things about this movie.I believe it will change, after some years.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Even more realistic than Snakes on a Plane,"Having had this movie recommended from various sources describing it as objective and touching, I decided to check it out for myself. Well, all I can say is that this is one of the most flawlessly executed pure propaganda movies I have ever seen.The subtle shifts in mood via music, pacing and harsher language makes the manipulation you're subjected to almost impossible to catch on to if you're not used to analyzing films. But it's there. It's actually a good idea to pause the movie during the most intense moments, sit and relax and then press play again. You wont necessarily have noticed the shifts and manipulations before but once you press play they'll hit you like a sledgehammer with that patented Hollywood-finesse (You know it. It's the one ranging somewhere between a rabid dog and a rapist).However some flaws were left in. While it was an ingenious (well...) move to use unknown actors with the audience as passive onlookers, it did leave one majer problem for me. Well over half the time, the actors looked as if they were concentrating all their skill and knowhow on not looking into the camera (and, therefore, looking every other possible way and ending up looking kinda desperate). It's the same way with cheap made-for-TV recontructions (...) but if that's your thing...Anyways, the princible question regarding U93 is ""why""? Why even make this movie? We know what happened and ""we""'ve got a pretty good idea why it did. In any case the movie doesn't offer any new twist on it. It seems it's only objective is to fan a flame that the American media have already turned into a roaring inferno with their trademark skills of communication. So why would they make this film? Anyone?Ya'll know what these little fellas mean?: $$$ If you don't, look it up. They're pretty big in Hollywood.I should add to anyone that agrees with me: Relax, it's just a movie and it can't harm you.And to anyone that disagrees: Relax, it's just a review and it can't harm you.

Most important film of the last 10 years.,"America needs this film.We have already forgotten what happened 5 years ago. We all know it happened, we all heard the stories, but we all forgot what it felt like to live through that day. 9/11 has become a memory we tell each other, I was doing this or I was doing that. I could not believe what was happening. But we don't remember what we felt. We have all forgotten the punch to the gut. This film brought back every emotion I had that day. They where not all good emotions. They where emotions of pain, hate, fear and love. This is why this film is important. When you see this film you will be transported back to that day and you will relive it. How is that a bad thing? Is the studio making money? Sure it is. Thats why they make movies people! But what is important is how it is handled. This film was made with the utmost care. In fact most of the actors in the film are playing themselves. The film plays in real time. There are no stars no main characters. No one is introduced there are no back stories to characters they are just there. You are there watching it all unfold. You experience the confusion of the air traffic controllers, the military and the passengers, While they try to handle on the situation never knowing what will happens next, But we do. We know that this will not have a happy ending.If you go to see this film I warn you. You will come out effected.Because the film will have done it's job.

Warning: This film can be gut-wrenching in both senses,"OK ... so how does a film about an essentially American tragedy play in Britain? I think 'good but not great' is the answer. No-one seemed to come out of the cinema sniffing or crying ... but a few stayed rooted to their seats, immobile, as the credits began to roll.This is a good film. Its biggest advantage is its fairness ... all participants are shown as human beings, with emotions, relationships, indecision, and so on. It's made in documentary-style, so don't expect any huge close-ups of reconstructed explosions (thankfully). But the personal stories, brief though they are are very moving - especially when you realise there were SO MANY of them.I went with a friend who was not too familiar with the whole story. I asked him what he thought of the film. He said he had to shut his eyes for much of the second half because it gave him motion sickness. So be warned, the film can be gut wrenching in more ways than one.Hope that helps.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not quite what I expected,"I (like so many others) was extremely skeptical before I went to see this film. My pre-conceptions pictured a huge Hollywood disaster movie walking over the tragic events of 9/11.The first 5 minutes had the audience quiet and expectant showing the kind of direction the film was going to take. It proved to be a far more personal film than expected, developing empathy and understanding of the characters. The plane passengers are matured and a sense of unity is created.The camera work and directing worked to set the mood and make it feel like a real experience. Whilst watching the film, I was drawn into a sense that this was just another day, and these people were normal people. It shows for example, the mundane activities of boarding a plane enforcing the reality by giving the associations we all experience on a flight.Overall, I found the film enjoyable and would recommend this to any film-goer. However, I did have some reservations whilst watching. Although the camera work was very effective in places, emphasising the ongoing confusion, I felt it rather dizzying. The film moves from scene to scene quickly yet build up seems abrasive and slow.Overall, I would give this film 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
These passengers are heroes.,"Unfortunately my English is very poor. Minimum ten lines based in fragments of English language is very hard for me. Even so, I go to try to explain my opinion. I watched United 93 in a movie theater near Paris in France. I liked this film. We can't forget this : this hijacked plane was destined to hit the White House, neither more nor less the heart of USA. Three other hijacked planes reached their targets : WTC and Pentagon. The reaction of the passengers from United 93 against the terrorists, prevented the complete disaster. These passengers are heroes!After the end of the movie, the people present in the room stay in complete silence. No moves, no sounds! Complete silence. It's impressive.A great movie.

Flight 93,"I just saw the movie tonight. The theater was packed but you could hear a pin drop during and after the show. I thought it was a powerful and compelling film. I left the theater feeling a lot like I did on the day of 9/11. I felt that it was probably an accurate portrayal of the events as good be done. Kudo's to the director and writer for not focusing on one person but showing the events as a whole. I only wish we could make this film mandatory viewing for the entire country. We seem to have a short memory in this country. This film should remind people why we are at war.

A Heck of a Ride,"United 93 is as a tense a thriller as they come. The fact that it is a true story and that I (we all) know how it ends didn't keep me from feeling the suspense. Seeing the twin towers burning again brought back the flood of emotion I felt when I saw it in real-time. The film brought out a sense of futility felt by the air traffic controllers, the military, and the passengers on-board Flight 93. The ""authorities"" were caught off-guard and there were too many links in the chain of command to move the machinery in time.As the action inside the plane grew to its crescendo I found myself rooting for the brave passengers who realized that no one was going to help them and that their fates were in their own hands. It was an odd feeling knowing that their actions wouldn't save them. But they are owed our gratitude for keeping the plane from its intended target, the U.S. Capitol.

"Emotionally Challenging, Mentalling Captivating","When I went to see this film the cinema was sold out. In such a case one generally expects the noise of popcorn rustling, coke supping, and sweet bag opening. None of these sounds were present, replaced instead with a deathly silence and broken intermittently from open sobbing. This sobbing was not restricted to any group as people from all around the cinema participated in a communal outpouring of emotion that maybe has not been possible since the event since it has been mediatized and politicized. Instead this film provoked raw emotions in those that saw it, me included, and when it ended, there was no chatter, we who watched it simply got up and left, not talking until we reached our cars. Put quite simply, the film is very realistic, well delivered and well acted. The director and production staff have put a lot of effort into creating the right feeling on the plane and the right atmosphere of those on the plane once the plane is taken over. The attention to detail is impeccable, and they even include a character (fictional or not I don't know) who outlines the previous history of hi-jackers thus explaining why similar events didn't happen on the other planes on the fateful morning. All in all, it is a compelling film, and one that I will certainly buy when it comes out on DVD. It makes real events that have been made feel so in-human in a very respectful way. 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,History
I Didn't Think They Made Movies Like This Still...,"This is an unparalleled film in its tremendous emotional engagement of the viewer. From the very beginning to the gut-wrenching final moment, this is a piece of art that one must remind oneself is almost a reenactment of an actual event. Paul Greengrass & crew have outdone themselves with this detailed, powerful film.The ultra-realistic depiction of mass confusion and breakdowns in communication between ordinary people trying to cope with an unprecedented situation pack so much punch because we, looking back today, of course know the outcome. Yet all we can do is sympathize for these souls who are nearing their untimely end. This is film at its finest; emotionally gripping, perfectly paced and brilliantly edited to portray the mess that September morning was for those trying to prevent further destruction.The class and respect for this tragedy Paul Greengrass has shown is a no-brainer. You have to be seriously delusional to anticipate a film like this coming out in some Die Hard action-type style of nonsense. It's obvious great care was taken and needed to be, and the result is nothing short of one of the best films I have seen in years.Clearly Greengrass has written the film closely following the 911 Commission's report, and the key in viewing a film like this is to detach yourself from your belief, whether you be a dedicated conspiracy theory believer or have Bush's pictures hanging on your home walls. This is a story of people dealing with an immense situation, at its heart.",,Anonymous,History
Not a fitting tribute to the lives lost,"Well I have to be put in the situation the hostages were put in. But you just can't help yourself but put a palm to the face when the terrorist are outnumbered and there only weapon is a box cutter. The hostages should have at least tried to fight back but they don't, especially the stewardesses they act a little too over the top and doesn't really help the situation, even if the passengers as common people, not heroes. It almost seems like the creators were trying to only sell the movie on showing respect and honoring the hostages that died a tragic death, but the hostages just cry and doesn't really stand up for themselves. Even the scene with the crying cell phone call near the end. Interviews with the family members actually revealed that the passengers were calm. This is a tragic event in history, but that doesn't make it a great movie. This film just decided to go in a Hollywood direction without the budget, which can get irritating. It just wasn't a fitting tribute to the lives lost, plus you just don't care about the characters cause they aren't that developed or noteworthy. It's like the casualties on the news.

After watching United 93, I feel that those doubts are irrelevant.Greengrass' directorial style, the same that he displayed in the Bourne films, is to let the characters and the action tell the story, without fanfare or fluff. This style works very well in this instance, where the film could easily delve into political or patriotic territory. Rather, it allows the actions of the passengers (or rather, what their actions are believed to have been) and the ground crew to stand on their own.A powerful, moving film, about the courage of ordinary people on an extraordinarily terrifying day.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Had the hijackers not crashed the plane, the two f16s that were less than 10 minutes away would have surely brought it down.

"Stay United by viewing ""United 93""","September 11, 2001 is still in us. It was a calamity that directly impacted many and indirectly impacted all. After observing these repulsive terrorist acts, many of us were quietly uttering the words ""This is just like a movie"". After you see the shattering gripping film ""United 93"" , you will be quietly uttering the words ""This is just like September 11"". Director Paul Greengrass has created a masterpiece of a narrative. The film is based on the hijacked 9-11 United Airlines Flight 93 which was hijacked by terrorists and supposedly was going to strike The White House. However, valiant passengers bombarded the terrorists to prevent The White House strike and instead the plane crashed in a grassy field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The passengers of United 93 woke up on September 11, 2001 as everyday living common people and died that day as forever-to-the-day living-in-our-hearts uncommon heroes. Greengrass powerful directorial execution inserts the viewers as they were actually passengers in United 93 observing the horror objectively, and as if they were air traffic controllers in the stressful trenches of the National Air Traffic Control Centers observing the horror subjectively. The shaky camera style of ""United 93"" provides an unsettling hysterical perspective to the film which coincides with the emotions all Americans were feeling on that haunting day. Greengrass' not so ""plane"" delivery of ""United 93"" was instrumental in disclosing emotions of that infamous day which many of us had stored as secondary sentiments for a couple of years. Greengrass brilliantly interchanges scenes from the turmoil of the flight to the labor of the traffic control centers. He was also wise to cast unknown actors in a film that the characters should supersede the actors portraying them. However, I should point out that the ensemble acting of ""United 93"" was remarkable and their performances should take off their thespian careers ""sky high"". ""United 93"" is a film that is not exploiting September 11. It is an educational film that pays tribute to the crew of United 93. So unite your family & friends and ""secure"" yourself to your local ""homeland"" movie theater by embroiling in the cinematic excellence of the film ""United 93"". ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,History
Much Better When It's Limited to the Plane,"I said it in my review of ""Brick"", something is going to have to blow me further away to make me think of it as a better movie this year. And ""United 93"" isn't that.In fact, I was rather disappointed.The scenes on-board the actual plane are amazing and tense and define a lot of...stuff. You know, that Americans can unite for a short period of time. That, though we may all be different, we all love and care for other people.Then everything else is pretty much ""Armageddon"". We're in the scenes where everyone is in the control room, babbling incoherently. I was bored. Everything made this to be a story about United Airlines flight 93, not everything else that was going on on September 11th. In fact, that's what I was really hoping for. But no. We're in that stupid control room and it's taking away from the film. Not to mention, it all felt like a prolonged scene from ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". ""Do you want to report a UFO? Repeat: do you want to report a UFO?"" As an audience, we know exactly what happened that day from an outsiders' point-of-view. I frankly wasn't interested in seeing what the military was doing.I do like Paul Greengrass's work, but I think he shakes the cameraman by the shoulders when he's filming something. There are times when the shaky camera does work. Like the hijacking and the uprising. I would be willing to bet that those times were just a big mess of confusion, and I think the film delivers that greatly. But everything else is super-hand-held. It gets annoying. I've seen other, better, hand-held movies. Just look at ""Saving Private Ryan"" for one. When the characters are steady, the shots are nearly steady. The same goes for ""The Constant Gardener"" and any Robert Rodriguez flick pre-""Spy Kids"". They know how to control it and it works better.The camera-work is more overused here than it is during ""The Bourne Supremacy"". ""Supremecy"" was all about confusion and spy-tactics and everything, so it was effective. People know what's going on in this movie (after a certain point and strictly limited to those stupid control room scenes) but they don't know what to do about it.Again, the United 93 scenes work so much, because Greengrass lets us get into the characters (or as much as they could base off the characters). The phoning home scenes are touching and show that people do care about others besides themselves. There were no messages of hatred or anything, even though what these terrorists were doing was pretty horrible. Those final moments (before the uprising) were about making peace, and that is demonstrated greatly. We saw it in ""Munich"" as the main characters suffer and we in turn are more connected to the action on screen. This is what happens during the plane sequences.Personally, I think Greengrass should have abandoned the whole ""real-time"" aspect. This makes all the control room scenes seem like a dull episode of ""24"" while the cameraman has a seizure. He could have easily made a tight film cutting all that out, and emotionally I believe it would have impacted everyone even more.""United 93"", while it is a good film, it could have been delivered in such a better way. I repeat (because I'm a post-Modernists and we do like repetition), the airplane scenes are gripping and heartfelt and the best parts of the movie. Pity it wasn't limited to just that.B",7.0,Anonymous,History
The passengers of Flight 93 were the first Americans to fight back,"United 93 reminds us that it is essential that we remember ourselves not just as victims on 9/11  remember not just what was sad, but what was inspiring. The passengers of Flight 93 were the first Americans to fight back. United 93 wisely avoids focusing too exclusively on any of the individual passengers. Instead, they are presented as an ensemble exemplifying many of the virtues of the American character: a great improvisational intelligence, as they quickly understand and cope with the radically new, horrifying circumstances they are presented with; an extraordinary civic facility, demonstrated by their ability to formulate rapidly a plan of action among themselves; and a fierceness when provoked. In preparation for the assault on the terrorists, one passenger tells a flight attendant: ""Get every weapon you can find. We need weapons.""The heroism of those passengers is now forever part of our story as a nation. It's not too soon for a major Hollywood film that portrays it brilliantly.

Our military is not prepared,This movie was heartbreaking. 4 planes were hijacked on 9-11. Three of them hit their targets. The fourth one is United 93- it didn't because the passengers were brave & they acted together. They uses their head - there's more passengers than hijackers so they overpowered them. The problem was once tgey had control 9f the plane the military was not around to help them land the plane. The ending of the movie tells about the facts behind it. The control towers were not prepared. The Vice President & whoever else in charge chose not to get the military involved. This movie made me realize that our government is not prepared for emergencies. Look at the flood when people died in Louisiana sitting on their roofs. Look at every single emergency - our government is lame. I don't see why United 98 had to crash land. One of the passengers was a pilot. All he needed was direction & clearance to land.,7.0,Anonymous,History
Air Sickness,"Most of this atrocious film is devoted to air traffic controllers babbling on endlessly about possible hijackings. This is inter-cut with closeups of flight monitoring instrumentation. It's meant to convey urgency but it induces boredom and nausea. It's amazing that Greengrass was Oscar nominated for this as it is one of the most incompetent directorial efforts in recent memory. His shaky, hand-held camera is extremely distracting, making it difficult to focus on the film. Not only that, but he favors extreme closeups and whiplash-inducing camera movements that serve to make the action confusing. Somebody please take this hack's camera away.

Many of the characters were played by themselves, i.e. ATC and military personnel. I do not feel it is too soon for this film to be released, and I do feel that America has already slid back into a place of comfort and semi-apathy. I think the film is an excellent reminder of necessary vigilance on our part. It did not leave me with a negative feeling towards Muslim people. I was slightly amused that the European gentlemen on the flight was portrayed as wanting only to try and negotiate with the terrorists. But, mostly I was left with a sense of pride for being an American, a sadness at the senseless loss of lives, and wondering what it would have been like if the passengers would have succeeded.

Greengrass Got It Right,"If you're looking for movie stars and pyrotechnics this is not the movie for you. Paul Greengrass did an excellent job of combining fact with conjecture without making any part of the story larger-than-life. By using a relatively unknown cast, (even the real-life traffic controllers), he managed to pull off an incredibly controversial movie with grace, and more importantly, responsibility.The fact is, we really don't know exactly what happened during the morning of 9/11 aboard any of the four hijacked aircrafts. What we do have are the phone conversations and cockpit voice recorders that are not only choppy, but unclear at times amid the confusion. Greengrass was tasked with combining fact with the unknowable and rather than glamorizing the story of United Flight 93, he told a story that was not only plausible, but likely as close to the raw truth as humanly possible.This movie is a must-see for any American who can bare to re-live that fateful day. It greatly helps bring to life the events that transpired from the moment the first airplane left Boston, to the confusion and uncertainty air traffic-control faced to the courage of a group of strangers who will forever live in our hearts and minds as the silent hero's or September 11th, 2001.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"If you're afraid, you've been ill-advised","Let's get one thing out of the way: I take seriously the attacks on New York, Washington D.C., and the skies over America - and I have not forgotten or mellowed over the last five years. Nor do I have patience for any one, Oliver Stone included, ""dramatizing"" or ""fictionalizing"" the facts of a historic moment. For this reason first, but not solely, I support ""United 93"" and Paul Greengrass' super-effort to make the facts and emotions of that day as true as possible within the confines of film.Does this mean his film is without Art? Not at all, but it DOES mean the only artistic devices he used were to assist the sense of reality that existed for those people during that time. I've heard ""complaints"" about the use of a shaking camera, but that is ONLY done as the tension and violence occur. It was the RIGHT thing to do for the film at that time, and a viewer's inner ear problems are of no concern to me. I want an artist to take me places I haven't been. If it's uncomfortable, so be it.I VERY MUCH appreciated the total lack of recognizable actors. It was a brave decision on the director's part. ""Selling"" the film would be much more difficult, if not the Kiss of Death, in our market. Greengrass was willing to stick by his artistic and story telling intentions. And, because he did, we are gifted with a powerful, accurate, straight ahead, non-gimmicky, emotional recreation of a terrible moment. This is a highly SPECIFIC film, not one loaded with parallels and symbols. If you are AVOIDING it because you've heard it's VERY bloody, etc., it's not. You've been ill-advised. It IS very tense. THAT it is. It is also very sad, and the unknown actors need to be given credit for that. If I remember correctly, Greengrass also used original participants, such as in the control towers, for the added accuracy and feel of time and place. It must've been difficult for those people.I doubt ""United 93"" was easy for anyone, and it remains a challenge for us. Thankfully. I'd hate to think someone DID find it easy.",,Anonymous,History
Absolutely Stunning,"Words can not describe how brilliantly done this film was! Everything about it was so incredibly sharp from the acting to the script to the photography. At first I thought it was going to be a propaganda type film for the American Govt but very soon into the film I was proved wrong.

Not once till I feel head spins or ill as I felt too engrossed in the film to care. I was completely mesmerized by the screen and could not look away - it is by far the most emotionally intense, powerful film I have seen so far. The actors look spitting images of those real victims and their acting is flawless considering they are all new comers - the cast should be up for some sort of an ensemble award!

"Maybe too soon, but certainly gripping...","Is it too soon for a film about September 11? Maybe. One thing's for sure, though, 'United 93' is definitely a good thing.The film is, among other things, interesting, gripping, physically and mentally draining and frighteningly realistic. Though it lacks the emotional impact I expected (with the exception of the film's sudden and quite subdued ending), it certainly provides a great insight into at least one part of the September 11 tragedy. The acting is consistently good and convincing, and the whole film is very believable. So believable, in fact, that it often feels more like a documentary than a movie.Not wanting to be overly critical (as this is a sensitive subject), I couldn't help but feel, as I watched the film, that I was watching a group of extras. Not because there are no 'big name' stars or because the actors are unconvincing; quite the opposite in fact. The problem is, I felt as if I was watching 'background actors'. It's very hard to associate with any of the characters (or rather people) because of this, and as such a lot of the emotional impact is dulled.The film is not so much enjoyable as interesting, and with its high production values, believable characters and shocking realism should satisfy those who believe it is not too soon. For me, personally, the most shocking and emotionally devestating part of this movie is the footage of the Twin Towers burning.

I don't want to be clichéd but...,"When people say a certain film is THE film of such and such a year, I am naturally sceptical. So many films seem to gain that title and , whilst being impressive, you will not think too much about it afterwards. I think United 93 will stay with me for a long long time to come. Paul Greengrass' visual style is entirely appropriate here. I cannot think what it is about the hand held grainy camera that director's seem to love nowadays (sometimes I think it's a fad) but Greengrass is the only director, for me, who can pull it off properly. The shots throughout the whole film were wonderfully realised; muted colours, great light and to the point. I have not seen Oliver Stone's 'World Trade Center' but I am not sure that I'll bother now. Much as I appreciate him as a director, I think his cinematic style is not suited to these sorts of stories (whatever ""these sorts of stories"" are. That was very shallow, wasn't it?). You only have to look at the posters to these films and you can tell the difference. 'World Trade Center' has four very good looking name actors looking off into the middle distance. Very nice; very Hollywood. 'United 93' has a lot of normal looking faces, both young and old, looking at something. These faces seem to have a purpose to look away. I think also that budget is a contributing factor. Oliver Stone had $60,000,000 to play with, whereas Greengrass had $15,000,000. A much lower budget restricts people I think and forces them to look at the little picture as opposed to a broad canvas. The shock of seeing the planes hit the towers was incredible. I have not realised the true magnitude of the whole event before. However, when those images flashed up and the people reacted, I felt a tensing of my stomach and a definite feeling of shock and horror. It is probably because they have milked the whole thing to death through whatever means possible but my senses have become numbed to the American predicament. This film really brought it home to me. These people were ordinary people, on the face of things, seemingly undeserving of such a fate. But then the film does not show us bad people or people to dislike, if you will. The terrorists are clearly believing in what they are doing and really into the whole affair. They will not stop because they believe it is the right thing to do. It was a film that made me think, how can I watch another film ever a again? All these millions of dollars of money being poured into so-called entertainment and it should be spent on other, far more important things. When I become a director, I shall certainly endeavour to make relevant films like this one. And yes! That last image will be burned into your memory forever.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Mixed feelings,"While watching this movie, I couldn't help getting the feeling that I was watching a propaganda piece. Besides that I found the storyline very dodgy to say the least. For example: the passengers are allowed to phone everyone they know and get the info that the plane will hit a (civil) target, while the terrorists are steering towards a big city? I believe the terrorist understood the English language, while we are told that they earned their experience to fly planes in USA. Another example: I was told that in reality they couldn't find the plane, here they show scattered material in the woods nearby, speculating that the plane crushed into tiny pieces. And last but not least: The melodrama in the left behind families was understood, but very very overdone.First I ask: Where is the plane? And second, if there was a plane, I believe the fighter-jets shot it down. Third: Where were the jets from Andrew airport? Fourth: If we believe the Twin Towers were an inside job, why should we believe the government saying that this plane was taken down by passengers?I give it a 6, but only in respect of the left-behind families.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Would I have done the same?,"I was in the air on an American Airlines flight on approach to Chicago Midway when the grounding of all aircraft was called for. As passengers, we knew nothing unusual was happening until we stopped at the gate. Then, as we turned on our cell phones, they were either ringing or had messages to call someone immediately. We exited the plane and observed some other passengers in the old Midway terminal staring at the TV in the lounge. The rest of my story was similar to many others in the same situation. Call wife back and assure her I was OK, grab the last rent car from the rental agent, find a motel, then car pool back to Texas several days later.That was just a bump in the road of life for me.Now, as I reflect on the movie and review my experience, I ask myself, ""Would I have taken the same actions as the passengers and crew on United 93."" I hope so, but I really don't know.I have a lapel pin that honors the flight crews of all four aircraft on September 11. Now it will honor all the passengers on all four aircraft as well the heroes at the FAA, ATC and Military Command.They are all heroes. Real heroes. I recommend the film to anyone who feels that there are no real heroes in the world today. They are out there everyday, doing what must be done. This film touched me and that is what great films are supposed to do.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Grim but useful reminder of an awful day,"United 93 definitely brings back the emotions of 9/11--possibly even more so because at the time there was so much confusion that no one could be sure what was happening. Now that I know what happened, and even though there's no real suspense in the movie, my stomach was tied in knots for almost two hours. The confusion of the day, for almost everyone involved, comes through clearly. There is an implied--and often explicit--criticism of the government response to the day's events, particularly the FAA and the military, as if they should have been immune to the confusion surrounding such an unprecedented attack. Don't get me wrong--this is no Michael Moore type slander, and probably most of the criticism is deserved. But I can't help but remember watching John Ford's ""Battle of Midway"", filmed in June 1942 during the darkest days of World War II. I was probably 11 years old in about 1960 when I saw it, and I still remember the pride I felt in our Marines as they defended that tiny island, even though they ultimately were overwhelmed. Lots of mistakes were made then, too, but we had a war to win; it was not a time for pointing fingers. Maybe United 93 would have been as inspiring, if John Ford had made it. As it is, the movie is a grim, but useful, reminder of an awful day. I just wish it had been more than that.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Boring,"In my opinion, this film is terribly boring, the most part of it the scenes are about the air controllers and their own language, which nobody understands, and the rest of the film is about how the supposed men in the airplane did make it crash in the ground instead of what terrorists wanted.We already knew this story, history in fact, the film didn't give me a new point of view to me.I also noticed that the only mission of women in the film is to cry and to be calmed by a strong and courageous man (of course, they are the heroes of this flight).I don't recommend it at all, and so less if you are not a patriotic American.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Any of you that have seen The Bourne Supremacy know about how Greengrass uses hand-held cameras. Giving you the feel that your right there watching what it taken place at the time. It is no different in United 93. My girlfriend commented that to her it felt like someone had a regular camera on board 93 and that is what we were watching that's how real it felt being in that theater. Right now I still cannot find the words to describe United 93. I guess to give anyone reading this somewhat of an idea... at the end of the film right before the credits started everyone was either just completely silent or crying, when we all started to get up out of our seats no one was talking, no one talked until they left the theater.

"Poignant, Realistic Mise en Scène","""United 93"" is British director Paul Greengrass' real time account of the tragic events of United Flight 93, one of the planes hijacked on 9/11 that crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, when some passengers tried to foil the terrorist plot. With unknown but competent actors and an honest sense of telling history (not a story), Greengrass (""Bloody Sunday"", ""The Bourne Supremacy"") conducted this horrific account with his peculiar, dry style of film-making and made a poignant film. ""United 93"" is superior and quite different from Oliver Stone's ""World Trade Center"", which focused on another side of the tragedy (the fight of the firemen to save lives), but turned out to be somewhat lame and melodramatic. ""United 93"" reminds me of Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"" (about the Columbine massacre): it doesn't take sides, yet it doesn't mean Greengrass was afraid to go beyond. It means there's still a lot to be known about the ones who caused this sad tragedy and everybody was harmed in a way. Perhaps the American president could've done more. The only heroes were the innocent passengers who tried but sadly couldn't save their lives. This film is both a tribute to them and a historic account that shouldn't be ignored. 9 out of 10.",,Anonymous,History
Very Strong Movie,"Wait for video. Not worth a night out at the movies - I just saw this movie in the theater last night and it wasn't all that great. Although I knew how it was going to end, I couldn't help but hope that when they stormed into the cock pit that they were able to grab control of the plane and at least tilt it up but we all know that sadly that did not happen. To see a depiction of what it was like on board was gut wrenching - awful to see all those people say their final goodbyes, the tears, the anguish and some even had hope that they would be OK and get out of this alive. It was definitely hard movie to watch. Throughout this movie, you can't help but wonder how it would be possible for so much miscommunication and initial disregard of the first hijacked plane - how much time was wasted and how little it says about the control towers who had to turn on CNN to see what happened to flight 11. I think this movie provided some insight to Flight 93's fate but it could've been better.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Nothing you expect... A must watch,"I'm very against the commercializing of 9/11, so chances are this is the only 9/11 film I will have watched.More of a docu-drama, United 93 focuses as much on air traffic control and military ops on that day as it does on the flight where 40 passengers stood their ground.I found this film to be very well done (the ""look"" and angles make it more personal, unlike Hollywood Blockbusters). The score doesn't interrupt the story, and the story... well, it's realistic, believable and really makes you feel like you're watching in real-time as the morning's events unfold.For those faint at heart, there are but a few ""rough watch spots,"" and all I can say is there's no choice but to watch them.I saw this in a theater that showed no previews, and posted a silent screen simply requesting that all cell phones be turned off.There are things to learn, and though some things seem to be placed for political reasons, I doubt they were. I don't think we'll see a ""truer"" film on the big screen about 9/11.I found United 93 to be an educational experience, which also reminded me how important it is to live life each day, and to simply be... an American. It was an experience I'll never forget, and it's a film I'll not need to watch twice. It left me with the emotion that what I felt on that day in '01 has never diminished.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Emotionally powerful, but not necessarily great","A very emotionally powerful finale does not make this a perfect movie, or even a great one, though it is an important one. For the most part, it felt more like a documentary than a fictional, creatively crafted film, which works, I guess, but made it confusing and even boring at times. The beginning hour or so, which focused mostly on the air traffic controllers, FAA, and military, was the prime culprit of this, and I felt like a was watching a doc much more than a film. The scenes which focus on the flight itself are by far the strongest, because it feels very real, raw, and moving. The shaky cam works best here, because it feels like you're part of the action, rather than watching it. Unfortunately, not enough time is spent developing the story on the flight, and it feels shortchanged by the end of it. The mix of unknown actors and people playing themselves makes it very realistic, though not necessarily better. The ending is very emotional, perhaps the most of any film I've seen, but it doesn't make the entire film better - just the ending. Overall, a good film that is very realistic, but also overrated.",6.0,Anonymous,History

The risks of telling the simple facts,"This astonishing movie has some very strong points I would like to address: We've got a problem. In September 11, 2001 America was the victim.

They think that all was set by the government or at least with the complicity of some politicians, including the President, George W. Bush.This movie is not a propaganda and that's why It could serve as a testimony in a better way than any other efforts, such as government press releases and fake documentaries: There are no superhero characters, terrorists are what they are, but not monsters, there are no ""patriotic"" or didactic dialogs or actions, and, best of all, it didn't buy any of the conspiracy theories.

disgusting!!!!!!,"With all due respect to the bravery of the men and women who perished in that fateful flight, this movie is the ultimate perverse transgression on human decency as I have seen it.1.

The crash of flight 93 itself is quite dubious (www.loosechange911.com) 4. The glorified heroism with carefully punctuated dialogues, the stunning visuals with a haunting background score DO NOT make this movie anything more than a merely well-written work of fiction.I am disappointed at the studios for trying to exploit the tragedy but I am certainly disgusted at the American public who have bought into this propaganda without even realizing it.Anybody who voted for the movie' technical production values, I admire your neutrality.

Excellent and hard hitting even though we know the outcome,"Of course, the outcome is predictable; but the movie does well in its portrayal (or speculation) of what happened. Based on the documented telephone calls from many of the passengers to their loved ones on terra-firma, the movie does lend authenticity to the events as they unfold.As most people also will say, I remember exactly what I was doing when 9/11 took place. And having two sons in the military; one a pilot who was scrambled, albeit not in that specific area, and the other working in The Pentagon that very day, I have a very vivid recollection of the precise sequence of events.

"A grueling tribute to families of 911 victims, even though it's with emotional terror and sadness.","I must say after watching ""United 93"" that the way Paul Greengrass did this film was greatly set up and done with excellent realism. It seems that every scene that is done seems so real and it's with believable dialog and super acting. I love the way the sets are filmed from everything from the inside of flight 93 airplane to the air traffic control center, as each moment of this movie unfolds the viewer can keep up with the drama and terror. Also the scenes are shown on monitor of the World Trade Center blowup and the control center scenes of the crew picking up the hijacking of other planes are well done. This movie wraps around the events of 911 perfect from the hijacking of all four planes with the big focus on the 93 flight and the take over from terrorist. The last half of the movie is disturbing as the terrorist overtake the plane in a brutal manner from stabbing passengers and bringing pure hostage horror to the unlucky forty people aboard. In the end these forty people are the real heroes as flight 93 is the only plane that did not carry out the demands of terrorists. Now talk about real and brave human soldiers. Thumbs up to Greengrass for making a film to show the painful terror these people went thru, and it was nice to give their families one last look to honor their memory and to put a final closure on letting the brave ones rest in peace.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A Tough Watch, But Tremendously Well Done","In ""United 93,"" the fictionalized account of what may have taken place on board the sole hijacked commercial airliner that did not reach its target on September 11, 2001, director Paul Greengrass has given us a clenched muscle of a movie. The film runs on pure adrenaline; it's terse, lean and frank. It also happens to be extremely difficult to watch.Filmed in a bare-bones style, with few recognizable actors and very little significant dialogue, the movie offers an account first of what takes place in several air traffic control centers in different locations as the realization that planes are being flown into buildings around the country settles in, and then it confines itself exclusively to the cabin of the doomed flight itself, after the passengers have learned that they're being used for a suicide mission and fight back against the hijackers. Greengrass resists the urge to sentimentalize the events or make heroes of anyone; the resistance of the passengers is not filmed in dramatic slow motion set to a booming soundtrack. Instead, it looks confused, messy and panicked, the desperate acts of people not suited for their roles. Likewise, the scenes that take place in the air traffic control centers have the atmosphere of authentic immediacy. I was at work the morning of 9/11, and the way I learned about what was going on matched very closely the way the people in this movie learn about the events -- through snippets of overheard conversations, images on the news, and random rumours.Many people have decried this movie as being unnecessary at best and downright dishonest at worst. Some have called it a blatant piece of American propaganda. I don't get that. I admit that while I was watching it, I did wonder if I could justify a film about such a sensitive subject that doesn't really have a point of view and can't even claim to be an accurate recreation of events. But then I watched one of the special features on the DVD, a short film about the relatives of those who died on this flight. Many of the actors met with the families shortly after filming, and Greengrass held a special private screening for the relatives before the studio released the film to the general public. All of the family members felt nothing but solace and a sense of peace after watching the movie. Almost all of them expressed their gratitude to the filmmakers for making the film and telling their loved ones' stories. They seemed unable to understand why others wouldn't want a film like this to be made. One of the rationales used against this movie is that it came out too soon after the date of the tragic events depicted in it. In response to this criticism, one of the family members replies, ""It's not soon enough."" So if the families who are most closely affected by the event don't feel the need to justify the movie's existence, why should anyone else?And as for those who claim that the film is a piece of manufactured propaganda, the Internet culture now allows every Tom, Dick and Harry to publish his or her opinions in cyberspace (my own included) as uncontested fact, but how do any of these bloggers know what took place on that day? They don't. Perhaps no one but the people on board ever will. Greengrass never claimed that his film was a factual recreation, but rather that it's a suggestion of what might have happened based on available evidence. It's easy to sit at a laptop in a coffee shop and claim that the movie is crap based on a bunch of conspiracy theories floating around in the ether, but until anyone has anything better to offer, I'll stick with Greengrass's version of eventsOnly a mere five years after 9/11, it's hard to believe that there was ever a time when Americans were so dismissive of terrorism. As this film shows, 9/11 worked because Americans really had no context for believing something of this magnitude could ever happen. Surprise was the terrorists' greatest ally. So no, I don't think it's too soon to show movies about that terrible day, or to keep thoughts of it constantly with us. The more we're prepared, the less likely it is that something this horrible will happen again.I can't say I was entertained exactly by this movie, though I was never less than completely engrossed in it. But I can certainly say that it is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,History
"It's well made no doubt about that. Rather manipulative though, and not as impactful as it's made to be.","United 93 is a movie I had heard people rave about for years, due to it's shocking realism, and the impact it makes on you. Well it did make an impact on me, but I had many problems with this, when all was said and done. In my opinion, this seemed to be really exploitive, and an attempt for the film makers, to cash in on what happened at 911. Personally I think this is a tragedy that didn't need to be revisited, and should have been left alone respectively. The actors in this movie, look like just that, actors. I didn't sense any realness to them, and the movie didn't give me enough to care as much as I should have, when the movie was finished. I'm a Canadian, but I was deeply affected to what happened on 911, like a lot of people were, it's just this movie Doesn't do it any justice. The Arabiacs often complain about injustice, and the treatment directed towards them, that America gives them. Well it's there own fault, by doing what they have done, they have dug there own grave, ruining it for a lot of other innocent Arabiacs. United 93 left me feeling a little empty, and cold, after it was over. It was a well made movie, but not worthy of all the acclaim it has gotten.Bottom line. United 93 is an effective, but over-hyped movie about the 911 events. It has many flaws, and as I said, left me feeling a little empty, when all was over.

"In 2019, this movie still chills me to the bone","I've tried to make it a point every Sept 11 to watch this film. I've missed doing this in 2017 & 2018, but I made it a point to watch this in 2019 with my wife. I remember where I was 9/11/2001, and this film does an amazing job capturing those emotions I felt on that day when I was 13 years old. My wife never saw this movie before, and she left crying, but did say it was a very beautiful tribute and extremely well written, and I couldn't agree more.One thing she pointed out that I never paid attention to was that in the beginning there is no music (she is a musician, go figure lol). In the beginning you start off the movie like a regular day. Nothing out of the ordinary and it's just a normal day. The movie progresses in real time and as it moves along, the confusion, tension, and reality of what is going on slowly builds. Even though we know what will happen, we still can feel the confusion the country felt that day, and the frustration of knowing nothing can be done in the moment, even though everything was tried within their power.The acting is superb! The terror in the passengers was just spot on. The hijackers were portrayed well. You could sense the utter hatred in the eyes of most of them. I know this is controversial, but I loved the portrayal of an almost sympathetic view of one of the hijackers (pilot). But during the movie, that view is pretty much shattered. No one person stole the show, the passengers that played the brave heroes of United 93 were amazing, every single one of them.This movie is uncomfortable due to it's nature, but it is an amazing tribute to the brave souls that, even though they were mostly trying to save themselves, in turn potentially saved hundreds or perhaps thousands of lives. If you haven't seen this, please give it a watch and at least judge for yourself. This is an event that should never be forgotten and I hope we never forget the heroes on that day.Also, I hope that someday we will remember how we were united on September 12. There were no Democrats and Republicans, Black or White, Gay or Straight, Atheist or Christian. We were American and united in peace. I pray we get to this point again as a country instead of giving the Terrorists victory in dividing our country from within.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Greengrass's masterpiece,"Watching United 93, I was suddenly reminded of a paper I had been writing about the director Roberto Rossellini and his post-war 'trilogy' of Italian neo-realist films. Not necessarily because United 93 is about the struggles of the poor in a post-war environment. But because of the qualities of the neo-realist filmmaker's attempts to capture reality as honestly as possible. Like Rossellini, writer/director Paul Greengrass uses real locations, and while not non-professional actors all unknowns in the cast, and does what critic Andre Bazin once wrote, ""directs the facts."" The film captures the most harrowing aspects of that morning that shook everyone in America (and the world) without pretense or melodrama. There's not a trace of director Greengrass exploiting those who died in the line of a terrorist takeover. And, like Rossellini's films, there is genuine emotion achieved for the audience by just putting up human beings up on the screen, without full-on characterization or over-whelming Hollywood sentimentality. Basically, what Greengrass gives the audience is this ""what it is is what it is."" This is a power that few filmmakers can pull off, yet he is able to achieve it with what will very likely be the best film of the year released by a major studio.One of the ways Greengrass is successful is in the style that he uses. In a way, he chooses to abandon all noticeable technique. His cinema verite camera, led with a tenseness that is rather shocking in its non-stop approach by Barry Akyroyd, lets the audience in as if you don't notice what is exactly going on at any given moment. The story is less that than it is just the eventual unfolding of the events. And he cuts between two very specific sets- the air traffic controllers and Norad, and the plane itself. It's important to point out that just in the sheer film-making and pacing, aside from the significance behind the subject matter, shows the filmmaker able to create true taut suspense. One wonders when the hijackers will finally get up from the seats. One wonders if the air traffic controllers will know if the plane is THE plane, among the many others scrambled at the moment, amid the chaos of the twin towers. And one wonders what will happen to the passengers, as they call with every ounce of fear and horror to their loved ones on the ground. And throughout, the tension just keeps on building like a brutal, bleak-as-Bergman vice.The film has been drawn criticism for being ""too soon"" in depicting a dramatization of the events of 9/11, and even for being too disturbing for some. To put it mildly, it's not an easy film. The way that Greengrass ends the film alone marks it as enough to make some in the audience just ball their eyes out with tears. But, again like Rossellini and other filmmakers assured with their intent in the depiction, it's not the kind of film that tries to cheat its audience like too many Hollywoodized bio-pics do. The film starts off mundanely, and then pits into a kind of tunnel of consciousness of the situation at hand. It's truly the kind of work that isn't afraid to provoke a response out of its viewers, which (as an American) was all the more rewarding for me. Like many great films, it asks underlying questions while still working as a piece of storytelling and action, and even through the shaky camera one never wants to look away. In short, I recommend the film to, well, just about anybody, even to those who think of the subject matter as being too taboo, which it is not at all. Stripped from the usual abstractions association in the years following 9/11, it's a peak that Greengrass may never be able to reach again. And so far as of fall 2006, the best film I've seen this year.",10.0,Anonymous,History
By turns it is interesting and moving and is well worth seeing,"In near real time and using accounts and officials records of the day, Paul Greengrass delivers an account of the events surrounding the terrorist attack on 11/9/06, focusing on the aviation authorities, the military and the passengers of the only plane that did not reach its target  United flight 93. By doing this he was one of the first to make a film (as opposed to a documentary) that recreates the day. That said though, Greengrass' approach might as well be a documentary as it is very much a recreation as opposed to being a movie in the way Oliver Stone's film was.Having done Bloody Sunday, I was happy that this had been put in his hands and I hoped he could do a good job. Although it certainly cannot be described as a fun experience, it is a great film in the way it coldly and convincingly does what it sets out to do  deliver a recreation. He doesn't try to manipulate the audience with cheap sentiment and he doesn't overplay the horror of the day. He also wisely avoids any questioning of why what happened and has no interest in conspiracy theories, mainly because few of us did as the day unfolded. Some viewers will complain about his shaky camera but for me I liked the way it kept moving, catching me up in the confusion on the ground and the fear on the plane.The film makes very good use of official reports on the ground and does a good job of recreating the scenes on flight 93. Only a French (or at least a French accented) passenger trying to convince the other passengers to sit tight and just do what the hijackers want was a bum note for me  I'm not sure, maybe it was factually accurate but it felt like a cheap shot and it was not up to the standard of the rest of the film. The lack of any (for me) recognisable faces in the cast was a very good move as it took away anything that would distract. The cast of unknowns all work well together and are very convincing in their various roles; there are one or two so-so performances but few of these are key performances and are covered over easily enough.The events themselves are still moving and it is easy to be caught up in them  the majority of the first half of the film is fascinating as you get a sense of the response on the ground, but the second half is gutting due to the very real sense of fear and desperation in the plane. Reviewers were concerned that this was ""too soon"" and I recall the internet having a buzz of dissension about the film but in reality Greengrass has delivered a strong recreation with a strong factual basis that just allows the events to speak for themselves right down to the very matter of fact way the film ends. By turns it is interesting and moving and is well worth seeing.",,Anonymous,History
"Good, but not really just about united 93","The movie was good, I did enjoy it. I was expecting a movie about the people on the United 93 flight with some small parts about what was going on in the rest of the country.

The parts of the actual united 93 flight seemed almost tacked on. It did make me want to read more about what happened there, specifically about the people on board. A couple of the passengers really had just a few minutes to figure out what was going on an come up with a plan. Who were they? What had they done in their lives that suggested that type of character? The most moving parts were the brief scenes of a few of the people calling home - it seemed most got answering machines - to say good bye. I assume they only showed those that got answering machines because then they got the actual words being spoken. It was almost a documentary with regard to the air traffic controllers as many of them were not actors. It's a movie I would encourage everyone to see, just don't come in with an expectation that you will learn even the identities of the people on board the flight.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Very realistic and hits you right on the spot,"I was speechless after seeing this ""movie"". It was like I had been there during the entire film. It also shows you perfectly how complex all of the attacks combined were and how hard it is to decide on how to act as an executive on the right time (which it never seemed to be). When you think all facts are gathered it is history and a new fact turns up. Also complex lines of communication were shown.It shows again how vulnerable we are in the Western world. You can't protect yourself against this without losing your freedom and quality of life. The art is to try to find a balance.Just today (9/11/2008) is again a day to remember.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Looked very promising... however...,"First of all, my review for this film is NOT based on political belief. It is NOT based on these so-called ""conspiracies."" It is NOT based on the story itself. It is based on the way it was presented.We all know the story from that dark day on September 11, 2001. We all know of the story of Flight 93, that crashed in Pennsylvania instead of the intended target of Washington, DC's capital building. Or more.This film, directed and written by Paul Greengrass (Bourne Supremacy) did intensive research of Flight 93, in every detail from the stories of the flight's doomed passengers, to the black-box recordings. However, this film does have its flaws.First, this has already been done. Anyone who saw A+E's TV movie Flight 93 knows what I'm talking about.Second, I disliked the camera work. The way it was done added realism to the film, but it go to a point where it just became tiring and blinded the atmosphere of the movie itself.Third... well, that's basically it.Overall, I would only recommend this film to those who wish to see a memorable tribute to those who died on September 11, 2001. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who feels it's too soon for a 9/11 movie, even though I didn't see any shred of negativity in the film.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Harrowing, Authentic, and Heoric, ""United 93"" is a moving experience","The tale of events that occurred on that fateful September day in 2001, where 4 planes were hijacked and crashed, is a date that changed many and scarred many others. ""United 93"" is a gripping recollection of United Airlines Flight 93 - the sole plane out of the 4 hijacked that did not reach its target.The film is very authentic; the camera never rests, the people on the ground at air traffic control are mostly those who actually were working at ATC on 9/11, and the use of lesser-known actors to depict the passengers really serves well to show that the people aboard Flight 93 were ordinary people leading regular lives, and not Navy SEALS or action movie stars. The film also takes place in real time, which adds to the realism.The film is so accurate and realistic it plays almost like a documentary, going through each of the events of 9/11 very well. It also plays like a thriller, because of how intense the film is. It is also brutally violent, with realistic-looking wounds and attacks that would clearly resemble the way passengers would revolt in such a situation, using anything they could get their hands on.Such a unique film has not been seen yet, and its down-to-earthliness and realism add to the experience. Being so realistic, the viewer definitely feels for the passengers, as they all start to realize just what kind of a situation they are in. It is a story of extreme heroism and courage, and the legend of the people aboard United 93 will live on.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Could Have Been Better!,"I was really anticipating this movie. Despite the controversy, I heard great things about this movie. I was looking forward to watching this almost ten years after the original tragedy. I was let down somewhat. Maybe it was because I was sick and had a bad headache while watching this, but I was disappointed.This is about the one of the hijacked planes on September 11, 2001 and how it got hijacked before its doom in the fields of Pennsylvania.The acting isn't that bad. The actors are unknown but they were decent. There was some over acting in moments though.The reason I didn't like this movie as much as I thought because it was simply boring. The first half was just airport people blabbing to each other.However, the final 20 minutes of the film is powerful and emotional and hence thats why this movie gets a 5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,History
United 93 is a powerful and remarkable film,"There's no way to watch United 93 and not relive the horror of the World Trade Center attacks and the jet that hit the Pentagon.And there's also no way to watch this extraordinarily powerful film and not be in awe of what human beings are capable of - both good and bad.The director of "" United 93"" delivers a wrenching chronicle of an everyday airplane ride that goes frighteningly awry on 9/11/01.There are the businessmen and women on their cell phones and laptops, idling in the airport waiting area before the flight begins. There are the pilot and copilot making small talk as they run down the cockpit checklist. There are the attendants, glad at the prospect of working an uncrowded flight, trading gossip, checking supplies.And there are the four young Arab men, first seen in early morning in a hotel room bowing in prayer to Mecca, then going through the airport X-rays and scanners, then taking their seats on the Boeing 757 before committing their act of evil against humanity.The passengers of this flight fought back against that evil. The fact that they did not survive does not diminished what they accomplished or their bravery.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"dramatic, gripping and raw","The movie was more than anything to me (aside from emotional reactions) informative. It shed a lot of light on the behind the scenes events of 9/11 from the perspective of Traffic Control and the Military especially. With the inclusion of real participants the reality was heightened greatly.United 93 seemed very authentic on the ground but I couldn't shake the fact that many of the plane events had to have been dramatized and that wasn't disclaimed.The wounds are still fresh and this movie certainly won't make that any easier but I for one am glad I overcame my aversion to this hard subject and the painful memories and hope you do the same.as a movie: 7/10as a tribute to the crew, passengers and ground people involved or lost:9.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
Greengrass Pulls It Off - Powerful Historical Drama,"OK, there has been plenty of speculation and opinion and probably a lot of comments written here by folks who haven't even seen the film yet..Yes, it premiered here last night and I had to go see... I found it is a powerful re-enactment that doesn't dwell on much or on any particular character... It is faithful to the time-line and the events of 9-11-01, even if some of what takes places on board the flight in the film does so out of speculation... What else can a film-maker do? Greengrass, who has done excellent work with the Jason Bourne thriller ""The Bourne Supremacy"", is the right man for the job here. He is smart enough to know NOT to tinker too much with history; to NOT cast this film with ""big stars""; to not cause too many distractions as the film moves along.What can I say? We all know what the outcome is. We all have our own ideas about what took place on board United 93. We all remember 9-11-01 like it was yesterday. This film honors those on the doomed flight for what we all have pretty much accepted as fact: The passengers, or victims themselves caused the mission to fail. The simplicity of the director's style, coupled with edgy, subtle performances throughout, will cause you to again stop and think about 9-11-01, most likely for a long time after you see this film. Maybe a lot of us don't want to keep doing that. Nevertheless, despite the fact that there's a buck to be made here, this work fulfills the idea that some of the stories of 9-11 can and need to be told on the big screen... It is powerful, painful, and prideful at the same time. Bring Kleenex.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Flying into boredom,"I have to stay this movie was really boring. I thought it would beat out the last 9/11 movie. In my opinion this movie was not even close. When I walked into the movie and my friend and I were the only ones in there. We knew that could not be good. But we sat down anyways and watch the first 5 minutes of the movie. After that we all were just talking about other stuff. I have never done that in a movie. The first hour of the movie was nothing special at all. Just like shots of normal people doing normal stuff and it was really boring. When you started to get into the good part of the movie where planes where being hi-jacked it was totally a different movie. Once the first plane was hi-jacked we kept our eyes on the screen for a while but then it kept going in and out of action. The movie was OK. It was not what I thought it would be. It's more of a short educated movie, not what i thought it would be. On our way to the movie, we saw a poster that was promoting the two towers. That one is going to have lots of problems and controversy over. But over all this was a okay film but not thing to go crazy over. 6.4/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
United to the end.,"Hard to review this without feeling the emotions of that day. As a movie, its one of the most riveting, horrifying, and draining movies i can remember. Sorta reminded me of watching Schindlers list. Another great movie with a tough topic. Like Schindlers list, you put yourself in these peoples situation and ponder how the heck would I react to being in those peoples position. No one knows for sure of course, but gives you the feeling of what it probably was like. From seeing the terrorist blend into the normal situations at an airport to seeing people from different ways of life, taking what they thought was just another flight not realizing that there fate was doomed the second they shut the planes doors. Filmed as if you were on the plane. The acting was great all the way around. From the scenes at the different controls towers, to the people on the plane. There's the very few rogue morons out there panning this movie. What can you say, there's bound to be 1 moron for every 10 normal people in the world. Anyone who isn't moved by this movie either didn't see it, or probably could care a less about someone else's life or supports what happen. I know for me, its a movie experience that brought 9/11 back has painfully as a baseball bat to the back of the head. And its a pain that will never go away.",10.0,Anonymous,History
well made,I had some reservations about seeing this movie. Not sure why. Finally I realized that I needed to be reminded about 9-11. We have a tendency to forget. This movie was done in great taste and with respect. I am glad I went. I am glad that I was reminded once again what happened and left with a clearer understanding of what may have taken place on flight 93. I Left the theater with a mixture of sadness for what had happened and also a sense of pride for those it happened to and their families. This movie will stick with me for quite a while. I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks that they have forgotten and want to remember. There was complete silence in the theater upon exiting. This movie is not for all but I think most should see it. It is good to remember and reflect on a very important part of recent history.,10.0,Anonymous,History
Hard to 'dislike',"An morbidly exact reenactment of the famed United 93 flight, which crash-landed in a field on September 11th and thus failing to reach the target point. By way of story memories of proceedings are still strongly etched in the minds of most of humanity, even though specific details are unknown. Paul Greengrass attempts to bring forth these details presenting a real time movie of occurrences which took place that day.With great focus on detail and language, the story shifts between control centres across the country and passengers of the doomed plane. Dialogues are painstakingly realistic, even professional lingo is used during conversations between air control personnel. Deeply essential to this realism is the all-engulfing feeling of utter chaos (enhanced by a shaky lens), giving an evocative understanding of how surprised and unprepared officials were to the attacks reacting in confusion and emotions to a situation outside their guidebooks. ""United 93"" goes to great length to present a matter-of-fact portrayal showing the fright, hopelessness, acceptance of inevitability and then the fatal moment of bravery. Characters aren't really presented or portrayed, their actions in response to the situation they were in are more important, while the rest is fittingly ignored (out of reverence to the victims).With such a picture brought about so soon after the attacks the movie holds a large amount of reverence to (most) victims, one can help but question the necessity of making such a movie. Ultimately a documentary style re-enactment in true cinema verite style brings no commentary to the disaster and while it causes several moments of gut-wrenching honesty, can anything ever really overshadow the feelings that everyone had on that fateful day? Do we really need to film it and see it in-depth to accept the tragedy? Even though mostly tasteful, reverential and with a required subtlety I couldn't help but question necessity. Essentially a movie that in honour of victims is hard to be disliked, but I couldn't help but question how exploitive a movie like this is...One asinine no-no by the filmmakers is the much talked about presentation of a German passenger in negative light, even though there are no suggestions that he ever went against the remainder of the passengers giving it a despicable anti-European touch, which shockingly and inappropriately disgusts.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The best movie so far this year and the most devastating movie this decade.,"This movie is not easy to sit through first and foremost. The same felling that overcame people who saw the Passion of the Christ could be felt here. The only thing different is that in the Passion of the Christ you felt manipulated into the feelings because of the blood and horror. This movie tells it like it was and you make your own feelings from the intense emotions on screen and in your self.The movie is made with great respect towards all those connected to that day. There is absolutely no exploitation going on and the movie has the respect not to offer any personal commentary on politics into it. United 93 chronicles the time that the flight was boarded to the tragic end. The movie cuts from the United flight to different Air Traffic Control centers and to the military control. Some of the high officials where kind enough to play them selves in the movie. There is no real star power which really helps make the movie feel even more realistic. You can tell while watching the film that the creators really took there time to fact-check many details to present it with much fascination info from behind the scenes. As I watched the film I could hear the sniffles, sobs, and other sad noises from the audience. The thing that amazed me is that no one in the theater left, nor did they make much noise in what I feel was much respect for the film and subject.If this film were released last year I would make the argument that it could have walked off with the Best Picture Oscar. While the events in the film were not that long ago and some might say that it is to soon, to that I say this film pays great honor to all those involved with that horrifying day and will inform more upon the tragic flight and the people behind the scenes trying to figure out what was going on. The movie is a heart breaking docudrama that with the up most responsibility accomplished a great feat in the history of film.(This movie covers September 11th through the air, look for Oliver Stones ""World Trade Center"" movie in August that will tell the story of two police men from inside the World Trade Center ruble.)",10.0,Anonymous,History
Sure it is not bad....,"The problem with this movie is not it's pace, not it's factual or documentary-like nature, not the movie director's interpretation of the events, but the general angst the director has to turn this fragile subject into a movie. Of course 9/11 was one of the most dreaded days in history, but only because of the tremendous media exposure and multiple-angular shots of the scene. The day Bush started the war in Iraq was a day sentencing more people to death then any other day in American history, and that is the controversial side this movie doesn't tackle. Therefore it gives no more than a shallow depiction of the events, rather than an in depth investigative movie. I am also afraid this is going to fuel nothing but sentiment and no discussion whatsoever",6.0,Anonymous,History
Constant Shaking of Camera Made us Feel Motion Sick!!!!,"The movie may have been good in the story line... however the camera was shaking so darn much, as if they were trying to make us feel like we were there, that we were getting motion sick and dizzy just watching the darn thing... I would have liked to see the entire movie, but felt awful trying to watch the shaky thing and decided to leave about half way through. My husband felt the same way and was more than happy to leave. We really did want to see it, but the constant jolting of the camera all over the place and the lack of focus through the lens made us so sick that we just couldn't handle it. I'm not sure how so many people gave it such a high rating. It was so poorly shot and edited that I can't recommend it!!! I did see a similar made for TV move that I did enjoy and did justice to that day and what those pasengers did.

Takes you right back to that day,"The United 93 takes you right back to Semptember 11th 2001. The day the U.S. was attacked. It takes you behind the scenes to air traffic control and shows you a real time play-by-play of what happened that morning. It takes you onto that fourth plane. I could feel the fear of the people on that plane like I was living it. Very moving, Very compelling. They hide nothing from you in this movie. The director did a fantastic job in making a movie from the little information he had about what went on on that plane. I strongly suggest watching this movie, however you may not want to fly on any planes for a long while afterwards.",10.0,Anonymous,History
An emotional experience,"Trying not to give out spoilers for this is hard, seeing that if there isn't one person in America that doesn't know at least 60% of the events that happened that day you must have been either drunk or stoned.You know the inevitable fate of the people on flight 93.They crash and die.But the story must be told. There is no time right or wrong because it is timeless.Have you ever sat down and listened to Ravels symphony Bolero? It starts out with only a whisper of a snare tapping and some cello's laying the foundation by giving you a structured baseline and a key we would call major. At first, there is nothing but base and snare. Then a flute floats through the air with the beginning of the melody. It modulates and takes you into a minor key. Slowly Bolero builds, adding other instruments as it goes along. Each instrument then joins the background as others take the melody. They become harmonies. Then they get loud. By the end, you don't remember so much how it starts, but you are startled when the final crescendo is played and all is quiet again.At that point you are allowed to breath. Slowly your emotions become your own. Most of us know how everything ended, but how this thing built up inside the few hours that it did makes you stop breathing; stop thinking; stop responding until the crescendo is over.The theater was void of sound. Not even the people sitting next to me were breathing. Just enough time goes by to remind you that you need to breathe. Some comments are displayed on the screen. I didn't hear the person next to me breath, but I heard the first tear well up in his eye and a brief rustling of cotton from a sleeve in motion. The person on my left slowly expelled a breath, then choked back a sob. The lights came up, and people started moving. Quietly: As if in a wake.If this film set out to honor the dead, it did so in one of the most deftly defined presentation I have yet to re-experience. I felt no political agenda. I felt numb. A numbness that continued till I was half way home, then I too fell apart.",10.0,Anonymous,History
I'm still shaking,"This was an absolutely intense, emotional, and beautifully made movie. It was incredibly well acted and wonderfully shot. It was, of course, extremely difficult to sit through. In fact I found myself shaking for most of the movie. I saw a few people get up and leave, I guess it was too much for them to stomach. And no wonder. We (of course) all know how it ends, but that doesn't stop us from wanting a different ending and hoping that somehow, the plane wouldn't have crashed. The movie starts off like any normal movie, except for one thing: we are not introduced to one single ""main character"", as you say. Instead, we get a feel for each of the people that comes up on screen (including the ones on the ground trying to make sense of this horrible situation). You are drawn into each and every one of their worlds without ever really having any kind of back story on them. Even though we have all seen the news footage of what happened on that day, it still hits you like a low-blow when it comes up on screen again. When I saw the second plane hit the world trade center, I had the same feelings that I had experienced that actual day of 9/11. It was gut wrenching and my heart sank. United 93 tells the story of the one plane that did not hit its target on 9/11 in the USA. And the movie makes you appreciate life and all of its glory. I don't think there was a single person in that theater with me that was not affected. Normally in a crowded theater, there are people talking amongst themselves and you can hear folks munching popcorn. But not for this movie. It was quiet to begin with, but near the end of the movie, when the credits started to roll, you could hear a pin drop. It just goes to show you the reality of this movie. How it was shot, the way the people on screen came together, and the wishful hoping of a different ending or outcome. All I have to say is: Bravo. And God Bless those souls on that plane.",,Anonymous,History
Dull first hour gives way to a more engaging final third,"I have to say that I was surprised when I first heard that this film was being made as while there have been countless films based on real life tragedies, the events of 9/11 only happened five years ago, and I side with those who think it was too early to have the plight of the victims turned into a film. However, everything controversial is of interest me and so I decided that I would watch the film. This sort of film is on the back foot from the beginning, as the writers don't have the element of surprise where the plot is concerned, and so have to rely on other means to ensure that the film is interesting. United 93 is something like a dramatised documentary, and recounts the events leading up to the crash of the fourth plane; the only one that didn't hit its target. I can't say how realistic the dramatisation is as I wasn't there and haven't seen any documentaries on the disaster, but basically what we have is a plane full of passengers deciding to take on the terrorists and attempt to regain control of the hijacked plane.The first hour of this movie is really rather boring, as we mostly centre on various organisations as the tragedy of the planes hitting the world trade centre escalates through America. I see this as a movie of two halves; we have the moot first hour, and then the engaging and climatic final third, in which the action changes to the plane of the title. In terms of cinema, what happens on the plane isn't all that exciting; and there are better and more entertaining disaster films than this one. Of course, the fact that it's a real life drama has to be accounted for, and it is not the action but the underlying hope that makes the final third of the film such a good watch. Even though we know how it is going to end, director Paul Greengrass manages to make sure that the audience are hoping that everything will turn out well alongside the doomed cast of characters. The reason I cannot give this film a high rating, therefore, is because I didn't like two thirds of the film. The events of 9/11 was one of the greatest tragedies of the last one hundred years, and so this film has a lot riding on its shoulders. Did United 93 do the tragedy justice? Overall, I don't think so.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Brutal and Intense,"Never have I seen a movie like this. I was expecting it to be some Hollywood film...just to get profit... Every time I heard about it, I thought it to be insensitive, and a little too soon to put a movie like this out there.I happen to work at a movie theater, so I cleaned the theater for this movie when it first came out, and I hadn't seen the movie yet. I walked in there just as the movie was ending to open the doors...it almost seemed like an empty theater. Never, have I walked into a movie theater so still and quiet. It was almost breathless. It startled me. I couldn't even imagine what the movie was like, and how brutal it was. All throughout the credits while I was cleaning the theater...there was one woman who remained in her seat..with her chin in her hands just staring at the screen. That moment alone changed my view on everything--and how real these events were. When they actually happened, I was too young to even understand what was going on....I just had upset teachers and parents......and I was confused.So, eventually...I got up the courage to see the movie...I knew what was coming--but i wasn't ready. ...when you see the people calling they're family...just to say 'I love you' One last time--It hits you like a knife in the heart....to know that there were tons affected by this..... The fact that you couldn't recognize a single actor in the movie makes it even more real... I saw the movie with two of my close friends...I know a lot of people that refuse to see it... I'm glad I saw it, but I don't know if I want to see it again...The movie just ends with a bang...and those subtitles came on.. 'No one survived'......... The room was completely and utterly silent---like no person even dare to move until the lights came back on... It was brutal, intense...and the scariest part, is that it's real.A lot of my coworkers at the theater have talked to me about it.....Most of us cried like crazy during the movie.. When we usher theaters---we carry a box of Kleenex to the theater for anyone who needs it. The movie helped show me..that though it was a few years ago, people are still hurting and healing...and that this will always leave a mark, despite how much people try to avoid the topic.....",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Must See,"Though it will always be to early for some this movie is a must see.I went in with low expectations due to a media clip seen on cable news. I felt that I had to watch this movie to honor those who had died by watching their story of terror, bravery and heroism.The expectations I had were so off, the movie was very well made and as far as I have heard from family interviews on cable news, the passengers and flight crew was happy with the overall portrayals.The anticipation level is on high from the movies first opening shoot, we know the ending but we are hoping and on edge waiting for intervention.The movie has no political agenda and takes place in multiple locations (not just limited to the inside of the plane) as the events of September 11th unfold.This film is strong and full of emotion, there were many sobs and sniffles as the lights came up, there were also many people who clapped in honor of the bravery and heroism of the passengers and crew on United flight 93.Many theaters stated they would not show this movie due to sensitivity. This movie in my opinion was in very good taste and is showing in at least 95% of the theaters across Texas. I went to the 7:40pm showing on Friday night in San Antonio, Texas.

Does It Age Well?,"A real time account of the events on United Flight 93, one of the planes hijacked on 9/11 that crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania when passengers foiled the terrorist plot.Roger Ebert, Michael Medved, Peter Travers, and James Berardinelli all awarded the film four stars. It was termed ""one of the most moving films of the year"" by Travers in Rolling Stone magazine. The film has even been cited as a favorite by filmmaker John Waters, who presented it as his annual selection within the 2010 Maryland Film Festival.Waters citing it as recently as 2010 is impressive, as I wonder if this film ages well. In 2006, the events of 2001 were still fresh in the minds of us all. But today (2014), unless we lived on the east coast, the tragedy is fading and Todd Beamer may not be a household name anymore.

What else can be said?,"If a film had to be made depicting the events of that dark September day, this is the perfect answer. The director brilliantly avoids making this a typical Hollywood production with heroes and villains, subplots, etc. There is ample drama in just depicting what really happened on Flight 93 based on what we know from passenger phone calls, ATC logs, data recorders, etc. The characterization of events of the actual hijacking,rebellion, and eventual crash of United 93 depicted in this film almost certainly match what actually occurred.I respect how the film portrays the events from the terrorists' point of view without passing judgement. They were undoubtedly scared as well, but driven by their loyalty to their cause and the glorification of their god. That said, we should never forget the courage and ultimate sacrifice given by the passengers of Flight 93 who tried in vain to save the lives of others.This film will forever remind us of their valor.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent film-making of a real life tragedy.,"United 93 (2006) was a very good documentation of the tragic morning of September 11th 2001 where terrorist's struck America in a big way! The terrorist's hijacked 4 planes that morning, 3 had already hit their intended targets - the World Trade Center, 1st the North Tower, then the South, the 3rd plane hit the pentagon, this film is a tribute to the very brave passengers and the families of Flight 93 - the 4th hijacked plane.As the passengers realised the real life terror that was happening before them, they were so brave and decided to fight the terrorists and in the process prevented the plane from hitting it's intended target - the white house, the plane crashed in a field killing all on board.The film is very well made, powerful and emotional with excellent performances by all the actors, i'm glad they didn't use big name Hollywood types!!, i also agree that it's done professionally and it's done with respect to the people and families that were involved.So in closing, i highly recommend this movie so that people can get a full insight to the courage and bravery of the innocent people of flight 93, we will never forget the images we saw on our TV screens on that fateful morning.",7.0,Anonymous,History
BS Propaganda,"This movie only serves to instill a sense of nationalism, and it is based on PURE FICTION!!! The passengers of Flight 93 were ultimately evacuated from the plane once it had landed in Cleveland, and then herded into a NASA research facility. Why? Who knows? Probably to be used for government experiments or something.Don't watch this piece of mindless drivel (although if you're conservative or love country music you probably already have). Instead, watch ""Loose Change 2nd Edition"" for the TRUTH about what happened on that black mark in our government's history.Kinda reminds me of when Nero set Rome on fire so he could build himself a palace.

Well done. A justice to the victims and their families.,"Greengrass spent much time with the families of the victims of Flight 93. They wanted this story to be available to the public and expressed their approval of the film. It is a fitting memorial to those who had to die that others might live. I loved that it was completely devoid of politics--no snide asides. It merely showed the horror of that day in the history of our beloved country. Because there were no Hollywood stars, I was not distracted from the story. That was the reason for the film: to simply and in real time tell the painful story. I felt I was on that plane, deciding what I would do when I realized it was headed for a target. Whether or not I acted would not change my fate.

I remember I was a first year high school student back then watching the local news TV at night when the station suddenly cuts to a Breaking News section showing live footage from CNN, and only a few moments after that I saw the second plane rammed into the WTC's Tower 2. A few minutes later the news and pictures of the United 93 wreck site also appeared. Paul Greengrass sure did wrote a very fine story that really gives me the shivers. It especially does so on the second part when the movie focuses more on inside the plane. The majority of the first part got the artistry very nice. The transition between scenes and dialogs kept the intense and confused mood very tight. But it all wears its appeal until the more thrilling second part jumps in. The acting overall is quite a decent job, although I think it's Paul Greengrass' genius directing job which did the movie a great deal.",7.0,Anonymous,History

This was not easy to watch,"9/11 is still a horrific memory. I can imagine it will be horrific for anyone to learn about born after that time. It was horrific watching this film. This was not a bad film overall. I feel the start in the Boston traffic centre was too technical and hard to follow, they could have omitted some of that useless info. The performances are strong and believable. You can feel frustration and feeling of hopelessness during the flight. It was scary watching a first normal flight full of happy and relaxed customers, then have everything changed. I am glad this flight never reached its target and the innocent people fought for their lives. Even though I knew how it was going to end, I couldn't help but hope for a different outcome in the end.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing,"I went into this movie not knowing much about it except that it was about the plane that didn't hit a target. I hadn't seen any trailers or anything. I was expecting that it would be more of a blockbuster type film. I was quite wrong. United 93 was a truly amazing and scary experience.I had always found it awful of course watching documentaries on 9/11, but never really scared. Probably because I live in New Zealand. But watching this as if you are actually in the plane was frightening. I was not scared in the build up of the event, even though you see the terrorists looking nervous etc, but as soon as they started shouting and stabbing innocent people I became quite frightened.The cast did an excellent job. It was awful to see the look of fear on the people's faces when they knew they were going to die, or how nervous they were at fighting back at the hijackers. The actors who played the terrorists were amazing as well. You hate them even more since they have a face, but are of course extremely scared of them too.Paul Greengrass did a terrific job on this movie. Amazing and scary, United 93 reinforces how awful the 9/11 attacks were.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great Film,"Pretty good crowd for a matinée. There were around 50 people there.I'll just say right off the bat that no one was crying or freaking out, or anything else that some who are against this film were ""concerned"" about. And, there were adults of all ages from early 20's up to 60+.This movie is rated R, but with the exception of language, I have seen worse violence in a PG-13 movie.I saw the A&E movie about Flight 93, and this one is much more believable. The A&E movie was very well organized, and focused on the passengers and their families on the ground. And, the passengers in the A&E movie were far too calm, and their conversations seemed scripted. In this new movie, it seemed more real. Everyone talking at once with a major sense of urgency. Same with the terrorists. It blended the agencies on the ground, and showed the result of different agencies not being able to share information. There is also no ""star and co-star"" There weren't any single stars on 9/11 either. In fact, I don't recall hearing ANY names of the characters, other than one woman who identified herself to the person she was calling on the phone.I'm not going to say how the World Trade Center and Pentagon were done, but I will say that it is done tastefully. The whole movie is tasteful, and there are no over glorified Rambo type fight scenes. It is all done realistically.Some scenes are very intense in the fact that it is based on a true story, and in some scenes, I wanted to jump up and help. It does remind you that we are at war, and shows you that our enemies are brutal, and do not care about who they kill.I recommend this movie to everyone. I simply do not buy the notion that it is too soon for a movie like this, and I think that people who are against this film should simply be honest, and say that they don't want to see it. Proceeds from the film are being donated to a memorial at the site of the crash, and if my matinée viewing is any indication of how the movie will do, I'd bet that there will be a VERY nice memorial.",8.0,Anonymous,History
you must see this film,"This movie is perhaps the best non-fiction film I have ever seen. Even though you know what is going to happen and the fate of the people on the plane, the suspense keeps up and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Every moment of this movie was well-crafted and perfectly done. From the opening sequence featuring the terrorists praying through the messages at the end of the film, the filmmakers knew what they were doing and the film was flawlessly executed.Even though you didn't learn more about the characters, that doesn't matter. The emphasis here is on the action on the plane and the events of 9/11. It was obviously well-researched as the passengers' phone calls and counterattacks on the terrorists were portrayed with perfection. The scenes where they planned their strategies, pounced on the terrorists, rushed the cockpit, and let their loved ones know about their actions were the highlights of them film. Anyone affected by 9/11 and Todd Beamer's words ""Let's roll"" will be captivated by the sequences of action and conversations. (planning and otherwise) *** 1/2 out of ****",,Anonymous,History
touchingly human,"United 93 is different from the other plane-related action movies I've seen. It's not a documentary on September 11, and yet you watch some news on TV; there are terrorists, but that's not what scares you the most; there are human stories but they don't hit you singularly. I watched all the events of September 11 from around the world, and yet I felt my eyes watering, so I wouldn't recommend the movie to relatives of the victims. It made me pray against the odds for a different ending, even though I knew precisely what was going to happen. I think it gives to not Americans a real look inside the pain of impotence, especially hearing the phone calls speaking of love instead of haste.

Flight,"What exactly transpired on United Flight 93 -- the fourth hijacked aircraft that did not meet its target on September 11, 2001 -- is something we may never know, but using information from dozens of interviews, this speculative drama portrays what may have occurred. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, the film is a riveting experience with the deliberately unsteady camera-work and lack of big name stars making the film feel like a documentary at times. Whether it benefits from flipping back and forth between the title flight and the frantic ground crew is debatable; tension dissipates every time the film cuts away from the plane, but the exposition revealed in the cutaway scenes certainly adds to the sullen mood. The film's more hotly debated issue though is its choice to paint the terrorists as flawed, questioning and equally as scared and nervous as the passengers. It is a curiously objective move, and yet without any of the passengers or flight crew fleshed out in any depth, an odd dynamic develops as we get to know the terrorists better than their victims. The intense final 20 or so minutes of the film do need deep characterisation though as the passengers and surviving crew members band together in a surefire testament to the power of the human spirit. While the denouement is hard to watch here without a lump developing in the throat, there is something uplifting about the film as it showcases just how much a bunch of strangers can achieve together; history today would no doubt be different had they acted differently that day.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not as good as Flight 93,"This is a very well-meaning and honestly-made film, and I would no doubt of thought very highly of it, had I not first seen the TV movie Flight 93.Some people seem to think that a TV movie cannot on principle be as good as a cinema film, but, at least in this case, it isn't so.United 93 fails to make the passengers into real, living individuals. The families did not want them to be named or singled out, out of respect for the rest, but this is to the detriment of film-making. It means that we cannot empathize with them very much.A very interesting and moving feature of the real-life tragedy was the fact that the passengers were able to phone home during the crisis - something new in the history of hijacking. Flight 93 makes the most of that. This film, though, pares it right down to repeated brief shots of people saying ""I love you"" and ""Just tell them I love them"". Here again, I suspect that the families, understandably, had a lot of influence.The upshot is: see the other film instead.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Raw, honest and superbly presented! A must see!","The story of flight 93 is an inspiring and heart wrenching story that needed to be told. All those of us who witnessed the events of 9/11 unfold on this fateful September morning remember clearly what we were doing and where we were. I was personally on my way to work when I heard that AA 11 hit Tower 1. 90 minutes later, I watched the Pentagon on fire from my office window. From that moment, my view of the world had changed for ever. I was quite relieved to see that this movie did not try to politicize the issue and just narrated the events faithfully, without any agenda. The footage was raw and poignant. Greengrass did not try to tone down the barbarism of the highjackers who cheered when they learned that ""their brothers had hit their targets"". We also get a glimpse of the terror that the passengers had to live through and overcome. The movie gives due credit to Thom Burnett's composure, heroism and leadership. A bunch of every day Americans who have been put together on this doomed flight and decided they would not go down without a fight. The movie was very well done, with very little background music and some real footage of the events. I was so shaken when it ended that I sat throughout the end credits, unable to move. I was very surprised to see a number of people from NORAAD and the FAA play themselves. How more realistic can it get? The bottom line is that this is a great movie and tribute to the first front line casualties of the war on terror and must be seen with the respect these heroes deserve.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Nice and powerful,"United 93 (2006) is a gripping rollercoaster that navigates the harrowing events of 9/11 with an unflinching gaze. The acting is a tour de force, with performances so raw and genuine that you feel the anxiety in your gut. The film editing is a masterclass, creating a relentless pace that mirrors the urgency of the situation. The strength lies in its ability to humanize the passengers, turning them from strangers to heroes in the blink of an eye. The weakness, if any, might be the visceral intensity that could be overwhelming for some. The haunting music underscores the tension, adding an emotional layer that lingers. The cinematography captures the chaos with a documentary-like realism. United 93 is not just a movie; it's a visceral experience that pays homage to the courage of ordinary individuals thrust into extraordinary circumstances. The message is clear: heroism can emerge from the most unexpected places. With a 7/10 rating, it's a testament to a film that leaves a lasting impression.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Gripping, frustrating, intense portrayal of heroism on 911","This is a gripping portrayal of what occurred aboard United Flight 93, the last plane to be hijacked on 911. The film runs pretty much in real time, splitting between the doomed passengers and the air traffic controllers who gradually become aware of, on the ground, what is happening in the air. The film plays as near-documentary, avoiding the temptation to idealize the people involved, or even elaborate much on who they were as individual personalities. Instead, it allows the horrific events to unfold as they apparently actually did at the time, without revisionist history or political commentary pointing us in a specific editorial direction. It makes no stars of its heroes, who are shown as just ordinary people who found themselves in a terrible situation.This approach seems almost dispassionate at first. But through a careful, minute-by-minute reconstruction of the known events on board Flight 93 (and perhaps some reasonable, but limited speculation,) the tension and anxiety gradually builds to a harrowing conclusion. What we get is a flashback of sorts to the morning of Sept.11, when, at first, no one knew what was happening, or what would happen in the hours, months, and years to come. We experience the attacks only through the eyes of the people caught on board one plane and those watching from the ground, as the gravity of the day's events slowly becomes clear. The frustration of the controllers watching helplessly as they are unable to stop the numerous hijackings taking place across the country becomes our frustration as well.Writer/Director Paul Greengrass takes great care in avoiding exploitation of the drama inherent in the terrible day's events, never letting us feel like we're watching an airport disaster movie. And although there is bloodletting aboard the plane as the terrorists carry out their evil plan, it never feels like the gratuitous, stylized violence of a gangster movie or mindless action flick. Rather, the brutal nature of all the 911 attacks manifests itself in the very personal hand-to-hand murders committed by the terrorists. The eventual heroic reaction by the passengers who turn from trapped victims with few options, into an improvised army desperately trying to save themselves and perhaps hundreds of other victims, needs no further justification: they realized what was going to happen to them, and they took action.Initially, both the hijackers and the innocent passengers seem as ordinary as any group on an average flight would be. Their call to action is entirely believable because we see them go through the realization that the flight they're on is not a hijack, but a suicide mission. By refusing to over dramatize the now iconic moments like Todd Beamer's famous ""Let's Roll"" remark, Greengrass doesn't seem to be directing the film as much as simply allowing the story to unfold naturally before us as it did for the passengers. We're drawn into their story as their emotions become ours, thus making us feel as if we too are trapped on a plane heading for disaster. The only letdown of the film is the somewhat anonymous nature of the passengers. They're not identified as readily as we know them by now, or at least the main figures who posthumously found fame for their heroism; Beamer, Thomas Burnett, Mark Bingham and Jeremy Glick. This seems to be a conscious effort to make all those who were on the flight as important as any other, not just to lionize the already familiar names in the story, because no one but those who were there know exactly what happened, and what role they actually played.The extraordinary actions of the ordinary people on board the flight are all the more chilling because we are forced to realize how easily it could have been any one of us stuck with the same fate on that day. But what will most deeply affect you after watching this film is the unavoidable question posed by its intense, involving, anxiety-inducing portrayal. Would you have the courage to do what the passengers did that day?",8.0,Anonymous,History
Tragedy accurately depicted!!!,"As I am writing from Greensboro,NC this plane had a special place on the local scene. One of the stewardesses, Ms Bradshaw was from here. After I watched this movie, the local TV news had interviews with both her Mother, as well as her Sister. Also interviewed were patrons at the theater that first showed this re-enactment. I will not go into details of how the tragedy unfolded; it was widely covered by the media at the time. The thing that impressed me was to watch it unfold made the viewer feel like they were a part of the scene, feeling the feelings that the passengers felt. It was as if you were there, hoping to change the known outcome. The accuracy and facts were carefully researched. Waiting 4 1/2 years after this incident was like a new wake-up call, that it could happen again. A must-see film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Is it wrong to watch/create this kind of film?,"I watched this film last night and thought it was a very deep and emotive film.However, as I watched it I realised that although the film can be touching a very raw nerve, are my fellow viewers sick for watching almost 'car crash' television whilst eating their popcorn and sweets?Naturally I feel that this is perhaps a very tunnel visioned view but this 'issue' has been at the centre of a very controversial debate. In my eyes, this is how I feel:-1) When choosing to watch the film, I wanted to see what happened on that fateful day - there was so much in the film that I didn't realise/contemplate or even consider.2) I completely understand that some people really have no desire to watch that film at all but at the same time the same principle can then be applied to other films such as Jar Head during the Gulf War, War Films, Munich etc etc. So what makes this film so different apart from the lapse of time between 9/11 and day of release? But is that such a bad thing?3) Thanks to IMDb, before watching I read on the website that the filmmakers had used a proportion of the proceeds from the film (perhaps the cinema tickets) to put towards the memorial for the United 93 victims. This figure turned out to be 1.95million. OK - that may be relatively small in proportion to how much money is generated from a film - but then again - there has still been a contribution so I can only feel drop of satisfactionPS - As for the rating of the film - i don't know - i didn't know how to rate it. it's not something that was rateable. for me i gave it a 9 because quite simply it was something that made me think - opened my mind and my eyes! is that an over clichéd thing to say?Sorry has been on my mind all day - so thought I would put to you guys!",,Anonymous,History
Best 9/11 movie out there,"Its only dawn for movies about 9/11, the only full length feature film I know of being World Trade Center, which was terrible. That being said, that automatically makes this the best 9/11 movie so far- I even like it more than the documentaries that recover footage.Opening on a tense and dark note, the movie wastes no time setting up everything. The terrorists board the plane, the other planes are hijacked, the WTC is hit, and the military is in a frenzy. While all this comes out good, the scenes on the plane are too slow-moving until the plane is finally hijacked in a dramatic and moving sequence.After the hijacking, the passengers make phone calls to their loved ones, hear of the 9/11 plot, and decide to take action. Everyone on board is a hero, but a problem lies in not knowing who they are.When people are calling their loved ones you feel for them but you're most likely not going to end up teary-eyed. The performances are touching but not having a story backdrop keeps it from moving you to tears.The stand out performances of the film are the terrorists aboard United 93. They barely speak much and you can see the inner conflict in one of them simply by the expression of his face. The hijacking itself is very frightening and the terrorists are merciless.While the film is strong, its a bit too slow-moving and therefore, can make it boring. And not knowing who anybody was makes it hard to evoke any emotion in one unless they lost a loved one that day. I live in NYC but did not, so after my first viewing I felt my attention going elsewhere. I recommend it for one viewing and one viewing only. 7.4/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Truly Memorable Film that All Americans Need to See!,"Paul Greengrass has taken the all-too-familiar events of 9/11 and has created an emotionally charged human drama that will virtually wring you out with emotion and yet not stoop to sensational melodramatics.He made the decision to use unknown actors, many of whom were actual workers in their profession to tell a documentary-like, non judgmental story of how that fateful day went down. The amazing thing is how he is able to use these people to pull you into the story even though you know the eventual outcome. You truly feel as if you are on the plane yourself and watching through your own eyes and not the lens of a camera.For those that feel that this film is being done too soon after 9/11, I hope you see it before you make up your mind on that. It is more of a cinematic memorial to those valiant passengers that will be an everlasting remembrance. It is a film that every American should see.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Solid effort,"I was questioning whether or not I really wanted to watch this, and then my brother rented it so I went ahead and watched it. It turned out to be a very well made film and respectful to all those who lost loved ones on that fateful day 5 years ago. It could be tough watching for many people since it brings back so many painful memories, but I also think it's important to look back from time to time to remember the severity of the attacks and why we're at war. Also, the movie casts relative unknowns, which I think is a good idea, since it makes it feel more real with real people. All in all, it's a solid movie. If you were on the fence about watching this, go ahead and give it a go. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Staggeringly good,"There was no applause when the film ended, there was almost no sound at all except for a few audible sniffles. The power of the film, especially the last 8 minutes, kept most of the people rooted in their seats through most of the credits. I think the only reason I wasn't crying at the end is because I was with a friend and no way am I'm going to lose it in front of a guy friend unless he loses it first. He felt the same which kept us both just barely on this side of sobbing. The movie takes its time, setting the day up, the bulk of the 9/11 hijackings are seen through the screens of the ATC, except of course for the United 93 hijacking. Seeing the news footage of the planes hitting the tower did not have much of an effect on me, I saw them 4.5 years ago and many times since then, so while they were well used here, that was not the part that really affects you. It is when the passengers learn that the planes have hit, and that their plane will not be landing at any airport that the film truly grabs hold of you with a vice grip. They know they have to retake the plane, they call their families to say goodbye, and those of us watching cannot look away from Greengrass' powerful film. People say that it is too soon, but I felt that it wasn't soon enough. We forget about the people who died, the heroes, the innocents who did not have a chance to be heroes. 9/11 has grown distant to so many of us, it has just become something for us to be angry about, be it angry at the terrorists who did this, or at the administration who so readily used it to justify their own agendas. This is not a political film, it does not judge or comment on policy before or after that day. This is a human film, and an intensely moving one.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Powerful,"Roger Ebert said in his review that this ""is not a film that knows any time has passed since (Sept. 11)."" That gives the movie more gravity because it doesn't know what will happen next, and makes the situation that much more immediate.""Powerful"" is a good way to describe this movie. There are a lot of emotions involved, and little character development, but we don't need to know the backgrounds of the people on the plane. They found themselves in a horrible situation and did their best to find a way through it.The camera work adds to the realism of the movie, but can be distracting at times.For those who say it is too soon, that may be just the reason this movie is needed - so we don't forget. If/Since the networks don't want to show Sept. 11 anymore, someone else has to step up and make us remember. Director Paul Greengrass and the cast of this movie do that.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Yes, This Is A Reconstruction","British movie director Paul Greengrass, who had already done movies about subjects such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland, was given the job to reconstruct what had happened on United Flight 93, the fourth passenger airplane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on 9/11/2001. Three others had been hijacked and crashed into both towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and the news of this had somehow reached the passengers of United Flight 93, and they fought back against the hijackers and the plane crashed into a field in Pennsylvania, failing to crash into whatever its intended target was.Purposely the movie was shot in England with little-known actors, to prevent people from bothering the production, and input from the families of the victims was brought in, and they approved the final movie, which was a critical and financial success. Also the movie avoids being rah-rah propaganda; the passengers fought because they had nothing to lose.As for all the conspiracy theories of the passengers somehow being taken to safety, my response is Ha, and Double Ha!",7.0,Anonymous,History
'United 93' soars as haunting cinematic triumph,"Like so much of this heart-breaking, beautifully handled film, you sit transfixed, knowing the tragic fate of the men and women hijacked by the four terrorists on United Flight 93, but not necessarily knowing what they went through during the final moments of their lives.That's still true - we won't ever know. But by stitching together the telephone calls made by those passengers to their loved ones as the events unfolded - as well as the documented accounts of those in the military and air traffic control towers - the movie gives us a believable, realistic idea that is never sensationalized.This sense of realism is heightened by a few factors.First, the film is shot as if it were a documentary, with hand-held cameras giving it the claustrophobic immediacy and off-center sense of confusion cinema verite provides.It was exactly the right choice, removing any sense of Hollywood gloss from a production that would have been bastardized by it.Second, the film employs no known actors - the distraction of a Tom Cruise, for instance, thankfully has no place in this particular war of worlds - with Greengrass going a step farther by using several civilians who were actually there when the planes struck the World Trade Center Towers, then the Pentagon, and then when Flight 93 crashed into that stretch of Pennsylvania field.Chief among those playing themselves is Ben Sliney, whose job it was as FAA operations manager to get a handle on the hijackings. His amazing ""performance"" - or reenactment, as it were - is a gift to history.While the movie only ever wants to observe and never to pass judgment, which is its shrewdest move as it allows the viewer to remain firmly rooted in the moment and not in the murky waters of political commentary, it's in its observations that it creates its gut-wrenching run of suspense.Going into it, we all know how this movie will end, yet watching the terrorists enter the airport and take their seats among those they plan to kill nevertheless forms a knot in your stomach that becomes an anchor.This is particularly true when the door to the plane is sealed shut. With the passengers still reasonably safe on the tarmac, just above them in the flight towers is chaos - frantic men and women aware of hijacked planes. The idea that none of this was shared with the passengers or with the crew allowed them to exist in a cocoon of false security. The world was learning fast that the world was on the brink of change, but for those in the planes, it was just another flight, a link to another destination.Later, in the air, with the chaos unfolding inside Flight 93, the passengers and crew realized they had no choice but to unify and to charge into the face of madness. It's a scene that makes the film the most difficult to endure since Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" or Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist."" ""United 93"" presses hard on raw nerves and then, in its final frame, it literally crushes them. What Greengrass has created is haunting and unshakable, the medium at its full potential.",10.0,Anonymous,History
An intense and moving picture,"The pacing of the script is excellent, with tension starting immediately then slowly but surely escalating all the way through until the ending. The tone is another thing worth mentioning, Paul Greengrass is known for making intense action movies, so he had some big shoes to fill in making a good historical movie. Did he do it right? Yes, he positively did. I've never seen a movie that blends such incredible intensity and some quieter moments into such perfect harmony like this one, that's something I've never seen in a movie before or since. You'd expect a massive cast to barely get any development in even a long movie, but this one is an exception because you get to know all the people on a personal level. I also like that they didn't make the terrorists stereotypical, sure they're irredeemably evil humans, but they still feel like real people. The whole movie keeps the feeling that you're really experiencing this whole thing and does a fantastic job feeling real.What's even more impressive is how this movie is so tasteful in every aspect. There's no perfunctory pro-america message at any point, no sugarcoating the facts, none of that BS at any part of this movie. It's here to tell what happened and how it happened, and it succeeds greatly. Paul Greengrass took painstaking care to make this movie what it is both in and out of production, doing extensive research into every aspect of it to make it a highly sensitive movie. That's pretty much a perfect summary of the movie in and out, highly sensitive. It shows that this was an unspeakable tragedy for the world because of the acts of evil committed, but also that the passengers of United 93 committed an act of unparalleled bravery in order to save many people, and it's tasteful enough to know what to show and what not to show. There was nothing good about that day, but their actions helped prevent even further tragedy.I seriously can't recommend this movie enough.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Reflections,"""United 93"" is not so much a film as it is a mirror. It reflects back to the viewer the feelings and emotions of September 11, 2001 without any attempt at amplification or modulation. In that respect it is perhaps the most unemotional film I have ever seen. There are no dramatic effects used to create the artistic bridge to empathy. That bridge is already present in those who experienced the events.The experience of the film is powerful because it taps into our own powerful real-life memories. However I wonder how it will play to children born today when they are old enough to see it. Will their reaction be as detached as the film, or will the film still draw in emotion that it does not exhale? Obviously I am unable to make a useful conclusion about that, but my guess is that it will still remain a powerful experience.",,Anonymous,History
"""I'm just calling to tell you that I love you, and goodbye""","When we talk about September 11, we usually refer to the World Trade Center and discuss the conspiracy theories and who is, in fact, responsible for this tragedy.

The story is told from the perspective of the passengers of the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, passengers who realized what was happening and took matters into their own hands, sacrificing their lives for a greater good. True, their fates were already sealed, since the abduction was a suicide mission, but it does not diminish the courage of people who have decided to leave this world as heroes, not as victims.

Exceptional and cathartic,"I hesitated watching this great movie. But now I'm glad I got up the nerve to sit through this exceptional piece of art.Greengrass walked through a minefield and created a masterpiece with this movie. His nomination for Best Director at the Oscars is so well deserved.I find myself viewing this movie again and again, I can't get it out of my mind. You've probably heard the many descriptions about how Greengrass's touch is pseudo-documentary in tone and style, a fly on the wall approach. We literally can't tell which players in this movie are actors and which ones are the real thing (with the exception of Ben Sliney and others).The depiction of the plane's passengers is heartfelt and subtle. Even the terrorists are fleshed out in such a way to provide greater insight into the evil things they did that day. Jamie Harding is excellent as the youngest terrorist who is so obviously filled with such self-righteous fanaticism that he, along with the others, could see the evil they were doing as somehow justified and an act of Allah/God.The looks on the faces of the players on the ground remind me of my own reaction - stunned disbelief and shock. Can this really be happening? It is enormously emotionally satisfying to see the passengers fight back as they do, as I hope I would do if I were there on the plane with them. The final moments of this movie are absolutely gripping and unforgettable.I can't imagine a more accomplished, more fitting treatment of the September 11th tragedy than this one.",10.0,Anonymous,History
It's...Effective,"How can a film so void of artistry be so effective? This is the question that lurked in my mind throughout United 93. The answer is simple: it's effective the same way watching news footage of the the planes striking the Twin Towers is effective--it confides in the sheer importance, and the Horrifying nature of these events. It's something real, something profound. But is that truly enough? Paul Greengrass thinks so.So, what is the difference between this film and, say, Faces of Death? Well, that's a tough question. Both rely on the pretense that you're watching a horrific act unfold in real time in front of your eyes; neither film has any substance or characterization, nor do they pretend to. So, why is one critically praised and the other deemed pseudo- snuff? I honestly cannot answer that. I do not know.Another film in the hyper-realism, docudrama genre is Gus Van Sant's 'Elephant', a film I've rated a 10 here on IMDb. The two are very similar in their approach. But what separates these two films is artistry. 'Elephant' is a film fluid in symbolism and meaning, 'United 93' is a film fluid in heedless chaos.Nonetheless, 'United 93' is an intense and harrowing thriller despite it's ultimate empty- headedness. A film everyone should see once.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
Be aware of the camera technique!,"This camera technique caused us to leave before the movie was half way through. I was motion sick like never before. I'm not sure what the artistic point is to the films the that use this technique -- looks and feels like it was done with a home, personal video camera -- but it ruined this movie for us.I noticed two ladies down the row from us having the same problem, closing their eyes and getting up and walking out for periods of time, so I know it did not just affect us.Let me interject here that before last night I really, really wanted to see this movie. That I had read many a review and felt that it was an honor to 93's victims. I felt like I wanted to go and honor them at the same time.And the part of the movie I did see, seemed to be done tastefully and honorably. There were some unbelievable parts such as the over-friendliness of the flight attendants. I fly a whole lot and I have never seen a flight attendant so animated and bright, much less a whole plane full of them.I also must say that it was a little confusing as the switched back between the different control centers and towers. It seems to me a film maker could be a little more creative in giving his audience a obvious difference that showed which command was the FAA, New York, Boston, etc.But for me, I am so upset that it was ruined by the motion sickness. I am not one who gets car sick, plane sick, boat sick, etc. So I am surprised. I have felt queasy in two other movies, the Blair Witch Project, and The Bourne Supremacy, but both of those I watched from beginning to end. This one I could not stay a minute longer, I was going to lose it.I don't know how to find out about this before going to a movie, but I will do some research. I don't ever want to go to a movie done this way again.",4.0,Anonymous,History
better than expected,"Somehow I expected, due the emotive subject matter, a somewhat sickeningly patriotic propagandist movie - but it was none of that! Though we shall never know the exact words said and the actions taken on board that airliner, we can believe it must have been something of the sort.Of course we knew the outcome, but I found myself nonetheless willing the passenger uprising to succeed and in the final minutes the intensity was enormous.The hand-held camera movement (as in the Bourne movies) was irritating, especially for the scenes on the ground. Also I felt the lack of visual reference points on the plane, for example the lack of scenery out of the windows to give a greater sense of height was missing - at some points you felt the cabin was a studio set as all shots showing windows were ""white"".It was a haunting and realistic movie, sensitively portraying the events as they must have unfolded on that fateful day from the perspective of flight United 93.",8.0,Anonymous,History
They came.... but could we?,"This astonishingly powerful movie gives us as close to a documentary view of the real-time unfolding of 9/11 as anyone will likely ever be able to get.I had initially resisted seeing United 93, remembering the actual day of 9/11 far too well to 'need' the reminder of this movie. But I hesitatingly relented. I was right to give in.United 93 is not ""enjoyable"". Nor is it ""entertaining"". It is unexpectedly, almost overwhelmingly real and sometimes difficult to watch. The R-rating is deserved for scenes that depict with distressing realism the raw violence and coarse, cold malevolence of the murderers on board. But far from embellishing the unknown or exaggerating the more 'photogenic' recorded details, this account of the last stolen flight of 9/11 succeeds in its brilliantly understated, and fundamentally truthful, handover to the audience of what simply happened, and how it happened between 8am and 10am on 9/11/2001. In a way that those of us who watched from the outside would never have quite understood, United 93 displays the confusion, anger, immobility and infuriating false-positives that resulted when expert air traffic controllers and soldiers were caught flat-footed trying to detect the few actually hijacked airliners in a dizzying electronic waterfall of 4,000 simultaneous flights moving across America.It also displays shocked professionals who traversed their emotions to tackle some of the toughest moral and tactical calls imaginable, all with the goal of saving innocent life. Perhaps as a contrast, we never see the political leaders who are ostensibly supposed to manage such a crisis, only hearing of them remotely as military officers urgently try to contact the President and then anybody who might have the authority to let them stop the now-hostile planes.United 93 also avoids taking a smooth and easy way out by trying to ignore or muffle the Islamic religious commitments and motives of the terrorists. On the contrary, the film explores this element of contemporary terrorism unflinchingly. Along with their combination of anxiety, hesitation, and astonishing malice, the hijackers' urgently-intoned Muslim prayers and Arabic entreaties add valuable emotional and human realism, while introducing the audience to the ideological anchoring that gave them the mental strength and clarity of purpose to terminate their own lives for the purpose of destroying others'.The surprisingly rapid awareness and response of the passengers and crew might seem almost artificially accelerated...until you realize that the passengers on United 93 actually DID respond with the amazing speed and flexibility that the movie depicts. The incredibly textured and human reactions of the diverse group of fliers on board could be the centerpiece of a textbook of sociology--and also forces viewers to consider whether they have the mental agility, freedom of thought and passionate moral commitment to dismiss a comforting framework of naiveté -- ""let's just do what they say..."" -- and respond instead with the same courage and speed generated by this unexpected brotherhood of strangers, as courageous and devoted as any unit of soldiers, who, one begins to feel, were led by destiny to fly and fight together. ""They're coming!"" yells one of the terrorists as the unexpected response begins. And come they did... but would we? United 93 begins as a prosaic Everyflight that transitions, with amazing speed, into a dazzling example of human bravery, shared mission and a burning devotion to the good.The brilliantly-filmed conclusion of the movie leaves you with an aching, rending sense of loss and justice denied--but also with an awareness that nobody else but those passengers was able to make the critical difference that morning. United 93 may well become the sine qua non of dramatic interpretations of 9/11. It deserves to.",9.0,Anonymous,History
United 93.,"This movie was spellbinding, and should be required viewing for all Americans. While we all remember, my fear is that we will allow the real horror of that day to fade.The crew and passengers on Flight 93 were an amazing group of people with courage that defies description. I was particularly touched by the strength displayed by flight attendant, Sandy Brandshaw.As I watched the movie I was struck with the fact that nobody in the theater moved from the moment the film started until it ended. Popcorn and trips to the bathroom were forgotten.As I left the theater I remembered exactly how I felt on 9/11/01.

Even though you know what is going to happen, it grabs you with suspense.No one living knows the full particulars of what happened aboard Flight 93, so some dramatization is necessary.

"More than an average ""Movie""","This film portrays the deplorable events that occurred on 9/11, ""United 93"" was one of the four planes hijacked that day and was the only plane that did not reach its target. This is definitely not for the faint- hearted as it is a very moving portrayal.The film is in honour to the 40 passengers and crew who stood out their bravery in opposition to the four suicide terrorists who hijacked the plane but did not reach their intentions of a premeditated attack.Paul Greengrass wrote and directed the film, which he knew would be considered as very controversial. Many argued that it was too soon to be re-enacted, but Paul felt it seemed the right time to be made with a release 5 years after the event. Paul managed to get in contact with all the families on board of United 93 which wasn't an easy task. The families were all thoroughly supportive towards a film being made as long as it looked and felt realistic to what did supposedly occur. I was very impressed how this film created a believable truth, and the film certainly didn't suffer with its improvisation. United 93 unquestionably looks authentic and doesn't belong into a clichéd movie world where you anticipate extraordinary things to happen. There is a lot of visual effects used in this production and they are very well handled and aren't the centre of awareness. For instance, during the filming the plane was on the ground and not in the air but this was not apparent. I also really thought the music felt appropriate as it had a sense of misfortune and told the story of a broken nation, which was important because the film explored one of the most significant events in a lifetime.The cast assembles reasonably unknown actors that were a close representation to those on board on the day. The actors were given studies to each individual's life and they met the families to give them a broad insight to whom they were playing. I have to say the acting in this film is very close to perfection and it felt truthful to use unknown actors who were just like any average Joe stuck in an everyday life. I felt this was a really good idea because I often get distracted when I see certain actors and it reminds me that the film is fictional. I believe what also made it appear authentic were the scenes shot in the air traffic command centre. The people portraying these roles are factual people and not actors, most of who were there on the day of 9/11  portraying themselves. The pilots and stewardess on board of the plane are also non professional actors and depicting what they do in everyday life.After watching this film I felt extremely speechless and proud of the passengers and crew that were on board - they took the chance of sacrificing their life. The film didn't make them look like victims, if anything they are the heroes! It is such a credible film and I cant think of anything negative to say about it. I felt very emotional after watching this and I envisage numerous others will too.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Would have benefitted from better focus and a tighter running time, but the last 20 minutes or so make it worth the effort","United 93 tells the true story of a plane that was hijacked on September 11th 2001 and the passengers on-board the plane fighting back against the terrorists in order to foil their plans...Given that the majority of the media focus at the time was on the planes that actually crashed into the Twin Towers, this harrowing true story is one that people may have forgotten about or overlooked. Having watched the film, it's not an experience that I'm likely to forget and I'm more than willing to commend the bravery of the passengers for their actions on that fateful morning. However, as a piece of cinema I didn't find United 93 to be entirely satisfying...The film is apparently shot in real-time and presumably Greengrass has done this to make the film feel more realistic and to perhaps draw the audience into the events as they happen. I think part of the problem with this film is that Greengrass has gone a little overboard with finer details - there is about a 30 minute build-up showing people waiting at the airport, waiting to board the plane etc and it's probably past the half hour mark before the plane even takes off. I'm sure in his mind that Greengrass did this perhaps as a way of building suspense, but I just found it a little tedious and unnecessary.Also as the film is called United 93 I did expect the film to focus pretty much all of its attention on that flight. However, on various occasions the film cuts back to various air-traffic control centres with varying threats or actual hijackings taking place. There's nothing wrong with any of this per se, but it does make the film feel a little cluttered and unfocused at times - it's like Greengrass couldn't decide whether to make a documentary about the events of 9/11 or a film about the bravery of the passengers on-board flight UA 93. By trying to do both, the film. feels padded and far longer than it needs to be.
 
However, once you get past the hour mark, Greengrass does crank up the tension and in the last 20 minutes or so I literally could not take my eyes off the screen. I would still recommend watching this film, but do feel that with a shorter running time and slightly better focus that I may have enjoyed it more than I did.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Left me drained and depressed,"Little is known about what actually occurred in the waning moments of United Flight 93 on the morning of September 11, 2001. All we have is the mute cockpit voice recorder and the recollection of families based on cell phone messages received from passengers before the hijacked plane crashed in a field in Shanksville, Pa. with no survivors. We also have the speculative recreation of director Paul Greenglass (Bloody Sunday) in his powerful film, United 93. Shot by Barry Ackroyd using a hand-held camera that makes you feel part of the action, (not recommended for viewers with a tendency to motion sickness), the film dramatizes the efforts of some passengers to free the plane from their captors whom they believed to be dedicated to carrying out a suicide mission, presumably in Washington, D.C.Using more than 100 interviews with families, friends, and civilian and military officials, director Paul Greenglass shows us what might have happened to the 40 passengers and crew of the ill-fated plane. Striving for a documentary-like reality, Greenglass uses unknown actors and key civilian and military personnel to play themselves, including Ben Sliney who was in charge of the FAA command center. The film, however, does not hesitate to utilize conjecture such as a terrorist placing a picture of the Capitol building on the cockpit steering wheel or details of a final heroic assault on the cockpit.United 93 begins in chaos and ends in flames. From the barely audible entreaties of the hijackers that open the film to the final prayers of the passengers and crew, the film revisits the fear and confusion of that day. Shifting between the passengers and crew as they prepare the plane for takeoff and air traffic control centers and FAA headquarters in Virginia, we watch helplessly as the nightmare unfolds before befuddled air traffic controllers and military personnel. Without belaboring the point, the director makes it clear that the lack of communications between key sectors and the unavailability of the President and Vice-President contributed to the disaster. Unlike Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911, however, there is no explanation of the fact that the Air Force requests orders from President George W. Bush but receives none.Excruciatingly slow to move, when the leader Ziad Jarrah (Kahlid Abdalla) decides the time is right to take over the plane, we brace ourselves for what is to come, knowing there can be only one result and the last fifteen minutes are extremely harrowing, to say the least. While, to his credit, Greenglass does not add extraneous human interest dramas, political commentary, or overt demonizing of the Islamic hijackers, the decision to avoid character arcs is both a benefit and a detriment. While it avoids reducing the action to the level of a TV movie of the week, it also deprives us of any knowledge of the individuals involved, knowledge that might help us care more about what is happening.United 93 does not bring closure to the tragedy or put it in perspective relative to subsequent events but only succeeds in rekindling our anger toward Islamic militants and, perhaps inadvertently, supports the Bush agenda. The result is a powerful experience but one that is strangely devoid of humanity and left me feeling drained and depressed with little space for quiet reflection or contemplation.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A very deceiving movie, trying to attack our feelings and smuggle the truth.","I was shocked how the movie depict the FAA control rooms as bunch of people that have no clue and the military as bunch of guys that have no authority. In reality - as opposite to the movie - the east coast is guarded and there are all the time fighter jets in air. They not need to be scrambles, they was just routinely redirected each time a malfunction in the communication occur to intercept the plane. There is a known to pilots procedure about it. The fighter jet come up from left (where the first pilot sit) and wave by his wings. The airplane witch radio was given up, has to wave by their wings as well. Then the fighter jet lead it to nearby airport and the plane has to follow. If not, there is warning shots and then direct ones. But all that is unnecessary in Boeing 757 and 767 planes, witch can be remotely controlled by NORAD itself. They can shut off the pilot controls and even with his active resistance fly and land the plane alone. Of course that way omitted. Another problem is, that at 8:13 is the flight 11 known for not responding (flighters should be notified from NORAD to check this one out). At 8:14 the flight 11 goes off course - all red signals go on and fighters should have fly in afterburner now, because this is serious. Transponder of flight 11 stop working in 8:20. Then the plane is shown as red object - it is UFO (unidefined Flight Object) or more like a ENEMY in USA airspace - so one not need to search out all 4200 airplanes air borne to see exactly witch one is now enemy. It should be worth mentioning that no hijacked ever disabled transponder, as that for the military then mean - ENEMY airplane. And the last thing hijacker want is to mess with military armed fighters. There was another lie in the movie that scrambled F16 was unarmed. First at all, a F15 doing the job. And second - they are armed the moment they roll out of hangar. What the hell could be a military plane useful w/o arms...? But back to the time. 8:13 or 8:14 we got a hijacked plane. From 8:20 we got a ENEMY plane over the United States of America. And to the impact at 8:46 is long 26 minutes. Ever if the fighters aren't in air already, they from Otis Airbase can do it to Manhattan in just 7 minutes. Look at small the distance, and F15 can pull Mach 2,5 - do the math. And about the phone calls - mobile phones does not work in airliners. Try for yourself. The setback phones might have better chances, but why would American Airlines in 2004 make such adverts from their new cell stations? If setback or even mobile phones worked so well in 2001, why invest millions in such new technology? http://www.usatoday.com/money/biztravel/2004-07-19-aircells_x.htmAnd someone have the balls to his the viewers with such lie - come on, that is not good.

The soul is alive,"United 93 Honorable, heart-breaking, proud, frustrating, angry, endearing, bravery, unbelievable, morose, and about a million other verbs, adverbs, or whatever other superlatives you can think of will cross the mind upon the experience called United 93. This film opens up old wounds and creates new ones. How could this possibly happen? Why didn't people move faster? Where in God's name was Bush? Why them? Why us? You are put on the doomed plane with forty extraordinary ladies and gentleman. You are so proud when this film is over and not to be an American but to be a part of the human race. At mankind's peek of expiration the spirit becomes alive and is evident in actions and words. I try not to look at this subjectively. Living so close to New York City and witnessing the attacks happen right in front of your eyes does make this experience that much harder. I will agree with a lot of people and say this might have been too soon to start giving the different perspectives on the attacks but it's been made and we have to deal with it. This is a film that you really don't want to see that you should see. Paul Greengrass took a huge risk on making this film and he does the passengers, the families, and the rest of mankind justice.The most hurtful thing of this process wasn't the actual things in the film taking place but the mystery that is left afterwards. We will never know in this world and lifetime what happened on that plane, we will never know what it felt like to be on that plane or to be the loved one of a person being called by someone on that plane, but we do know that if you are reading this review right now than you are alive and that is a blessing in its own.There are no performances that stick out unless you give it to all the passengers as an ensemble. (hint: Screen Actors Guild) I'm not sure if this could make it to the ceremony. I on one hand loved the film for its brutal honesty and hate it because it's a constant reminder of evil. I will probably never see this film again, I'll own it on DVD just because I'm a freak like that but living through that day over and over again is just something I don't want to do. Possible nominations for Picture, Director, Screenplay, and the technical categories. If our Academy is touched as I am by this film they will want to reward it with at least a nomination otherwise it will play as another ""Passion of the Christ.""

Realistic and powerful,"It seems as though the creators of United 93 were prepared to make a film that respects Sept.11, 2001. This film negated any notion to ""Hollywoodize"" the film, over-sensationalize the events, or attempt to make the viewer teary-eyed. Kudos to them for taking this angle and because of this, a wonderful, powerfully honest, and realistic film emerged from this.My only problem with the film was the seemingly ""shakey camera"" annoyance, the extremely small lettering in the sub-titles during the hijackers conversation (had to keep rewinding), and the somewhat disturbing misses during action sequences that the camera could never quite focus on. It was as if the cameraman was a passenger desperately trying to film and never having the ability to get to the core of the action.

This is a hard film to review.,"Before seeing United 93, I had many doubts. Natural questions arise when discussing the first Hollywood recreation of 9/11.Should this have been made? What can be taken from it? Will it just be an offensive or heartless manipulation of a real tragedy? There is little doubt that simply as a film, United 93 is well made. It is expertly paced, it is involving and it captures the chaos of that Tuesday morning.Director Paul Greengrass uses mainly hand-held cameras, giving a similar ""you are there"" feel as his last film, the hit sequel The Bourne Supremacy. Random bouncing around is toned down a bit, though, so if you got sea-sick during Bourne you can rest a little easier here.Most of the running time is spent either on flight 93, which was the fourth plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, or around various air control or military rooms. Nothing is shown from Ground Zero.Greengrass walks a very tight rope, managing not to become exploitive while also not falling into extreme political correctness.His film is brutal at points, but never gratuitous. The way the reactions of everyone in the film are portrayed helps to humanize them, since we all had similar responses on September 11th.Even if a vivid back-story is not presented for each person, little distance is felt. Sometimes it is possible to relate through circumstance, and the fact that there are no marquee name stars helps the actors become their characters. Some of the officials in the control rooms actually play themselves, too.This gives an authenticity to the film that is needed, especially since it comes so soon after the attacks.Of course, following Fahrenheit 9/11 anything that remotely touches on controversial or political ideas is considered one-sided propaganda. Conspiracy theory nuts especially have used this to bring down United 93 and the people behind it.However, any film or art form cannot truly be neutral, and this is a good thing. It is why  as filmgoers  we should use our own intelligence and rationality, never only taking what we see on screen as gospel. Art should make us question rather than blindly accept.With this said, here is a film that is constructed with passion and care, attempting to recreate an experience rather than further an agenda.The portrayal of the terrorists is perhaps the hardest challenge. Their evil is not overemphasized. The film opens with them praying, and it gives a glimpse into their fanatical religious beliefs that lead them to believe murdering thousands of Americans is a solution for anything.This makes the tragedy all the more palatable, since we are not watching inhuman monstrosities rampaging, but rather people doing horrible things to other people.This inherent tragedy helps to make the heroism at the end seem true, rather than forced and sentimental. United 93 shows, without preaching, the way people can bind together to kill each other, and also bind together to do the opposite.Still, not everything about United 93 works.One scene involving a passenger who wants to acquiesce to all the terrorists' commands is overdone, and it feels like a fake Hollywood invention.The amount of text after the harrowing end  which eerily reveals death as well as cinema can  is somewhat distancing. It would have been better and more effective if there wasn't an immediate bombardment of historical facts we already know.In the end, United 93's greatest strength is its greatest weakness. The fact that it has no political ambitions or fiery declarations lets the emotion of what it shows seem fresh, real, and genuine.The confusion, fear, and unification that came from these attacks are perfectly captured, although little is said that is groundbreaking or philosophically revolutionary.""Why"" is not as important as ""what."" United 93 is ultimately a reminder.While remembering an event that happened less than five years ago might seem superfluous, this is not so much a reminder of the physical, actual event which is impossible to forget, but of the emotions that arose that day and what was created from these emotions.9/11 has become a punch line for politicians, the memories we all carry abused and torn apart by vehement partisan anger.The title might seem cheesy but it signifies the central theme that runs throughout this tragic but heroic tale.For all that was destroyed in the attacks, something was gained. America found a new connection, a connection that went beyond conspiracy theories or liberal/conservative politics.The fact that United 93 captures this connection at all is proof that, despite any flaws, it is not too soon for this film, and that its greatest message is not delivered in a long-winded monologue but discovered in the emotions simmering right until the end.Critic's Conclusion: Not necessarily an easy film to sit through, United 93 comes at the right time. Unlikely to find a large audience now, those willing to give it a chance might be surprised at the emotions it carefully exposes.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A dark day brightly done,"This is not likely to turn up as an inflight movie anywhere or anytime. It captures the horror and the terror of 9/11. And although it captures the reality of the situation, the endless aviation jargon in the tower and the cockpit gets confusing and even boring. It's also difficult to understand how the producers of such an important film got so much so wrong. Cinematic licence or carelessness? (Look at the error file here on IMDB).
Nevertheless it is a graphic and important re-telling of the events of that horrible day. Most intriguing to me was the fact that I knew what would happen, but none of the passengers, aircrew or ATC officials did. Their false hopes and attempted explanations of what was happening make compelling drama.

It brings back memories for the rest of us.If you want to know if you should go see this film, then my answer would be yes.

It is a well known fact, that movies can be strong propaganda tool. Especially when you are trying to make people believe in to something that simply is not true. Allot of movies that are suppose to be telling a story of a true event, still do not follow the true story, but still adjust to the public . . . in this case, the whole movie is simply a drama, made up movie with absolutely no basis in reality . . . .Critical, and open-minded look at the evidence would make any person with actually using it's brains see that . . . I live in Europe, and I consider my self lucky not to be living in the states. I watched the movie and was laughing actually all through it cos most things shown there have nothing to do with reality - - -I am in the aviation, and know a bit about procedures in these kind of situations - - - What I saw in the movie ( and it is suppose to be a fact ) - - - made me laugh. Of course people with absolutely no idea about aviation and procedures . . . will buy the story, cos it is easier to believe a fairy tale then look the truth in the eyes and say ""Yes our government is killing our own people, to promote their own agenda"" - - - nobody wants to believe that people that were ""elected"", simply don't give a MERDE, for common folk. And coming back to the movie, this movie was one more little manoeuvre thought up by people in power, to help them promote their agenda of BS concerning 9/11 - -",1.0,Anonymous,History
A Must See,"I have al4ways wanted to laugh at people who jump up at scary movies and yell out ""Run! Run!"". I always wanted to turn around and say ""It's just a movie!"" This might just be a movie--a re-enactment--but during parts of the movie, I wanted to do just that. I wanted all those people sitting in the waiting area to get up and leave. I wanted to be in the room with the air traffic controllers and tell them what was going on. It compelled me to want to do those things. This was a great movie and, even though we all know what's coming at the end of the movie, you will still feel stunned.

"Believe the hype - this is an amazing, gut-wrenching film","Saw this film tonight and wow, it's a breathtaking roller-coaster of emotions. Greengrass makes you experience it all, anger, confusion, fear, pity, nausea, sympathy, hope, pride... I could go on. This is unbiased but gut-wrenching film-making at it's finest, and deserves Best Picture awards worldwide.Obviously it's impossible to give a 100% accurate depiction of events - because everyone has a different perspective on the simplest thing. But we have the airplane tapes from the Moussaoui trial, with the record of the altitude and speed changes and even hearing the commotion of passengers storming the cockpit, plus the phone conversations and messages (my God can you even imagine leaving your loved ones a final voicemail in a situation like that) and years of knowledge of what happens in air-hijack situations.You know what's coming, and have seen every bit of footage, but it doesn't stop you re-living the shock of that day, wishing on the passengers to recover the plane, welling up with emotion when they're speaking with those safe on the ground, saying goodbyes and hanging up in dignity. Even the footage of the 2nd plane hitting the WTC is given a new, and stomach-wrenching immediacy. Everyone was caught flat-footed, with two planes sent to guard the capital of the most powerful country in history - and they turned out to have gone in the wrong direction, unarmed... In years to come it may seem like this attack could have been a whole lot worse.This is a drama in a long tradition of depicting real events in as 'truthful' a way as possible, and like a Shakespearean history play, or a novel like In Cold Blood, that means some artistic decisions / licences need to be taken and the results will not be to the taste of everyone. Of those decisions, I feel more positive about some than others: the terrorists are realistic, not from a comic book or Hollywood movie, and the repeated use of 'I love you' e.g. by one of the terrorists before boarding, by the passengers before fighting back, is unbearably powerful.On the other hand I'm not sure why Greengrass made out the German passenger, an identifiable real victim, as an appeaser/coward. Couldn't this have been an anonymous member of the cast, or would that not play to American audiences / backers?Ultimately though that's nit-picking, because this is as visceral a film as anyone could bear. Some will see in the film the indomitable spirit of the US, others their unpreparedness and naivety; some I think will come out in despair and others with hope, but I feel sure this is a film that will be talked about for years to come.PS Isn't it scary the numbers of bug-eyed monomaniac loons posting on this site that are convinced this film either perpetuates a right-wing conspiracy or is riddled with socialist, terrorist-loving, 'European' anti-American ideology.

United 93  - Should they have made it?,"I think the answer is an unequivocal yes! Yes, it does seem a little soon but if ever a 9/11 film was going to be made then this is it. United 93 should set the standards for all 9/11 films to follow (Oliver Stone - with your big name cast - take note) With his docu-drama style and refusal to sensationalise Paul Greengrass just tells it like it is, or at least how we think it probably was. Mix this with great script writing which builds the tension almost unbearably (this is a story of events after all NOT a documentary) and consultation with the relatives of those killed and the air traffic officials actually involved and this is an unconventional and brave film. I admire him for using and unknown cast, and I admire the balance of viewpoints taken from the passengers and the terrorists. And most of all I admire the many people who played themselves in the film and were obviously keen for this story to be told.",,Anonymous,History
a brilliant action movie written by life,"This film is a brilliant action film written by life. I was deeply touched by the idea that people really can do such a hijacking without any emotions. I also felt with the passengers and their attempt to turn the situation. Unfortunately the film misses any psychological depth or political statement. What makes people in the third world and some Islamic countries so frustrated that they are open for the fanatic wire-puller who seduce people to such a criminal action.What is the role of the USA and their neocolonialistic friends in the global play, what about the crime of poverty and suppression which is the ground of terrorism. To be very clear: all the negative influence of the west may never be an excuse for murdering innocent people wherever in the world. What about the feelings of the passengers and their intention to turn the situation as hopeless as it it. How develops the team dynamic which empowers them to come to action which is a last chance but it also might be a suicide action. A lot of questions which will made it more than just an action movie. At the end all this questions are still open, they are even not asked. Considering the missed possibilities of the historical and human background I was more than a little bit disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Gut Wrenching, Must SEE!!!!!!","I went to see this movie with open expectations based on what I had heard through others who had already seen this movie. The movie takes on a real life account of the day that we would come to know as simply 9-11. I was across the river from the Pentagon when it was struck, and watched with my own eyes as the events unfolded in DC. I knew two of the people who were killed on that morning in the Pentagon. It is a hard pill to swallow to bring back those memories that we as Americans have tried to put behind us.... But should we really try and forget those brave people who lost their lives on Flight 93, or any other flight that went down that morning. Absolutely Not!!! It is my belief that if this film was supported by the families of those who lost their lives, then who are we as Monday morning quarterbacks to say a word about whether we think this film is appropriate or not. I think every American, Man, Woman and child should go and watch this movie out of respect for those people who have lost their lives due to the events of terrorism.

Paul Greengrass masterfully captured the chaos and panic of September 11 as the military, government, FAA, and airlines all scrambled to respond to the terrorist crisis. The movie takes a few minutes before the frenzy is unleashed, but once it does, the tension and heart-pounding don't stop until the credits roll.

Powerful Drama,"Perhaps the best thing about this flick is it was difficult to find actors. The director honed the flick subjects to the point of total credibility.That said, we can recall the emotions of that day and its confusion. Although this was a creation of what might have happened, I found it well done.I couldn't help, wishing the flick could have the terrorists ousted and the innocent saved.I could not help wondering if this flight may have been saved with an earlier alliance of the passengers and the quick ousting of the terrorist from the flight seat.I sometimes think a third undisclosed emergency pilot should be on every flight. For example, what would have happened IF they ousted the terrorist and flip the plane's guidance computers back on before it was too late.I'll never know and neither will anyone, and of course such speculations are entirely moot.An exciting drama that should be seen.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A unique experience,"This is only the second review I have written on this site and for good reason, I haven't felt strongly enough about the majority of films in recent months (strong enough one way or the other). It was only after watching An American Haunting that I registered with IMDb as i felt it my duty to tell the world how breath takingly awful it was! In fact, it was so bad it almost knocked D-Tox of the top of my list of worse films ever made. Thankfully, I find myself returning to the key board... and IMDb to tell you that YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM!Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you should watch this film to be entertained because that certainly isn't the feeling i had when watching it. To be honest I was nervous and anxious throughout the film, my palms were sweating, an occasional tear would swell in my eye and found it hard to watch in places. I was going through a whole spectrum of emotions that I haven't experienced through film since my first viewing of E.T when I was six years old, but this time there was no orchestra guiding me through the scenes, no patriotic cigar chomping heroes saluting the star spangled banner, no slow motion action and thank god not an a-list celeb in sight.I believe this is as close to real film has ever come. You get a true sense of 'this is how things were'. It's obvious to point out that it has been shot in a documentary style to put you in the centre of the story and involve the audience in the 'action' but never before has it worked with such a degree of success. I felt emotional because for that 90 minutes I was in the plane and just like the passengers I felt there was a chance we'd make it right up to the point the plane crashes (which of course is ridiculous but never the less true).The film triumphs in avoiding all the usual Hollywood b****cks. No Political agendas or meaning are attached to the film, just objective viewing (true fly-on-the-wall style).A lot of people are going to hate the film because they feel studios are capitalising on such a terrible tragedy but I can't see that in this film. It hasn't been made to turn a huge profit but to show the world what happened without bias and it does this very well.I said in the summary that this is a unique experience, by this I mean that never before have I been so compelled to watch something I didn't feel comfortable watching or wasn't entertained by. It is so hard to describe exactly what the feeling is you get from the film so I think it is important that you see for yourself. Don't be put off seeing it because you don't want to contribute to the studios money pot, this has to be viewed in a cinema. I challenge anyone not to be totally gripped.9/11 is fresh in everyones minds and maybe thats why there's such an up roar but personally I think it has been timed perfectly. Yes it is going to open the flood gates to countless, tasteless copies but I urge you not to bundle this one into that category. You're going to be hard pushed to ever find a film so tastefully done on this subject.",9.0,Anonymous,History
an hour of air traffic control and 30 minutes actually concerning united 93,"This movie really disappointed me. I've never been a fan of made for TV movies, but A&E made a movie, titled flight 93 (and I'm fairly sure the A&E version was released first), which I saw prior to seeing this theatrical version, which I would give a ten compared to the 4 I gave this version. The theatrical version severely downplays any heroism you could attribute to the individuals on the flight and focuses more on the insubstantial banter of people in air traffic control rather than most of the true issues. Overall, when you consider the money and time invested in this movie, it is fairly worthless when you compare it to the most likely low budget, but far superior A&E version.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Intense but amazing,"I completely agree with the comment above mine - this movie portrayed the events without making it more dramatic than it really was. I felt like I was a passenger in the plane, and everything was so realistically done it could have been a recording of the real events. It was so powerful, from start to finish. Besides a few gasps from the audience or the occasional sniff, it was silent. And at the end, you could hear a pin drop.I would recommend this movie only if you think you are ready to see it. I knew that I was ready, but throughout the whole film, especially the last hour or so, my stomach was in knots and my muscles were so tense I was shaking. Yet it was an amazing experience. I now can begin to understand what it was like for those passengers. And most importantly, I can appreciate everything that they did, and admire their bravery and strength despite the horrific situation they were thrust into. This movie honors their memory and I truly believe that it is important to never forget what happened that day, and understand exactly what those passengers did for us and our country.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"I was so taken back to that day, I the felt same feelings.","The average movie-goer probably does not appreciate the amount of research and attention to detail that went into the making of this film. As a flight attendant myself I was so quickly taken in by the routine conversations of the flight crew as the preflight inspections take place as they do every day and on every trip. I soon forgot that I was in a movie theater and felt as part of the crew. That is quite impressive in it's own right. All the sights, sounds and even the United flight crew uniforms were so authentic. As the movie progressed, I felt the same panic and anger I felt on that day. And asked the same unanswered question of Why? I think this film even though it was questioned by some to be made too soon, is a very fitting tribute to those who lost their lives. I have always wondered what it would have been like to be on board that flight, what would I have done. I found myself yelling out to the passengers to grab things like fire extinguishers and seat cushions. Then I looked around and remembered I was in a movie theater.

Sad but Inspiring...,"I saw United 93 yesterday, and it affected me so deeply that I was awake most of the night thinking about it. It is a long, long time since I have been so moved by a film.United 93 is the sad but inspiring account of the actions of a group of passengers on a hijacked jet on September 11, 2001. The director, Paul Greengrass, uses shaky, hand-held cameras which make us feel as if we are at the centre of the action. The cinematography is outstanding. As one might expect, the film is terribly sad...one scene in particular got to me...as United 93 is taking off from Newark Airport, the Captain remarks what a beautiful day it is...we then see the plane fly past the World Trade Centre, against a backdrop of a cloudless blue sky. And it was a beautiful day, before tragedy struck...The acting by the completely unknown cast is superb. Many of the air traffic control staff play themselves and I was particularly impressed by Ben Sliney. Yes, there are violent scenes and it is upsetting to see that plane hit the WTC's South Tower. But this is a story that should be told. The heroism of the passengers and crew of United 93 should not be forgotten.Although there is no happy ending here, I left the cinema feeling that those 40 people did not die in vain...their actions quite possibly saved the lives of hundreds of people in Washington. The film leaves you in no doubt that these people were heroes.I really hope that United 93 wins Best Picture at next year's Oscars. It deserves to.

An exercise in endurance.,"The fourth plane to be hijacked on September 11th 2001 did not hit its target because of the immense bravery of a determined few: its passengers – ordinary people who were not ready to die without a fight. Not heroes in white vests or cool leather jackets, but real people. Thankfully, 'United 93' keeps it that way. The characters seem as real as you and I, fretting and stressing that to stop the four terrorists from blowing up the plane or crashing it they are going to have to murder them with their bare hands.The camera work in this film is so claustrophobic that we feel as if we are in the thick of the decision making. We are forced to sit in the air-conditioned near silence and consider if we would have what it takes to survive this or whether we would sit and wait for the end, cursing our own inaction. We peek around chairs and listen as our fellow passengers make phone calls to loved ones, knowing all of our goodbyes may be the last we ever share with a child or a wife or husband. We are trapped in this film and its inevitable end. It is utterly excruciating.Interestingly, not only are forced to endure the aforementioned process of accepting death or fighting it off tooth and nail, but we are also, at the conclusion, stuck up against the fanatics who are crashing the plane, watching closely as they waver not a millimetre in their determinism. They cry 'Allah' as if someone had given them a script from God; they say it as if it was always going to be said with no chance of escaping this nose diving fate. This makes us more determined to stop them; an affectation that pays the highest testimony to the brilliant direction of Paul Greengrass.See this film, but don't expect to ever want to endure it again.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Just the facts; no drama,"Writer/director Paul Grengrass chose to go with a straightforward, home-video style with this film. There is no attempt at finding stories or meaning, no plot to speak of. Things simply happen and then it's over.By going with a barely-compressed time frame which denies the audience a chance to see into the lives of the people involved before the events play out, we are denied involvement with the emotions of the characters from anything but a superficial, fly-on-the-wall standpoint.Greengrass chose to focus narrowly in this movie on air traffic controllers and the passengers on United 93, none of whom we ever really get to know.Frankly, while the finished product is probably exactly what Greengrass was after, a far more remarkable film could have easily been made of this event. But is it still too soon? For a ""real"" movie, yes. But this thing is respectful to a fault, except perhaps in the implicit condemnation of the US's leadership in a time of crisis. That very carefulness, that presentation of everything in as neutral a light as possible, ultimately leaves an empty hole that will probably bring very few viewers the catharsis they bought a ticket to seek.If this were a work of fiction, it would be a very minor release. If it had ever been made at all.A final comment: I for one am sick to death of watching camcorder-style photography in big-buck movies. Focus, steady shots, action that's not rendered an incoherent blur, smooth zooms instead of quick, jerky, ""my first video with this new camera"" pulls and pushes: is it really too much to ask for?",5.0,Anonymous,History
Horrifically fresh,"Director Paul Greengrass has made the unlikely transition from making worthy Birth docu-dramas to frenetic Hollywood blockbusters; lying somewhere in between is this film about the terrorist attack on America in 2001, based on a combination of known fact and plausible interpolation. Potentially, a story of hijacked aircraft crashing faces some of the problems that affected attempts to make a movie about another iconic, era-defining human tragedy, the sinking of the Titantic 90 years earlier: for sure, it was a huge event in world history, but the basic narrative is apparently quite dull: innocent people board a transport of some description, something terrible happens and a lot of death follows. This led to James Cameron, in his film about the epic ship, creating a preposterous and melodramatic back story for his travellers, one that attempted to be large enough to actually contain the sinking of the boat within it. Greengrass thankfully does nothing of the sort here, and there are actually several good reasons why his doesn't need to. Firstly, this drama occurred during the era of modern communications; these have given us the detail that can only be speculated about in the case of the Titanic, and moreover, how this information came to be communicated is a story in itself, whose conclusion is that even the might of the United States military is curiously impotent in the face of a wholly unexpected but immediate threat. Next, there's a natural story that isn't just one of accidental death, in the efforts of passengers on United flight 93 to resist their hijackers (hence the title of this film, although much of this movie is actually set in the air traffic and military command centres, as Greengrass sets his central tale in just the right amount of context). There's also the immediacy of the events, which gives them a horrific charge in a way a story of people who would be dead by now in any case cannot; not only do we still remember the day, it took place in what is still essentially our world. Only when the passengers gather up scissors to prepare a counter attack does it briefly feel like a piece of history. Personally, I find Greengrass's 'Bourne' films somewhat overcooked; but here he gets everything just right. The sad thing is that none of the people he pays tribute here survived to be acknowledged for their bravery, which although it did not save themselves, certainly saved others.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Visceral masterpiece. The end leaves you breathless ( American B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10,"Films about tragic events that everyone knows about, don't always paint the subject matter with seriousness or caution. However, United 93 did an excellent job on telling a story about an event in that day in history. Greengrass' directing was spot on. The characters were richly portrayed and believable.

"""A Film That Is Honest And From The Heart""","United 93 tells the events of September 11th, 2001. It was the only hijacked plane that did not make it's final destination because of it's passengers who decided to take control of the plane. I sat and watch United 93 and Stone's ""World Trade Center"" in the same session. While both films did tug at the emotional scales, United 93 seemed to be a more heartfelt film.Greengrass, who's other films include the just as serious ""Bloody Sunday"" and spy flick ""Bourne Surpremacy"", takes on the difficult task of retelling the horrific events of that day. With no mainstream actors, a relatively small budget and the controversial topic, it would seem that the film was doomed a failure before it was even finished. Alas, it got the approval from the families and people who said that it was ""too soon"" actually went to see it. There are many words one may use to describe the film: respectful, powerful, humanistic, but you can't really describe it to anyone, they must see it for themselves.Why does the film work so well? It chooses to show us the story and not shove it down our throats. We know what happened, but not how it happened. We will never know how it happened, but United 93 gives us a suggestion. Greengrass chose to use a relatively unknown cast and it works. There are no big name distractions here, these people are not being paid big bucks to star in films, which is the sense I got in ""World Trade Center"". Although, you might recognize a face or two, at one moment I was saying to myself, ""Hey, it's that guy from The Mummy"". There were only a few moments in the film where the acting was pretty bad, mainly in the military scenes. That one blonde woman was horrible, but this did not ruin the film.It was interesting to see the intensity of the military personal and flight control centers doing what they do. I can only imagine it was ten times more intense that day then what was depicted. You get the sense of urgency in these scenes, a sense of realism. Everything was pulled off nicely. Seeing the mentions of the other planes was a good way to broaden the drama. I was pleased the film wasn't solely concentrating on United 93, which was another problem for Stone's piece. I was surprised to see actual footage of the planes hitting the towers to be shown and applaud Greengrass for not shying away from it. The use of inexpensive hand-held cameras at to the urgency and realism that was needed. If the production was any bigger, it would have ruined the effectiveness.The film doesn't show us the heroes from that day, instead it shows us how human they are. In the final chilling moments of the film when the passengers are trying to take over the plane, there is no ""hero"" shot of one man overcoming evil. Instead it is raw anger from these passengers and their need to save their own lives and the lives of others. The film ends on a perfect and chilling note of what they saw. We are not watching them crash, we are there with them. The heart pounding score increasing the tension and the intensity of the actions. There are no post-dramatic events to show, no air traffic control scenes trying to explain what happened. A beautiful ending to a powerful film.Here's a film that tells us to look back at that day and remember those who died. It's not one to shy away from a serious topic, instead it confronts it head on. The film was given the go ahead by the families from the passengers on board. No one should watch United 93 as a ""film"", but more of a look back on that day. It's a respect piece to those who died. Not a tale of survival of any kind, other then the fact that we as people survived that evil and continue to live on.It's safe to say that United 93 is one of the most important films of 2006 and probably of the last 5 or so years. Not only does it honour the family members of those on the plane, but the rest of the people who experience something that day; everyone experience something that day. There is no character to identify with, they are all equal, all human, all just like us. Everything that happens is in the moment, no one knows what is going on, but audience. Everyone should give this film an honest open minded viewing. It is important and will only grow to be more important with time.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Powerful, Moving, and one of the best of 2006","A fantastic, and heart pumping drama, about one of the greatest tragedy of the 21st Century. Only a handful of movies have affected me so deeply, as this film has. My heart was pumping, tears we're streaming down my face, and it was just moving, and powerful. It's a film simply about 9/11 and this particular flight that fought back, nothing more, nothing less. You won't find any Michale Moore nonsense, and I don't know what some of you have been watching, but as far as I'm concerned, I didn't see any real propaganda. And I think you calling this movie propagandist, is utter B.S. I don't see anyone calling Farenhite 9/11 ""Propaganda""It was very respectful to the people who we're on that plane, and the families involved (If you don't believe me, go look at Larry King's interview about this film) Made with a modest budget, and it portrayed the unsung heroes of Air Traffic Controll nicely. It's a good movie, and you should see it? Is it too early? I don't think so. We shouldn't forget 9/11. It wouldn't matter if this was 2006, or 2026, everyone on both sides would feel the same way.See this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History
War between the evolved and the unevolved,"Throughout the 4 million years of human evolution the higher plane of our species has exterminated or ""bred out"" the lower plane. Right now we are in a war with over 100 million extremists who want humanity to forever live in the 15th century from a social standpoint. These extremists will lose eventually because they are smaller in number and less intelligent than the more evolved of our species who view civil behavior as being defined by it's ability NOT TO HIJACK planes and kill innocents to convince people of the legitimacy of their point of view.This movie was excellent. It shows the events of that day and lets the viewer make value judgments based on their own intellectual/emotional abilities.On a side note. If you read the reviews on this page you will find 1 or more people beginning their review with (paraphrasing), ""So I gotta crank out 10 lines when all I wanna do is shout a single sentence of profanity to show everyone how I, and the hijackers, have something in common. Neither of us can critique something without engaging in verbal violence."" I just find it strange how many reviewers on IMDb start their review that way, never understanding how they've lost the audience before the end of their first sentence.

The most powerful movie of our time...,"When I was watching United 93, I felt like I was in the movie. Paul Greengrass did a SUPERB job with it. It felt very real. I was crying throughout the whole thing. It is beautiful. Truly beautiful. This is one of the most important films of our time. It is also the most moving and emotional one of our time.

It is documented that this flight landed and did not crash. Why is no one speaking on it and why are all the posts that mention it deleted????? This is not cool whomever is behind it.

Powerful,"United 93 was nothing like I expected. It wasn't a slick Hollwood movie and it wasn't a sappy movie-of-the-week kind of thing. It was raw and intense and gripping. What the director seems to give us is as close to a real-time accurate account as possible. I didn't get the sense there was much embellishment and there are no unbelievable heroics. Instead, we see confusion and fear that lead to desperation, courage and incredible determination.The film spends as much time on the ground, in air traffic control towers and NORAD, as it does in the plane. But you really feel the drama, shock and utter chaos of that day from perspectives that you probably wouldn't expect. The really interesting thing is how much of the tension is created, not by the film, but by the viewer. You know what's going to happen, so every moment that it's not happening, reality is playing as this contrasting backdrop in your mind.It was a truly powerful film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
United 93 is a stellar film-making achievement,"Director Paul Greengrass' ""United 93"" is a magnificent film, both in it's artistic accomplishment, and it's success in creating an emotional experience that should quell critics who believe the story's telling is coming ""too soon"". It takes a filmmaker of brazen courage and extraordinary skill to tell the story of the passengers, terrorists and air-traffic and military personnel that held us transfixed on September 11, 2001, given how socially relevant the events of that day still are in our daily lives. Greengrass has crafted a film that honors the real-life people of 9/11 without an ounce of exploitation. I am a huge fan of an earlier film of Greengrass's called ""Bloody Sunday"", which depicted the civil rights march massacre in Ireland that bolstered the IRA's political presence. It was called ""documentary-style"" film-making by many critics, with a roving camera, presumably never weighed down by a tripod, wonderfully realistic acting, and a script with overlapping dialogue that never once rang false. All of these aspects are used to eerie effect in ""United 93"", as the film never condescends to present you with pedestrian movie gimmicks to force a feeling on you. Greengrass is much smarter, as his cinema verite style percolates in the extreme ordinariness of the first few hours of that fateful day. Pilots arrive at the terminal, chatting unimportant banter, passengers check phone messages, the FAA operations manager trudges into his first day on the job. The inevitability of our knowledge of the fate of these people simmers underneath it all. Greengrass' fly-on-the-wall style doesn't announce ""Great moment of the film coming!"" or pander to labeling the passengers from Standard Disaster Film Catalogue #1, enabling unbelievability with witty dialogue. The material demanded more. ""United 93"" achieves much more by immersing you in the chaos and confusion in the flight towers and military bases of the east coast, and strapping you in as a passenger of the doomed flight. Much has been made of the fact that the film boasts no stars. This is a great asset, as no baggage marred my ability to get to know the characters just as they got to know each other. In fact, many of the roles in the film are played by the people who experienced 9/11 firsthand, the boldest performance coming from Ben Sliney, who plays himself as the FAA operations manager, whose day slips into turmoil as he's constantly fed misinformation about hijacked planes, and underserved by a military presence. Sliney also served as a consultant to the film to help Greengrass re-create the order of the day most accurately. And as I watched hundreds and hundreds of shocked and frantic FAA controllers and military personnel scramble to prevent further harm to the country and await chain of command orders from the highest levels of government, I once again hope George W. Bush really enjoyed ""My Pet Goat"". Military response orders arrived from the Executive branch well after the fourth and final plane crashed in Pennsylvania. The film-making is so good, I almost expected a different outcome, I was so emotionally invested. After viewing the film, I was visibly shaking. It prompted a 90 minute conversation with my friend Kevin about religion and politics and reawakened in me an immediacy to be involved in the world view. Normally, when I write a review, I just say whether I liked a movie or not, but with ""United 93"", I am highly, highly recommending you SEE IT. This is easily the year's best film and one of the best I've seen in a long time. It's an important reminder of what happened that day, so when you see a ""We Will Never Forget"" sign, you can further understand. This film is a noble reminder that the greatest, most honest and most successful retaliation against terrorism since 9/11, happened immediately.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Important but difficult viewing.,I've only been able to watch this film once. I went to see it when it came out. The closing scenes! I was a mess!

I put it in with the likes of Schindlers List as important films but also difficult viewing.,10.0,Anonymous,History
"Paul and Barry, kudos.","Another astonishing achievement by Paul Greengrass. In his unique documentary-style way, Paul leads us on a journey that we all know the outcome to, yet manages to completely submerge us in the story. I found myself at times rooting for the passengers and hoping they'd prevail even though I knew better. That's how compelling this film was for me. As a jaded film professional, I have to say that this really doesn't happen all that often.Additionally, I have to make mention of the outstanding work by my colleague (in arms) Barry Ackroyd who photographed this picture. It takes a lot of discipline and focus to create an artificial sense of reactive camera work as he did in this film. I know Paul Greengrass is known for barring camera crews from blocking and rehearsals, then bringing them in to shoot off the cuff in order to preserve a certain honesty in the camera work, and this really translates an earnestness into the camera work. As a trained professional, I have to comment on how exceedingly difficult it is to discipline yourself to allow your guys to break all the rules. Absolutely flawless, Barry. My deepest respect (I really enjoyed ""The Wind that Shakes the Barley"" also). Kudos all around.And finally, to the VFX guys that created the exteriors to the airplane, your work was flawless and you should be proud.All in all an outstanding achievement. You all deserve every accolade.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Absorbing and Humantarian Courage,"All I can say is that I have left the cinema full of emotion and frustration as I wanted to cry for the lives that were lost on this tragic but heroic day. This film may be controversial with reference to this event, but Greengrass portrays this historic day as a celebration of humanity and sacrifice against the war on terror. This has enabled me to understand the loss that USA has had to come to terms with and made me realise that London's loss last year was also significant and that we in the West need to make a unified stance against terrorism and ensure that we do not mix this up with war between Christanity and Islam.

"Intense, realistic and utterly compelling","A dramatised account of United 93, one of the four flights hijacked on 9/11. We see the events of that fateful day unfold from several perspectives - the passengers, crew and hijackers of United 93, several air traffic controllers in a few major control centres and from the perspective of the military, in particular US air defence at NORAD.Intense, realistic and utterly compelling. Mixing dramatisations of actual events, eg the air traffic control scenes, with best guess estimates of what happened in United 93 we have a movie that is part-docu-drama, part-fiction (though probably quite close to the truth). This gives the movie a great grittiness.Very well set up too. The scenes of passengers and crew getting on the plane are like any flight. This makes the movie even more engaging, as it shows it the characters were just everyday people going about their everyday lives, until fate changed that.Even when action is called for, there's no gung ho, Bruce Willis-like heroics. It's all pretty realistic and engaging.The sense of realism and real people is helped by having a cast of largely unknowns. Many of the air traffic controllers and some of the USAF personnel are played by themselves. No Hollywood pretentiousness and glamour.And then there's the tension. Director Paul Greengrass builds the intensity well, and ends the movie at the height of it, i.e. perfectly.Even though you know how it is going to end, you can't look away for a second, it is that compelling.Superb movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Pointless.,"Films exist on various levels and serve different purposes. My favorites are commonly ones which exist on a visual/cinematic stratum. This film does not abide in that category. Another impetus for creating a film might be to deliver some sort of message or political stance. These are lesser experiences, but still can carry some weight if the message is particularly profound or artfully delivered. This group is where 'United 93' should belong. Should.At this writing, it's been nearly 5 years since 9/11, an event which altered the course of human progress. That said, I think it's inexcusable that the producers of this film had absolutely nothing to say about it that wasn't immediately obvious in the days following the attacks. All we have here is a sterile real-time account of events that we all know by now. The only point seems to be that it was dramatic and horrifying for those involved. And?The truth is that this movie actually resides in the most pointless of all classes. That is, the kind that is strictly a business venture.

United 93,"I went to see ""United 93"" having heard excellent reviews. My expectations were, therefore, very high. I can only say that as high as they were, they were totally exceeded. This is a GREAT film.This movie (which is done in a documentary style, which is totally effective) grabbed me by the throat, and held me in its grasp until the very end. Indeed, I (and the other audience members) sat stunned in our seats as the credits began to roll. I wasn't aware of tears on anyone's part; the reaction was one of utter shock, of having been almost pulverized emotionally by the experience--an experience beyond tears.The thing about United 93 is its utter believability. I had the sense that THIS IS THE WAY IT HAPPENED. Naturally, no one can know what each person said, or did, during that unspeakable time. But there is no doubt in my mind...remembering, of course, that every witness to the actual events on United 93 is dead...that this is as close as one can possibly come to knowing what these tragic/heroic individuals experienced.I shall never forget this film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Delicately executed,"'United 93' starts slow, and it loses strength and drive around the middle of the movie. Many dialogues and lines are terminology used by professionals. It enhances the truthfulness of the movie but hinders the connection between the movie and the audience as well. However, 'United 93' was surely one of the hardest movies to make and direct. It makes up for the fact that the pace of the movie in the middle gets loose.First, 9/11 was extremely devastating, but the movie cannot be histrionic or sentimental because it would be a joke for sure. Second, 9/11 is the most controversial tragedy and produces the most conspiracy theories. The film has to avoid being one-sided so it does not become a political agenda. Finally, it has to be respectful to the families who lost loved ones during 9/11 and truthful at the same time. 'United 93' achieves all three goals.I want to praise the editing of the movie specifically. Short shots of all the agencies related to aviation, of military branches, and of UA93 increase the anxiousness. Each scene moves to the next one very quickly, adding reality and urgency. Silence after each attack speaks louder than anything else. Sadness and a sense of loss expressed in the movie is hefty, pressing the chest really hard because of that silence.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"high expectations, big letdown","I went into this film with high expectations. I had heard that this was going to be a great film. I was terribly disappointed.First of all, this film had some of the worst camera work I have ever seen. At one point, about 40 minutes into the film, I had to walk out for a while because I was getting motion sick. The cinematographer was unable to stay on a single object for longer than 2 seconds while continuously zooming in and out, moving in and out of focus. It would be one thing if you saw it on a TV, but on a big screen its hard not to get sick.Second, the acting was terrible. Some of the actors on the plane were good and convincing, and I have no real issues with them. But the ground control and the military characters were absolutely terrible. They were quite possibly some of the worst actors I have ever seen. They even at times forgot some of their lines, and the director decided to leave those moments in.Overall, it was some of the worst production I seen on a film in a long time. I am disappointed because this is a film that needs to be well done so that the people of the world can see how we felt when this happened. I think the world thinks that it wasn't that big of a deal.

It is a sickening movie to watch.,"It took a long time before I was able to see this movie. Hollywood does not have a good reputation when it comes to films about real events. But I was surprised to see that the events where depicted in a clean way. No superheroes running around in this movie, no over-the-top heroism. Yet, it is a bit awkward to see people, like Ben Sliney, play themselves.It is a sickening movie to watch, because the outcome is known. Four terrorists hi-jack a plane, kill the pilots and head for the Capitol building to destroy. The passengers panic but on the airline mobile phone service they find out that already planes hit the WTC and the Pentagon. So they decide to regain control over the plane. Although they manage to take out 2 of the terrorist their action is too late, the terrorist at the control lets the plane crash. Most of the events are filmed with a hand-held camera so the movie effectively takes you into the cramped space of an air liner.The movie is sickening because you know the passengers are not going to succeed. The movie is also sickening because you look at people, the terrorists, who believe that their god will give them access to heaven because they murder people. These terrorists seem like intelligent people, so they should know the difference between believing something or knowing something. Yet, they behave as if they have no doubt about murder. That their god orders them to do that. But it is just something they believe. Did they never ask themselves the question, what happens after death? Do we go to heaven and will our god say, ah, you did a good thing. Or will he say, oh, you are the ones that murdered these people, but your victims are already here in heaven. I can't allow you to mingle with them so you won't come into my heaven. Go next door, to hell. Anyone who knows the difference between believe and knowledge, would have thoughts like that. They didn't. Who did that to them, who brainwashed their minds so much that they chose to die. Whoever, it must be an evil person, probably someone who would never do that himself. Someone who defends the comforts of his life here on earth, who whispers the promises of death in the minds of numskull to retaliate on his enemies.

Tragedies and Vulnerabilities,"I watched this movie last year with my mom and younger sister. I remember my sister crying at the end of it, distraught at the injustice of the world. This film is both a celebration of heroism while also capturing a tragedy unfold on screen. You know what is going to happen, we all do, but dread fills you as it does. You wait with bated breath, knowing what you're watching, while also wishing it wouldn't. The film used many of the real people involved and also no names for the people on the plane. And that's the point. The film is not meant to capture characters you're supposed to root for. And there's not a message. It's about people on a plane, a specific plane. It's about people, people we don't know, people we'll never know. But they're people, and so I don't need to know their loved ones, I know they have them, I don't need their sad back stories to care about them. The ending is powerful enough on its own. From all the 9/11 narratives, this one captures the chaoticness of it, while also the lack of action. We know, in hindsight, the mess and tragedy that comes from this. But here, in this film, everyone in air traffic control is casual, controlled. The situation is not the collapsing towers. And I guess that makes it horrifying and terrible in its own way. It's a film I'm glad I've seen. Vulnerability and heroism comes often from tragedy and this is no exception. Well done.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Rent...Don't Buy,"I would definitely recommend watching it once, as long as you can take the fall-out from the emotions it elicits. I was afraid they were trying to capitalize on people's death, but it is actually as tastefully done as anyone could possibly manage. It doesn't portray the hijackers as straight up villains or the passengers as superheroes. The film is far more nuanced than that. They're just humans, and they act like humans for whatever decision it is that they made, whether right or wrong. The hijackers are nervous and unsure and oddly clueless, as well as possessing an aggressiveness that seems born out of fear and not hatred, possibly because of their young age. And the passengers step into the role of the heroes reluctantly and unknowingly, as all they're trying to do is survive and get back home to their families. I was especially impressed at how the flight centers were depicted, as it didn't overdramatize things. For the most part, the personnel just behaved like this was a normal day at work, until events really started to heat up. I will say I did get lost in the technical aviation jargon. However, understanding it is not needed to understand the story. So I am very glad I watched it. But I will never watch it again. It just isn't the kind of movie I would imagine downloading now and again to watch while eating dinner on the couch. I would at least suggest that you rent and watch it before buying it.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Sometimes im afraid riding a plane after watching this,"""United 93"" presents an exceptionally authentic depiction of the trauma suffered by the victims of terrorism on September 11, 2001. Director Paul Greengrass adeptly avoids sensationalism, providing an unfiltered and haunting view into the distressing events aboard Flight 93. The film's commitment to realism is both its strength and challenge, accurately capturing the chaos and fear of that tragic day.While the intense realism of ""United 93"" may be a demanding viewing experience, it's precisely this quality that renders it a compelling cinematic journey. The film refuses to gloss over the human cost of terrorism, delivering a respectful and profoundly moving tribute to those thrust onto the front lines of a national tragedy. The performances of the cast significantly enhance the emotional impact, effectively conveying the victims' fear, desperation, and courage.In delicately approaching the sensitive topic of 9/11, ""United 93"" rises above mere dramatization, serving as a poignant reminder of the far-reaching impact terrorism has on individuals and communities. The film's portrayal of trauma is both thought-provoking and praiseworthy, providing a genuine exploration of a dark chapter in history.

Good Job Greengrass!!!!!!!!!!!!,"""United 93"" is a 2006 film directed by Paul Greengrass that chronicles the events onboard United Airlines Flight 93 during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The film strives to present a realistic and vivid picture of the passengers' brave efforts to prevent the hijackers.The effect of the film on viewers might vary considerably dependent on individual sensitivities and experiences. For others, viewing a video that reenacts such a horrible and sad event may provoke intense emotional reactions. The film's authenticity and the representation of the horrible events of 9/11 may be unsettling for certain viewers, especially those who have a personal connection to the events or have suffered trauma.On the other hand, some viewers may admire the film for its effort to depict the narrative of the heroic passengers who fought back against the hijackers, underlining themes of heroism and tenacity in the face of adversity.It's crucial to remember that the psychological influence of any film might change from person to person. Some people may find it therapeutic to interact with hard subject matter, while others may find it too stressful. It's recommended for people to be attentive of their own emotional well-being and to make educated judgments about the information they choose to consume. If someone has worries about the possible emotional effect of a film like ""United 93,"" it could be good to seek assistance or express these concerns with others.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The work of putting together the information from the transcription of the plane's Black Box and the calls made by passengers Tom Burnett, Mark Bingham, Edward Felt, Jeremy Glick, Todd Beamer, Honor Elizabeth and flight attendants CeeCee Lyles, Sandra Bradshaw are what make the film becomes a documentary piece that, for sure, will be able to stir the emotions of the audience. Even being aware of the film's final tragedy, Greengrass manages to make the viewer uncomfortable, and even nervous about reality. The people on the ground, in the conning towers, the army, all stunned by cinematic fiction blending into reality, completely pulling the rug out from under everyone. And the best part of this film's work is that we can not only see it, but also read the expressions and looks, through some hidden camera shots (an effect that was very well worked on in the ""24"" series). Likewise, the tranquility of passengers, who less than an hour after taking off, become victims of the four hijackers (which also differs from the other hijacked flights, which were given as five hijackers).The documentary tone that Greengrass had already used with great impact in Bloody Sunday is used again here with the same effect. The camera acts as if it were a mere observer of the events being shown, and ends up taking the viewer into an immersion that perhaps he is not prepared for - and this is the great asset of the technique. There are no unnecessary character developments; only your actions are shown, which further increases the shock by the action, and not by wielded resources. The script, by the director himself, opts for two parallel narratives that run in real time. One shows the boarding of the passengers, the flight and the taking of the plane by the terrorists. The other is attached to the flight control cabin, functioning as a kind of great chronological presentation of all events and also as the eyes of the spectators in front of the facts. A pity that this part takes longer than necessary and becomes too tiring.Focusing a good part of the first hour of projection on the civil and military flight control centers, Greengrass, also the author of the script, reveals the complexity of the operations to keep thousands of air routes running simultaneously and follows the growing chaos that took care of all those experienced professionals as controllers lost touch with several planes and the careful strategy behind the hijackings became evident. In the process, the filmmaker makes clear the unpreparedness of civil and military authorities to deal, at the time, with such a well-orchestrated attack: the mismatched information results in defense jets being sent in the opposite direction to the requested one; planes considered hijacked reappear without problems at their destinations; an aircraft is announced as having hit the World Trade Center and then ""rediscovered"" while still in the air (which was again incorrect; it actually hit the north tower; liaison officers between civil and military aviation are slow to take up their posts; and, of course, the President is out of reach, at the height of the crisis, because he is slow to react to the news received (something that the film does not show, but which we can witness in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"").One of the most distressing aspects of United Flight 93, by the way, is precisely related to the fact that we already know everything that happened that day, while the characters are just discovering the scale of the attacks - and when the first plane hits the World Trade Center, instead of showing the image we already know so well, Greengrass makes the smart choice to follow the event from the flight control room. Thus, when the dot representing American Airlines Flight 11 disappears from the radar, the controller in charge cannot understand what happened, while the spectator immediately recognizes the implication of that disappearance - and this proves to be more impactful than the mere reproduction of the scene would be. That we all have engraved in our minds.Right from the start, Greengrass's goal in creating a realistic tone in the plot is clear. One of his choices for this is to build a story without a protagonist, not even the passengers on the flight, choosing to intersperse the action that takes place on the plane and in the control towers, making the public focus on the events, creating a documentary tone. On film very efficient. Comprised of unknown faces (with the exception of Gregg Henry, who plays Colonel Robert Marr), the cast of United Flight 93 features professional actors and (most fascinatingly) several of the people who actually starred in the events portrayed in the film playing themselves - and when watching the scenes that take place in the control centers, it becomes impossible to differentiate one from the other, such is the intensity of the performances. In addition, the improvisation tactic used by Greengrass brings greater realism to the procedures, as the ""actors"" stutter, stumble over words and interrupt each other, never seeming to have their lines ready and memorized on the tip of their tongue. As if that weren't enough, it's chilling to see that figures like Shawna Fox, Major James Fox and Ben Sliney are basically reliving some of the worst moments of their lives in front of the cameras - which brings immense benefits to the film, since, for a change little, we can finally trust the authenticity of the recreation of events. So, when Sliney makes the decision to shut down all air traffic in the country for the first time in its history, possibly causing the airlines to lose billions, it is impossible not to admire his courage and the wisdom of his action.On the other hand, the events related to Flight 93 present an initial calm that, paradoxically, leaves the viewer in a terrible state of anguish: while we follow the boarding procedures, the refueling of the plane and the wait before takeoff, we end up hoping that everything works out. Right and that tragedy is anticipated by someone and avoided - something we know to be impossible. And when the terrorists finally take over the plane and the passengers of United 93 find out, through calls made to their families, what is happening in the rest of the country, we realize, along with those people, that taking more decisive action will be inevitable, since everyone will probably die one way or another. Thus, instead of portraying the passengers as heroes who acted without hesitation, Greengrass demonstrates that trying to take the terrorists' plane was more than a matter of heroism, but of logic - which does not diminish the greatness of the courage of those people, of course.Another noble decision by the filmmaker is to portray terrorists not as irrational madmen, but as intelligent and emotionally stable people who, moved by a cause they consider noble and right, commit acts of unspeakable cruelty - and, although Greengrass has no way of knowing exactly what occurred during the flight (with the exception of the recordings made in the cockpit and the phone calls made by the passengers), it is perfectly plausible that things happened in a way similar to the one portrayed in the film. It's easy, for example, to accept that the four kidnappers were anxious and nervous about the task before them - and also that one or the other was hesitant to take it forward. But the most sublime and touching moment of United Flight 93 is the one that shows passengers and terrorists praying, each for their own reasons, that God (or Allah) will bless them and protect their souls - a scene that can take on different meanings (but equally rich) according to one's belief (or lack thereof).As throughout his entire filmography, Paul Greengrass builds in Flight United 93 an intense, dynamic work, but which also moves without appealing-to-appealing moments, sensitizing the public with moments that are so realistic and that facilitate the public's identification. In addition, the director does not fall into the boastful and patriotic discourse, presenting a story that does not try to elevate anyone to the status of a hero, showing all the courage of those people for having simply opted for the right choice, or in this case, the most logical one. Emotionally exhausting, United Flight 93 eschews melodrama and easy tears; there are no farewell scenes here as in the (good) version made for American television, during which we also followed the reaction of each passenger's relatives and friends. This sobriety (which the film shares with Bloody Sunday) is also reflected in the soundtrack, which, used minimally throughout the projection, never tries to accentuate the drama, serving more as a commentary on the shock experienced by everyone - in fact, the sound design. The production is ingenious: the beeps, telephone rings and shouted orders perfectly replace a more conventional and therefore artificial ""suspense"" track.Closing with 15 minutes filled with an almost unbearable tension, the film also demonstrates how capricious real life can be: after all, how can one discuss the poetry present in a flight that, under the name ""United"", represented the only case in which the plane put into practice on September 11, 2001, would it fail - and precisely thanks to the actions of the passengers? If this had been a screenwriter's invention, the symbolism might have become artificial, but how can we disagree when Destiny itself conceived it? When the passengers on the flight make the choice to take the plane, they seal their own fate and become the heroes of an episode where there were no winners. Which leads us to reflect on everything that lies beneath this episode: what is worst and best in humanity.",8.0,Anonymous,History
You have to see this film,"I was totally prepared not to see this movie. As painful it is to remember September 11th, I had to go see United 93 out of respect.Reading newspaper articles, I had heard that a movie regarding United flight 93 was coming out and my thoughts were great!!-Here comes some gold-digger wanting to make a movie about perhaps the biggest tragedy our nation has ever seen. (I say perhaps because everyone has an opinion and might rank Pearl Harbor, JFK or The Challenger up there as well).I am so happy that my preconceived notions were completely wrong. The movie did what I needed it to accomplish.The film showed tremendous respect and honors the passengers and crew of United 93, as well those who were in the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. United 93 also showed the horror of those who had to watch and stand by helpless as the day's events unfolded.United 93 wasn't glamorous nor did it pull any punches. It was an emotionally hard film to watch but something we need to see.Myself I did something I have never done before in a theater; I yelled at the screen... I haven't had a movie ever hit me with such emotion and force. United 93 is a wake up call that our war against terrorism is not over and a film that was necessary to make.Thank you for reading this and God Bless Chris",10.0,Anonymous,History
Attempt to elevate official lie to a myth.,"As more and more Americans are coming to realize, the story of Flight 93 is total fiction, lacking even a shred of truth. While many in the World have recognized that the U.S. Government's ""script"" on 911 was a big lie designed to get Americans to accept the inevitability of war and to accelerate the assault on civil rights, Americans for the most part have remained in a state of denial over the reality that 911 was an inside job. This film merely takes the 911 official hoax to a new level by injecting a sense of ""humanity"" into the fabrication to make it seem more ""real."" But a lie is a lie, and whatever talents were brought into this picture cannot disguise this fact. I would not recommend that anyone see this movie since--as a matter of principle--liars should not be rewarded for their lies. The film also does a terrible injustice to the victims of 911.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A Fitting Tribute To The Passengers Of United 93,"I can remember sitting transfixed in front of the TV on September 11, 2001. It wasn't a morbid sort of fascination with the events of that day that was keeping me glued to the screen; it was more a sense of numbed paralysis and disbelief; a sort of ""how could this possibly be happening?"" type of experience. I found myself (as did most people I suspect) with a lot of questions coming to my mind. Watching this movie (as I first did shortly after it was released) was a way of dealing with two of those questions: how would the passengers on those planes have felt as they approached what they must have eventually realized was their end, and, second, when the inevitable movies are made, are they going to be respectful or exploitative. This movie helped with both of those questions.This is - as the title says - essentially the story of United Airlines Flight 93, one of the hijacked planes on 9/11. I was pleased that the movie was made with the co-operation of the families of the passengers; pleased even that the DVD doesn't have previews of other movies, as so many do. There's no attempt to shill anything else here. The DVD just goes right into the story. It offers a powerful, emotional and completely respectful account of what might have happened on board that plane on that terrible day. United 93, of course, was the plane that didn't get to Washington. It took off late, which meant that the passengers knew through their cell phones what was happening to the hijacked planes. Knowing that they were probably going to die anyway, these passengers decided to fight back - and, along with New York City emergency workers, ended up as the great (and tragic) heroes of the day, managing to thwart the hijackers and crash the plane into an empty field in Pennsylvania.Aside from the passengers, there were three other groups looked at. The first was the hijackers themselves. I thought their portrayal was interesting. The leader of the group seemed to be portrayed as having some moral qualms about this. They came across to me as fanatical, but not evil - which is probably an accurate depiction of their mindset. Then there were the air traffic control officers. Many of them (most importantly Ben Sliney, head of the National Air Traffic Control Centre) played themselves, and considering that they weren't actors, they did a magnificent job of recreating the tension and chaos of that day. Finally, there was the military, largely centred around a NORAD base in New York State. They were frustrated - they didn't have enough fighters to properly respond, some of the fighters they had weren't armed, and even if they were armed they didn't have authority to engage the hijacked planes - that order could only be given by the President, and they couldn't reach him.This is a marvellous and touching way to honour the brave passengers of Flight 93, as well as all of those who lost their lives on a day that no one will ever forget. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Heroes all,"Is it too soon? Are we ready? Am I ready? These three questions have been asked in just about every media outlet on the crest of the new 9/11 film release, United 93. Whether, you, I, or the world is ready to relive in graphic detail the events that unfolded on September 11th is up each individual, but whether you find yourself standing in line at a movie theatre, renting the DVD this fall or avoiding it altogether, nothing will take away from the fact that United 93 is a fantastic film that leaves you breathless and shows the world more heroes than just those that were onboard the fateful flight.United 93 is directed by Paul Greengrass, who is no stranger to fact based-documentary type shot films. In 2002, Greengrass filmed Bloody Sunday which was a dramatization of the Irish civil rights protest march and subsequent massacre by British troops on January 30, 1972. Bloody Sunday was one of the best reviewed films of the year and ended up on many (including yours truly), Best Of lists when the year was recapped.Based on this previous outing of success, Greengrass was the perfect choice to direct United 93 (note that the studio did not 'choose' him but rather, he pitched it to the executives).United 93 tells the story of the fourth airplane to be used in the terrorist attacks on 9/11. The story of that plane came to us slowly while we were still digesting the horrors of the attacks on New York. As it was recounted through phone recordings and conversations between the passengers in the air and their loved ones of the ground, the plane was taken over by terrorists with the expected goal of using the flying tube as a weapon, quite possibly flying the plane into the Nation's Capital.As family and friends spoke to those on United 93, the passengers began to hear of the stories of the Twin Towers and the Pentagon and they knew that the intention of the terrorists was to martyr themselves, taking the passengers and crew with them.The passengers fought back. And their mark in history was recorded.United 93 does a spectacular job of keeping us on the edge of our seats even as we know how the film will eventually unfold. Greengrass does this by spending much of the time with the stories that we weren't completely aware about. The stories about the ground controllers, the FAA staff and the army all grappling with the unfolding events and determining the next course of action. We relive the events as they lived them  on the front line of events that changed forever the world to which we live.We learn amongst the chaos that the army had difficulty getting authorization to scramble fighter jets and that those that did eventually make it airborne were unarmed and headed in the wrong direction. We learn that those on the ground in command centres were ill prepared for the events and had problems with communication both internally (trying to determine if there were other flights hijacked at the time) and externally (trying to get an open communication channel to the army). We learn that one man  on his first day on the job  made the executive decision to ground all planes in lieu of any government intervention.United 93 tells these stories while jumping back and forth to the passengers aboard the plane and we watch as they learn and accept their fate and then react in a manner that would thwart the hijackers intentions as the plane flew into an open field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.United 93 is an emotional punch to the stomach and a jaw dropper to boot. I sat amazed as these people figured things out based on limited intelligence and made decisions of universal impact. All this occurring while I stood dumbfounded in front of an office computer watching streamlined video of the event almost five years ago. I was reacting when then were acting. Heroes all.You will leave United 93 exhausted, and during water cooler discussions that follow you will not be able to remember a characters name or backstory. That is because their isn't any. Greengrass doesn't follow the typical rules of an event film and keeps to the real time facts - not singling out any one person or institution, but telling the story of how the group of heroes both on the ground and in the air forever etched a mark in our long term memory.www.robertsreviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,History
A film about one of the greatest tragedies in the history of airline industry,"United 93 is an excellent film about the crash of United Airlines flight 93.The unique thing about this film is that through its making the subtle lines between reality and fiction appear to have blurred. A viewer experiences the sensation of seeing the tragedy happen right before his/her eyes.United 93 is not a documentary film and cannot even be termed as a feature film.This is the reason why the narrative approach chosen by Paul Greengrass does not contain any components of these two genres of cinema.What we are able to see in this film is an accurate recollection in real time of the events that took place on that fateful day.By involving the relatives of the victims,this film's director Paul Greengrass has made a good attempt to be as close as possible to the reality.It can be surmised that they must have provided vital information about the mental state of their loved ones when they were stuck in that unlucky airplane.This is a film to watch as the inevitable tension has firm grip on viewers from the start right until the end of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Awful.,"So I am required to put 10 lines for this. Let me begin with the statement that I truly regret for the lives of the innocent victims who died on 9/11, both on the two Towers and in the planes involved. I'd be human without soul if I haven't. Still I have firm opinion that this movie is shameless piece of sh*t and should have never been made. The reasons - it is completely fiction, based on no facts whatsoever, the plot is imaginary and sucked out of the fingers. Actually there unfortunately are no any clear evidence of what had happened on the board so the speculations may begin. Here we have evil Arab terrorists kidnapping plane with plastic knives (no, this is not ""Is there a pilot on the plane"" 2). For me the circumstances - that not a single body was found (they simply vaporized), as well as explosives of any kind but still the plane exploded (I remember the CNN news that day and have recorded it on tape) are enough to not trust the original version. The real problem is so many American people believes blindly to what The Government says. So blessed the fools are. Also, I noticed that despite the dullness of a movie, there will always be a bunch of vivid fans shouting ""Oh my God, this is the best movie ever!"" I am telling you this before some user feels offended of truth and report this for being abusing.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"UNITED 93, a classic!","Much controversy has been with United 93 since it's inception sometime last year. The ""too soon"" mentality of those who see that films exploiting or depicting those horrible events of September 11, 2001 is here. The second film about 9/11, Oliver Stone's World Trade Center, will be in theaters later on this year. There's no need to go over the plot points of the film. The world already knows it. From the opening scene of the four hijackers reading from the Koran to the descending plane which ultimately crashes, United 93, is a mesmerizing, unforgettable, and heart-wrenching masterpiece. This docudrama was directed by Paul Greengrass, a director who got to know the families of the victims that perished from the plane. He tells us the story with sensitivity, and does the enormous feat of honoring those who fought back realizing that the plane was not going to be ""turned around"" but was being used as a missile for an American landmark (one of the terrorists taped a picture of the Capitol in the cockpit).There are no back stories to be told. Everything is told from the morning of September 11th forward. There is no mention of Osama, Iraq or even terrorism. We do know of a few key characters but we know nothing of them. They are all portrayed in the moment, going about their business, waiting at the airport terminal, getting on the plane, making friendly conversations, flight attendants making sure everyone is buckled, pilots having their morning orange juice. Scenes on-board the plane are inter cut with traffic control centers and military command rooms. Amazingly, some of the people actually play themselves. The third act of the film harbors over some of the passengers realizing what's happening as they figure out that the pilots, a flight attendant and a 1st class passenger have been brutally killed. Pieced together from taped recordings from passengers calling their loved ones and one flight attendant getting a hold of a United mechanic, the devastating scenes of the passengers attacking the hijackers are some of the most intense of any film I've ever seen. Some of the passengers, as they call their loved ones will pull at your heart strings. As one woman tearfully ends a conversation with a loved one, she hands her cell phone over to a young woman and says, ""Here, call your people"". It is all quite emotional.I must admit, I was an emotional wreck after viewing United 93. Greengrass has created a powerful, gut-wrenching, and courageous movie experience. Like that of The Passion of the Christ and Schindler's List, everyone must see this film at least once. It is a draining experience and extremely difficult to watch. But it's as important as any movie theater experience you'll ever have.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Outstanding!,"This is an outstanding movie, certainly one of the very best I have ever seen! Although we know the eventual outcome, the movie is an edge-of-your-seat nail-biting thriller. The important message is that this is not simply a tale of sacrifice. Enough time had elapsed that the passengers were able to learn what was in store for them if they did not act. Those Americans processed the information they had available to them, formulated a plan, and carried it out with amazing courage and bravery. The intention of the passengers and crew was to take back the plane and to save their lives. That they were not ultimately successful in this endeavor makes the act no less courageous or admirable.

So glad I decided to go.,"Last night, my husband and I did something i was pretty sure we weren't going to do - we went to see ""United 93."" I have to admit, I went a little reluctantly - when i first found out that the film was being made I was outraged. Thought it couldn't possibly be anything but exploitative. Thought it would needlessly open emotional floodgates. Thought it would be fraught with propaganda and skewed viewpoints that would only anger me. Thought that after watching the film, I'd be too frightened to ever get on a plane again.I was wrong on all counts - and I was so stunned by that, I wanted to share my impressions with others who may have the same reservations.It occurred to me as I left the theater that I had never before been to a movie that hadn't attempted to manipulate me emotionally. And considering the subject matter here, the fact that this one emphatically did not was, I felt, amazing.This is, simply put, the story of what happened to and on Flight 93 on September 11th. There is not a trace of Hollywood to be found. No dramatic score, no gratuitous violence or emotional tweaking. It's simple, direct, and realistic. And much of what you see in the film is what happened in places other than on that plane - in the air controllers' tower that was tracking the flight, and at Norad... in fact, some of the actual personnel who were there on that day chose to recreate its events for this film themselves. (If you read the credits at the end, you'll see many of the air traffic controllers and military personnel listed as being portrayed ""as him/her self."" ) This only added to the film's directness.Having said all this, I'm not going as far as recommending that everyone see it - each of you knows your own sensitivity level, and will have to decide based on that. But if you had some of the same reservations I had, i wanted to assure you that this isn't 9/11 done as an after-school special. It was, I thought, handled and presented masterfully. It's not a redneck call-to-arms, or a sympathy treatise for the terrorists. Neither is it a scathing indictment of our government. The way Paul Greengrass managed to tell this story without a hint of bias or finger-pointing is truly worthy of respect. We plan on buying the movie when it is available on DVD, and asking our children, when it's appropriate for them, to watch it. Because it's a piece of our history that we need never to forget.",10.0,Anonymous,History
An imaginative portrayal of a terrifying ordeal,"Four planes taken over by terrorists on that fateful day we call 9/11 struck terror in the hearts of the Amercan people. This film is an attempt to portray what happened on Flight 93. This was the fourth plane which happened to miss its target and made heroes of its passengers.I thought the casting was good. I didn't know any of the actors. They seemed like ordinary people caught up in a terrifying experience. What took place on that flight we will never know in absolute detail. We do know however that mobile phones were used by passengers to say a last farewell to wives and loved ones before the imminent crash landing.I found those final conversations very moving. What do you say when you know that death seems inevitable? That maybe you only have a few minutes left? The scripting of those conversations were probably the most accurate part of the story because families will never forget those final farewells.I think the scriptwriters did an excellent job in researching the events and portraying what they believed was the manner in which the drama unfolded. It seems entirely acceptable to me. Indeed as I watched the action I felt I was watching an actual record of the real event. When the terrorists lacking in experience took over the control of the aircraft the plane plunged and rolled tossing the occupants out of their seats. These scenes were well done. Considering that most of the camera work was carried out in the one set (the plane) there was never a moment of boredom. The suspense was hardly bearable.I liked too the subdued musical sound effects, the percussion instruments giving the impression of impending danger. This really did heighten the drama.Overall a very good production, one I will remember for a very long time",8.0,Anonymous,History

It can happen again on a plane or maybe the terrorists will be on your train, your bus, your ferry as you go to work and live your life as your normally do each day.United 93 is a tasteful film and in no way does it exploit the tragedy of 9/11.

Exploiting a Tragedy for Profit 101,"The first film to exploit the 9-11 tragedy. This is an underplayed and restrained production that shows what MIGHT have happened on this eventful day. The fact is that this movie hearkens back to the days of the ""disaster"" epics of the 70s. Essentially it is any one of those airborne disaster films with the exception being it was a real and not imagined disaster. The no-name cast is pretty unremarkable and the shoe string production values really show on the screen. The hand held camera work creates the proper sense of claustrophobia, but it is overused. We all know what the outcome was so its no use repeating it again . The producers of this dull and exploitative film claimed it was done to honor the memories of the 3,000 people who died on that day. The real fact was that they thought they were onto something good by being the first ones to exploit this tragedy for personal gain. Mercifully, it died at the box office, but it did go on to spawn Oliver Stone's equally abortive ""World Trade Center"" a few months later. Have we become so desentisized to the violence of the real world that we need to make movies to exploit them for profit? Like WTC, this is a slap in the face and an insult to anyone who either died or survived 911. I guess that anybody will do anything in the name of the almighty dollar, but when it comes down to an exploitation film like this, it is just plain despicable. Adding to the overall tedium are the pointless conversations from the control tower and the passengers on the doomed flight chattering away on their cell phones.- God forbid that somebody should be without one. The overall quality of this film resembles a hastily contrived ""tv movie"". Poor propaganda does not an engrossing film make. Absolute rubbish, this is not worth your time. So ""let's roll"" straight out of this movie.To say liberties were taken with the story is an understatement. How did the terrorists smuggle that bomb making equipment on board after the baggage search? Also, to call this film boring is to praise it to high heaven. It defines dull. It is about as exciting as watching paint dry or grass grow. Unfortunately, I had to endure it again as a class project. This time out the jerky motion of the hand held camera gave me a headache.I also tried to stay awake for it, but I did doze off. They were still in the control room when I awoke.

The Most Important film of my Generation,"This was the most moving film I think I will ever see. I liked this film because it did not sugarcoat 09/11/01. It brought back some familiar feelings I had that day fear, confusion, anger, and hope. I thought it was very accurate. I think this is the right time to see this movie while 09/11 is still fresh in our memories. It changed our lives and the world we live in. It made us see what evil and hate can do and how it can change our everyday lives. Those who oppose are entitled to their own opinions, but I think its important for people to face reality and not forget what happened. The acting was realistic, the build up was tense, and the climax was so unforgettable it made it hard to sleep that night after i seen it. Definitely worth at least one viewing to every single human being.",10.0,Anonymous,History
An Important Film To See,"About a month ago I saw Tom Hanks on Inside The Actor's Studio and he said that this was the most film to see and he was right. I saw the film last night with my mother and neither one of us were prepared for what were about to see. I have seen documentaries about 9/11 and the people on Flight 93 and I have read the 9/11 Commission report. But this film takes inside of what happened on United flight 93 on that day that no one will ever forget. The film opens with the hijackers praying and meditating before they leave their hotel room and head for the airport. We see a regular and beautiful morning in which everyone is going to work: the pilots, the stewardess', the people in FAA and in Air Traffic control. We see the passengers including the hijackers wait before boarding the plane. It was a regular and beautiful day until American Airline flight 11 disappears from the radars and on the news we see the horrific images of the World Trade Centers on fire. Within minutes of that morning more attacks took place: the second tower of the WTC, the Pentagon, and then the airplane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania that was suppose to have targeted Capital building or the White House. While the passengers are on the plane and in the air everything is pleasant like most flights usually are: breakfast is being served, conversations, and friendly and courteous smiles exchanged. Everyone on the flight is oblivious of the news of the attacks on the ground and then the hijackers unleash terror 70,000 feet above the ground. Gradually, the passengers slowly realized that these hijackers were on a suicide mission and the news of the attacks are reached to them via telephone from their loved ones. No one in Air Traffic Control or in military sectors knew until after the plane had crashed that United Flight 93 was hijacked. My mother and I saw the film and we both left the theatre shaking and in tears. I have seen films that have made me cry and have impacted me, but there are no words to describe the feeling of fear and yet there was a sense of admiration for the passengers as they banded together and took the risk of taking control of the plane. The final moment is so powerful it leaves you shaking and begging them to win. The phone calls made from the passengers to their loved ones and the prayers of both the passengers and the hijackers resonate louder than the airplane engines. There is no one today who could even be prepared to experience on the events that took place on United 93. There are political statements or even any mentioning of partisanship. You don't even hate the hijackers, or at least I didn't. Quite the contrary. They were human beings driven by fanaticism and madness to commit the acts they were trained to believe were honorable to the name of Islam. The one hijacker, Ziad Jarrah, who was trained to fly the plane seemed to be the only one who was willing to back out, but didn't. This was certainly not film made to bring in box office winnings or title. This was a film that commemorates the heroes and the lives taken on September 11, 2001. Warning: the film is very graphic and no one will ever be prepared for a film of this magnitude.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A truly emotional experience,"I don't think I've had such a profound movie experience since I saw the first half hour of Saving Private Ryan. This film does not tell a story, but rather transports the viewer into the events of that that day. I left the theater with a sense of loss for the passengers of that flight. Like D-Day in SPR I intellectually knew what was going to happen, but seeing it so skillfully brought to the screen I could feel it on a visceral level. I could not help but remember where I was and what I was doing on 9/11. There has been some controversy regarding this film in that some people consider it exploitive. I got no such impression from this film. It deals with the subject matter with the utmost respect. These are real people in a harrowing situation. There are no Hollywood heroics in this movie. I am thankful that I have never found myself in any situation remotely similar to this, but if I ever do, I sincerely hope that I can comport myself a fraction as well.If you thought the days of meaningful art had left the cinema, or want a truly emotional experience I urge you to see this",8.0,Anonymous,History
Disaster,"Absolutely horrible . I am glad I did not pay for this piece of c***. The acting , accept for David Rasche , who played the passenger with flying experience, was horrible, Incidentally , he was the only actor I have even heard of . The camera shook more than an earthquake. It was like this was made from novices. Boring tech stuff intertwined throughout the movie that basically told us nothing . Those added personal touches on those cells being passed around . Give me a break . I heard I LOVE YOU more in this movie than in a Meg Ryan romantic comedy. Absolutely ridiculous. I could have bought a store full of hallmarks. I agree with some of the other people that this may have been propaganda .

Powerful,"We are beings that no matter the tragedy, we like to revisit and chew on it for as long as we can. September 11th and all the events that unfolded is no exception.For this to be the first studio film to tackle the subject, it is a great start. Shot more as a documentary, the film doesn't try to create false sentiment or make one group out as victim or hero. It just tries to set the course of events, as best we know them.Using no big name actors and using a large portion of persons who worked that day, the film stays grounded.All the naysayers and detractors of this film can claim conspiracies and the like. This film probably set the bar at a level no other 9/11 based film will reach.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Shockingly Powerful, The Most Important Film of the Year","You could ask almost any American living in the United States in 2001 where they were when that first plane hit the World Trade Center on September 11th 2001. Sadly, I was sleeping at the time, but many of my family members endured the hardship and shock of seeing that second plane smash into the other tower of the World Trade Center, and the tower itself fall to the ground. It was an absolutely harrowing period in time that pretty much everyone sadly remembers. The planes that got the most coverage were the ones that crashed into the World Trade Center, but the plane that didn't get as much coverage was Flight United Airlines 93, which harbored a few outstanding Americans who over-threw terrorist plans to crash the 747 into the White House. 'United 93' the spectacular emotionally-charged drama chronicles an estimation a about what really went on-board.Paul Greengrass, the Irish writer/director of the film who was behind such films as Bloody Sunday and the Bourne Supremacy, does a magnificent job crafting this heart-wrenching tale. The graininess of the film and the shaky motions of the camera does a perfect job slowly building the tension of the film. 'United 93' is Paul Greengrass' masterpiece, and if there is any justice in the film industry Greengrass will be rewarded with the coveted 'Best Director' Oscar nomination when the Academy Award Nominations for 2006 are announced next January. The acting of 'United 93' is as solid as it can be, with unknown actors turning in accomplished performances that are just as good as what the big-name Hollywood actors would normally offer. I actually admire the fact the production company didn't cast any known actors in this film or have a well known filmmaker direct it, so it could avoid senseless labels of 'the Harrison Ford movie' or 'the Steven Spielberg movie', and be known as 'The 9/11 Flight 93 movie'.'United 93' succeeds on so many different levels other than acting, writing and directing. I highly commend the film on being so unbiased in everything, the film doesn't discredit the U.S. on this situation and they also don't show the terrorists as senseless monsters who eat little children, so to speak. The people on the flight are shown as real human beings that are flawed, frightened and confused, and the terrorists are shown as frightened and truly believing what they are doing is righteous. 'United 93' resists the Hollywood temptation to point the finger of blame at someone or some group, and just shows an almost documentary-like illustration of the tragic and catastrophic events that took place on that cold September day. Although 'United 93' is flawed in some areas, like starting out a little slow and running on a little long, it has a tremendous amount of heart and provokes such strong emotion from the viewer. We as an audience feel every single bit of pain, fear and hysteria not only the passengers feel, but the terrorists feel as well. Any film that can do that is without question pure genius.There has been a lot of debate and talk about this film, some people saying it has come out too soon and it's inappropriate. I personally believe it's not. It's a wake-up call to America, to those who just want to forget about how many Americans lost their lives this day. The biggest way to get the attention of the American public is through film, and I think this might have been one of the reasons why 'United 93' was made. Like a rusty fishing knife covered in salt thrusted through your gut, 'United 93' screams 'don't you dare forget what happened on this day, and don't you dare forget why we are in this war."" This message might not come across to everyone, but it does to me. Whether you are more conservative or liberal, I think this film is required viewing for any red-blooded American. It's a film of extraordinary power and passion. It's the best film of the year so far, and you can expect it to be on my top 10 film list of 2006 come December. Do not pass up the chance to see 'United 93' which may prove to be one of the most pre-eminent motion pictures of our generation.

This is no ordinary analysis,"This is the true story of the forty passengers and crew and four terrorists aboard Flight 93 on September 11, 2001. Before you dismiss it, this is no ordinary analysis. There are no stars in this film. You'd be hard pressed to remember any of the characters names; they are all ordinary people caught up in the most horrifying of circumstances, young and old, with the most diverse backgrounds as you'd expect from a group of strangers caught up together. The difference between this film and something you may expect from Hollywood is two fold; the families of the victims were in support of this predominantly British project and the reason for their support is due to Director Paul Greengrass, (Bloody Sunday, Bourne Supremacy).Like those two other films, Greengrass uses a documentary type feel and he uses it brilliantly here. Hand-held cameras are employed almost exclusively, both on the plane and in air traffic control rooms where a lot of the 'story' takes places. It's as though news crews were invited in to observe the chaos. It is as much about the miscommunication between the AFF, the military and the US Administration than it is about a plane hijacking. Certainly this is something which still angers the families. One wonders if any real change has occurred since then.Greengrass has gathered as much factual info as he could for his screenplay and utilizes actors who closely resemble the real victims. There's also a very emotional documentary on the DVD as actors meet the families for the first time. While is sounds exploitative, it isn't; the families want this documented, the sooner the better.The film, however, is free from that emotional stamp that filmmakers usually employ to garner reactions, (read unnecessary schmaltz), and yet it is impossible not to be caught up in the tension as time runs out and we hope against reality for a different conclusion. Fortunately there are other good directors like Greengrass now working in Hollywood, (Alfonso Cuarón, Todd Field) and the sooner we can prevent the Michael Bay's from ever working again, the better. One can always dream.Until then, we have United 93 as a testament that there are still significant films being made on the fringes of the mainstream. It's up to us as audiences to support them when they come along.",8.0,Anonymous,History
heart break,"Everything about United 93 is heart breaking to watch. From the Arabs praying with their Koran, to the smiling faces of the personnel facing what must have seemed like just another day; the person who boarded at the last minute. Paul Greengrass's docudrama is a superb piece of film making. We have the benefit of hind sight and fore knowledge, and yet, as information filtered to the people involved, it seemed surreal, unbelievable, tragic, and baffling. If this film is viewed by film goers who have also watched WHY WE FIGHT, the astonishing, brilliant documentary by Eugene Jarecki, it adds profoundly to our understanding of the human condition. And then there is everybody's favorite whipping boy, Michael Moore, who always tells the truth in his own, sardonic, passionate way. Regardless of how you may feel about him, his perspective is helpful and he doesn't lie. It's difficult for me to comment much further, since United 93 is a film wrought with emotion. Regardless of our personal beliefs, our own convictions, our own sense of the world, people died that day. It show cased the best and the worst in us. Many people die every day all over this complex world and for many of the same reasons. It was hard to speak during, and after viewing this film..... We will never know exactly what happened that day, and Greengrass's meticulous research is a testament to him. It is a film about human beings facing an extraordinary day and how they responded to it, and yes, in an extraordinary way. There was no finger pointing, no demonetization, no focus on the body politic, no jingoistic call for war nor anger. But the themes of love, love for family, love for friends, courage, desperation, cooperation, fear, acceptance. rebellion... I watched his other docudrama, BLOODY Sunday, and this film has the same type of style. But this film flew by, and it felt like it was only a few minutes in length. It left me breathless by the end, and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for most people. A remarkable film about an infamous day. It is a great monument to the people who died that day. A portion of the monies generated from United 93 went to their monument. In RAN, Kurosawa reminds us that when we forget history, we are doomed to repeat it, to walk the same path over and over. My hope is that we move forward as a species....United 93 is a painful yet important film. many people were praying in this film, from beginning to end. i wonder; were they all praying to the same God? screenplay A direction A editing A+",10.0,Anonymous,History
Not entertaining,"The movie is made too soon after the tragedy. The movie exploits the tragedy, but not in an entertaining way. There are several episodes in the movie, which are not credible at all, like the episode with telephones, and the bathroom, and the co-pilot stuff. The passenger's behavior is very strange, they act like Hollywood make-out war heroes, although they are supposed to behave just like ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. The camera work and the prompts are good, but the directing is flawed. I could not wait for the movie to end, and I regret wasting my time on it. Apart from being absolutely not credible, the movie does not grip you, does not make you feel for the characters, and as everyone knows how it ends, does leave much room for anticipation. I would definitely recommend skipping this one.",3.0,Anonymous,History

The goodbye messages from the passenegers to their famalies were very touching and very realistically portrayed. The rest of the movie, however, was not nearly as well put together.

Brought back memories...,"At that very same time, I was on a flight from Paris to San Jose, CA. When the pilot announced we wouldn't get there because of ""terrorist attacks"" on American airports and other strategic places, and when I saw the sadness on the crew's faces, I had only one thought: ""please, let us be safe"". Luckily, we stayed safe, we were redirected to Calgary, Canada, where we stayed for 10 day before being able to get back to Belgium.I was in charge of a group of 45 people, an ""incentive travel"". I remember passing my mobile phone to other passengers, mostly not belonging to my group, to allow them to call home to tell that we were going to be OK. But we still didn't know what happened in reality. It was horror when we discovered it, in a small room - with TV - at Calgary Airport.All my life I will remember the reception at Calgary Airport, the gentle people that helped us out, there. I will not go into details. It still is hard to remember. And I wasn't even directly involved.Just to say, I can imagine the fear, the horror, but also the braveness of the people, like me, like you, aboard that flight United 93.

A soldier's review of a disgrace to those lost.,"First off let me tell you a bit about who I am. I was the film critic and entertainment editor for my school's paper, a soldier who has been in the Army for almost nine years now, and I carry two degrees including a B.A. degree in Communications from Penn State University. On September 11th 2001 I had just started my contract with The PA Army National Guard and within a half an hour of the second plane crashing I called both my new unit and my old unit and asked to be put back on active duty immediately. Due to contract obligations, on an Army Guard contract you must fulfill at least the first year, I was unable to go back active. Needless to say 9/11 means a lot to me. The people who died are personal heroes along with those who serve/served our country in all ways.That being said this movie is utter garbage. In no way shape or form does it honor the memories of those who died that day. So why do people feel so heartfelt about this film then? CNN! The film relies heavily on replaying, over and over, the actual footage from CNN from that day. You would think the film makers could have come up with a better approach than to draw emotion from something that people are already scarred from. I cried, but I knew why I was crying, watching the footage again brought back so many painful memories. The film overreaches for a documentary style that it misses completely by making sure each and every shot is completely hand-held. This adds up to motion sickness and a film trying to be overly stylized. Although it was not an action film, the camera movement suggested otherwise. I'd like to personally smack the idiot that entrusted the director of The Bourne Supremacy with something of this nature. The acting, if you can call it that, is sub-par, and in no way was handled the way it should have been for a film of such importance. The script also neglects some key points from that day, one example is no mention of where our president was. Do your homework on this, you'll be offended as to what our leader found more important. This is nothing more than a snuff film. You will become emotional, but only because they overuse all of the footage of the actual events over and over. Avoid this film at all costs and take a trip to where the towers once stood instead. It is a much better way to remember those that we have lost.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"If You're Not Afraid, You Should Be....","This nonjudgmental portrayal of the events abroad United flight 93 probably didn't set out to send any sort of a political message. In fact the director went to extraordinary lengths to avoid appearing to have a political point of view. The message came through nonetheless. The message is simple: There are many, many, Islamic Fundamentalists out there who want only one thing out of life -- they want you dead. And they think nothing of killing you for no other reason than being American, or Jewish, or Christian... or anything other than a Radical Muslim. These people are not bearded, turban-wearing, wild-eyed screaming lunatics. They are far too sophisticated and savvy for that. No, they masquerade as students, computer specialists, engineers, clean cut young men you would probably not even notice in a crowd. They are the kind that could call their wife on the phone and say sweetly to her ""I love you,"" then get on a plane and kill thousands of innocent civilian strangers, in the name of God. They could be anybody, living anywhere, doing anything... and that's what makes this movie truly frightening.The fact that the story is told without and typical Hollywood hype, corny dramatic devices, or other distractions only serves to point out how terrifying the modern world really is. It is made so as a result of this fanatical terrorist ideology. Regardless of your political position, you are forced by this movie to see the fruits of radical Islam. You are forced to see raw evil. You have no choice. There is no way to sugar coat it. These people are evil and must be eliminated, by what ever means are necessary. As the movie makes clear, it comes down to one thing -- it really is them or us. It really is just that simple. You're either for them or you're against them. Our country's very survival depends on it.I urge everybody to see this fine movie. If you have seen it once, I urge you to see it again.

If you're ready,"If you're ready or close to ready to see a movie about September 11, I will strongly recommend United 93.I have not seen Flight 93, which was made for TV and I have read is much more sentimentalized. This one has not an ounce of sap. It is more nearly a documentary than a feature (of course it is a re-enactment and not a documentary, but it has some of that feel). The DVD extras include 45 minutes of interviews with several of the families of the passengers and crew (they resent the word ""victims""), all of whom gave permission for the movie, and I think all of whom met the actors who played the parts of their loved ones. They got to see it before it was released to the public, and the movie gave some of them a bit more peace.I saw World Trade Center, which was not bad but was Hollywoodized. This movie has actors we are not familiar with, so we will not be distracted by them, and many of them look eerily like the folks they play. The flight crew and air traffic controllers are played by people who do those jobs in real life, not by actors.A Oscar nomination for Best Picture is not out of line. Even though we know the plot, we are mesmerized, both by the heroes and the villains. We get a lot of time in the air traffic control centers in Boston, Newark, and a military command center. The scene where the Newark controllers are trying to locate a missing plane and then they see it hit the second tower is indescribable.I don't say it is a must-see, because reliving that morning is not something everyone is ready to do. But when you reach that place, start with this movie.It is rated R for violence and ""intense sequences of terror and violence,"" though the distributors will appeal or have appealed. I believe many teenagers are ready to see this. There is maybe one word of profanity. There are some scenes with blood but it is not gory or overdone. The issue is whether a child can handle the fear. Watching the movie, your heartbeat goes up several times (I think I noticed a heartbeat sound effect a few times, but I did not resent it as manipulative like I often do some musical choices). I was gripping the arms of my chair when the pilot tilted the plane to throw off the passengers' attack. I am trying to remember at what age I could have seen this, and been able to separate the fear from the events. Maybe 12 but certainly no younger. Most kids it would be more like 14 or 15. I do not know that they need to change the rating, as it would be a good idea for kids to have parents available to talk to about this movie. I guess since it's seen at home now it doesn't matter so much, but I wanted to describe some of this for folks who might want to see it with their kids.",10.0,Anonymous,History

911,"I saw this film today and it was a shocking, brilliant piece of film making. I don't really have anything more to say about it - see it for yourself. Questions I'd pose to people about 911 are:1)When Bush was first told about the attacks why did he continue to read to the kids class for another 7 minutes? did the secret service know something we didn't? 2)why did the terrorists attack between 8-9 am when the buildings where mostly empty? 11 am and each building would have had had 20,000 people in them. 3)Why did the terrorists chose to fly into the toughened side of the Pentagon when the roof would have been much softer to fly through? 4)Where are remains of the aircraft that hit the pentagon and the pictures of this 747 sticking out the side? 5)Wire framed buildings have not historically fallen down due to fire. Didn't the collapse of the towers look sooooo like a controlled demolition? 6)Why has Rumsbvelt got 3 different versions of what he did immediately after the attack? 7)Was United 93 actually shot down? 8)Why did all the normal protocols for incepting planes that communication is lost with not kick in that day. Were they turned off? 9)Who benefited from giving the Bush administration reason to go into the middle east?

Stunning but not sensationalist,"It would be hard to overstate the impact on ones senses and mind of the final minutes of the film United 93. A cacophony of sounds and images fill the screen and our ears. Screaming, cries of desperation, panic and anguish accompany the desperate attack the passengers launch against hijackers who are intent on killing all aboard. Imagine trying to reach and the wrest the controls of an aircraft from a man who can send the plane towards the ground in an instant, but delay the attack for a moment and you will die anyway. That terrible reality faced the passengers and left them no option but to try, even though they must have known they stood little chance of surviving the incident. The film was shown on the BBC tonight and I can imagine living rooms around the country being full of people sitting stunned in their arm chairs at its conclusion. Other comments on this site confirm that my reaction to the ending in particular is a common one. And yet the film does not sensationalise or give the events of that day the Hollywood treatment. Instead in many ways it is understated but always incredibly realistic. The acting was almost too good to be called such. Filmed like a fly on the wall documentary, it felt like we were being presented with snippets of real life action as it occurred. People spoke as real people do in such circumstances. At one point the passengers learn fragments of truth about the other terrorist attacks taking place at the time. But the information is incomplete, sometimes incorrect, and being filtered in from many sources via mobile phones being used by the passengers to talk to loved ones. As rumours spread and word passes round, the same phrases, such as ""The World Trade Centre has been hit"" are repeated over and over again. If one was to read the script one might think the sheer number of repetitions would be ridiculous and yet it accurately conveys how people in such desperate circumstances would seek to inform others around them of what they had learned themselves and accurately portrays how it is natural in such circumstances to repeat something in order to comprehend the magnitude of it ourselves and as a way of comprehending the implications such news has for our own predicament. The film also did an excellent job of representing all the grey areas of human nature rather than resorting to caricature.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Tense but factually bankrupt,"All due credit must be given to director Paul Greengrass for a tense and gripping thriller that keeps the viewer on edge throughout the course of the movie. Sadly though there is very little factual merit to this story.Firstly one must bear in mind that the whole dramatization of the evens unfolding within the cabin are based entirely upon many highly questionable cell phone and air-phone calls. The cell phone calls alone have already been scientifically proved to have been almost impossible from an aircraft moving at that speed, not to mention it's altitude. Although there isn't sufficient space for an in depth analysis, here are two very well written articles which may be of interest:http://physics911.net/projectachilles.htmhttp://physics911.net/cellphoneflight93.htmMost interesting is Mark Brigham's air-phone call to his mother which began - ""Mom? This is Mark Brigham."" OK seriously when was the last time anyone used their full name when calling their mother? Also, Todd Beamer who's call appeared to have lasted the longest, would rather speak to the Verizon operator than have her connect him to his wife. This is something she could have done in a matter of seconds.Most disturbingly was the portrayal of a German passenger aboard the plane, who's name appeared on the passenger manifest, yet other than that nothing more is known of him. However the director has decided to portray this poor man in a rather negative light, simply for being a pacifist and wanting to try to negotiate with the hijackers. Could this be a deliberate metaphor for the increasing political divide between Europe and America? As an American it seems to me that from a very early age we're brainwashed into believing that military might is a positive asset, while pacifism is simply for the weak. In reality it is quite the opposite!Finally with regards to a post-script appearing prior to the end credits stating that the President did not scramble aircraft because he did not wish the plane to be shot down is again nonsense. Anyone who remembers where they were that tragic day will also remember where George Bush was - or more to the point wasn't. Apart from a brief statement that morning it wasn't until later that evening that any of us heard a single peep out of him. The responsibility for scrambling aircraft sat with Vice President Dick Cheney.Contrary to popular belief the scrambling of military aircraft does not invoke shooting down the airliner as a foregone conclusion - in fact that is an extreme last resort. It has always been a common practice to scramble a military escort to any hijacked airliner in order to get it safely on the ground. Cheney flat out refused to do this.I will leave the readers to draw their own conclusions, but i do urge all of you to look at the facts.",3.0,Anonymous,History
no big stars=great movie,"as a soldier in the united states army having been deployed for a year in Iraqi i almost forgot what i was over there for. watching this movie helped me realize that heroes do not only exist in the movies and the military, they exist in those that display it in time of need. i do not not hate the people in which we are at war with i do however share a small feeling of pity towards those who attempt to destroy the country in which i live. this movie went in the direction of few great movies. there were no big names like nick cage or Ben affleck. and that is why i gave this movie a 9 out of 10. i think that many people are going to be surprised at how Hollywood is handling this subject.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Greengrass conducts a masterful study on humanity,"Director Paul Greengrass does a masterful job making viewers feel like they are there. It is more than just the shaky cameras which many newspaper reviewers referred to - it is his sensitivity and portrayal of human emotions, and the choices he makes in what to show on the screen.It is jarring at first to see that the beginning of the movie is from the standpoint of the hijackers, but this seems to be the only logical choice. After all, we, as viewers watching this after the events portrayed in the film, know what is coming, and it is only the hijackers who know what's going to happen. One of the hijackers is sitting at a chair waiting at the gate waiting for the boarding call, and looks nervously to the man sitting next to him casually conducting everyday business affairs on his cellphone. A flight attendant asks one of the hijackers what he would like for breakfast... Seeing these men and women on the plane, including even the hijackers, portrayed as real people who we can somehow see ourselves being, makes the entire film almost unbearable and impossible to watch.The scenes from the flight control centers are necessary to bring us back to that day, because most of us were as these people were - horrified observers. The film cuts back and forth between Flight 93 and the flight control centers, until the final part of the movie when we are on Flight 93 entirely.What is gripping about this film is that it puts us in the minds of the people who died that day. Greengrass paid much attention to details, such as early on in the movie when a passenger looks behind her as she adjusts her seat backward to get more comfortable. The flight attendants put on their heels after having sat during the takeoff, to take food orders from the passengers.In conventional Hollywood terms, the first half of the movie is ""not very exciting,"" and there is in reality a scant amount of violence when compared to commercial action films. But the film places you so completely and psychologically on the plane that day, that when the first horrors are committed -- in the same real, gritty documentary style the rest of the film is made in -- the violence is stomach-churning and horrifying.The triumph of the movie is that, as we approach the final minutes and the passengers are aware this a suicide mission, we are still right there with them. One of the hijackers might trigger a bomb strapped to his waist at any second, and no one knows if they'll live to see the next moment. We feel their terror and their struggle to build up their courage. In the final minutes, as the passengers (we) face fate, the film becomes a universal experience. The passengers' terror, determination, and courage are now recreated through film, in possibly the best way it could have been done. Though the heroes on the plane are no longer with us, they live through our thoughts and our memories. A respectful and heartfelt dedication to the passengers of Flight 93.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Difficult to watch but unexpectedly of high quality,"I'm not certain exactly what I expected from this film, but the high quality of the production certainly beat my expectations. United 93 has a very strong feel of reality. It does not feel preachy nor is it forcing a ""tug at the heartstrings"" feeling. It does not even actually take a side. It simply says ""this is what we believe happened"". It portrays real people in a very shocking and terrible scenario as they attempt to identify what exactly is happening and what they can do to correct the problem and save lives.This was a terribly difficult film to watch because we all know the story and the ending. But, I admire the film makers in the direction they took to simply let the story tell itself. And, they did it with great respect and with tremendous attention to detail. No over-acting, no over-used musical crescendos, but a tremendous amount of action and fine acting. A great script, as well. It may be too early for many Americans to watch, but it is a film I feel comfortable recommending to those who feel ready. It has a great sense of documentary, and I expect to see it shown in classrooms in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Very powerful film,Just got done watching this film. I was definitely skeptical of it when it came out as I thought 9/11 wasn't that long ago. But my fears were put to rest and this film is quite appropriately right for the time. It is a very strong and moving film and does an excellent job portraying the confusion that filled the day. It doesn't glamorize anything and sticks to all the facts that are known about 9/11. I highly recommend rented this film and watching it by yourself on a night of no distractions. You need to really fully dedicate yourself to the film as it commands your attention. Not only so you can get the full dose of the film but also out of respect for what you are watching and learning.,9.0,Anonymous,History
The point is?,"This movie portrays the fact that something could have been done to save the original planes when actually they were caught with their pants down with the 1st 2 planes, the story of the united 93 however was quite well predicted. This over all however was a waste of just under 2 hours of my time since we all have seen the news footage of what happened and we don't need a story written about it, controversial or not.This was a waste of money and effort that could have been used a hell of a lot more imaginatively and productively.If you wish to see the events from an American Biased point of view and think of it as facts then feel free to watch it, as it seems as factual as braveheart to me ;)",1.0,Anonymous,History
I shook the whole time,"I was genuinely surprised when I saw this film last night. I expected a Hollywood version of the tragic reality. Instead, I saw a devastatingly real portrayal of the tragic events as they unfolded.After the first half hour- 45 min. of the film I was by no means convinced of it's quality. I disliked how fast-moving it was. The dialogue was hard to hear and follow. I though some of the ""Actors"" seemed very fake and stupid. Then I realized that we were ALL ""stupid"" the morning of Sept. 11th. Until the action began to get a grip on what had actually happened, which DID NOT OCCUR until the late afternoon/evening of Sept. 11th, all of us, including the air traffic controllers and military, were more shocked and confused than angry and revengeful.Then the film really got started. Once the endless back and forth confusion of the air traffic controllers and military ended, the film focused solely on the passengers and terrorists aboard flight 93.I don't know if I can recommend this film to others for one reason- It scared me.When the plane started going down, I couldn't help but gasping for breath through my tears because I felt like I was aboard. You can FEEL the fear and desperation they felt, and it was scary.This film was not sugar-coated by any stretch of the imagination. It was raw. I think it was well-done because it was not made up. The director presented the fact as he knew them and didn't attempt to stylize or change anything. He didn't over-generalize it either.Its a human story. And its worth seeing simply to appreciate each and every day you have on earth with your loved ones.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Moments in the air,"The courage of man...on that dreadful day.That day is September 11, 2001.United 93 is getting ready for liftoff in New York.There are forty-five passengers waiting.And three of them are hijackers And then...the takeoff.The air traffic controllers hear there has been a plane hijacked, maybe more.Then, moments later, two of those planes crash into World Trade Center.And later Pentagon is hit.But United 93 doesn't hit any building, because the passengers decide to fight.The plane crashes in Shanksville, near Pennsylvania.Paul Greengrass did a very fine job with United 93 (2006).The cast is mostly unknown, but very good.Christian Clemenson belongs to the more known names.He plays one heroic passenger called Thomas E.

"Gruesome, thought-provoking, and most importantly, evokes admiration for true American heroes","I can't help but feel ashamed that for quite a while, I wouldn't see this movie. Not because it's horrific, mind you, but because of the fact that I once foolishly assumed that this was exploitative film-making, that not only would it fail to honor the heroes in United 93, but also that it would cheapen the significance of one out of four awful incidents of that tragic day. I absolutely loved the way ""25th Hour"" from Spike Lee handled the 9/11 subject matter: as a background and parallel to the characters' lives. I couldn't imagine watching something that directly dealt with it. I can't say how deeply upset ""United 93"" made me, and yet how proud I am that someone sitting next to me on the subway potentially could have that kind of courage to deal with unimaginable circumstances, I certainly am unsure as to how I would handle something like that. Despite that I knew what the outcome would be, I never stopped rooting for the terrific ensemble cast, and even within the last few minutes, the film provoked a feeling that somehow and some way, the passengers would survive. I remember that when it happened, I was in a college dorm watching the WTC footage live on the television. As gut- wrenching as I felt back then, the scenes that took place at the various control centers made me realize how lucky I was to have the comfort of friends around me as opposed to having to directly deal with the situation. The light small talk that the passengers were having before and after lift-off is very human and very scary: that something very ordinary as talking about your grandchildren with someone sitting next to you could happen within the same few minutes that a hijack would occur. On a side note, I'm still very wary of watching ""World Trade Center"" from Oliver Stone, as I find that his style is ""more is more"", and that he has all the moving parts of a Hollywood Blockbuster that overall lacks humanity. However, I was wrong about this exceptional film, and so it's possible that I may be jumping the gun again. Now though, I at least feel I owe it a viewing to make up my mind.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Outstanding on so many levels,"Only five years had passed since the 9/11 attacks when Paul Greengrass brought his depiction of the events on board the plane that fought back to the screen. It would have been so easy for him to give it the Hollywood treatment ; stereotypical bad guys, gung-ho heroics and dramatic action and sensationalism. Instead what he opted for was a candid and neutral exploration of not only the events on board United Airlines 93, but the events of the day as a whole from the perspective of the people on the ground in the military and air traffic control. The terrorists are shown to be scared and very nervous. Not only that but they are presented as how they must have been: unassuming men who you'd pass everyday on the street. I think the depiction of the confusion on the ground and how it happened minute by minute is outstanding and very well produced. The air-traffic control scenes are the best. The performances from the unknown cast are perfect, again showcasing what a fine director and film-maker Greengrass is. He handled another traumatic event and portrayed it candidly and equally respectively on the big screen four years before this with 2002's ""Bloody Sunday"". ""United 93"" is by far the best film made about 9/11 and should be the definitive watch for younger generations to come for an idea of what it must have been like on that day.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Moving beyond all expectations,"Tonight as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival I attended a screening of ""United 93"". I was moved by this film in a way no other film has ever moved me. Having had only a scant knowledge of the events surrounding the fourth hijacked plane on that fateful September 11th, the film portrayed so graphically the horrors faced by those poor souls who died on this flight, that I felt almost as if I was there with them - right the way to the tragic end. I do not recall ever leaving a cinema and observing so many other theatre goers who were wiping away tears, and looking as stunned and emotionally ""wrung out"" as I felt myself tonight. To see theatre ushers comforting one another as they sobbed (male and female) openly, and partners locked in supportive embrace while also crying unashamably in public, is a sight I have never encountered following the screening of a film. The impact was so great I am still reeling an hour later, my thoughts, a mixture of sadness and sorrow. For me the ""alarm bells"" are ringing, and the question I have been asking myself for the past hour is this .... If organised religion means acts such as this can be justified, then isn't it time to rid ourselves of such institutions, and to seek faith on a personal and private level? No god could sanction such acts against humanity. I defy anyone with an ounce of compassion not to be effected in some way by ""United 93"".",10.0,Anonymous,History
Emotional,"United 93 is one of the most emotional - eye opener of a film I have personally seen. United 93 gives you a good perspective on the 911 bombings, detailed with how horrifying the event was. This is a gut churner of a film, which makes you put yourself in the passengers shoes and to think what it must have been like for the hostages on board. The film leaves you speechless and makes you feel lucky for who you are. The film will get a good response from the public (especially the Americans) for the event that it covers as it was a sudden and horrible event that broke many hearts.A great eye opener, simple but effective - 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Leaves you shaken.You are likely not to forget this one.Truly remarkable film-making.,"What happened on that plane can never be known.No film could possibly depict the exact situation on that flight.But United 93 uses that event as a back-story and dramatizes it.Paul Greengrass knows that he can't accurately depict the incidents that has taken place on the plane.So,he uses the limited information and gives a dramatic approach to that event with as much realism as he can.So that all that in the film could look real.I was unsatisfied the way he approached the incident.The sudden rise of the passengers to halt the plane,and the continuous praying of the Muslims.He doesn't know that.He couldn't possibly know if those terrorists really were praying in their last minutes,or the passengers really did join forces and came together to stop the plane so that they could get back to their loved ones.But what he does is that he uses all that and gives us a devastating drama.A drama that will hurt Americans.But it's also a drama that is to be seen by both Americans and the non-Americans.We see how far we have reached from that point to this.We are reacting to the situation with violence.America has come a long way now to eliminate terrorism.And they've failed,just as they failed when the President was informed about the situation and the government didn't take action until it was too late.Greengrass really is the man who gives a powerful,shocking and painfully disturbing story,regardless if it's true.It hits you.And in the end,you choose to accept all that happens on screen.These men and women just wanted to get back home.They fought back before they died.What did those men and women do to the Terrorists?But then again,what did all those men and women in Iraq and Afganistan and all those Muslim countries that America is fighting war with do.The reason also to watch this harrowing unsettling film ,in the way MUNICH was , is that the stark realism that is put on the film.It is impossible not to believe the events that were occurring on the plane ,even if they weren't precisely accurate.It's a startling achievement for Greengrass,and I don't care if he did to honor them or just thought of getting an Oscar.He gives you a towering achievement.This is grand and perfect film-making.He takes us deep into the Airline headquarters,and shows us all the operations in detail.How a normal ,regular day begins to unfold into a chaotic ,shocking day.The men both in the Airline traffic control and in the plane,are left totally shaken by the events and so will be the audience.The sheer intensity of the situations scares you at times.It started like any other day,and slowly it descends into a nightmare.The Airline officials couldn't do anything,they were hopeless.They couldn't get approval from their Government,resulting in further tragedies.It just grips you.It will be a nightmare for those families who watch this film.Especially the final 10 minutes.Which will never be forgotten.It's like a horror movie before you.And makes it even more scarier,because you know what the conclusion is going to be for these men and women.A look is definitely worth.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A thought-provoking look back at ""that day""","This was a well-done look back at a day we will all remember. I was especially amazed how the writers/directors took some scenes that, by necessity, were chaotic, and made them make sense.Now, to be sure, this movie was not, nor was it made to be ""entertaining"", but it seemed to convey the urgency of the day's events and did a good job of changing the victims from sheer numbers to understandable characters.The ""beauty"" of this movie, if you want to call it that, is that it was a movie that will stick with you (my hands were sore after the movie from gripping my armrest through most of the picture).This one should be around come Oscar time for Best Picture. Due to the nature of the film, I'm sure none of the cast members will earn any awards; but that simply means that they were doing their job. This movie was about the events and the people. It was not made to call attention to any of the actors.I would heartily recommend this one for adults. Of course, I wouldn't want any child (or adolescent, for that matter) to relive this day unless they are really up to it.Thanks to the Paul Greengrass for having the courage to do the movie; and thanks to the families of the victims for sharing their stories with us.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A good ending does not equate a good movie,"... which is bad news for The Usual Suspects, but even worse news for 9/11-take United 93 because it is a film that solely relies on its last 10 minutes to be poignant, engrossing and unfortunately even watchable. The rest is a dizzying and visually exhausting fare that besides its shaky camera-work has no even remotely interesting approaches to save it. Even this cinematic device is tiresome as it fails in bestowing its product with that ""intimate"" and Claustophobic feel, and it instead leaves you thinking that a monkey could have shot it  same lack of any clear sense of direction, and the same listless wandering.This monkey (Paul Greengrass) opens his film with a scene of one of the hijackers  the one with the unibrow  sitting on his hotel bed and reading from the Koran. The next morning, he boards United 93, unites with his fellow hijackers and takes over the plane. Dizziyingly, the story shifts to command centers, traffic control towers and the National Guard who all struggle to work out the situation, shouting numbers at their screens and talking on their mobile phones. Most of the action takes place at the aforementioned stations and not the actual plane (like it should have).So now we regrettably have 1 hour and a half long hectic, shaky journey of air traffic controllers navigating a pool of numbers, coordinates, transmissions and codewords. Relegating 9/11 to numbers on a screen of course makes this experience detached, listless and cerebral. I'm not saying there needs to be melodrama, but there needs to be some emotion  a subtle scene or two to elicit a psychological response from the audience besides boredom and exhaustion over all the shouted flight numbers.What is disturbing is not the tragic fate of the passengers on-board United 93, but that IN SPITE of an emotionally-charged premise, controversial circumstances (very early to make a film like this) and intimate camera-work, it actually leaves you cold until the last ten minutes. In these last minutes, Greengrass finally abandons the lofty command centres and zooms in on the passengers on-board the flight  and the result is thankfully a poignant last journey.4 out of 10",4.0,Anonymous,History
very powerful,"I really wasn't sure about this. When the trailers started to appear, I wasn't sure I wanted to see this. I'm not American, so although the 9/11 tragedy did have an affect on my country, obviously it didn't have the same effect as in the US. However, it was still a shocking day that will live on for years to come.As a movie, I think Paul Greengrass deserves immense credit. He could probably have made it more Hollywood, with big name actors, and such. However, by simply telling the facts as best he can, as no-one knows what actually happened on that plane, he comes up with a powerful, gripping tragedy. By getting people in the movie playing themselves, and by involving the families of the the people killed, it shows that he wanted it get it right. And I think he has.He makes no political statements in the movie, he simply lays out the events of 9/11. No doubt political movies about this will appear, but this is not one of them.All the real people involved deserve immense credit for appearing, as it couldn't have been an easy thing for them to relive the events of that day. And I think the actors are brilliant, in their performances as the passengers who come to realise what's happening and then trying to do something about it.This film is not entertainment. I don't think you can tell a 9/11 story as entertainment. Like any tragedy all you can do is simply tell the story of the events as best and as realistic as possible. Greengrass has done that.And, if as reported, the families of the victims are OK with the movie, and the portrayal of their loved ones, then to me that says everything.This movie demands to be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The portrayals are very convincing, and the viewer feels as though he or she is there, on board the aircraft, or in the FAA traffic control centers, or at Northeast Air Defense Center.It is one of the few films I have seen in a theater, after the showing of which, one could hear a pin drop.

"Please, see this film. You'll cry like a baby.","Last Sunday, two days ago, my mother asked me if I wanted to see a movie. The only thing I wanted to watch was United 93, or I have choices such as RV and Stick It, heh, you get the point. So I went in thinking, yeah I might cry a bit, but given the critical acclaim, I knew I'd at least enjoy the film for what it was. 30 Min. into the film I noticed the superb acting, very impressed by people I've never seen on the silver screen acting better than almost all the 20 mil. actors out there. That point within itself should bring realism and this further more immersed my attention to become lost in its greatness. Yes, greatness. When the footage of the plane hitting the towers flashed before my eyes, I couldn't hold my tears in for the life of me. Greengrass' flow and suspense really pulls in the audience, grabbing them by the neck with emotion and immersion, never letting go. The acting, the camera work, the writing, everything was done with no flaw what-so-ever. By the end of the film, I couldn't take it; I was bawling like a baby, I've never cried like this before to a film, much less even in my entire life. I felt as if I was on board that very plain. No exaggeration at all. If a 20 year old man (me) who stereotypically would never show his weak side, considering I barely cry, cried so hard the entire theatre heard me. I had to go through the back exit so people wouldn't stare. I continued to cry until half way home. My mom had to drive my own car cuz I was so cut up. Now, with that said, I learned something. In the past I THOUGHT I felt for the passengers and families, but after experiencing this film, I KNOW, KNOW what the meaning of Don't ever forget 9/11 was truly about. OK, I admit the very first time I saw the trailer, like everyone else, felt it was too soon. But that's the point, nobody felt this way for Pearl Harbor, even the people who lived through it, given it was a weak film; I was still something people could emotionally relate to. Please people, the only reason you shouldn't see this film in the theatre is because of a soft heart. This film was made with dignity, made with care and attention to detail, with out the goal of making a profit. That is definitely something 99.9% of Hollywood filmmakers can't say. Greengrass can. One last point, I'm an avid film maker and I've seen a great amount of films in my life, lots, and this is by far on of the greatest film experiences I have ever had in my entire life.

Well done movie,"Well, I went and saw it. There are no spoilers; we all know how the story ended.The movie itself was well made. The progression of events and the individuals' respective responses, while speculation, was reasonable and believable. The brutality of the terrorists was GRAPHIC. The behind the scenes events in the Air Traffic Control Centers and Military Command Posts were well done. This is the most realistic movie I have seen out of Hollywood on an actual event I have seen in a long time.There was some license taken, A passenger with a northern European accent (either Scandanavian or German) urged the other passengers to behave and be quiet. He even stood and attempted to warn the terrorists, but was dragged down and silenced by other passengers not in the assault team. What the ""assault team"" did to the terrorists outside the cockpit was at least as gory as what was done to the flight crew, a flight attendant and a passenger by the terrorists.It showed the door to the cockpit being breached, but never showed the passengers reaching the controls although that was implied.The movie suddenly went to black. There were two slides of epilogue and the last slide before the credits was a dedication to all who were killed on 11 Septermber.The theater was silent, with the exception of some people crying. Leaving the theater was like leaving a funeral.I am glad I saw it. You may not want to; that is your privilege, or you might wait until it comes out on DVD.

Excellent,"First, my prayers go up for the passengers and the crew and their families who survived them - and for their hijackers. It's the hijackers for whom I feel the sorriest because people who are so twisted by hate need the sorrow more than do the innocents they mass-murdered. The hijackers came from their world of so little love and kindness to mass-murder innocents who came from their worlds of genuine love and kindness. The telling difference between the hate-twisted, nihilist hijackers and the heroic passengers and crew is that in their attempt to save themselves the passengers and crew succeeded in sparing the lives of God knows how many more innocents whom the hijackers, had they flown into their target, would have also mass-murdered.'United 93' is the most harrowing film I've seen. Its makers relied as far as they possibly could on the documentary record of the event it depicts - on the facts, not on the paranoid, twisted, cynical, bigoted prejudices and predilections - and not on the cheap thrills and frisson of phony righteousness - of conspiracy theorists. Those facts include all that the makers could draw and glean from the tapes of the passengers' and crewmembers' in-flight telephone conversations and the background sounds they included.Cinematically this is a seamlessly tight, masterly treatment of real-time docu-drama. Top notch in my book.'United 93' ought to be shown, it ought to be required to be shown, in every American senior high school class. Now and forever.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Shocking....Disturbing....Amazing,Some say we are not ready for a 9/11 film. i disagree. i think this is the perfect time. this film doesn't confront any theories or conspiracies. it doesn't go after bin laden or Muslims or even know about them at the time this takes place. it only shows what we and they knew at the time this happened. the film takes place from the time people started entering United Fliht 93 to the time it crashed in the field at 9:04 A.M. This film is truly heartbreaking and will be hard to handle for mostly everyone but is still a film everyone should see. Greengras does an amazing job directing this Shocking film. some may not be able to sit through this and may have to leave the theater but i suggest you give it a shot. this is the best film of the year so far. 10/10,10.0,Anonymous,History
"UNITED we stand, harsh realism makes for a years must and one of the best films","****, the first of two major motion pictures depicting 9/11 and the horrific events that would follow. The other being Stone's ""World Trade Center"" and the best of the two ""United 93"" does a top notch job. You would figure it would take on so many aspects, with characters and more plots, and the President. But it doesn't, it settles on people, it's real. These people are strangers to us but we get emotionally involved, that is what makes Greengrass a great writer/director here. He takes real people and makes it work to a well formulated story of heroism.The story of course about the few passengers about flight 93 who took the courage to defy the terrorist who have hijacked it. Most of the characters played by no name actors, which I love. I am glad I didn't see Tom Cruise in there screaming or over acting on the plane. Another reason why ""United"" works, it has every essence of an ordinary film, almost low budget with a big heart.This movie does not make fun of the people who lost their lives that day, it salutes them. This movie is beautiful, inspirational and one of the years must see films. I loved this movie and the last 15 minutes will leave you breathless and amazed.

A must see. You don't have to be American to enjoy it,"The tragic events of 9/11, in particular, the huge loss of life that occurred at the Twin Towers could easily provide enough material for several feature films, so it comes as some surprise the first major film release inspired from 9/11 would be the lesser known story of those who lost their lives on United 93, the only plane not to reach its target. Also surprising is the even-handedness with which British director Paul Greengrass has brought to U93 as this film could very easily have succumbed to blatant flag waving, a 'tribute' to the American spirit (a la Ladder 49). Hell, if Jerry Bruckheimer had gotten hold of it he'd have had Arnie on the plane, and I'm sure Arnie would found a way to stop the film from crashing. Cynicism aside though, Greengrass's devotion to verisimilitude gives U93 a huge edge over anything that 'Hollywood' could have done with this film. Greengrass's use of the hand-held camera, nauseating in Bourne Supremacy and serviceable in Sunday Bloody Sunday, works a treat in United 93, conveying so well the fear and desperation of the plane's passengers, but also the anxiety of the terrorists themselves, especially before the actual hijacking. The tension is un-paramount, as is the confusion Greengrass captures in the FAA and Air-Defence headquarters, as people struggle to comprehend and control the situation. Greengrass's decision to move the film around in between places other than the actual plane works extremely well, with one particularly harrowing scene taking place inside the New York Airport control tower as they see they second plane coming in low (at this stage the first plane was considered a possible accident) before cutting to CNN footage of the impact as FAA workers watch stunned. U93 is a great example of how such dramatic material can still be done with subtlety. There is no constant and dramatic score, but somehow Greengrass creates incredible tension right until the last moment. This film is ultimately about the heroism of the plane's passengers, their efforts to not simply 'lay down' is compelling. The fact that we know the end result of the film does not detract one iota. As of yet I haven't seen Oliver Stone's World Trade Centre, and though Stone can critique America has well as he can celebrate it, I cannot imagine it being half as good as United 93.",,Anonymous,History
Not worthy of the Big Screen,"This would better serve us all as a Sunday afternoon documentary.

We are not given the opportunity to embrace the passengers, because we don't get to know them at all on a personal level. We weren't able to even know who Todd ""Let's Roll"" Beemer was until the last couple of minutes of the movie.

I was unsure of what I would feel. But, I can say that I will recommend this movie to all of my friends and family. Most of the movie does not contain cursing and there is no sexual content.

Almost TOO Real...,"I went to see this movie feeling that it was an important piece of cinema to see, as a means for people to make sense out of the September 11th tragedies and to understand that day from various perspectives. Personally, the core of the tragedy to me has always been the World Trade Center and while Flight 93 was certainly an enormous tragedy as well, I think more often than not of the twin towers as emblematic of Sept. 11th; Flight 93 somehow takes a back-burner in my mind. This movie certainly gives the lives lost on United 93 their due. Coming out five years after the fact, this movie is an important reminder of what happened that day, in spite of the wars and propaganda and emotional callousness built up over time. I say that this movie is almost TOO real because when watching it I was struck by the everydayness of the people on board the plane and the incredulity of the air traffic controllers when first confronted with the hijackings. Some of the actors in this movie aren't even actors; I read in one review that some of the actual air traffic controllers play themselves, and the lack of ""name"" actors is an effective means of realism. This movie is shot shakily, as though with a hand-held camera, which gives it an even more authentic feel. While it plays out a bit like a Hollywood thriller, I had to keep reminding myself, ""This HAPPENED..this is real,"" and at times that thought was overwhelming to me. I had to look away from the screen more than once and at one point leave the theater for a few minutes. It is different from some fictional thriller in that going in, you know the ending; there are no light moments in this movie and nor should there be. The film refrains from political commentary or subjectivity. I don't feel there was any sentimentalism portrayed whatsoever, as with some made-for-TV movies on the subject. While some might say any September 11th film capitalizes on a horrible tragedy, I think this movie treats the subject with utmost sensitivity and respect; my thought coming out of the theater held true with what I felt going in: this is an important piece of cinema. While difficult to watch at times, I am glad that I saw it. I don't want to give away any spoilers but one scene in particular affected me very much, as a reminder that regardless of race or religion we are all human, and there are certain commonalities we all share in that.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Powerfully Done and Excellent Film-making,"One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.

You can not help but become drawn into the film and it has an emotional impact.Hollywood needs to take note - this is how to make a powerful movie about a historical event. No one really cares about your political take on an event - draw us into the event, make us feel we are there and you will have a blockbuster.Well worth the money to see in a theater - which I haven't said about a movie in about 2 years.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Powerful, masterful filmmaking.","United 93 is rarely mentioned when great cinema of the last few years is talked about. It isn't hard to see why. Films of this nature that are based on incredibly large disasters can always be criticized for different aspects. This is a very vulnerable subject, and a film like this can very easily step into melodramatic or overwrought fare. Which is why United 93 works so well. It doesn't.Technically, the film's cinematography captures the tension and sadness of such a day perfectly because it allows for a more realistic connection. There is where trouble could brew. If a film like this was shot in a very stylized manner, or even in a way that people would say resembles a regular film, well of course it will get complaints. It is very difficult for the audience to separate a film from the event it is based on, especially the event that is he single worst day the United States ever had. United 93 never wants to make it a regular film though. It isn't emotionally-manipulative either. It carefully captures the events and reactions to that day. Not only are the sections inside the plane gripping, but the ones outside as well. Not once did I question any shot or scene. But then again, we have to remember the tragic event it is based on, and memories come flooding by.I am giving the only perfect score of 2006 to United 93. It definitely is hard to watch and to grasp, but it isn't a completely melodramatic affair (uhm, Titanic... although to be fair that one is merely fiction in its central plot) and it definitely is engaging and completely gripping. Also to note the music score, which is only used softly at times and for the most part the lack of it allows us to be absorbed into the reality better. As a stand-alone film it is fantastic as well, even with perhaps imagined events.",,Anonymous,History
Sold less tickets than the revolting RV,"It is a sad day when United 93 sold less tickets than true garbage RV (which was another self hating America's attack on itself.) Flight 93 is not selling very many tickets and shows what a short memory so many people have. This is why I give it only 2 stars because it is not being given the sales by Americans.This men and women were heroes in the truest sense. This film is tough, tight, but very respectful to the people of that monumental day in world history. I have read the Todd Beamer story called Lets Roll which is a great book about one of the passengers who was heard saying ""lets roll"" on a cell phone just before a major incident in the movie. The movie though is about all the passengers and also covers other events of that day. Also, I took my 11 year old to see it and I believe she was old enough for the film. There was a little swearing and the violence fit in to the story. Certainly a parent could have their kids look away during a few moments of violence if they wanted too but I did not need to.This film is extremely important and should be seen by everyone. Lets start taking kids to the right films. She remembered 911 and she was only 7 at that time. Now she understands it far more. By the way her best friends are Arab and this movie is not anti Arab but it is clearly anti terrorist. It does portray passengers as heroes which they truly were.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Staggering and sensitive piece of work,"Paul Greengrass's bold dramatisation of the horrific events of September 11th 2001 was one of the biggest risks taken in cinema in the first few years of 21st century. The importance of the event was undeniable, but the emotions which it had naturally aroused in those personally involved in the story and the vast majority of the world's public made this subject incredibly delicate. However, with this film, Greengrass met the many challenges that came with it and established himself as one of the most talented and important filmmakers of the day.The power of this film comes almost entirely from the genius of Greengrass and his script, his style and his execution of a brilliant and sensitive piece of film-making. The film is not a simple docudrama (it is so much more than that). It is a true to the events but takes the licence necessary to turn it in to a story with intelligent perception of what happened but an emotional heart which makes this very difficult subject as gripping and moving as it deserves and needs to be. Bravely, however, this film takes on the subject of the hijackers without reducing them to inhuman psychopaths but portrays them as misguided human beings. Before one of them gets on the doomed flight to carry out their terrible plan, he gets on the phone and simply says ""I love you"" – a touch of genuine class from Greengrass.For Greengrass's sensitive handling of the story he is to be praised (he only proceeded with the film once he had gained the consent of all the families of United 93, who co-operated with his research), but his realisation of the story on screen is the real triumph. His (now much-imitated) hand-held style, which is exhilarating in the ""Bourne"" films, is brilliant here at bringing across the terror and chaos in the air – a style he contrasts with the scenes on the ground were the chaos is viewed through a far more stable and controlled eye. The sheer lack of order and control that occurred on the ground that day with the air-traffic controllers and the federal government is brought home brilliantly, with some of the crucial real life figures re-enacting what happened that day.All of this would still have been rather pointless had it not been for the power of the story being told. The courage of the passengers is incredibly powerful and a testament to the human spirit which seemed so absent that day. The final part of the film in which the fight back happens is a stupendous bit of cinema. Moving and haunting it is an absolutely perfect ending to an absolutely brilliant bit of film which left me (and still leaves me) speechless, with chills running up and down my spine.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Powerful Film About True Heros,"Much criticism has been lodged against the makers of ""United 93"" saying the film is too recent to document the horrors of 9/11 and that it is exploitive of the passengers aboard that doomed flight. Having seen the movie, I can say nothing could be further from the truth. In less than an hour those passengers had to overcome confusion, fear and shock in order to attempt to take back control of their plane. This film is a tribute to those passengers, and an important testament to human courage and the will to survive.Filmed in a cinema verities style, the first two thirds of the movie concentrates on the air traffic controllers and the military as they struggle to come to terms with what is occurring aboard several aircraft, and what they might do to avoid further casualties as the events unfold. One of the main strengths of ""United 93"" is that it makes these events more human, and avoids laying blame in regards to what was an unprecedented and chaotic situation.Interspersed throughout these scenes are the happenings aboard flight 93. The movie doesn't provide us with back stories about the passengers and yet we come to understand and identify with them as we witness the horrific incidents that occur. The movie shows the struggle in the cockpit, and the murders of some of the crew, but it doesn't exploit them close ups, rather it simply films what is believed to have happened.The last thirty minutes of the movie is devoted entirely to the passengers and their fight to take back control. It is during this last half where the movie takes a brilliant turn with direction, acting, editing and music all merging together to make for powerful and gut wrenching conclusion. It is also during this half that we see the passengers making phone calls to their love ones in an intense montage as they express their love, their emotions, and their resolve to stand up for themselves. It is raw, it is hard to watch, and yet it is beautiful to see.The criticisms that I have are that I think there was too much hand held camera work in the control room scenes. I did feel a little nauseous at points as my eyes tried to focus. I also am not sure how true some of the events are that movie documents towards the end (there seems to be a little artistic license), but these are very minor criticisms. Overall, I think this movie is one of the best directed films I've seen since ""Requiem for a Dream"".I can understand people not wanting to see this movie. It's not easy to sit through, but for those who can, I do believe they will come away feeling moved, and oddly a little more optimistic about life and the events of 9/11.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Powerful, moving, and all too real","The adjective ""painful"" is one that often gets bandied about in movie reviews, particularly when the film is a turkey. Paul Greengrass' United 93, which tells the story of the Sept. 11 flight which crashed into a farmer's field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, is the furthest thing from a turkey, and yet it's painful to watch.Greengrass brings a cinema verite approach toward the subject, eschewing name actors in favor of unknowns  using a real flight crew and electing to have key individuals from the FAA play themselves. There are no individual heroes in this film, just ordinary folk. There's no Harrison Ford scaling through the underbelly of the plane looking to kick terrorist butt. Just average folks who, via cell and cabin phone links to loved ones on the ground, discover the fate of the three flights that preceded them and, concluding their fate, decided to act collectively to seize back the plane.Played out in real time, it's a testimony to Greengrass' skilled film-making that the audience ends up finding welcome breaks from the mounting tension aboard United 93 when the director intersperses the events unfolding on the plane with scenes of carnage from the twin towers.From the first frame, as we see the terrorists preparing themselves for their fate in their hotel room, to scenes of mundane, family-oriented preflight conversation from the flight crew, to the ubiquitous chatter of the passengers clearing security and stowing their luggage aboard the plane, a mounting sense of doom begins to grow as we watch everyone involved on their journey to certain death. And with it, mounting sadness over how the passengers almost pulled it off.Some will argue that it's too soon for a film like this. The incident too fresh in people's minds. And they would be right, which is why United 93 is not a film for everyone. Each individual must make their own call as to whether or not they want to see this film. For me, the film was a cinematic parallel to John McCrae's famous poem written in the heat of battle during World War I:""We are the Dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved, and now we lie, In Flanders fields.""Whether you choose to see United 93 or not, the greater tragedy would be to pretend it never happened.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A film pulling apart the tragedy of 9/11.I'll promise everyone that there will be films to come about 9/11 trying to overachieve Unite 93, and they will fail miserably.This film is quite impressive considering the obstacles the film had to take to make it.

A fitting tribute,"If the date September 11, 2001 means anything to you then you probably already know the story of United Flight 93. Of the four planes hijacked by terrorists on that day this was the only one that didn't reach its target.I was sceptical about this film since the mere thought of a Hollywood dramatization of the horrific events of 9/11 seemed almost disrespectful. For an example of the type of thing I half-expected, see (or, better yet, don't see) the Michael Bay debacle ""Pearl Harbor"". Thankfully, Paul Greengrass keeps the film from becoming a victim of Hollywood hokum.The cast is made up of unknowns, which I feel was the right choice since the absence of familiar faces adds a touch of realism. Despite being without any 'stars' the acting is in no way below par, though. In fact, if you look at the closing credits you'll note that a lot of the ground personnel were portrayed by the real people.I don't know how close the events in the film match what really happened but I must say that Greengrass's script is mostly (mostly, mind you) devoid of the typical 'improvements' to fact that screenwriters are so fond of. At its best, the film is effective enough to evoke some of the horror felt at watching the events as they unfolded nearly a decade ago.I'm not usually a big fan of Greengrass's directorial style but I'd have to say that he did an excellent job here. The direction & editing (the sources of the film's only two Oscar nominations) enforce a cinéma vérité approach that was really the only 'right' way to do this movie. The score is unobtrusive as well while still contributing to the mood of the movie.In the end, ""United 93"" is an impressive film and a fitting testament to the heroism of those who risked, and ultimately gave, their lives with the end result that who knows how many other lives were spared.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Respectfully made, realistically executed, powerfully emotional","Unflinching in it's realism, United 93 comes as close as possible to recreating the real time drama that unfolded on 9/11, using the one failed terrorist plot as a focal point. While we may never know the particulars of that mysterious day, and can quite reasonably argue that perhaps the events unfolded in an entirely different way then what was portrayed, one can certainly not fault the humble and passionate filming of Paul Greengrass, as he relentlessly parlays all of the ""facts"" as we have come to know them into an amazing piece of pseudo documenting. Painstaking detail is given to the inept bureaucratic formalities that kept the good guys from pursuing the quickest course of just action, starting with the brilliantly plotted introduction of the 1st plane crash via air traffic control. From then on out, the chaos that continued to multiply on that frightful day is offered amazing counterpoint with the quiet, intuitive struggles that went on over Pennsylvania on United 93. While the action is certainly intense, the majority of time on board is spent simply being with these individual characters, but due to the quick edits and frantic nature, not long enough to gain any real connection with. However, the focus on environment rather then individual characters does tend to immerse the viewer into this unprecedented experience that much more effectively. Certain ""patriots"" who immediately play the exploitation card as a reason to boycott anything creatively done in the name of September 11th, should first at least check out the DVD extra's, which elegantly details the entire flight's families considering, accepting, and eventually embracing the idea of what this particular movie was to be all about. In the climactic throngs of unity, emotional truths massively outweigh whatever grudges anyone could seemingly muster for this must see, as the year's most powerful final scene reminds us in all that is good with humanity, and it's offspring, the arts.",8.0,Anonymous,History

""United 93"" tells the gut-wrenching true story of the brave passengers on United Flight 93, and their desperate and selfless act to stop the terrorists on-board from crashing the plane into the capital building.The beauty of the film is that it does not make any controversial statements about the vent. Nor does it try to spin the story for its own purposes. It simply tells a true story of bravery against all odds. There is no exploitation in the film, nor is there any action simply for the sake of entertainment. Paul Greengrass simply puts forth the story as if we were there on-board or there on the ground. There's no mention of Osama Bin Laden or Iran and Afghanistan. Greengrass doesn't manipulate the characters for his own purposes. He simply shows them for who they truly were: people.

"Its well made, but it left me feeling empty","The story, as best as we can tell, of what happened on Flight 93 which crashed on September 11 2001 when the passengers attempted to fight back against the hijackers of the plane.This is an extremely well made and well acted film. Its a film that pretty much puts you into the plane on 911. Its emotional and heart breaking. As a docudrama of what may have happened its a great film.The problem for me was that I walked out of the film feeling extremely empty. Why have the film makers chosen to retell and re-speculate as to what exactly happened on the plane yet again? There have been the how many documentaries and at least one TV movie that covered the same ground. The film makers here have added nothing new except a big screen and big sound. The film essentially covers the moments before the flight and the flight itself and only puts the events in the confines of that narrow time period on that day, which for me added nothing new about anyone or anything. I stopped caring about twenty minutes in and simply braced myself for the body blows that were going to be coming.I don't see the point of telling this story yet again. Actually the only reason for me is purely exploitive, its like those nasty made for TV movies about horrible tragedies that seem to be made just to make you watch and be upset. This isn't to say its a bad movie, its not, its just a completely unnecessary one since it doesn't add anything to what we know or have learned from the other versions of the story. What bothers me is that there have been so many re-tellings now that the effect or ""shock and awe"" is beginning to wear off. How many more will there be before we simply shrug and go ""oh thats nice"" dismissively?I don't think I can really recommend this film to anyone other than those who don't know the story of what happened on 911. Granted that recommendation comes with a warning about the emotional pain this movie will probably cause you. If you've seen anything on this flight you may want to skip it, it will add nothing to what you already know, and it will only end up making you feel bad, something you can do on your own by thinking back to that fateful day.",5.0,Anonymous,History

I think the movie actually takes place in real time. The story takes place in the 111 minutes that the movie runs. I was also impressed by the number of people that play themselves in the film. The actors are all unknowns and take a backseat to the story. The film is more than just a memorial to a group of folks who decided to do something in the face of terror.

An unobtrusive and genuinely moving account of the events of 9/11,"Where to begin. Well maybe i should start by saying that this is one of the best films i've seen recently- the type where you feel paralysed in your seat for a few minutes afterwards.What makes the entire film such a masterpiece is its continual understatement from start to finish, and its belief that the audience will notice its subtleties and nuances without being fed them on a plate. Why? I can only conclude that it is down to British writer/director Paul Greengrass. There is no Hollywood finesse, misplaced patriotism, or need for a dollar generating superstar to play the the lead role.The film is no more than a snapshot of time, and viewers aren't ever manipulated into an opinion. Those that call this film a piece of 'propaganda' are quite simply wrong. 'http://www.dictionary.com' defines propaganda as 'information, ideas, or rumours deliberately spread widely to help or harm a person, group, movement, institution, nation, etc'. I'm unable to see how this manages to apply to United 93. The film never passes judgement on Islam, America, the characters in the film or anybody else for that matter. As far as i can see, those on this website who have written negative reviews of this film are unable to face up to the fact that America did make a few blunders on 9/11. The film does justice to the good that the nation did do, but it is unashamed of presenting the facts.For those desperately searching for a reason as to why this film was made, it is not supposed to show us a new version of events. It is supposed to be a story that can be applied to all aspects of life. It is supposed to reiterate morals, and, to an extent, try to explain to many the reasons that the attacks happened in the first place.There are some truly beautiful moments in the film. When the plane first takes off, and we just catch a glimse of the very tops of the twin towers, or when both the hijackers and the passengers are praying, both to God but in two different languages, for example. These moments leave you thinking afterwards, and give the film depth and longevity.From a theatrical point of view- the film could be described as Brectian in style. The audience are always watching from a distance, and do not become emotionally connected to the characters. By doing this, they are left with the facts, and forced to make their own conclusions.There is so much more to say about this film- the informal but atmospheric style, or the excellent writing that makes the film feel like a piece of live action. But there is only so much that one can say, and i can only firmly encourage you to see this unobtrusive, understated, but truly remarkable piece of film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
It really got to me,"When I first heard of this film being released. I was completely against it. Not because I didn't think a film like this should be made, but because I felt that it was too soon. I have always felt that the purpose of telling a story like this is to pass it on to the next generation. Last night I went down to the Tribeca Film Festival. After getting shut out of the film I had intended to see, I decided to give this one a try. I was so moving and so tastefully done, I felt like I was reliving that horrific morning. I recommend everyone in the country to see this film so that we can remind our generation not only of the tragedies of September 11th, but also of the triumphs as well. There is a reason why we call ourselves the ""Home of the Brave.""A DAMN GOOD REASON!!!Keith",8.0,Anonymous,History
A modern classic !,"I never fancied this film as there is such an overwhelming sense of inevitability about the ending that I felt it would be a depressing chore.However I am so glad that I watched it. It is filmed very much in a documentary style that totally engrosses from the beginning. You know what is going to happen but you want something to change it, a proper search by airport security, the plane to be grounded in lieu of the other attacks etc.The film is genius in that it builds tension from the opening frames and never lets you go. The acting was superb all round and it really humanised the tragedy and the confusion of the day. You are transported to the back of that plane as a passenger and find yourself searching for a solution to the mayhem around you.Amazingly, the film is uplifting in the final frames and finishes just a the right moment. It is already a cinematic classic and a wonderful tribute to all the lost lives that day.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"""If I get out of this I'm quitting tomorrow.""","When the first previews of ""United 93"" hit the theaters earlier this year, the feedback from the audience was pretty mixed. A common phrase used when taking about the upcoming disaster film was ""too soon"".But in order to achieve the dramatical power the film pursues, it was crucial to release the film precisely now: almost five years have passed, but the unfortunate date still remains in our memories and therefore helps the film accomplish it's emotional drive.The film's helmer, Paul Greengrass, has been making a name for himself for some time now, but he didn't exactly pop up until 2002 when his political drama/thriller about the Irish strike-turned-to-massacre, ""Bloody Sunday"", was released. In 2004 he directed a great sequel to ""The Bourne Identity"", called ""The Bourne Supremacy"". These two films give the viewer a good sense of his style of directing: very realistic, raw and not too dramatized. He really let's the images speak for themselves.And now he has made quite possibly one of this year's most emotionally challenging films. It begins with a scene from a hotel room: a man that you will immediately see as one of the terrorists, praying. This is a key element when thinking about the terrorists and their motives: religion is definitely displayed as the soul motive for their acts.After this we are witnessing the soon-to-be-hijackers arrive to the airport, go through security and finally board the plane. At the same time we see the other passengers getting ready for the flight, talking with each other and on the phone. You really feel like you're just witnessing actual events in a very documentary way instead of the usual Hollywood-style. The biggest factor in achieving this is the fact that all of the actors are relatively unknown especially outside TV. They really come out as just ordinary people on the edge of an enormous tragedy: and they all do a fantastic job.The film goes through all the key moments of that day, from the first hijack speculations to the World Trade Center and Pentagon being hit. It is basically divided into two parts: there's the plane and its own atmosphere that is eventually being disturbed by violence, and there are the air traffic control towers throughout the east coast. The totally closed environment of the plane offers a great contrast to the control towers, where all the information and chaos is almost overwhelming, as opposed to the plane, where no one has any idea what's happening around them. The camera doesn't wander off these two sets for one second, so all the events are being witnessed through these two environments, especially the air-traffic towers. And this is just one more thing that strengthens the documentary style of the film.The story that Paul Greengrass has created is naturally fictional since no one really knows what happened on the ""fourth plane"". However he has managed to gather a story that, created from the bits and pieces that are known about the flight, seems just about right and believable. Greengrass doesn't rush with the story, but let's it slowly evolve to the final climax that literally leaves the audience's mouths wide open. The ending scene is displayed with such beautiful minimalism and realism, that there hasn't been anything quite like it in cinema before. It crushes the viewer with it's total hopelessness, even though the course of the events has been clear to the viewer from the start. The only downside of the story is that some might find the air traffic control sequences (that the film has quite a lot of) a bit dull as opposed to the plane-sequences. However this is highly individual and perhaps depends mainly on simply how strongly you feel about this whole event.Paul Greengrass has truly created a masterpiece: a film that will have it's place in history for it's unbelievably realistic approach on a tragedy, that shocked an entire nation. True, the film owes much of it's emotional power to the fact that the events are still clear in our minds, but I don't see how it couldn't also work as an independent film, separated from the WTC-tragedy.ps. This was originally written for school, and therefore has some pretty obvious stuff mentioned that I wouldn't normally point out.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"A Movie To Never Forget, Just Like The Event Itself.","I was only 3 when 9/11 happend, so when people talk about where they were the day that happend, all I can say is: ""In preschool, proabaly."" I have no recollection of the news or anything like that. In fact, I would hear people talk about how terrible it was and I didn't get why it upset people so deeply.It wasn't until 7th grade, 11 years after the tradegy, that I understood. We watched a documentary on it in History class, and I was stunned at the live footage of what happened.Years later, I heard about United 93 from one of my favorite film critics, James Berardinelli. He reserves his perfect score of 4 out of 4 stars for ""truly special"" movies, and United 93 is one of the select few movies that he awarded this honor to. In his books, 4 stars is equivalent to a ""must see"" movie.I agree, United 93 should be seen, but by those who can handle it. It's an uneasy experience, and those deeply connected to the event should see this with caution. (For example, if a loved one of yours died on a 9/11 plane, think twice before seeing this movie.)To briefly summarize United 93, I could just say it's about 9/11, and for some people that may be enough, but that doesn't really do the film justice.For those who know their history, 2 planes hit the World Trade Center and another one hit The Pentagon. United 93 was a plane that almost hit The WTC, but the passengers and flight attendants worked together to try to stop it. They are, of course, unsuccessful, but they don't die in vain and they succeed in not crashing into the designated building.The movie is kind of broken into 2 halves. The movie is 110 minutes long, and the last 10 are the credits. At the one hour mark, the terrorists attack United 93.The previous hour is admittedly not as engaging. Not that it's bad, on the contrary, but there's a ton of airplane jargon and exposition to get us to United 93's specfic attack. Let's put it this way, when I dwell on the movie, the 2nd half will stick with me more than the first.Even when there are no attacks, the movie is intense. I remember trying to see it a few months ago but the anxiety of the events to come made me have to turn it off. I could have done the same last night, but that seemed disrespectful to the people involved- let me turn off this event that these victims couldn't!The attacks are not the only intense moments of the movie. Sometimes simple dialouge is haunting on it's own. In one key example, before take-off, we hear that the flight should take 5.5 hours. I thought: Either this is going to end sooner, or the terriosts are going to hold the flight longer than that.In this same scene, the passengers are advised to listen to the safety precautions, whether they are regular flyers or not. The shots show us that the passengers are reading magazines, listening to music through headphones, anything but listening to the annoucemnets!When it's clear to the passengers that they are going to crash, regardless of what they do, they use the plane phones and their cell phones to call loved ones, and we get a sequence of ""I love you"" and ""Tell the kids that I love them."" In another scene, the terriosts pray to Allah(though they speak in Arabic without subtitles) and simultaneously we hear passengers pray The Lord's Prayer, bit by bit. This even gives us empathy for the terriosts. While they are doing an inhumane thing, we are reminded that they are human as well.Paul Greengrass, the writer and director, does a brilliant job shooting the movie. He films it in such a way that it appears that we are on the plane as well. It's almost like we are in danger of crashing also. This is another tactic that works as well on the viewing level.The film ends with the crash, some black, and title cards that give us some concluding remarks of the event-followed by a dedication to those who died on 9/11. Even the start of the credits: ""Written and Directed by Paul Greengrass"", is haunting-given the silence following the crash.While United 93 is not the easiest movie to sit through(I paused it a couple of times to recollect myself), it is probably one of the most essiental movies in recent years, if not ever. Again, if you can handle it, you should see it. We see those magnets or signs that say: ""9/11: Never Forget."" After seeing United 93, how could you?",10.0,Anonymous,History
Painful,"I thought it was extremely well put together. Very subdued. Not very dramatic, which made it feel very real. I felt like I was living what these people went through, and I felt so scared throughout the movie. I wanted to turn it off many times. If you are someone like me, who lost loved ones in tragedy, and live in constant fear of that happening again, I don't recommend it. It just was very painful. For general viewing public, I think this story was much more real and worth your time than movies like World Trace Centre. I also liked how they didn't try to make the terrorists look like evil people. It just showed what happened in very dry manner. I think that was great, because I don't think it's that these people were evil, but there is something wrong with the world where we create so much hate.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Realistic and emotional,"Yes, we don't know exactly what happened on United 93... that is true. What we do have is the accounts of the loved ones of those on the plane. They relayed their stories of the contacts they made with those on board. We also know of the last minute transitions made aboard the plane indicating that those aboard did fight back... with that in mind, the events displayed in this film are as close to factual as we will ever come.With that put of the way, the execution, pacing, and pure intensity of the film brings true honor to those aboard this flight. Even though it's been 18 years since the events in of 9/11, and well over a decade since this film came out, it still hold incredible power. In fact, rarely have I seen a film which grows in its quality like United 93 does. As we grow more and more separate from the horrible events of that day, this film's quality grows, too. Though not entirely accurate, as we will never truly know of the events which took place aboard the plane from minute to minute, this film will grow in importance as time wears on. In 100 years, I truly hope this film deserves the accolades of deserves. It tastefully brings honor to those aboard flight 93 while also bringing is right into the flight control centers. It shows the best of humanity in the worst of circumstances. And it does so in a tasteful, respectful, and honorable way. Everyone needs to see this film once. Even if they dont like it, everyone needs to see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The First Victory in the War on Terror,"I have been disappointed in cinema lately until this came out. This movie grabbed me by the throat and ringed me out like a sponge. This film, not only paid tremendous respect to the families of these great warriors, but at the same time touched every subject that film can grab.Of all the branches of Cinema, only the animation branch has made me cry....until this movie. This movie was the only film that made me sit down and think about what it would be like to call my parents for the last time knowing I was about to die. The fight scenes are realistic, there was no Hollywood style stunts or lines, this was real and this was life Hollywood was left out as it should be. Having watched this film four times, I still work my way into a frenzy when the passengers realize what's going on and attack the terrorists! These were the real American heroes going all the way back to the first war America ever fought. Who beat the British? Not military people but Farmers! Who destroyed the terrorists? Not the military, but passengers! This movie also dabbed into the spiritual warfare. Throughout the film the terrorists pray to Allah and at the end the passengers pray to Jesus. It was a war between the nation based on the the teachings of Jesus vs the the nation based on the teachings of Mohammad and we won thanks to the courageous efforts of these passengers!10/10!!

Non-creative?,"Before the movie got released I thought it was too early to make a 9/11 movie. So I didn't expect the movie to be great before I watched the movie. When I expect nothing, I should get something great, right?But no! I didn't get something great.It was a long and boring movie. Mainly it happens in the flight centrals in different cities where they talk about what happened to the planes. Why should the people find dialogs in the flight centrals interesting?Though the boring movie, I found TWO scenes ONLY thats good for me. These scenes was the scene of the second airplane-crash on WTC and the scene of the end. Or else nothing good or interesting in the movie.Just by the end of the movie, it appears 4-5 pages with text that tells what happened on the day. I was like ""what the..."". Movie is meant to be visual, not like a book.I gotta say something to the director. Get more visual! And by the word ""visual"", I didn't mean stuff like action, shooting or explosion. But September 11th happened too much to make a movie in flight central and United 93 only.

Incredibly tense,"Without any doubt one of the best films of 2006, possibly *the* best American film, ""United 93"" really demonstrates the true power of the film medium. It grabs your attention immediately and it's impossible not to emerge yourself in the true story about the passengers on United Airlines' flight 93 on September 11, 2001 - despite the fact that you know how the story is going to end. It's quasi-documentary style fits the story like a glove, and remarkably, director Greengrass avoids every single opportunity to get into Hollywood-isms (single male heroics, presidential bullshit, 101 strings) - this is a terribly frightening film but it's also a very respectful depiction of the people who was on board that plane. Keeping everything in balance (another important example is the low-key but very effective score by John Powell), throwing in some strong critique towards the US authorities (who admittedly were in a state of shock and utter confusion during the 9/11 events), Greengrass succeeds in telling a story you already know in a way that really absorbs you.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Very important movie, a must watch","United 93 is a 2006 movie written and directed by the amazingly talented British director Paul Greengrass (the Bourne movies). It tells the story of the ill fated flight United Airlines 93 travelling from Boston to San Francisco on September 11, 2021. The plane is hijacked by 4 terrorists intent on crashing it into the Capitol. It focuses on the air traffic controllers in Boston and New York, the military, the Federal Aviation Administration and of course the crew, passengers and hijackers.It's made in a convincing documentary style and takes place in real time. The actors are all pretty much unknown (several people portray themselves in the film), most of the dialogue was apparently improvised in rehearsal and the cramped sets did result in some actual cast injuries. This all combines with the chaos and confusion of the unfolding events and the flawless editing, to create a true masterpiece. It is suspenseful, confronting, heartbreaking and important.",10.0,Anonymous,History
too much ATC chatter,"About two thirds of the film is unexciting chatter from air traffic control staff trying to find out what's happening, followed by a short free for all on the plane. OK, that's because all that chatter was recorded, and no-one really knows the detail of what happened on united 93, but it doesn't make for riveting cinema. In reality it was a tragic episode, and it should have been left that way. I mean it should have been left as a real event, a news item at the time. The film is not a significant work of art, as for example Picasso's Guernica was.We could have done with more background about the lives of the passengers and aircrew in the weeks before the flight took off. As it is, they are rather two dimensional characters. Ironically, it is easier to understand the context in which the hijackers are operating, because of all that has been written about them (and people like them) since.",3.0,Anonymous,History

They portray it so honorable, and not with all the Hollywood special effects. Though the movie is sad, it serves a purpose and it definitely makes sense.

'An affecting and fitting tribute to the unlikely heroes who lost their lives',"Are we as Americans ready to see the events of 9/11 re-enacted up on the screens of our local theaters? It's a touchy subject and the makers of 'United 93' are aware of this fact. They walk a delicate tightrope between offending or paying homage to those who lost their lives that fateful day.With Paul Greengrass at the helm, United 93 manages to become the best film it can be despite, as I said, touchy subject matter. With the guide of Greengrass' steady hand we are thrusted into the date: September 11, 2001. The film proceeds in real time.The first half is set in different air traffic control towers across the U.S. They frantically try to stabilize the situation at hand(the hijacking of multiple planes). We know nothing about the people talking except the few details that are mentioned the very day of the hijackings. Greengrass' screenplay never resorts to 'Airport' stereotypes. I am extremely happy to report that no one in this film is slapped and ordered to get a hold of themselves.The second is just as affecting and sustains the same narrative and technical structure of the first half. Now, we are moved on to United Flight 93. Again, we know very little about the passengers. We hear bits of conversations. It feels as if we are waiting in the airport terminal with these people who are essentially complete strangers. Luckily, Greengrass makes sure no passenger on the plane is pilot who no longer flies yet somehow must face his fears and (dramatic pause) FLY THE PLANE!!! The franticness with which the passengers band together has a rather vivid feel to it.The conclusion is fairly obvious from the word ""go"". However, Greengrass presents such a compelling portrait we are lost and are near the edge of our seats to view the climax.That brings us to the climax, which is an oddity. It is simultaneously uplifting and sobering.Uplifting and Sobering.Much like the film.The #3 film of 2006.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Harrowing But Necessary Film,"Although incredibly difficult to watch, this is absolutely Paul Greengrass' masterpiece. It's the most non-Hollywood, non-sensationalized film you will ever see. This allows the movie to garner a tremendous sense of respect from myself despite the context of profiting off of tragedy. It's clear the individuals producing this movie were incredibly conscientious of this as well. What we have here is a very simplistic, low budget film with absolutely no dramatization of the events of that day. Despite this, it's still one of the most harrowing films I have ever watched. Although you go into it knowing the entire plot as well as the outcome; there was no shortage of tears well past the final frame.The events of that day need no help from Hollywood. Greengrass knew that and many frames of the film are simply that of news footage from that fateful day. This helps drive the impact of the reality of that day even further.The cinematography is simplistic and brilliant. There isn't a wasted shot and each frame is as impactful as the last. The filmmakers utilized actual footage from that day in lieu of dramatized special effects, which again, only help make the film more impactful.The casting of the film makes it all the more haunting. For the vast majority of the audience; they will have never seen any of the actors and actresses prior to seeing this film. The same goes for post-viewing of these film ""strangers"". It is eerily similar to the reality of this story for most Americans. We know what they did. But we never knew them. The only casting related issue I have (which prevented me from giving this film a perfect rating) was the casting of a real-world FAA official that played the role of himself. This just left a bad taste in my mouth. However, it has absolutely no impact on the overall quality of the film.Although difficult, I believe every American has a duty to watch this film. It's a beautifully simplistic film that tells a tragic story with no frills. It will haunt you long after the credits roll. Film making at it's finest.",9.0,Anonymous,History

I thought it was too soon for this kind of reflection, but I don't feel that way having seen the film. It is so well done that it seems appropriate.The acting is subdued and quite good. I expected more information on who these people were and who they were talking to on the phone, however, in the long run it didn't matter.Please see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing,"Typically, I have steered clear of 9/11 films, though I have viewed a couple of related feature-length productions. ""United 93"" is actually one of the best films I have seen all this year (2006). This is not a dramatization of 9/11 as much as it is a factual recount. The writing, the performances and the cinematography all place you in the hot seat of NY ATC Command; in chief positions of FAA; in command at NORAD; and in the tense passenger seat of United Flight 93. The experience becomes personal as the events of that day are realistically installed into the looming fate of the last flight to go down on 9/11. There are no frivolous set-ups; no character-building is placed into the story and no personal backgrounds are highlighted. With no peripheral plots, this film is a true look at what did happen.I anxiously anticipate the next fact-based film by Paul Greengrass.Joe Dougherty Los Angeles, CA DocORock@comcast.net",10.0,Anonymous,History

Literally a revelation,"This movie is a stunning achievement. I sat down half way through the movie and began to watch with only moderate interest at first. What I realize only now is how brilliant the portrayal of these events is. The story of 9/11 speaks for itself and Paul Greengrass honors it in the deepest sense possible by adding...NOTHING. A cast of unknown and relatively unknown actors delivers a collection of some of the most compelling and honest performances I have ever seen. I cannot speak enough about how realistic the portrayals looked, sounded and felt throughout the film. When the movie suddenly ended after the most intense crescendo, I sat blank for a moment. And then I literally burst into tears. 9/11 has placed an indelible mark on the consciousness of the World and this movie represents the ultimate retelling of one facet of that story.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Powerful and moving,"I was very leery about seeing this film, as the prospect of reliving the events of 9/11 did not particularly appeal to me. Thus I waited nearly two years, and it was only the very positive reviews I kept seeing that finally convinced me to view the film.Like most Americans, I clearly remember the events of that day...and the way it affected me for years afterwards. It was the plight of the planes themselves that had the biggest impact on me, probably due to the fact that I traveled all the time for work and had taken some of those very flights. In the months that followed, as I tried to process the tragedy of what had occurred, I often pictured myself in the same situation and wonder how I would have reacted. I remember flying just a week after 9/11, and not being particularly nervous, but with a heightened awareness and suspicion of all that was around me--scrutinizing passengers, looking for emergency exits, watching the bathroom.As I watched the movie unfold, I was struck by the ""realness"" of the scenes and the acting. United 93 so accurately captures the experience of airline travel that it could be a documentary. In a sense it allowed me to see the events I had imagined in my head so many times before played out in front of me on the screen.All the action takes place in ""real time,"" and there are no back-stories, or judgments, or manufactured drama. You know nothing more about the people on the plane than you would know about your fellow passengers traveling on a flight today. This choice allows you to experience the events from a first hand perspective (at least it did for me).We all know what happens to the flight, so there is no suspense about the outcome. I did not find myself ""routing for the good guys"" or feeling that sense of pumped-up macho bravado that I often experience with action films. Though I did experience a slew of different emotions, I think for most of the movie I was in shock--just as I was on that very day six years ago.At the end of the movie I cried, when the epilogue began to roll. Not because of what I read on the screen (I already knew the information), but because I think I finally could allow myself to let go and start to feel what I just seen and relived. I will need more time to fully process the impact the movie had on me, but I will agree with others that thus far it has been an extremely cathartic experience.It is hard to judge this film on strictly technical merit because of the power of its content. I will say that the acting, direction, camera work, and editing are excellent. They absolutely get it right. You could say that the story development could have been more complex and compelling, but I think if you are trying to judge this movie on that level you are totally missing the point. The narrative is what it is: how things unfolded on September 11th (or our understanding of them).This in not a film about politics, patriotism, or national pride. It is just a story of what happened on one particular day in September of 2001 and the people involved and some of the lives it touched. The biggest impact of the movie is dependent upon you; and that depends on how 9/11 affected you, and how you've dealt with it since. For me this movie was a very positive experience, and one that I believe has helped me heal just a little bit more from the wounds of the tragedy on that day.",9.0,Anonymous,History

This movie could be about 10 times better,"OK OK, I saw this movie in the theater a while ago and I just got around to spreading my opinions.I'd probably give this a 3/10There are many reasons that this movie was lackluster at best.1. It didn't tell any backgrounds of the people that died. If this was dedicated to the people who died on the flight, then it should have told about them. I know the director was trying to get the message across that these people were just random, every day people, but I already know that. What I want to know is who these people were. I want to know why they didn't deserve their fate. I wanted to cry at the end, but tears never came.2. The movie was not done well. They had a pretty large budget for this movie, but used small amounts of it... They pretty much needed one set: The Plane. Aside from the end, there were no cool shots (the way it ends was cool)3. But the ending could have been better. I know it is clichéd, but if they could have fit a few news reports in, it would have made it more moving I think.4. The crowd I saw it with sucked... Everyone started cheering when they slit the terrorist's throat. If you clapped when this happened, you are probably going to hell. It is still a person.5. It is too soon to make money off the tragedy. That is just lame... they should have let people in for free or like give 100% of the money made to charities or something. That's as bad as Mel capitalizing off of Christ in The Passion.6. Everyone knew what was going to happen, and it is meaningless to see. The director doesn't do anything different or really cool... and since the plot is already given, it is like watching a special news report, but a little more interesting.If you haven't seen it, I'd suggest just downloading it off bit torrent to not pay corporations to make a meaningless film to make money off a tragedy.I pray to god that WTC is better.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Intense ... and not conflicted,"I'm 45 years old. I served 8 years in the military. I've seen lots of things I don't want to see again. This was the most intense movie I have ever seen. It took me about an hour to fully disconnect from it.The lack of big-name actors makes a very realistic movie even more real. The use of the pseudo-hand-held style of filming (it has a name that escapes me for the moment) is a bit distracting at first and something I've never liked. But I got used to it after a while, and it actually works to its best advantage inside the plane.We don't know everything that really happened on that flight. But we know enough to piece things together. We know the passengers did fight back.The terrorists were not conflicted about their actions. And the passengers were not conflicted about who their enemy was.Remember 9/11. And remember United 93.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A successfully realistic portrayal of that autumn day,"I saw this film and was left speechless as the ending credits came upon the screen. This film captures that horrific day with startling realism to go along with believable characters, sharp editing and non-stop emotion.Paul Greengrass makes a tremendous and successful attempt at capturing this country's most shocking day. He stays away from big name actors and instead provides his viewers with something they will never forget. We focus on what we should focus on: the people, the locations, and the emotion. He shows nothing of Al Quaeda, Afghanistan, or Iraq. We are merely placed in the presence of what those people had to endure, something no one should ever have to go through.This film is a tremendous work of art that transcends most films of its kind. There is no reason for someone to avoid this film because of what they think it may entail. It does not exploit the events of that tragic day; it embraces the unfortunate who were involved and in the right way.See this film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Greatest Film Ever Made. period,"This is the single best movie i have ever seen. It's so harrowing and suspenseful and realistic. The fear and confusion those people went through must have been terrifying but they managed to overcome their fear and unite to try and retake their plane against a faceless enemy. On a day we suffered unthinkable disaster and devastating defeat, Flight 93 brought consolation to many people as it shows that even against all odds we can stand together in the face of danger. This film should be preserved as a reminder that we are all capable of self sacrifice and heroism when we are at our most vulnerable. Paul Greengrass has created a masterpiece that will stand the test of time as a stirring tribute to all those who died on 9/11.RIP Flight 93 passengers and crew.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Disturbingly real!,I like a lot of people had heard a lot about this movie.But I wanted to make up my own mind so I rented it out last night.I found it to be a powerful but compelling version of events that happened on a day no one will ever forget.Yes it is disturbing but only because you're not watching some bogus storyline Hollywood made up-it's disturbing because it's real and it happened but that only makes it even harder to watch but you simply cannot tear your eyes away from the screen for one second because you know that the human adversity almost overcome such evil.I can't say I enjoyed this movie but I think it is a story which had to be told-if only for us to learn from the mistakes of that day..........,8.0,Anonymous,History

Gut-wrenching,"Greengrass has made all the right choices in this production, unknown actors, naturalistic, a documentary feel, understated use of music (allthough he could have done without a score completely). The result is an absolutely riveting, edge of your seat movie. The editing is superb, and you get a gut-wrenching feel for the passengers and their reality inside that plane that day. The whole event seems to be played out in real-time, and also include the actual traffic control chief who was working that day. A very authentic feel throughout, despite my minor objection about using a music score. The extras on the DVD, which include the actors meeting the families of the victims, are deeply moving.

A moving and impressive tribute to the heroes on Flight 93,"Admittedly, the United 93 was hard to watch at times due to realism of the story. However, this tribute to those aboard the doomed Flight 93 was both moving and impressive. I am thankful to have seen a movie that portrays the heroes and evildoers as they truly were, instead of some politically correct film that tries to create sympathy for the terrorists and/or vilify the heroes. The flight passengers who fought back were truly the heroes, and the terrorists were truly the villains. In addition to being a moving tribute to the 9/11 heroes, I believe United 93 has the potential to go down in history as one of the most patriotic docudrama movies of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Fact Is,"NO ONE knows what happened on board the subject flight. We can only infer. We know only the outcome. If you keep THIS fact in view you need not worry over how good a documentary this film appears or pretends to be.Paul Greengrass did not set out to make a documentary. He said so from the outset. He says so in his DVD commentary. If others call into question his detachment, perspective, integrity or sense of timing I commend him for his skill, tact and honesty. Was he opportunistic? If you make a film it had better be about something you care very much about. No matter what he had aimed for he had to know the end result would be viewed through the lenses of many others who knew what they thought had happened. Faced with this challenge his direction, writing and editing earned their professional recognition.It's hard enough to move within a Boeing 757 when it's powered down on the tarmac. And try sitting through a transcontinental flight on a clear day with your eyes volitionally closed from takeoff to landing. For these reasons Barry Ackroyd's photography deserves special praise. It strives to emulate what you would see and the way you would see it if you were on board.The sound and sound editing are spot on. John Powell's minimalist musical score is sobering and complements the film perfectly, for without the stream of images I find the score unlistenable.Before James Cameron's film, when I'd heard a Broadway stage musical version of the Titanic disaster was in production, I'd thought the effort at best supremely callous. That view changed when I later learned the cast members, without prompting or compensation, visited the families and descendants of the victims each was cast to portray as well as the very few remaining survivors and their families. The results showed on the stage. It appears a very similar approach was taken here.Should the film have been released first-run as a commercial feature let alone made so soon? It's been seven years as of this writing. We are at times blessed with short memories and faulty recollections. The events were thrust upon us. The film is not, for one either views it or doesn't. That should always be a choice resorted to and exercised with gratitude.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Complete Work of Fiction,"I give this movie three stars presuming it is a complete work of fiction. We certainly have no idea what happened on the aircraft, if in fact United 93 did crash on September 11, 2001.Why 3 stars? One for a clean sound track. A second for in focus camera work. A third for, dare I say, making me laugh from time to time, by way of peculiar actor performances which were amusing.This movie seems to rely completely upon patriotic support and a desire to honour the people who perished on September 11, 2001. If one takes that out of the viewing experience, and views it as a work of fiction, it remains a bad movie as it doesn't provide the audience with a compelling story. All of the characters are under developed. There is no story line upon which to focus our attention. Worse yet, what is happening over the course of the movie feels arbitrary and without motivation.Example: the four hijackers do not appear to be working together in a well co-ordinated manner. They are presented more as bumbling fools who seem unlikely to have been successful, especially with their very peculiar behaviour prior to launching the hijack attack.The way the passengers were portrayed was, in my opinion, insulting. Four men begin an attack and not one of the passengers close to them responds instictively with a counter attack and the reasoning presented (to not counter attack) is very thin.Over all this is a movie to watch to learn how NOT to make a movie.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Highly Recommended,"Paul Greengrass has created a stunner. Dramatizing the events of 9/11 was an obvious challenge. First he had to justify the making of the movie against widespread opinions that it was uncomfortably soon to let film makers dramatize the story. Add to that the fact that the audience had presumably seen, heard, talked about and read every conceivable angle of 9/11. Greengrass avoids the slight impediments deftly. United 93 tells an almost real-time account of the story, from individual points of view, bringing each experience out so vividly and intimately that we relive it along with the characters. It does not attempt to glorify the heroes of the fateful flight, neither does it load the story with Hollywood-style colors and dramatics. It just tells the story in a real and grounded manner, and sets it in a palpable world where bad things happen to good people, and man stands up to protect himself and fight oppression. And that's what makes it all work out so well.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Faithful,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*This is a reconstruction of the events, which happened on 9/11 focusing on what happened on Untied Airlines 93 flight. The film enjoy the fact that director & writer Paul Greengrass has decided to approach this film in a style that is combined of documentary and feature film. This approach is support with the fact he has used some of the real people playing themselves in the film. This lend the film some of its strongest point. One can only imagine how difficult it was for these people to re-live the events of 9/11. Anther point of strength is the use of unfamiliar faces to play the passengers and crew of United 93. This decision has kept the story in focus and you are not distract by the actors. The story is faithful to the facts(as much as possible) and there is no trying in making it end differently than it has been, while in the course of the film you wish it has been different(in real, not in the film).

This film works very fast, as if you were actually there, on the plane, just going about your business and ready to reach your destination. When the eventual moments of terror and agony begin, not only can you feel everyone's pain, suffering, fear and desperation, you feel the same. Paul Greengrass is one of today's best directors at all of this. The fact that the families of those who perished had a lot of input into the film really helped and made it as real as possible.

Taut drama that's as brilliant as it is disturbing,"There could hardly be a film more distressing to watch than Paul Greengrass' ""United 93,"" the writer-director's cinematic cogitation on the grim events that unfolded in perhaps the bleakest day in America's history. It certainly isn't an easy subject for Greengrass to tackle, or for any filmmaker for that matter, especially considering the post-9/11 sensibilities of the audience. But the director of such films as ""Bloody Sunday"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" delivers the story of that day in a no-nonsense manner giving the film its brilliance, yet ironically also making it hard to bear.On September 11, 2001, four American commercial planes were hijacked as part of a coordinated terrorist attacks upon the United States. Two hit the World Trade Center in New York, and one hit the Pentagon. The fourth one, the United 93, crashed in southwest Pennsylvania, over a hundred miles off the target - Washington, D.C. - as passengers and members of the flight crew tried to fight the hijackers and regain control of the plane. Of course, in the end no one survived and it's what makes the film all the more harrowing.Greengrass' direction is virtually flawless. He paces the film in a way where amidst the constancy and familiarity prior to the events is a building of trepidation when the horrific events start to progress as soon as the cards are laid and all bets are off. It's heartbreaking as it develops, yet still holds our attention even if we already know the tragic fate that awaits. The director's trademark hand-held camera-work underlines the confusion and chaos that reverberates throughout the film, which is shot in a pseudo-documentary style. As he stages each act, he not only lets us see what happens; he brings us there and then. The scant use of music and the fluidity in presenting scenes from FAA headquarters, air traffic control in various cities, and from United 93 itself, contribute to the atmosphere enveloped in paranoia.The script has also taken the right approach in presenting its characters, for in matters such as this, ambiguity is more effective than providing absolutism. Greengrass generates sympathy for the doomed airplane passengers without a mawkishly sentimental effect. We know just enough of these people for them to remain ordinary in spite of the circumstance. Of course the decision to cast mostly unknown actors help in creating the tension. The cast members' subtle performance are genuinely gripping and as we delve into their characters' despondency, we sympathize with them. We feel their fears. By the time the end abruptly comes, so do we realize how fleeting life was for these people.""United 93"" is an excellent film. It is more of the director's somber rumination of the events rather than a solid popcorn entertainment because this is definitely not an escapist fare. Neither will it be easy for a lot of viewers to warm up to the movie. It presents brutal facts only a willing mind can take but ultimately rewards those who see it with a provocative and rewarding experience.",10.0,Anonymous,History
United 93,This movie should be seen by everyone who believes that the war against terror is stupid or that George Bush lied.

Cinematic Catharsis,"Put your politics aside and see this film for what it is, an excellent example of film-making. Perhaps the best in recent memory. Gripping, thrilling, heart-wrenching. The film will have you glued to your seat. It makes you relive the horror and emotions of the human tragedy we all lived through 5 years ago. Some would ask, why bother? Is it too soon? Experiencing the events of that day once again reminds us of why we must at all costs defend ourselves against this cancer that's infected our lives. I don't care about conspiracies or anyone's agenda, the reality is this DID happen and will happen again if we are not vigilant. And for you Bush haters out there, he's not portrayed in the best light since no one at NORAD could find him or the VP for orders to shoot down hijacked aircraft. Greengrass is a master of the art!

Sobering Look at Real Heros,"I added this film to my video service queue with trepidation because I tend to shy away from films that exploit real-life tragedies, but it got such good reviews during the time it was in the theaters that I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad that I did because it is truly a rewarding experience.To me, the events of 9/11 continue to be somewhat surreal in my mind. I sometimes have to remind myself that I, indeed, did see those two towers collapsing on television and think that just a few miles from my home, the Pentagon was laid waste by another attack. But the event of that day that has always been paramount in my mind was what took place in that airplane somewhere above Pennsylvania. That horrible day was surely not lacking in heroes, but those few ordinary people on that plane became, probably, the most extraordinary heroes of the day.The film is extremely well done in that it does not contain any of those standard Hollywood elements normally associated with films of this sort. Instead, the viewer is given a close-up view of the events in the plane, at aviation tracking stations, and at military headquarters. As a viewer, you feel you are actually there observing the events as they happen.The depiction of the hijackers reminded me of Paradise Now in that they are not evil devils but simply young men who have been brainwashed in order to carry out a mission of evil and destruction.For those who rent or by the DVD there is a worthwhile documentary on the disc. It is an hour long and shows some of the actors in the film meeting the family members of the people they portrayed. What the family members have to say, and their lives since the time of the event are engrossing.This film is very worthwhile viewing that gives further insight into an historical event that will be discussed and debated for many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,History

On 9/11 the first battle in the war on terrorism was fought aboard United 93 by ordinary people who took extraordinary measures to prevent further destruction to our nation. This movie does an amazing job of portraying their heroism with respect and honor.By my observation, there was not a dry eye in the theater and the feelings of shock and sorrow were palpable.

"United 93 is unbelievably real, not to mention inexplicably and heart wrenchingly powerful.  It's a film not just for a nation, but for the entire world","Stunned. That describes two days in my life. One: September 11, 2001. Two: the day I saw this film, based on the tragic events of September 11, 2001. Paul Greengrass's 'United 93' is not only the most powerful and real film I've ever seen, it's one that will stick with me for an eternity. I think it should be a requirement that every person should watch this film, because it will change your outlook on life, much like Schindler's List should have done. The main sticking point here is that the film is indescribably real. The actors are complete unknowns. The only actor you MAY have seen is Peter Hermann, the frequent guest star of 'Law & Order: SVU' and husband to Mariska Hargitay. What adds to the realism as well is that no passenger is the star of the film. Actually, the passengers don't say anything until they plan a revolt on the terrorists. The first half of the film is mainly from the point of view of the terrorists and air traffic controllers in Boston, New York, and Newark. Every character, including the terrorists are played brilliantly, and I believe it was the realism getting under the actors' skin. The climactic showdown between the passengers and terrorists doesn't take place until the end. But back to the realism. As the viewer, you will feel so in tune with the story, that when the culminating scene rolls around, you'll actually want to jump into the screen and join the fight against the terrorists yourself. You know what happens before you watch the film, but you will speak aloud at the end, just hoping the passengers can hold on for one more second, one more minute, one more breath. I absolutely am entranced by the direction here. It is so perfect and well-done that Greengrass should be honored with some awards this year, if not a Best Director nomination at the Oscars. But, knowing how respectful this film is, Greengrass probably wouldn't accept an award for this film. The entire world will be moved by this, not just Americans. There is no stupid patriotic garbage clichés in the film. I am prepared to bet that the words United States are not said in the film. The only time American is said is referring to American Airlines. That's it. Anyone with a heart will be moved to tears in this film, and it is the only film since Schindler's List that I've seen with a group of people to get a standing ovation. Not Crash. Not Mystic River. Not Shakespeare in Love. Not Lord of the Rings. United 93. United's story of heroism, realism, and unwavering power and depth is an indescribable experience that must be seen to understand the magnitude of this film. Easily 2006's best film.

I highly encourage you to see this film!The fact that the cast is composed of people who are virtually unknown allows you to focus on the characters portrayed instead of the actors and their individual performances.All aspects of the film are excellent.

Flight 93 A Disappointment,"I was very disappointed in this version of Flight 93. It is jumbled and confusing at best. There is no comparison to this version and the A&E Version. Do yourself a favor and watch the A&E Version, it is 10 times better. The A&E version covers more of the personal lives of the passengers and the loved ones they called from the plane, the Universal version barely touches on it. Half the time I could not understand what people were saying on the plane, it was too mixed up and confusing. Maybe that was the way it was on the plane - who knows, but as a movie it stinks this way. I am sure that the family members of those on that flight are disappointed as well. If I were a family member of any of those on Flight 93, I would think the A&E version does more justice to those who sacrificed their lives.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"To Watch This Movie Is to Be Met Head-On BY the Miserable Anarchic Actuality of September 11, 2001.","The reason Paul Greengrass's intensely unsettling docudrama is so potent and effective is because it does not play as if to know that any time has gone by since any given second of the unspeakable events of 9/11. The entire film, every facet, exists on screen in the most immediately present tense. The dialogue, which is generally improvised based on rehearsals Greengrass held with the cast, is anchored in interviews in the flesh between actors and families of those they play. Hardly of the passengers in the film are alluded to in any manner by their names, a touch gives light to the alliance rather than any distinct gallantry.This momentous cultural, artistic and historical achievement makes a measured endeavor to steer clear of not only name actors, but actors with whom we are really even very facially familiar. In a sense, the film takes more chances as a narrative than it does as a dramatization of 9/11, because it makes no effort to depict the passengers or terrorists with exposition or backstory. In most movies about ill-fated journeys, we meet a handful significant characters like the selfish businessman, the quiet, surprisingly heroic man with a skeleton in the closet. What we discern about the passengers on United 93 is just what we would know if we had been on the plane and sitting near them: Nil save for one or two fine points of physical appearance.Screen time aboard the plane interchange with time spent inside the National Air Traffic Control Center, airport towers, air traffic stations, and a military room. Here, too, there are no histories, but experts thinking and communicating in the immediate. Numerous of them played by the actual people involved, they have an unprecedented expertise of jargon and courses of action. When the controllers see the second plane crash into the World Trade Center, they flinch with disbelief and terror, and that instant in the film feels as real as it felt to me on that universally eery day, no matter how normal it was in terms of my own routine and everyone else's in spite of all the cataclysmic new chapter of history building in the background of the day.This gut-wrenching masterpiece of tension is supremely overpowering because it gives a picture of all of its characters as just anyone shut into an inevitable advance toward the end. Oscar-nominated British director Greengrass's disturbing docudrama includes no politics. No speculation. No private dialogue between anyone on screen, and so of course there aren't any jingoistic pro-America monologues. The film pathologically avoids the big picture.We watch United 93 as the passengers and crew get on the plane and it gets ready to depart. Very soon, the first plane is engulfed by the ominous flames in the World Trade Center. Living in that flash, we share the bewilderment of the air traffic controllers. There is a thin silhouette of assorted procedures that come into focus, deliberately without expansion or analysis. I am one of the many who see this film and recall the now infamous scene in Fahrenheit 9/11 in which George W. Bush sat inert in a kindergarten classroom in Florida for seven minutes after being informed of the attack. We see the reality that he's informed, so what was he waiting for? This, a taut, spare dissolution of its events' primordial cognizance does not reach for that understanding, because the people on the screen do not have the vista of retrospection.The third act of the film is some of the most harrowing cinema I've experienced since the first time I saw Requiem For a Dream years ago, as the last twenty minutes concentrates on the despair aboard United 93, when the hijackers have taken over, hack flight attendants, slay the pilots and ostensibly have a bomb one click away, the passengers erratically overcome their fear and attack of mortality and bind to rush their victimizers, all having been reconstructed from the 33 telephone calls from the plane and from the cockpit voice recorder. Greengrass is bursting to be as truthful and precise as possible. There is no fabricated showboating, no dramatized arguments among the passengers, no specific champions. The passengers are a horrified assembly of strangers. Even while these courageous passengers spend their last minutes fighting tooth and nail, we know nothing about them, none of the information about them which we can of course look up now. It could be us on the plane, petrified and alarmed.",9.0,Anonymous,History

The original story is horribly tragic with a touch of hope, yet this movie does a terrible job of really conveying this.

Three of the four hijacked planes reached their target destinations (Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington D.C.) in which everybody talks more about the Twin Towers as if they were history majors and forget about the rest.This movie tells about flight United 93 that didn't reach it's destination thanks to a group of people who stopped the terrorists before reaching their doom.""United 93"" doesn't have any big top actors like Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Samuel L.

The actors here look exactly like ordinary people we wouldn't even bother checking their acting credits; everybody plays the real life heroes in this movie.Paul Greengrass (The Bourne series) directs this movie where it's so realistic, it makes us feel as if we were there. The editing is realistic where it feels like an episode of ""24"" with different cameras showing points of view from the passengers in the doom flight to the traffic control towers to the military.This is the kind of film where you don't have to have an opinion (or express that you could've been there to be a hero) but to shut up and just honor those who at least did something with their lives.",10.0,Anonymous,History
An Excellent Piece of Work!,"On September 11, 2001, four planes were hijacked. One of the planes was the United 93, or Flight 93 in which we see what happened before is crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.This is a great film. It's one of the best films in 2006. One thought I had before seeing this film is that this will be an airplane movie like Red Eye, Flightplan, or Snakes on a Plane. I was wrong. Instead, it shows the point of view on different characters, some who are not on the plane and the rest that are on the flight.This film also shows human spirit and how we work together. There wasn't any main characters but for no-named actors, they were good. This film is thrilling and suspenseful, while some may never see the film because it's ""too soon"".It's not soon. It's a perfect time to see the film and all of you who thinks this film should never be created. It ever reaches the political side. Everyone knows the story and know how it ends but it's still thrilling.The last 30 to 15 minutes are the best. It'll leave you speechless. This film is very intense, heartbreaking, but inspiring. United 93 is an amazing film like World Trade Center, another 9/11 film made in 2006. Both films are worth watching so see United 93.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Powerful real time drama,"United 93 handles a sensitive subject matter extremely well, delivering a powerful, gripping and emotional real time drama.

A respectful account to a tragic event.,"United 93 was the first Hollywood rendition of the unforgettable 911 plane crashes. Thankfully there was no Titanic love story, and no big budget re-enactment of the 911 crashes.Tastefully, Writer/Director Paul Greengrass decided to show three of the plane crashes from the perspective of the control centers. This turned out to be a very interesting, and suspenseful way to present the tragedy. The decisions that had to be made and the actions that weren't being carried out, really revealed the hopelessness of the situation. Although this created suspenseful moments and great anticipation, the same conversations and shaky camera movements for almost an entire hour became a bit tedious.There is no main character in this story. Instead the main character is the body of passengers that boarded United 93. The reactions of the passengers and flight attendants seemed very real. United 93 is made up of all kinds of passengers. Business people. Families. Tourists. The portrayal of those aboard United 93, down to the moments when serious decisions needed to be made concerning the terrorist attack, seemed painfully believable.Greengrass was also successful in making it clear that the terrorists were also human. The terrorists displayed moments of hesitation and fear to commit these acts of terror. Though their actions were undeniably vicious, they were men that would do anything to serve the Lord.My only complaints were that the control room conversations did begin to drag in the beginning, and an ending, or lack thereof could have been improved.There is a great, great rise in the climax and the movie definitely makes an impact. But frankly, it seemed like the movie took the easy way out by using text on the screen to tell the rest of the story rather than presenting it visually. With that great rise in suspense leading to nothing, the movie almost feels incomplete.Overall the movie is a great reminder of how significantly the event affected our lives. Thank God they didn't make it out to be a Shwarzenegger blockbuster or a Pearl Harbor romance. Instead it respectfully told the story of the individuals aboard United 93 who had no choice but to become their own heroes.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Uses plausibility shamelessly,The events of September 11th are tragic. I have watched many movies and documentaries on that sad day but this one by far is the worst.It seems like 80% of the movie is just people yelling at each other and making phone calls.Then the events on the flight are recorded as a counter attack against the hijacker's but I feel like the story is being sold to me as minute by minute accurate storytelling instead of a plausible occurrence of events.The last 15 minutes of quite captivating but I felt weird after thinking that this story was probably completely different from what really happened.,5.0,Anonymous,History
Agonizing docudrama of the fate of the fourth plane hijacked on 9/11,"A taut, saddening, intensely realistic docudrama about the fate of the fourth airliner hijacked on September 11, 2001, the one intended to hit the Capitol in Washington, DC, or so we all imagine, but that crashed instead in the Pennsylvania countryside, killing the crew and all 92 passengers, including the four young Islamic terrorists who had seized the plane. Much of the film depicts the increasingly frantic efforts of civilian air traffic controllers and air force emergency response personnel to first comprehend and then take preventive action on that horrid morning, as the saga of four hijackings, and the destruction that followed, unfolded.These scenes are intercut with others inside the cabin, aboard United flight 93, as terrified passengers and crew try to survive and retake control of the plane. What is underscored so effectively is our nation's shocking lack of preparedness for such an unprecedented attack. Adding to the realism of the film story is the participation of a number of actual personnel (air traffic controllers and military figures) who were involved that terrible day, i.e., playing themselves..

The most moving part of this film is about human nature,"What is the most moving part of this film? Well there are a lot of parts that are moving indeed and different people have their different moments in mind, and for me, this is a great film, and the greatest part is that when the passengers are praying to God, the terrorists are praying too, to their god... This is so amazing... I'm not talking about whose god is the true god or which religion is the true religion; what I am trying to say is the case is people's religions, or beliefs, especially when the chips are down, are truly just what they think or assume they can rely on... When I saw everybody on the plane pray, I laughed, yet I was very clear that it is human nature: you know it probably won't help but as long as you assume there is some hope, you'll still do it, BECAUSE YOU WANNA SUVIVE... Their religious beliefs are what they call upon for help, and it makes no difference if the help is from Christianity or Islam, because it's all just fake hope...",10.0,Anonymous,History
Fiction story,this is a great movie when you think for once this is not a movie base on a true story. The real events is far more different then the reality.

Sympathy and regret from the UK.,"What can you write/type or say about 9/11 that hasn't been said? The film I'm my humble opinion was well portrayed and showed every qualities of the human spirit.From over here in the U.K and we watched the drama unfold that Tues morning we looked on in awe and shock and respect and reverence and wondered what was going through peoples minds that day on those flights and on the grounds.I hoped that Flight 93 gave some of us an insight into this and I thought that every thing was portrayed with sympathy,humility,courage and hope.To us here in the U.K we will stand by your side in the fight against terrorism,as we are use to fighting the oppressors on a daily basis.God Bless the USKeep the faith",8.0,Anonymous,History
I love all movies...except this one.,"I had heard good things about this movie so I decided to check it out. Little did I know that I was about to witness the most boring movie I've ever been unlucky enough to sit through. This movie seems like a documentary in which nothing really interesting ever happens.If you are a fan of action movies, this is not really geared towards you. If you are fascinated by the events of 9/11, this is also not for you. If you want to learn more about what happened that day, or want to see what it was like through the eyes of people on the plane, I still wouldn't recommend this movie. Some people may disagree with this but I (a huge fan of all types of movies) just didn't find any part of this movie thrilling.In closing, I'd like to say that I've had more fun riding airplanes than watching other people riding airplanes in this failure of a documentary.

Exceptionally well-crafted depiction of one of the most difficult topics to film,"This film shows all the hallmarks of an exceptional film-maker. Told in documentary style using real people rather than actors in important scenes it has the air of reality which is so often lacking in dramas, real or imagined. The stark facts regarding the inability of the military to act are so shocking that I would very unhappy to allow the US military to defend my country, The UK.The fact that CNN was the main conduit for news of what was happening on the ground is also a sad reflection of the sorry state the USA finds itself.The camera-work and editing are just about the nearest you will get to perfection in this area, and all those concerned on the technical side should be applauded.

One Word....WOW!!,"When I saw this advertised I was a little bit surprised at how soon after the tragedy but after seeing it I'm glad it was released now! Ill start off and get my rant out the way that the acting in the air control centres was pretty awful and very amateur at best. But I was still absolutely engrossed.Whilst this incident is still photographic in most peoples mind this film really hits some emotions. I can say this is the best film I've ever seen at recreating an actual incident and one of the best films I've ever seen. I'm glad this team portrayed these people the way they did as true heroes, because this is what they were & still are. The movie starts a little slow but after seeing the whole film you can see this is building a fascinating film, the information at the start I felt was all important in holding this together. But when the film starts to focus more & more on Flight 93 I could not blink, it was amazing acting on the plane, and I don't often well up in films, I actually never had but I did in this. Knowing this all actually happened (or very close to) and the people phoning their families was an extremely powerful scene. The lady or man i can't remember who offers her phone to a younger girl to ring her family is brilliant and is a reminder of what humans are all like at heart and how we should be more often, all helping one another. The thing I found amazing is although we know these poor peoples tragic fate I found myself willing them on to try and take over the cockpit and staying alive and not till the very last scene did I really believe it. For me I think the families who this film directly affects should feel honoured their loved ones were represented in this way, for who they really were true heroes (I don't mean to offend anyone if you don't feel this way) but after some testing times with Western and Eastern culture this film really emphasises this small Al-Queda is a minority and although you fell hatred for the ones who performed the hijackings and were behind them it made me realise this is a small number of people.Being British I'm a big fan of British directing, I love the honesty and grittiness they usually generate and this was no exception, the directing was top notch! The moods, thoughts, emotions and hopes were all captured perfectly and just gave this film everything you'd want from one especially recreating actual events. This film for me has to be best picture at next years Oscars, albeit they are a while away and with many films to come out that is a bold statement but it deserves massive recognition! And Paul Greengrass deserves at least a nomination for directing, simply amazing! You may think this review is not weighted so heavily towards the films actual content but believe me once you've watched it and I highly recommend you do, you'll see what I'm on about! Simply a stunning motion picture and deserves full marks & R.I.P to all those who lost their lives in 9/11 except the hijackers!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Paul Greengrass Creates the Impossible: Capturing the Horror of 9/11,"Though it has been over five years since the devastation of 9/11 the memory lives on, a day no one will ever forget - nor should we. This viewer waited until UNITED 93 was released on DVD to view it, thinking that watching the film in the security of the home might make it less threatening. But what Paul Greengrass has created in reconstructing those few hours in 2001 that changed the psyche of the world forever is an achievement in courage, in understatement, and in respect - as fine a memorial as any that has been planned.In using not easily recognizable but very fine actors in all of the roles, Greengrass allows his script to unfold gradually in the relaxed atmosphere of the usual air flight plans and minor delays, conversations heard by all of us as we await a take off of a plane. Concurrently he shows the four men, whose mission is to destroy 'the oppressors', prepare, pray, dress, and board. Then he moves into the planning rooms of air control, lets us feel the insidious progression of the hijacked planes, shows us the military response and paralysis, places us back in United 93, and unfolds the recognition by the crew and passengers of the danger in which they have been placed. The acts of heroism seem like natural permutations of human response all the way to the final abrupt dark screen when the plane goes down.The degree of tension Greengrass and his superlative cast and crew convey is almost intolerable: magnify that times infinity power and we have a glimpse of what it was like to be in United Flight 93 on September 11, 2001. The film is a remarkable achievement and is destined to become a hallmark for artistic representation of historic events. Highly Recommended on every level. Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Absorbing, intense, and appropriately moving","Clearly comes across as a story that ought to and had to be told and never too soon... a reenactment that drives home the impact and meaning of that tragic day.In no wise is it exploitative nor lurid entertainment, but satisfactorily an artful, tasteful, apt and appropriate tribute to the human spirit in the face of fear, terror and misguided fanaticism.The brilliant editing, with its insightful cross-cutting from various POVs is superb and the pacing, suspense and intensity at times is unnerving. The heart-pounding progression toward inexorable fate renders a harrowing experience that culminates in a moving (lump-in-throat, tear-inspiring) close.I cannot urge enough that those that will resist or refuse to allow themselves to go through it, should shrug away the misgivings opposed to it and give the episode its due. You must not look away--Lest we forget...or let it sink into postscript-of-history status. The filmmakers have done the entire thing proud and have rendered a true homage to those who lost their lives heroically. A fine work indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Overwhelming,"Paul Greengrass and company took a unique approach to this film. The viewer feels as if she or he was right there in the room as the action progressed. As the roomful of air traffic controllers realize that one of the WTC towers has been hit, there is a stunned disbelief, followed by the logical statement that that gaping hole couldn't have been made by a Cessna (as was first reported...a small private plane has hit the WTC). Then, when the second plane hit, stunned silence, followed by yelling to keep moving...there is work to be done. What would have helped me would have been a small clock in the bottom of the screen...it was difficult to keep focused on where in time we were, and I was a bit confused at the end (minor spoiler) because it says that the military was not notified that 93 had been hijacked until 4 min. after it crashed, but the air traffic controllers were talking about it well before it crashed in the film. That said, this felt so real! There was no melodrama. Many of the air traffic controllers portrayed themselves; the actors portraying the passengers (and hijackers) were unknowns. The passengers look like real people...they were all sizes and ages (except, thank the Lord, no children!!) and some were without makeup, just as in real life. What a stunning movie. I wept several times as the enormity of how much our lives changed that day hit me over and over again. I recommend it. It's not easy to watch, but worth seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Proud to be an American,I bought the movie with some hesitation. I found out that the actors had met with the real-life family members and that the families of the heroes had already seen the movie. A friend of mine said that she thought the military got bashed unnecessarily. Unfortunately the reality of that horrible day 5 years ago is we were ALL unprepared and maybe a little too confident that the days of hijacking planes were long over. As far as the government? I Love our country and am proud to be an American but facts are facts and what happened that day is accurately portrayed in United 93. My heart goes out to the loved ones of Americans that perished on Sept 11. Let us only pray that we do not ever again become so comfortable to think that we as a nation are safe or protected from this terrorism.,,Anonymous,History
Shaky camera and a work of fiction,"Bad writing, Bad acting and full of clichés. The shaky cameras to create suspense creates an utterly nauseating experience.

One of the best movies ever made,"I saw Paul Greengrass's ""Bloody Sunday"" and was very impressed. However when a movie that dealt with America's most horrible day was going to be directed by him, I got very nervous. I didn't feel that he was the best to direct this movie. Oliver Stone or Steven Spielberg seemed like better candidates instead. However when Greengrass's documentary style of filming was used it created such an unsettling mood, which only added to this great drama. The acting was incredible and actually, some of the actors in this film were actually portraying themselves on 9/11. I can't begin to visualize how much pre-planning Greengrass had for this movie. Every shot is perfect. This movie, might be a modern classic. I feel it has its moments that rival films as dramatic as Schindler's List. In short, this movie is destined to become a classic, and is one of the best movies ever made. This movie will be a definite Oscar contender this year and if it is not, I will be very disappointed. I also sense a definite Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Ensemble for this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Heartbreaking film-making,"This is a powerful film. The absence of big names and the minimal use of music to suggest how we should feel ensures that this film portrays the events of that horrible day in the respectful manner which they deserve. I kept on trying not to think of the passengers as characters but as real people. However, there is some degree to which the characters have become larger than life and their story so familiar that there is catharsis in watching them unite to fight against fate. Director Paul Greengrass was the right man for the job. He got approval for his picture from many families of the victims of flight 93 and I think rightfully so.It was heartbreaking to watch the segment tracking the characters before the hijacking. As viewers, we know what happens and one hopes against hope that somehow the inevitable will be avoided. This obviously does not happen and it's heartbreaking. We watch the passengers preparing in the relatively unperturbed way in which we all approached flying before 9/11. One wants to yell at the screen for the characters to leave, to fight, to avoid what we know will happen. I felt a great deal of sympathy for the air traffic controllers who didn't know that they were working on the day of the worst terrorist attack in US history. I also felt a lot of sympathy for the military personnel who were trying to secure approval for scrambled planes to mobilize in order to head off a hijacking.The film is based on documented information detailing what happened on that fateful flight. I found the section of the film in which family members made final phone calls to their families extraordinarily moving. Again, the hindsight which allows us to know that indeed these passengers would not leave the plane alive is what makes this section so moving. Greengrass never plays up the emotional gravity of anything, even at points at which a lesser film-maker might have succumbed to the temptation to secure a greater emotional pay-off from a directing decision, such as when Todd Beamer said ""let's roll"". This is to his credit. Greengrass offers no comment on the actions of the authorities, the passengers, or the terrorists. I don't think any movie could pay tribute to the events which transpired on United flight 93 than this film.One final note. If you have the DVD release of this film, watching the 45 minute featurette Greengrass made discussing with United 93 family members the making of this movie, including the cathartic meetings between family members and the actors who would portray their lost loved ones, is must-see viewing as we see family members several years after the tragedy, dealing with grief which never goes away.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Surprising,"The movie was not what I expected at all. It was not political, religious over over-the-top in any way. I love that many FAA and military personnel played themselves. It was also a nice touch that one of the flight attendants and the captain were also United. I also appreciated that there were no 'big name' actors to take away from the story. These people all looked like the people you would see on an airplane any day of the week. All in all, a very touching but not overly dramatic portrayal. It did however remind me for a time of how angry I was right after September 11th. How soon we forget and move onto something else.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Sometimes the person who has to ""do something"" is you.","A legitimate tribute to common citizens, who, when faced with the realization that death may be imminent, chose to fight back and possibly save others while they are at it.The characters are not known actors. Each person was asked to read a bio of their character so they might be able to do a better job of being them, not simply being a good actor. Some of the flight controllers and military people are the real people who did those jobs on 9/11. It dramatically increases the realism.The movie is real time. The characters don't know anything more than they did at that time on 9/11. No patriotic speeches. No over the top action heroes. No ultimate evil villains. Real people. Muslim terrorists doing their deed, not cartoon characters. Scared people doing the best they can in a terrible situation.You owe it to yourself to see this movie. It will make you ask yourself if you would have had the courage to act as these common citizens did.

Both sensitive and stunning,"Although there have already been a couple of television programmes on the seismic events of 11 September 2001, this is the first feature film. There will, of course, be many more, but it is difficult to imagine a more stunning and impactful one. In a sense, therefore, it is ironic that the writer and director Paul Greengrass is British and that most of the filming was done at the Pinewood studio just outside London, using the inside of a salvaged Boeing 757.The style adopted by Greengrass so effectively is an utterly sparse one. The hand-held camera work and rapid cutting give the whole thing the feel of a documentary. There is no preamble or scene-setting, no flash-backs, no explanations, no star actors. Instead the narrative is simply linear and the confusion self-evident. The research as to events and dialogue is meticulous, members of the aircrew are played by actual stewardesses and pilots, and many of the air traffic controllers and military personnel are playing themselves.There may be no analysis or commentary but many of the messages are stark. The nearest F-16 was 100 miles away and the military knew nothing of the airliner's fate until four minutes after it struck the ground. Neither the President nor the Vice-President was in contact. They and we were totally unprepared for an event of this nature.Since United Airlines flight 93 took off from Newark airport 40 minutes later than scheduled, the passengers were able to learn of the suicide missions carried out by the three other sets of hijackers. Since the time to elapse from the first jet slamming into the World Trade Center to the crashing of United 93 was around an hour, this film is able to adopt a real-time narrative.The tension, as the 40 passengers gradually understand more about their dilemma and plan a last-ditch effort to gain control of the plane, is almost unbearable. The mobile calls to relatives and friends makes one's eyes well with tears. The timing and nature of the final shot - the actual crash and a totally black scene - is stunning.This impressive and compelling work was produced in full co-operation with the relatives of the passengers and it is a fitting tribute to them, their bravery and their sacrifice.",,Anonymous,History
A complete abomination of tedium and pretension.,The cinematography is simply horrendous. The camera is continuously panning back and forth and going in and out of focus while capturing such illuminating images as someone's back. The director's attempt at realism (excuse me this is not a documentary!) comes off like a cheap transparently contrived TV show for dullards. After five minutes of this immensely annoying tactic I was getting bored. I soon began to fast forward and everywhere I stopped it was more of the same inane drivel. Back and forth the camera goes with sophomoric pretense that is astounding in its ability to bore and annoy. The acting is just as bad. The only value this piece of garbage has is capitalizing on the subject matter to lure people unfortunate enough to pay to see it. I glanced at the ratings here before I rented this abortion and after watching this mess I can not believe anyone would rate it above 6. Hype! Hype! Hype!,2.0,Anonymous,History
Reality as Art,"Sometimes an artist tries to interpret reality, heighten it, and massage it in order to make clearer its real meaning. But there are some rare realities that are so overpowering that they stand alone and any massaging can only diminish it. Unfortunately, in most cases, the ego of the artist cannot resist the imperative to try and clarify further. The director in this film has successfully resisted these natural artistic impulses, and in so doing allowed the art of reality to manifest itself, as itself. That in itself signals an artist of a higher caliber.This is not a documentary. It is indeed an artistic film.Beyond art, the reality of the events are straightforward. There are no political statements, no indictments, no rah-rah. We see failure and we see heroism in equal parts as normal people react to crisis. We see competence and incompetence hand in hand. We decisions made and responsibility taken in one moment, to be negated by incompetence or a flawed system in the next.This film shows us a massive system designed to protect us break down in chaos and confusion. Those elements of the system capable of processing information and those capable of acting were not in concert. The weakest link of the chain doomed the system.The only group who was able to process information effectively and act on it were normal Americans just like us. The North American Air Defense Command, the FAA, the Air Force, the CIA, the FBI were unable to save thousands of lives and an irreplaceable American landmark of the soul on that day despite the desire and will to do so. But Tom Burnett and the others on Flight 93 were.If there is a message in this film. Perhaps that is it. Each of us may be required to take action some day in defense of ourselves, and something larger than ourselves. We are America, not some far away FAA official, not a local police agency, not some Colonel in some underground command center, not a Department full of federal employees.We must take our survival, and that of our country, into our own hands from time to time.

It made me cry so many times.,"wow, this is a serious tear-jerking film. When I write comments, I usually don't like to admit that I cried while watching. I just watched the movie called ""Joyeux Noel"" last night, it made cry. This one made me cry several times. I cried so hard when one woman talked to someone on the phone that she loved them.The story seems very authentic. They didn't waste any time on any unnecessary minor things. Even though this film is 111 minutes long, I don't think that it is long at all. At the last part, it only focused on what happened on that flight. Instead, they could have added a few more scenes from those control centers during or after the crash. I was afraid that this film might have too many brutal, violent scenes, such as blood flying everywhere, etc. It was not too bloody.While watching, I wondered if they would show the US president. If they use an actor, it could certainly ruin the moment, because he is not the real one. It didn't happen.One big problem for this film is its cinematography. That is the reason why I gave it to a 9 instead of a 10. Sometimes, it was obvious that the cameraperson was holding the camera by hand, so the scenes were shaking, or they focused on the subject too closely, or the camera was moving too fast as if someone was running from one place to another to give us the view. It made me feel dizzy. After all, this is a big screen film, not a home-made video. They want to give the audiences the feeling of being right there, they did not have to sacrifice the big screen images.It would be nice if they list all the names and occupations of all the people aboard on that plane, maybe even those important real people's names when they first appeared. After all, this is not a fiction, it really happened. They can do that in the next release. I was surprised that Ben Sliney was the actual FAA Director of Operations. He did a really good job, very real.I don't know anything about those four actors who portrayed the ""terrorists"" on the plane, hopefully they didn't get any threatens from anyone after this film. They were as real as they can be.In the bonus feature, they only interviewed a few family members which are all Caucasian looking. I don't know if most of the family members had opportunities to meet with the person who acted as their beloved ones. Even though it was also touching, but it seemed to lack of diversity. It is a pity that neither of the pilot's family members were shown, one of the pilot was a black guy who just had a baby not so long ago. There were many other family members who were not included in it. Maybe those family members declined. Probably most of them have already been interviewed by various news medias which I just didn't have a chance to see them all.One interesting note, this film won ""Best British Film"" by the Empire Awards, UK in 2007.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"A shocking, heartbreaking tribute to the victims of 9/11","2006 was a memorable year for movies, for many reasons. One such reason is the fact that for the first time Hollywood had the guts to tackle a painful subject like 9/11, only five years after that terrible day. While Oliver Stone's World Trade Center was a decent film, it suffered from the occasional ""inspired"" auteur touches, which were meant to add emotional power but actually made the movie more pretentious. United 93, on the other hand, stands out as the better of the two achievements because of its straightforward approach to the events: no contrivances, no hidden messages, no attempt to glamorize the tragedy. Just good old honest storytelling.The film deals with the hijacking of the titular aircraft, the only one, of the four that were taken on September 11, that didn't hit its target. The reason? The passengers and crew, knowing they would probably die anyway, decided to try and stop the terrorists nonetheless, so that they could have at least one chance to see their loved ones again. This part of the story doesn't actually take place until one hour into the movie, as the director Paul Greengrass builds up the suspense by cutting between the plane calmly flying on its designed route, airports suddenly realizing some aircrafts are missing, and the military wondering what's going on. Then the WTC is attacked, panic breaks loose on the ground and in the air and all everyone can do is stand and watch the images of the Twin Towers falling apart, asking in horror how this can be possible. From this point on, the outcome of the events is painfully obvious.United 93 is a gripping, staggering picture. Much of its impact is due to Greengrass's documentary-style direction: the film is shot entirely with hand-held cameras, giving it a more realistic tone; the characters are all portrayed by unknown actors, allowing the audience to connect with all of them, not just one or two ""team leaders""; and, most crucially, the events occur in real time, adding to the nerve-wrecking tension. All these elements contribute in making the movie an almost unbearably intense experience. Such is the power of the film some might even not be able to watch the last five minutes, where the pain and suspense reach their emotionally exhausting climax. We feel for these people because they were the kind we would run into every day. Unlike the firefighters in Oliver Stone's 9/11 film, the plane's passengers didn't deal with potentially lethal situations on a regular basis, and their sacrifice had nothing to do with patriotism: they did it to save their own lives, perfectly aware of the risks and the slim chances to succeed. And while it's sometimes hard to watch, United 93 is a remarkable tribute to their courage.",10.0,Anonymous,History
if there wasn't the prejudice factor,"If you do the math if you take out most of the ""1"" votes (prejudiced) votes the movie gets a rating of 9. Movies are made all the time by Hollywood during events that are destroying the civilized world. We've had 5 years. if anything we didn't come out with a movie soon enough. Its also fact-based and well done as a movie. THIS IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY. Good job on the directors part of keeping the movie going and not have it sag in areas. Thatnk God that their is some patriotism in Hollywood since the liberals in the rest of Hollywood and the media have plenty fun destroying the image of the country and making a huge profit. However when it comes to people displaying courage and self sacrifice of fellow Americans all people believe that its just to stuff their pockets with money. How come we do hear anything about that fat-ass Michael Moore tearing down our country to feed his fat pockets and his fat face.",10.0,Anonymous,History
My Two Cents on United 93 and the Backstory,"This subject must be dealt with. As a nation, we risk being blinded by a kind of PTSD if we cease to function rationally when this subject or the fate of those passengers in particular and their unfathomable decision, is uttered. I don't know if a film, which is generally considered to be the most potent form of communication, is the best way to deal with it.The film is, deliberately or unwittingly, an allegory or microcosm of the Curse of the Modern Age. Great minds have commented that the possibility that the weapons and tools of geniuses can and will ultimately fall into the hands of those with neither the intellectual ability to conceive of them nor the associated responsibility to humanity for their use  is very real and is our greatest enemy. The coupling of ideological fanaticism with this little glitch in the economy of innovation is what made the September 11th attacks possible.The struggle that took place on Flight 93 encapsulates this ugly battle, which, at its heart is man's highest faculties (the use of advanced technology, and understanding of human psychology and fear; the effect of 'blitz' actions) applied in the most base way (fanaticism and anger), to the most humdrum and unsuspecting of subjects. It was a real 'down and dirty' play, a proverbial kick in the balls.And it failed.What most affects me is the failure of the attempt to seize psychological control over the passengers, as was successful on the other flights that day. Clearly, the effect the news of the other attacks would have on their hostages was not something the planners of the hijacking accurately figured into their deliberations, which must have been extensive.This single aspect, that those who would attack a group of hapless travelers had not considered either the depth of their strength, duty, selflessness, courage or humanity  is the chief idea in this sordid matter. It is paramount because we are in a struggle for our humanity, not only in a cultural sense, but within single cultures, single nations, and even single individuals. This struggle between the higher and lower aspects of our species is not exclusive to one gender, race, culture, creed, age or religious persuasion.The highest purpose of any individual or society or species cannot, logically, be realized without freedom, and there is no materially freer (financially, culturally, religiously) country than the United States. 'Live Free or Die'; the dichotomy of freedom-loving people willing to go toe-to-toe with the greatest enemies of freedom, and the incarnation of its own fear is counter-intuitive, but actually makes poetic sense. One reason freedom is so special is because it enables a formidable defense, when provoked, but needn't resign itself to a militaristic or passive disposition by default. Because...what kind of life is that? Attacks upon freedom are attacks upon the self; thus, though freedom may not prevail, it cannot entirely be defeated.I think the terrorist agents in these attacks were behaving like neglected teens, and that the United States has indeed been stingy and somewhat self-righteous with freedom. When I see the human desperation required to enact those attacks, they appear to me as cries for help  and I'm not being dismissive. The main reason is that the perpetrators have no negotiable terms. These were not attacks aimed at a strategic objective, like Pearl Harbor, or which would cease at a defined state of affairs.When human beings resort to terrorism and behave like animals, they have already surrendered their humanity, and we know well what human beings with no humanity are capable of. It is a mistake to sympathize with this behavior. I think the course to take is to recognize the real reasons for such attacks: feeling excluded, disenfranchised. I realize a lot of the rest of the world would say I'm being smug in this analysis, but fear of the good life, a deep-seated inferiority complex, and actually being excluded  manifested as envy  is the only explanation that adds up. Inherently, religion is not a cause; it will always be subject to the host; which is simply our design. A person may resign his personal control or judgment, but this is willing. Religion is like software; it can be uploaded or downloaded into any willing 'carrier' or system. Moreover, aspects of religion may be played-up or played-down. The question is: why are certain people disposed to faiths, and aspects of those faiths, that support other objectives? Ought not we to consider what that seminal, grass-roots ethos is? There are Muslims in America who are law-abiding. There are, too, Christians, in America and abroad, who conceive monstrous plots to kill in the name of their faith. Let's call it what it is: their dressing up their personal needs in something larger, not owning up to a deeper psychological cause. That's all I'm saying.Our Achilles heel is also our secret weapon: freedom enables us to keep our wits and fight smartly; to oppose or reconcile as appropriate - most especially when the unthinking impulse is to destroy. Is there any greater terrestrial power than what I have described? It's giving your humanity a weapon and a flower, and choosing for your enemies when they cannot. I don't see so much of that kind of Kingly power; I don't see us acknowledging what our weaker enemies cannot themselves acknowledge.",,Anonymous,History
True American Heroes,"Following the deadly attacks on America, I twice visited the crash site of Flight 93, going behind the scenes. I wanted to get closer and somehow gain a better understanding of the significance of what happened that day and what it meant.Take a rare, inside look with me and perhaps reflect more deeply into those events and the heroic sacrifices rendered for each one of us by the men and women of Flight 93.January 11th, 2002 was a bitterly cold and blustery day just outside the town limits of Shanksville Pennsylvania. Standing at the temporary memorial site, the frigid air held the flags straight out at attention. With camera in hand, I had to frequently hold it under my arm against my body, so I could cup my ears, trying to provide some warmth and protection from the relentless, snow-laden gale. A road wound back into the trees, beyond an unlocked gate. I could see a cabin and vehicle parked there. Large, bigger than life orange signs stood on each side of the gate, sitting in the field on either side, which read, ""Road Closed."" Plenty of small white no trespassing signs lined the path.With some real misgivings, I drove in and parked in the driveway. The thick evergreen trees made it appear darker outside. The wind had seemingly stopped because of the protection provided by the trees. Fresh snow covered the ground, only blemished by the tire trail that led up the long driveway to the cabin's front entrance. I approached the far door, where footprints in the snow led and knocked on the door. I waited 15 seconds, but no one answered. Deciding not to knock twice, I turned around to leave when the cabin door swung open. A comely man, appearing to be in his 30's, with long, dark brown hair, dressed like a lumberjack, scowled directly at me.""Sorry to interrupt you,"" I said, introducing myself by name. ""I always lock that gate."" He murmured. ""I'm not sure why I didn't lock it this morning, although I should have."" He continued to reject my presence. ""There are 'no trespassing' signs all along that gate"" ""I sincerely apologize for the intrusion."" He paused a moment, ""Accepted."" He said.I explained my interest in writing a patriotic piece about Flight 93. ""Is that the accident site over there?"" I asked. He nodded and stepped outside and kept walking, with me following. ""This isn't actually my house. It's down there"" He pointed through the thick growth of tall, evergreen trees. I said my name again and waited for his response. We shook hands. ""Hi, I'm Barry Hoover."" ""I know I can go down to my property, but I'm not sure if I can take anyone else."" He said, walking towards the structure, with me following step for step. Stooping, he showed me the base of his garage and how it was moved off its foundation from the force of the blast. ""You are at ground zero."" He said, standing back up. ""First, this was a death scene. Then, it was an accident scene. I was not allowed to come back to the house for 12-days."" He said.I realized how much his life had been disrupted. ""I didn't have any clothes, toiletries  nothing  and had to go buy all new things, and borrow."" He explained how he had to live in a hotel. ""I'm sorry you had to go through all that."" I said, empathizing with his ordeal. ""My concerns were for all those families who lost their loved ones"" He said, ""not for me."" Windows were still missing. The doors, originally blown off their hinges had been replaced. The inside was still vulnerable to the wind and rain. The furniture was not salvageable. His house, from top to bottom, had been pelted with bits of aircraft and contents, most of which were gathered up by investigators. Charred, black patches of trees and shrubs dotted the landscape, which were more visible on the second visit, after the snow had melted. ""I'm amazed none of those little fires spread into bigger ones."" He said.There were hundreds of pieces of metal from the aircraft that were no larger than a quarter and wires that still covered the ground like confetti.I turned around and looked out through the glassless window, back towards the crash site with a better sense of the magnitude and force of what had taken place right where I stood and tried to envision the horror of those final imperiling, heroic moments being experienced aboard the aircraft The sacrifices for freedom of those brave heroes who died on Flight 93, who viewed liberty as being worth more than life itself, are truly worthy of our constant remembrance.

A True Must-See,"I have seen many powerful movies that deeply affected me, but nothing like this. I've never had such a physical reaction to a film before. I was almost nauseous with a feeling of impending doom, since we all know how it ends, but I still found it to be quite suspenseful. Using largely unknown actors was a stroke of genius, and the mundane aspects of people going about what should have been just another day was part of what made this so gut-wrenching for me. My heart was racing throughout and by the end I was shaking and sobbing. A truly harrowing experience, but one everyone over the age of 16 should have.

"Eerie, like a horror movie","Online Slate magazine has a pretty good write-up about this movie. (http://www.slate.com/id/2140690/) Except the author doesn't say that watching the events of 9/11 unfold is eerie. It is like watching that horrific day all over again with the clarity of a horror movie. We know what the bad guy is going to do next. We know the innocent, happy girl is going to make a mistake, and despite our inner admonishments and hands clutching the theater seats, sure enough, like an idiot, she opens the wrong door.With horror movies, we have the frustrating benefit of foresight. The director lets us in on the secret. With 9/11, we have the wretched frustration of hindsight.First there is the Discovery Channel's review of the 9/11 Commission Report, which found a damnable lack of foresight, intelligence co-operation and imagination in a defense system that already suffered multiple attacks from the same terrorist organization, including one previous attempt against the very same target! Then there is Thomas Friedman's book, The World is Flat. He details the extensive $400K, multi-team globalization project, which al Qaeda undertook to attack the towers, the Pentagon and the Capitol building.In some respects, this is movie making at its best. Hand held video follows the terrorists through their daily prayers and preparations, nameless, faceless people board the plane amid scraps of conversations and phone calls. Air traffic control centers follow yellow markers on the screen. Bureaucrats shuffle papers and attend meetings. Then one plane is off the screen and nobody knows what is going on. Then another plane is off the air. United 93 taxis down the run-way, preparing for take-off. Four young Arabs sit quietly in first class.Another plane is off the screen. The military is alerted. A plane hits the World Trade Center. The director is clinical about the timing and conversations of the events. His eye never wavers as the clock winds down to the inevitable. This isn't a roller-coaster. This is a grind.Our government doesn't look bad. They just look woefully unprepared. The mother of one of serial killer Jeffery Dahmers' victims spoke in court. She said there was nothing wrong with her boy. Yet nothing, she said, prepares you for a monster like Dahmer.So it was with the military and the air traffic control centers. Although Islamist extremists tried to bomb the WTC before and they successfully bombed the USS Cole, we never met a monster like bin Laden.The director doesn't amplify the courage it took those soldiers of faith to dive head-long into an oblivion of structural steel. He juxtapositions the religious preparations of the terrorists with the last minute prayers of the doomed passengers.And then it is over. You are left alone, in the dark, after a nightmare ride to death. The emptiness and the hollowness of their jihad inhibits you.Unlike Tora, Tora, Tora or the first and second Pearl Harbor movies, after watching United 93, it is easy to see how the schemers and manipulators gave us the war we got. Neither side may be the moral right in this cultural war over globalization and scarce resources, but after watching this movie, you want war. You want justice and you want revenge. I am not sure the Afghanistan war alone would have satisfied our national appetite for revenge.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A tribute to the heroism and courage of the passengers of Flt 93,"No one should be afraid to see this movie. It is truly an emotional ride, but the courage and presence of mind of the passengers/hostages of United Flight 93 makes them, in my mind, true heroes. They were not victims of a hijacking. They were the true martyrs for a higher cause, not the terrorists. They gave their lives as a sacrifice to save others on the ground from what the terrorists had planned. Their families should be proud of them. The only criticism I have is the use of the ""f"" word by one of the actors. The character the actor portrayed was a man of faith and the actor did him and his family a disservice by uttering that word. I can't imagine the real person he portrayed would have uttered it, even under those circumstances. Except for that, the movie was a very moving tribute to 40 (minus the terrorists) very brave people.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of the most powerful film i have seen......,"Fist of all let me just say that i am not an American ,and therefore probably don't feel the same level of Patriotism as some of the American viewers, i have to admit that watching this film does provoke some strong feeling in me.What i like about this film is the fact that there are no cheesy line, gimmicks, or glorified Americanise (see independence day). All there is is the director detailing a event as it happen to the best of our knowledge, showing us how a group of stranger banded together to survived and draw courage from each other to try to come out of a difficult situation. And i have to admit, listening to the passengers making call to say goodbye to their love ones brings a few tears to my eyes.A good movie is one that makes you think after you walk out of the cinema, and i think this movie does that to me. Even now i still got this question in my head.... If god forbid, this ever happens to me, would i have the courage and do what these men and women do?",9.0,Anonymous,History

Excellent,"I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I decided to go see this movie. I knew that if it was accurate it would be great, and that was more than true in my opinion. Having read the 9/11 commission report, as well as other federal documents on Flight 93, and listening to the phone conversations online, I would have to say that this movie is about as real as you can get in a documentary/style film. The actors looked very similar to the real victims of this tragedy, and I firmly believe that since the film was made with the help of some of the people who experienced the tragedy, it was even better than it would have been. United 93 is a movie that will hit you deep inside. No matter what political affiliation you are, this film will remind you of the sacrifices that these men and women made, and life's true value. 9/11 affected us all in one way or another, some more than others. United 93 is fitting in every way, and is definitely a film everyone should see. A lot of people, especially on the east coast, are saying that it is too early for a movie about September 11. I ask you this then. If it is too early for a film of this matter, then why did the victims families and friends of flight 93 help out with getting the film right? This film is about heroism. The bravery, courage, and selfless-service that those men and women endured on Flight 93, and to have the courage to fight back is a quality that every American should have, and remember.I end this post with the famous words from one of my biggest role models and heroes, Flight 93's Todd Beamer.

One of the most moving films I have ever seen!,"After walking out of the film (excuse me), I walked into the men's bathroom, and there were two men standing against the wall crying. As one of the men looked up at me, tears streaming down his face, I knew what he was going through, and he just shook his head saying, ""Wheeew, man that was rough."" Never have I seen a film affect people to this degree. Other than seeing ""The Passion of Christ,"" I never saw an audience leave in complete silence. Usually someone speaks, but you could have heard a pin drop.Paul Greengrass, the director, shows you something true (or as close to true as facts allow). Most films that are fiction and have great stories move us emotionally, but those films that are true and have something we remember involving a devastating event effect us to the core. I think most of us can remember where we were when we first heard the news of 09/11/2001. My mom remembers running down the street at 24 years old telling everyone that Kennedy had been shot. I remember watching the space shuttle explode in the 80's (skipped out of school that dayha ha), but nothing compared to watching the live television coverage of the World Trade Center disaster.Greengrass, being English, doesn't just concentrate on the plight of the passengers, but allows the audience to see it from the terrorist's eyes as well.Spoiler: There is a scene where the primary terrorist is sitting next to a prominent executive in a designer suit and leather shoes. You see him continuing to stare at the shoes as if to be thinking my compatriots and people are dying and starving and this greedy American continues to consume products at will without regard to survival.As you watch this film, keep in mind that the film is just as long as the actual flight of United 93. Given the circumstances, what would you do? What amount of terror would you be feeling? The passengers had only a short time to react to all the things that were happening, yet they found the time to call their loved ones and tell them bye. Greengrass' film is emotionally draining and powerful. Greengrass takes you on the ride with the passengers and doesn't let you go. I did find myself having an urge to leave the theater because I wanted to get off the plane. Then I reminded myself, ""They couldn't get off, so I won't leave them."" This film will be the one remembered in years to come as the pivotal film about 09/11.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Why did they slander Christian Adams, the German passenger?","Imagine that you are the family of Christian Adams, the German wine merchant who died on Flight 93 on 9/11. You go to see the movie, bracing yourself for what you know will be a harrowing, painful experience. And what do you see? You see your loved one portrayed--based on no research whatsoever--as a collaborator and traitor to the passenger rebellion. This is inexcusable, chauvinistic and insensitive. Why, I would also ask, are all those passengers sobbing on their phone calls when in fact the reports are that they were calm? The truth would have been more moving. All of that said, the movie is powerful and I was sobbing hard at the end, and all other contenders for Oscar for best editing should not bother renting tuxes. Still: the film would have been ever better without the unnecessary creation of a villain among the passengers.

United 93 Was A Sad & Very Heroic Tale,"After watching the movie United 93, I almost wanted to cry in my seat at the theater. The audience was completely silent and somber when the movie had finished and the lights went up in the theater. Nobody talked. Nobody said a single word. People just slowly got out of their seat and left the theater with sad faces or tears in their eyes.United 93 reminds us all of what happened on September 11, 2001. It reminds us of who are as Americans and where we were when the 9/11 tragedy struck the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. United 93 also made me realize that the President of the United States is one of the luckiest men in the world. For all we known, the terrorists aboard United 93 might have been using the 737-222 aircraft to try and crash into the White House in Washington, D.C., but we will never know for sure.What we do know for a fact is that United 93 was heading for Washington, D.C. and that the brave passengers aboard the aircraft prevented the terrorists from reaching their intended target. What makes the President of the United States so lucky is that common, ordinary American people on United 93 sacrificed their lives to save the lives of those living in Washington, D.C., including the President of the United States (although the president wasn't in Washington, D.C. at the time of the 9/11 terrorist attacks).How many times has a President of the United States been lucky at avoiding assassination attempts against his life? How many times have ordinary American people, or American soldiers, or Secret Service agents sacrificed their lives to save the President of the United States?Although I was a little hesitant about seeing United 93 at the theater, I am glad that I did watch the movie. It made me realize how important it is to remember the people in our own personal lives (friends, family and relatives) who mean the most to us and how we should call them on the phone more often and say how much we love them in our hearts. After watching United 93 at the theater, I called my mother at home and told her how much I loved her and how important she is to me in my life. That is how great of an impact that United 93 made on my life after watching the movie. I wanted to cry and it made me think about the passengers of United 93, my country, my mother and the President of the United States.I would encourage people (especially young teenagers) to go watch United 93 in their local movie theaters. It is an excellent movie and it seems to be very accurate in its details. It will remind you to never forget about those who sacrificed their lives on United 93. And by watching the movie, you will feel as though you are paying your respects to the honor and the memory of those who gave their lives in the cause of American freedom and liberty on United 93.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Greengrass takes you for a ride on United 93,"From the first scene to the last, Paul Greengrass is faithful to his minimalist presentation of United flight 93. He avoided every wrong turn and I left the theater having flown on United 93 and amazed that I was still alive. There were many brilliant methods built into the making of the movie. To name just three: combining actors with real characters portraying themselves, employing a close-as-possible real-time time-line (Real-time Terror, 01 April 2006, Film Journal) and keeping the actors portraying the terrorists apart from the rest of the cast during rehearsals and until filming (Interview with Lloyd Levin, 28 April 2006, The Michael Medved Show).

I Felt As if I Were On That Plane.....,"United 93 will no doubt become one of the most controversial films to be released by a studio this year. It is a film that is difficult to watch in that the events that took place happened only five years ago, and for most of Americans, happened in a place no one would actually see with their own eyes. It is, in fact, a sort of surreal event most of us experienced through television and newspaper. Yet with United 93, we are put into the positions of the air traffic controllers and the passengers themselves as they go on about trying to de esculate the situation that would become 9/11.The camera is a first person point of view of the events that took place that day. We are never given a particular character to connect with, instead connecting in unison with all Americans with the events that unfold during that tragic day. Greengrass edits this film with precision and power, smoothly flowing from one air traffic control tower to another, as the controllers try desperately to understand the hijackings taking place. These shots are inter cut with the passengers on board United 93, not knowing the events that have begun to unfold, even before they take off.The experience of watching this film is intense, and quite difficult to watch in many areas, yet I found it hard to turn away from what was unfolding on screen. The camera boards the plane as if it were just any other passenger, quietly observing the small talk, the flight attendants carrying on about their jobs, the pilots preparing for their flight. We see the terrorists calmly seated in first class, knowing what is to happen within a few minutes, yet being unable to stop them from carrying out their murderous plans.By the time we see the actual take over of the flight by the terrorists, the WTC have already been attacked, the fear on display in that plane is so overwhelming, and so real, I didn't know what to think. The messages to loved ones by the airline phones broke my heart, yet we never hear or see the other side of the line. We wouldn't if we were actually on the plane, so why would we in this film? The rebellion is heart pounding, and before you can blink, the film ends, and you remain in your seat, heart pounding, hands shaking, and in total shock of what had been witnessed.Paul Greengrass did absolutely amazing work with this picture. Using no name actors in the roles of the passengers and the air traffic controllers made the film more real and that much more of an experience. It doesn't sentimentalize the events that took place, nor does it become judgmental or linear. It was a day of grand confusion and fear, and Greengrass was able to take his camera and quietly observe the chaos that took place that day.United 93 is not an easy film to witness, and I don't recommend everyone to watch it because of its subject matter. But if you feel emotionally strong enough to witness these events, I whole heartedly recommend this picture. Very few times can film be considered an actual work of art. I consider this to be one among the few.HIGHLY Recommended.MJR",,Anonymous,History

Wow,"United 93 is very moving. Incredibly so. It plays like the docudrama it is, telling the story everyone already knows, but it literally keeps you riveted to your seat for every single painful minute. I've heard many say ""we aren't ready"". I used to be among them. Seeing it though leaves me feeling that it's a timely refresher on what we are up against, and a tremendous memorial to the bravery of the those who gave their lives on that day.When I first heard Hollywood was making this film I feared a typical PC exercise showing ""both sides"" of the story. Some attempt to hint at the ""understandable reason"" behind the madness. To my surprise (and relief) we just get an accurate recital of events as we know them, including the terrorists and what we know of them. This film is history. Not history 2.0.My only negative comment concerns the few paragraphs of text that appear at the end. They seem to indict those in authority for inappropriate or untimely reaction. For example, there is one paragraph about military commanders not giving interceptor pilots firing orders after permission to do so had been granted because the commanders were concerned about an accidental shootdown. A very wise precaution if you ask me, but the scroll seems to suggest there was something suspect about it even though the interceptors were never in a position to stop any of the planes. It's a minor gripe given the rest of the film, but it bugs me a lot. It's as if the filmmakers wanted the audience to shake their heads at something and decided ""lets point a finger over here"". Ditch or change the closing words and you have a near perfect film. 9 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,History
An example of excellence,"One thing is for certain: United 93 is a difficult movie to watch. It is unflinching in it's almost moment by moment dissection of September 11, 2001, at least from the point of view of the air traffic controllers, the military controllers and, of course, the passengers and crew of United flight 93. It pulls no punches, doesn't soft pedal anything and really only restrains itself at the last moments, where taste would allow nothing else. And in doing so, writer-director Paul Greengrass has crafted what is almost certain to be the best movie in 2006. That is a high bar to set, but it is difficult to imagine any film coming any closer to the excellence on display here.United 93 is, almost needless to say, a gut-wrenchingly detailed and, seemingly, accurate, re-creation of many of the events of the morning of 9/11. It's principal focus, more or less, is on the titular flight that was the only one of four planes hijacked that morning to fail to reach it's intended target, in this case, the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. We see the passengers and crew going through their average routines, preparing the flight for takeoff, talking about their lives in snippets, nothing out of the ordinary. The flight control centers that are key to the days events are also introduced, tracking planes, worrying about the weather, the usual stuff for them. We also see the terrorists preparing themselves, praying and gathering their weapons. They appear, to the average individual, no different than anyone else. Few would realize that these four individuals are capable of the acts they are about to perform.To give a traditional plot summary, beyond the above setup, is practically useless. This is not really a traditional narrative film. Greengrass has put it together in an almost documentary form, using almost no recognizable actors (and often utilizing the real individuals that were working in the air traffic control centers), hand-held camera moves and very few filmic tricks. We believe we are in the rooms with these individuals when it happens, following along as the day's horrific developments unfold. It is almost shocking to view the early moments when the first flight is believed to be hijacked and the air traffic controllers almost dismiss it. It has been so long since something like that has happened, they can't believe in the possibility. It is only after listening to cockpit transmissions from the first plane to be reported hijacked, American 11, that the reality of the situation sinks in.We are quickly drawn in to the confusion, the sense of pure helplessness in the film. These men and women at the various locations are simply unable to really do anything, and as audience members, we can sit and scream mentally on the inside to do something. But that day was simply one that was unprecedented and beyond comprehension. The actors in United 93 are stellar in their performances. The nuances, delivery and body language are more believable than almost any other fiction film I have ever witnessed. The direction is near perfect also. The editing and choice of camera angles bring us into the action, never locking us out.Throughout, Greengrass mounts the tension impressively. We know the outcome, how things will turn out, but we can't help but be caught up in the moment. After the terrorists capture Flight 93 and the passengers begin plotting to take back the plane, the moments as they call their loved ones and give their goodbyes are heart-wrenching, to say the least. Composer John Powell deserves a strong notice for crafting an understated, yet amazingly effective score that does not manipulate your emotions, but underlines what is happening on screen, especially in the film's concluding moments.For those who might complain about the portrayal of the terrorists, I find this a difficult point for anyone to argue over. Greengrass gives them as much objectivity as the other characters, and we cannot help but be affected, emotionally, by their actions. We see at least one, the lead terrorist, portrayed by Khalid Abdalla, who is obviously having reservations about his actions and decision to go forward with this plan. His fellow hijackers are more than willing to make the move, but he is not. The final actions are known, but Greengrass does not reduce these men to caricatures, they are believable men who do inexplicable things.It is almost impossible to watch United 93 and not be flooded by a range of emotions, ranging from sadness, helplessness, and, most significantly, anger. You almost find yourself wanting to jump onto the screen and take matters into your own hands, to stop the inevitable from unfolding, but you must just watch as the film moves toward it's inescapable conclusion.There are few other films that are this effective at moving an audience without manipulating them, and for that reason alone, United 93 is an impressive feat. But it is more than that. It is a template for how filmed accounts of events such as this should be mounted, a defining moment in film history. United 93 is the very best movie I have seen in a long time, and will not be quickly forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Unbelievable,"This is a movie that tends to shake you out of your everyday complacency and make you take note of what is going on in the world. You get a very good view of the emotions and actions that the writer perceives the hijackers to have had. You see the same thing in all the people who were on the flight. The insight into what happens at the ARTCCs at each major air center was very realistic. Fear everywhere. Interesting political commentary is weaved into this movie. It would be virtually impossible to leave this movie without having been moved, having thought a little deeper, and having realized that you too have the power to be extraordinary, just as the people on the flight were truly courageous. Absolutely amazing, gripping, shattering.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The story of United flight 93 on 9-11-01,"Great production, the story needs to be kept ""raw"" as some of the victims family members have stated. I like that there were non actors playing themselves and some not well known actors playing the victims. The movie in my opinion was done in good taste, not over the top since much of what happened is purely speculation. Paul Greengrass had permission from each victims family members and had his crew interview each family extensively so the victims would be portrayed as true to life as possible. My only complaint is the constant motion of the camera, I would guess it was done in this way to give a ""chaotic"" feel or maybe to have it seem more like a documentary. The shaky camera gave me an intense head ache right away. By the end of the movie (from this and the adrenaline from intense emotions) I was quite nauseated. I feel the end of the movie was perfect....I cant say more or I will spoil it!",9.0,Anonymous,History
What a great movie!,"I have seen many movies, and it's getting harder and harder for a movie to impress me. I have been disappointed by most of the movies I have seen this year, and was expecting the same response from United93. On the contrary, United93 was incredible; it told you the straight story with no fluff added. The way the movie was filmed made it even more realistic, like you are on the plain with the passengers. I knew the out come of the movie, but still the whole time I was hoping that maybe somehow the ending would be different,(I actually found myself hoping for a Hollywood ending).I left the theater with far greater respect for those who died on United93. This movie is deeply moving. I would recommend every American see it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
UNITED 93 - a belated wake-up call?,"When is it the 'right' time to make a movie about 9/11? Five years? Ten? Never? If the terrorists had attacked say, an underground mine of 2000 workers and killed them all with an explosion, would there have been all the media hype? Probably not.Despite what Americans think about terrorists, calling them 'evil' and 'callous', they forget one important fact: terrorists are extremely intelligent and will outwit the best of our best every step of the way. They also have unlimited funds. Add the fact that fanatics have no qualms about dying for their beliefs and you have an undefeatable power. They don't care what we think of them.The Twin Towers were attacked for one reason only; visual impact.The WTC was a famous US landmark and targeting it drew the necessary news coverage. Add the attempts on the White House and Pentagon, both also US icons, and you have a nation terrified out of its wits. This basis of terrorism is of course, terror. Considering how the US treats Arab countries, expecting non-retaliation is sheer arrogance.The unexpected downing of the Twin Towers was an added bonus for the terrorists. They must have squealed with glee as they watched their targets collapsing. It is extremely difficult to 'aim' a large airliner at such small targets (relatively speaking) and the pilots had considerable skills to do so (pilots trained in the US). No doubt the Towers falling spoiled the terrorists' 'fun'. Once the towers were gone, so was the visual impact. All that remained was smoke. The light show was over.We cannot imagine the insufferable losses of 9/11, but police officers and fireman will tell the same story; they were merely doing their jobs. They did not know that the Towers would fall, but the shortsightedness of this is remarkable. Consider two, 300+ tonne commercial airliners, laden with highly flammable jet fuel slamming into buildings at over 400 miles per hour. Is it not feasible that the building's superstructures would become compromised? Even so, what were we to do? Leave the buildings' occupants to fend for themselves? It was a lose-lose situation.Many emergency personnel knew that once they entered those buildings there was a chance they would not return. This is true of any emergency rescue. These folks are not heroes in the way we have glorified them. They are simply brave souls willingly to face extreme adversity in the execution of their duties. Many of the souls lost on that day would baulk at the idea of being 'heroes'. They would claim they were simply doing their jobs.Whatever your beliefs, we cannot deny the incomparable bravery and spirit of those personnel. We do not know the facts of UNITED 93 other than vague radio messages and telephone calls made by passengers. Dialogue had to be created. The situation was well-handled and the dialogue believable, however much artistic license was used. UNITED 93 attempts to show an objective view of what may have happened aboard the stricken aircraft. It makes no claim to accuracy.Even though we knew the inevitable outcome, I still found myself rooting for the passengers. Yes, the jerky hand-held camera action is annoying and there was too much time given to the hijackers praying and not enough character building of the passengers. But it did show terrorist fanaticism. I doubt there was the hesitation shown by the hijackers in the movie. Fanatics do not falter. Their minds work on 'autopilot', believing firmly that what they are doing is required by them of their Gods. Who are we to argue?Whatever your thoughts, UNITED 93 is an acceptable and believable account of events, however inaccurate. It does a very good job of portraying the confusion by both NORAD and the FAA. Scenes aboard the aircraft will keep you glued to your seat. Anyone who has ever been in a crisis situation will know that there is first disbelief, then chaos, followed by arguing as it then all goes to pieces and those involved realize that they are ill-prepared to cope with the situation. Communication always breaks down. Incredibly, it is only since 9/11 that the US' security services have begun exchanging information.The 9/11 attack was just the tip of the terrorist iceberg. As long as the US continues to invade other lands and insult their leaders, they will be under threat from organizations far more powerful that they can ever hope to defeat. Praying just will not do.Terrorists have infinite patience and funding and I they want to bring us to our knees, they can and will do so with ease. Inevitable future attacks will be better organized and funded and will result in the loss of tens of thousands, possibly millions of Americans. Targets are shopping malls, cinemas and any critical US installation. Imagine 200 planes hijacked at the same time, or the orchestrated blowing up of packed shopping malls at Christmas time.We need better leaders to help defend our own borders, not interfere in the lives and beliefs of other countries; an act that has gained the US international notoriety. Bush's war mongering adds fuel to the fire and his arrogance at thinking he can defeat these terrorists continues to threaten Americans. He needs to put down his club and listen. Bush's ideas and actions are little different than those he calls the ""evil ones"". Murder is murder. In any God's name. Iraq is a prime example. Examine life in the US very closely. How much freedom do we really have?The world's opinion of America and is not very high and that 'superpower' arrogance will one day be removed. Whatever it takes and whatever the human cost. See the movie and form your own opinion. UNITED 93 is not professing to be the whole or any truth. It is well handled and very watchable. Decide for yourself.",,Anonymous,History
So bad it can't be put in words,"The facts on this movie is just as believable as Star Wars. None of this happened. This movie had bad writers, bad actors, everything was the worst. The old Little Mermaid is more credible.",1.0,Anonymous,History
The Inevitable,"The events that took place on September 11th are still embedded into the minds of Americans everywhere. For months there was no escape from those dreaded images and the idea that terrorists are stronger than previously thought. The last thing to worry about would be a a picture about the events on that fateful day. Upon hearing that there would be not one but two movies released less than five years after the catastrophe (Oliver Stone's World Trade Center being the second), I was skeptical to say the least. Is our country ready to relive those terrible hours on the big screen?United 93 takes a look at the last hours of the passengers aboard United Airlines Flight 93. The films opens with the terrorists making some final preparations before they leave. Director Paul Greengrass jumps around throughout the film from control room to control room and back to the situation aboard the plane. Because of all people involved, there is no need to delve into backgrounds for the characters, just the fact that they are present is all that is necessary for the film to work.The movie isn't completely centered around the flight of United 93, but the events leading up to the fateful crash in Pennsylvania. One idea that is constant throughout the film is that question of 'what now?' Today's world has changed because of what happened in New York City, Washington D.C., and Pennsylvania. We are much more cautious and anxious about taking the next step. In 2001 no one could have foreseen this happening to America. A country that for hundreds of years has taken in all sorts of cultures and given them fresh start on life. It is almost a stab in the back. To see the panic in the faces of the air traffic controllers and the stewardesses is a chilling reminder of how we all felt that day.Greengrass luckily didn't go out of his way into making this a blockbuster smash like The Perfect Storm. Both are stories that have holes missing in the actual time line of events. The only certain aspect of these movies is the outcome. Rather than relying on the big name actors to lead the passengers in an uprising against the terrorists, Greengrass acquires talent in numbers, forging an element of realism in the passengers. The casting of actual military personnel is a much needed touch that makes the movie that more believable. Without this aspect of the film it would be making a mockery of the event and smearing the movie industry.The message being sent isn't to be more patriotic or more anti-Islam. The message emanating from the film to be informed and to understand what ordinary people can accomplish in an extraordinary situation. Of course these people should be honored and remembered, but the movie doesn't make them into Harrison Ford's and Sigourney Weaver's. It creates their legend. They saved hundreds possibly thousands of lives, taking their own.Skeptical as I was, I only knew of one thing coming into the movie and that was the outcome. I knew that there was no way this movie could end happily. Michael Bay tried to do this with the movie Pearl Harbor and made a shamble of such a solemn and tragic event. Although the ending was certain, the beginning and body of the movie was basically a mystery entering the theatre. It truly was an informative and necessary piece.So where is our country now? Have we come any farther from when we once were? United 93 doesn't answer that question. The answer lies within every American. Do we move on and remember the thousands of lives lost that day, or do we stay in the past beneath the pain and agony that came screaming out of the sky?",10.0,Anonymous,History
"An Overdue Expose of a Soulless, Unhumanitarian Cult","Extremist Moslems - and they make up the majority of all Moslems today -hate us and have dedicated themselves to destroying our cultures, our societies and our persons - and by ""us"" I mean anyone and everyone who has not embraced Islam as the only true religion and who has not accepted Mohammad as God's true prophet (the Messiah, in other words). This includes Christians, Jews, and the great Eastern religions: Hinduism, Buddism, and Shinto. Their bible (the Koran) urges and encourages them to convert we ""nonbelievers"" into good Moslems; but if we refuse to do so, they are obligated - on pain of religious anathema and banishment for heresy - to pursue us and to slay us. So they hate us and wish to destroy us because this is what their religion mandates, and this is why they feel so sacrosanct in committing their dastardly acts of mass murder in the name of ""the Prophet, Blessed Be He."" These themes are brilliantly brought out in the film and make it quite clear that there is only one solution to the Moslem ""problem."" We must kill them in greater numbers, at faster rates, than they do us, so that we can destroy their economic infrastructures, their livelihoods, and bring them to their knees economically such that they are ready to throw their Korans into the trash and listen to entreaties from us to conduct themselves as decent human beings and to finally learn that in order to survive, one must accept one's fellow human beings for what they are - and for what they are not.",10.0,Anonymous,History
