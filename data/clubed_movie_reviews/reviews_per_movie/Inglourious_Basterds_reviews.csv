Glorious indeed!,"Aside from the Kill Bill's I have not seen any other Tarantino film. I heard this one was good and so I watched. It's great. From the opening scene you are mesmerized by Christoph Waltz's unnerving performance. He gets a lot of credit and rightfully so. Hans Lands is possibly one of the greatest movie villains of all time. There so many iconic moments and Tarantino demonstrates how normal dialogue scenes can become suddenly intense with words alone. Every actor gives it their all with Brad Pitt giving a memorable performance as well. This movie is worth watching just for its opening but it also has back to back quality scenes that are well shot and have excellent dialogue. The movie balances it's comedy with excellent dark moments reminding viewers that this is indeed a WW2 film. Overall, my favourite Tarantino film of the three I've seen and might be for some time. Worth watching for Christoph Waltz.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Quentin Tarantino's style and Christoph Waltz's menace,"In 1941 Nazi-occupied France, ""The Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) finds the Dreyfus family hidden by their neighbors. Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) escapes after her family is massacred. Meanwhile Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) has gathered 8 Jewish American soldiers to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. Their brutal scalping campaign instills fear among the Germans. Donowitz (Eli Roth) is even given a nickname ""The Bear Jew"" for brutally beating Nazis with a baseball bat. Then in June 1944, Shosanna has a new name and a theater. She catches the eye of German war hero Fredrick Zoller who wants a big premiere in her theater that will attract the biggest of Nazi leaders. It even attracts the Jew Hunter as well as the Inglourious Basterds.Christoph Waltz is great as the cold menacing well-mannered Nazi. He is completely engrossing in every one of his scenes. Every word he speaks is dripping with menace. His scenes are quiet and some of the most compelling parts of the movie. Then Quentin Tarantino has injected his brutal violence into this Jewish revenge fantasy. It is nothing less than audacious and uniquely original.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Oh! What a Lovely War...,"There's a hunter called Hans Landa you should fear, if circumcision defines the way your men appear, on the surface quite polite, underneath riven with spite, carries a scar that lets you know of his career (or at least he will). But those un-helmeted can rejoice and be spurred, avenging evil come Inglorious Basterds, being led by Aldo Raine, with a remit to cause pain, several parts may disappear as things are sheared.Great dialogue, great direction, sublime performances and original in its depiction of a war picture that's been repainted a thousand times before, but seldom with such entertainment - Tarantino's best in my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
I have NEVER seen such a performance ... ever!,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them.
Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!
He is ULTRA polite with each one; and has supreme confidence in his scary, chilling, bold mannerisms.
All I can say is: ""You see this movie for Christoph Waltz's performance; all the rest is secondary""!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
I can't believe I just now watched this for the first time.,"This is a perfect Tarantino movie. It's explosive and exciting while also deep and well thought out. It took me a minute to get used to reading so many subtitles because of the variety of languages used, but I think that's a quality that makes the movie even more enticing. It is incredibly well done and it had a hold of me from beginning to end. Fair warning for any Tarantino movie, be prepared for the gore and violence. It runs rampant throughout the movie, but it's kind of gratifying seeing it happen to the Nazis.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Who the hell is Christoph Waltz?,"That's what I thought, when I heard about the cast of Inglorious Basterds. And I'm both from Germany and into movies.That guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre TV series - and even there he didn't play the main parts. Obviously nobody ever noticed, what he's capable of. Now, thanks to QT, he got one shot to change that - and - let's put it this way - that was a bingo! He is the living proof of what a great caster Tarrantino is.By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a German - being able to understand everything. And the German dialog is written almost as good as the English.Now I could repeat, what many others have written here before. I'll put it short: Finally, QT is back.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Waltz is a Genius!!!!!,"I had the PRIVILEGE of attending the UK premier of Inglorious Basterds this evening! Having seen the trailers i had high hopes but had doubts due to a string of self indulgent films (c'mon lets be honest, self indulgence is his tarantinos middle name)I was surprised to find though that he had pulled the cat out of the bag with this one. The film is rich with interesting dialogue, Perfect timed comedy with a dash of brutal assassination.The crowning glory of this film though lies with Christoph Waltz whom no fault or error can be found. He manages to create a real tension in the audience whilst remaining quite ""theatrical"" (couldn't think of a better word). He definitely deserved his prize at Cannes and is heading for an Oscar no doubt!!!! Hoping to see him in something again soon!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
The Jewish Scalphunters of Quentin Tarantino,"Once again, revenge is at the center of a Quentin Tarantino movie. This time a Jewish dirty dozen takes things on their own hands. Tarantino re-writes history and shortens WWII with a comic stroke that is as entertaining as it is vacuous. A fantasy that re-arranges some controversial historical points. Okay, it's a movie and as such it works for most of its two and a half hours. Christoph Waltz opens things up in the most promising way. The opening sequence is filled with a subtle but unbearable tension. Weltz amalgamates all the Nazi villains we have loved and hated in the movies into one glorious creation. (I will advise my countrymen to see it in its original multi-language version - the Italian version is another movie altogether. Some of the extra pleasures are in the dialog that, naturally, are not to be found in the Italian version) Brad Pitt, rapidly becoming one of the best character actors in the world, with a leading man's face and billing, is truly fantastic. Diane Kruger makes a credible Barbara Bouchet (one of Tarantino's muses from trash action Italian movies from the 70's) and the rest of the cast has some exquisite touches like Rod Taylor as Winston Churchill. Highly recommended for a Sunday afternoon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
One of the best films I've seen in my life,"It's a historically brilliant Tarantino film recreating a Second World War scenario featuring the group of bastards and one of the best villains in the history of cinema (Hans Landa, the Jew Hunter), for me a somewhat negative feeling about the film is that for me it could have less of the Shosanna arc and more of the batards killing the Nazis, the end of the film is one of the best endings showing what makes a film and maybe if I made a film it would be this ending, but even with this most negative point , in my opinion the film is perfect and one of the best films I've seen in my life, without a doubt 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Quentin Tarantino is a Crazy Basterd,"I can't imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than Quentin Tarantino's. (At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics, such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since, he has been a disappointment for some. Well, I am relieved to say, Tarantino has not lost his touch. He brings us his best since Pulp Fiction and thankfully so.We know the story, a WWII tale told only as Tarantino can. (Fictional of course) A war film hasn't been done like this before. Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine leads the Basterds in Nazi occupied France. Their goal - killin' Nazi's. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He's know as the ""Jew Hunter"" and goes about his business as ruthless as no other. The third sub story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who witnesses the slaughter of her family. And she, of course, wishes to plot revenge on the Germans for her devastating lose. There actually is three stories here intertwining and connecting with each other. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, this is nothing new for him.War has never been been so fun. The Basterds, are haunting, but at the same time, very funny, at times even hilarious. The dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other Tarantino films. The entertainment and hilarity is led by Brad Pitt. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. I couldn't wait to see him on screen again. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. Also making great impressions were Mélanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were tremendous. The film was filled with noteworthy performances.The story itself, has so many historical inaccuracies to even count, but so what? It isn't meant to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun with, as should we. The cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film. You've really got to love the last line in the film... but Pulp Fiction remains his masterpiece.Quentin Tarantino among all other things, is an entertainer. WWII, is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino some how manages to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun film, it's tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, suspenseful, and funny at the same time. Jam packed with everything you look for in a movie, done with that certain Tarantino style, it's worth being checked out. It's time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"He loves his movies, doesn't he?","Everything is forgiven because ""Inglorious Basterds"" is so entertaining and at the end of the day that'ìs what matters. I think it's a pity that certain critics, specially in Italy, are determined to transform this clever pulp director into some kind of god. Maybe, partly, because Tarantino has been very clever, elevating some of the Italian pulp movies of the 60's and 70's to a sort of cult status. Italy is very grateful for that, he's rewarded with interminable praise. I fear that's the wrong approach, it's also confusing. He makes popcorn movies, brilliantly. The characters have never anything important to say, Burger King, Superman, that's the extent of its depth and I think he's tapping into a society that's getting shallower and shallower with every passing year. But, if I'm mentioning this instead of talking about all the great things I could be saying about his movie is because there is a strange force trying to brain wash me into believing that Tarantino is the most important influence in movies since time immemorial. No, he's a great director of inconsequential fun movies. I consider myself a fan and I intend to see all his future movies. This one has some wonderful touches, winking at other movies by John Sturges, Robert Aldrich etc. Brad Pitt and in particular Christoph Waltz give wonderful performances. Waltz is at the center of my favorite scenes in the film. Enjoy this movies for what it is and not for what critics are saying it is. You'll enjoy it even more that way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

A Comedy Of Horrors,"Brad Pitt sticks his index finger in Diane Kruger's leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, horribly so.

Even ""Paris when it sizzles"" is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog. I was thrilled by Christoph Waltzer's character and by his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a true original. I love the actor's lack of vanity. There's a quirk in the character that is pure Brad Pitt.

"Great fun, a real surprise","It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill films (although i preferred the second) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven't hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.Then i read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and i hated it! Sure it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on page it was more juvenile rubbish, largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a Tarantino Q&A following in London. I figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in Q&A as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person.So little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds.Easily Mr Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown it is a triumph.Yes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunt casting but he works fine, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared. While i admired Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof in order to amp-up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino's own appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote.What really makes this work is how BIG it is. The spaghetti western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so big. The audacity so big. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers the Hitler moment and Pitt's performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune's blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn vibe to him, and of course a suitably Lee Marvin edge.Christoph Waltz (who i did not previously known) and Melanie Laurent (who i first noticed in a brilliant French-language British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future. Tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting, which seemed to desert him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally large in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here.That every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems pulled directly from the mold of Attenborough's Great Escape leader.All the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes, but ones that work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger's Hugo Stiglitz is a riot. After a sensational slow-burn opening and a glorious intro to those inglourious Basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by.It also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to real film-making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired from Morricone on.The film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining, but also involving and impressive film should be this one, when i would never have believed it from script form. Welcome back QT.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
A Brilliant Filmmaker With Very Little To Say,"Very entertaining, that's for sure. Great little moments ""inspired"" by other movies. ""The Guns Of Navarone"", ""Operation Crossbow"" and a myriad of 70's B exploitation Italian movies. Tarantino is certainly clever and knows how to use the camera but then, I have to say it, nothing. The childish ""divertimento"" dressed in smart ass dialog remains there. The entertainment value is, perhaps, the most one should expect from a movie but it seems a damn shame that such a talent should be put at the service of something so one dimensional. I can't help but remember Ernst Lubitch's ""To Be Or Not To Be"" that was also a comedy with remarkable, inventive dialog but it also had so many other layers that ""To Be Or Not To Be"" after 70 years still resonates with whoever has seen it. Christoph Waltz is terrific and Brad Pitt is always great fun to watch but the experience is purely epidermic in spite of some truly gruesome moments. Am I expecting oranges from an apple tree? If that's so forget what I've just said and run to meet Tarantino's basterds.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Brave, unique and just sheer brilliant!","Inglorious Basterds makes no apologies, asks for no forgiveness, it's a  no holds barred assault on the senses. Tarantino doesn't care if he  offends, if he steps all over stereotypes and clichés, this is film  making at it purest. It's great to see a film maker whose work clearly  isn't interfeared with by the powers that be. Tarantino is a master of  effortlessly cranking up immense tension and suddenly mixing it with  laugh out loud moments; you're not sure if you should be looking away  in disgust or rolling around laughing, either way it's a roller coaster  and one not to be missed! It's not for everyone, certainly if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, this may be a little hard to swallow, but  never-the-less, it is a film which simply has to be seen. No self  respecting film fan should miss this. And the performance of Christoph  Waltz... Oscar don't you dare ignore him!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Tarantino and His Italian Critics,"You should hear the Italian critics talking about Tarantino and ""Inglorious Bastards"". They run out of superlatives. One of them last night actually shouted ""Tarantino is my God"". Wow! I, personally, suspect that Tarantino is the result of a generation of TV and bad (now cult) exploitation movies. I enjoy him, don't get me wrong, but I'm not shouting miracle when I still have ""The Great Escape"", for instance, so fresh in my mind. ""Inglorious Basterds"" more than any of the other Tarantino films is all about appearances. There is nothing underneath other than references to other movies. Nothing wrong with that in fact I like it but I refuse to treat Quentin Tarantino as a sort of Deity. I can't buy it. I think he should be placed exactly where he belongs among the best of his kind but what kind is that? Never mind, it works. Italian critics who are so prepared to destroy their own - you should read some of the reviews for ""Baaria"" - are prepared to fall to their knees in front of Tarantino. This are the same critics that last year, the year of ""Milk"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"" ""Edge Of Heaven"", The Wrestler"" etc, gave the David de Donatello Award for best picture to ""Grand Torino"" I want to make sure that I'm making my point clearly. ""Inglorious Bastards"" is a terrific comedy with most of Tarantino's trademark tricks in place. You'll have a great time with Brad Pitt and an incredible Christoph Waltz as the ultimate Nazi villain but don't expect a masterpiece as declared by some critics. That kind of review damages the film and me the spectator. It forces something on me. As if I was suppose to feel the same otherwise there is something wrong with me. No. I liked it, I recommend it for what it is. Period.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
No Matter How You Spell It,"...""Inglorious"" as our local theater decided to display its title on their marquee, minus the second word. It is terrific cinema.I don't hesitate to recommend this film to all but the over-squeamish. Let them never know what they're missing.I did hesitate to give it ten stars because of my experience of Tarantino's previous films. In every case, save ""Reservoir Dogs,"" they have improved with additional watching.So although I gave it ten stars, I did so reluctantly. It leaves me no ""up"" to go to.Yes Christoph Waltz is the Nazi we've all imagined the worst to be. He is cultured, sophisticated, suave and most sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who puts out his cigarette abruptly in a strudel, grinding it into the whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim.To understand Tarantino's films, you need only have a sense of dialogue, color and pacing. The colors are as bright as necessary and when necessary, brighter yet. In the French farmhouse of the opening scene, they are muted and dark, but excessively so. Outside a brilliant sun is shining, but in the one room of the house, everything is bathed in shadows and black.It is a brilliant setting for an interrogation by Waltz, as the ""Jew Hunter"" of the SS, who dangles his host French farmer over the precipice of revealing what he cannot reveal numerous times, then pulls him back with obsequious lines of friendship and understanding.A second sadistic German, well-played by August Diehl, later functions as important actor in the final plot twist. Diehl's Nazi Major, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz....almost.Film classes will study much from this movie. They should look lovingly at the superb pacing. Tarantino knows just how long to draw out a scene, building suspense in the manner of Hitchcock, then at just the breaking point, suddenly coming to a resolution.For color, look for a final shot at a French Theater, where its secretly Jewish proprietor is staging a surprise for the upper reaches of Nazi leadership.We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, awaiting the hated German dignataries who will arrive for a film preview of the latest Deutsch film masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious accomplishments.Laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the gorgeous theater, her red lips and low cut dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of her designs on her guests. It is a single shot that would be worth an entire film.There are thankfully many more such images, many more paced scenes of exquisite dialog and suspense.In short, see it. I'm sure you'll see it again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
A Rip Roaring Yarn,"An fun, engrossing, beautifully crafted piece of nonsense, the likes of which we hadn't seen in a long long time. The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilized monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating (hilariously) an Italian? I thought so. His character's name sounds like Aldo Ray and I'm sure that's no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970's sexpot, Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino's trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He's clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don't read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That's how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time. For better or worse this are Tarantino times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Tarantino Delivers!!!,"I must admit when I saw the preview for ""Inglorious Basterds"" I gave myself big expectations. THIS FILM DID NOT Disappoint.Rarely when I watch a movie with such high-expectations do I have those expectations met or exceeded; this film did that and more. Even more rarely do I clap at the end of a movie, this I and everyone else in the theater did.I have to say I am a little biased towards Quentin, I grew up with ""Pulp Fiction."" I watched it when I was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film.However, since then Quentin has not really lived up to his billing. His style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar, the quality honestly wasn't there (I never watched Jackie Brown, and then there's Grindhouse). That is until ""Inglorious Basterds."" What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but seeing how Leone is dead, Tarantino's the self appointed guy on this masterpiece.So let's look at the movie which I won't give away. The writing was spot on, a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie. Not to mention this movie was set up in the classic Tarantino mold, great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action.The acting was superb!! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, seriously. I don't say that often, but honestly the man should get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie, and delivered with such amazing touch and poise. He stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive.I have no problem building this movie up, because this movie is the best film I've seen all year, and probably all of next year. Quite frankly the more I think about it, this movie may crack my top films of all time, and is Quentin's best movie since ""Pulp Fiction."" Take it from me, watch this film. I loved it doesn't do this movie enough justice.I watched it yesterday and I'm still blown away. Thank you Quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie. You're back on top again buddy. I can't say enough for ""Inglorious Basterds!""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

World War II In an Alternate Universe,"I take exception to the comment that one reviewer made saying that a film like Inglourious Basterds had not been made before. Not only was one made, but it was made during World War II. When Hitler, Dead Or Alive was shown I'm sure the same rousing cheers went up from the audience who really wanted World War II to end that way.Quentin Tarantino must have seen Hitler, Dead Or Alive and decided to do a big budget version of that B film propaganda flick from the Forties. In that one Ward Bond, Paul Fix,and Warren Hymer play three German speaking gangsters who take a contract out on Adolph Hitler from some public spirited citizen. They enlist in the army, but as soon as they can they desert grab a plane with a pilot and land in Germany and set about to perform their task.What Tarantino has given us is Hitler, Dead Or Alive with official sanction. Brad Pitt heads a group of GIs, the rest of them are Jewish so they'll have proper motivation for this job, Pitt's a good old boy from Tennessee. The purpose of their mission is to just kill Nazis, the higher up, the better. And they soon get a reputation that's come to the attention of the Fuehrer himself.This film is a throwback to those propaganda films that came out as morale boosters during World War II. Pitt and the rest of the cast look like they're having a great old time with this. Best performance is Christoph Waltz who plays an SS colonel who specialized in tracking down Jews who've escaped Hitler's final solution. He might just get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.As for the end, just relax and imagine this is World War II in an alternate Universe.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
dialogue language visuals homage to cinema,"I have been feeling a little disappointed by Tarantino ever since death proof. But i insist it was only a little, because i can appreciate the amount of work in producing such an homage to stunts people. Inglorious Basterds has definitely propelled Tarantino to the top ranks in my universe. This movie can be summed up (albeit inadequately) in one word : ""RAW"".There is an intense emotion in every scene. Revenge and justice seem to be the main themes, From the start of the movie one feels compassion towards the victims of the Nazis, and is placed in Tarantino's fictional dimension of the WW2 historical context.Characters are unpredictiable, fun, scary, brutal, sexy, and other adjectives i am sure are escaping my mind that are just as fitting and positive. I won't go in to an appreciation of each character, but the other comments by fellow users sum up the appreciation of the various performances.Dialogue has evolved from the classic Tarantino ""bad ass"" provocative style as seen in Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. One can feel in the dialogues that Tarantino is making more open references to other movies. Indeed, many dialogues were near lessons in cinema to the audience, the setting partly takes place at a movie premiere ; a reference to a movie is close around every corner.It is nice to see that each language presented (German, French, and English) is employed rather equally and naturally. I speak both French and English very fluently, and am frequently disappointed in how English speaking characters in french movies act poorly, and how french speaking characters in English/American movies act poorly. Amazingly enough, Tarantino managed to make his actors pull off a natural and graceful performance from his actors. It helps put the audience in context of the historical context. Indeed ; soldiers, spies and civilans rarely understood soldiers/spies/civilians from other countries.The visuals/photography are beautiful, with sceneries convincingly conveying a 1940s WWII Europe. The outfits are perfect, and the violence orgasmically/realistically conveyed. No punches are held back, and the Nazis are often shown being tortured. This makes the movie not open to all audiences ; the graphic violence can shock the more sensitive demographic.volumes can be written about this movie. But the movie is so good, that during the North American Inglorious Basterds premiere at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal, i had to pee, but refused to go so as to not miss one single scene. I hope that image conveys how strongly i feel about this movie, and i'm a hard audience to please.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Not for critics, but people who love a good movie","Some critics might claim to need a code key to interpret what Tarantino means by this revisionist adventure film, but I'd say it's right under their up-turned noses: There's a great little scene where Mike Meyers plays a British military man who anticipates attacking a Nazi film premiere so he brings in an a film critic as an adviser. This may or may not be necessary but it does allow for a dialogue exchange like: Meyers: What do you do? Critic: I am a film critic.Meyers: What are your accomplishments? Even though the critic goes on to list some compilation books, it may as well be a rhetorical question.Tarantino thumbs his nose at convention and that is part of the movie's appeal. His movies are often about movies as much as they are about the content at hand. Yet he still manages to sustain genuine tension. The opening Nazi interrogation of a French farmer and a later a tavern basement guessing game scene must have had whopping page counts but they play out as chapters and remain engrossing high stakes set pieces. In the same film he can introduce a character by throwing a title onto the screen as if this member of the ""Basterds"" was cool enough to have his own movie, or play a 1980's David Bowie song while a woman prepares to do battle in her own way while Nazi flags hang outside the window.The movie takes place in an alternate universe that could either be a dream or the unreality of the grind-house era Tarantino has celebrated in Kill Bill and, well, Grindhouse. Anyone with a brain will get that. If that sounds good, see it. I notice now there are blurbs about ""how Jewish critics feel"" about the movie. Well, those who go to a movie with a deliberately misspelled title knowing it is a revisionist fantasy and can't bear to see the character of Hitler as the butt of the joke don't have an opinion worthy of note. If you are an expert on NASA, your views on George Lucas' Star Wars movies are not necessarily of use to me. In fact it's a little galling that such a critic-proof designation as ""Jewish critic"" should be trotted out. They can say what they like about a sensitive document with the intentions of Schindler's List and God bless them. But if someone gets his boxers in a bunch over slapstick Nazis or clueless Hitler autographing the Grain Diary for Indiana Jones, then they just aren't going to be the right audience for Inglourious Basterds. In fact they shouldn't be watching fun movies at all. They should try staring at a blank wall and talking to themselves rather than type up their blather.But it's not all fun. Sad things do happen and unfortunate events occur in this movie. The tension even in dialogue does come from the danger of having a Nazi at the table or someone daring to ask him to leave. But when you get reviewers comparing the Basterds to Al Qaida I think we can excuse those critics from the table as well. Or call Eli Roth over to them and yell ""Play ball!""",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Magnificent performance by Christoph Waltz!,"This is the Tarantino Movie of the 2000's no doubt, carried by fictional storyline set in WW2 that can only be hoped to have been real.The main highlight of the film is not the storyline or Brad Pitt but a magnificent performance by Christoph Waltz who portrays his role and speaks multiple languages flawlessly. How can someone be so talented and underrated at the same time. His performance will make you root for him despite him being the villain.Storyline and screenplay were as usual very good and Mr Waltz truly deserved the Oscar for his role.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Sorry sweaty-palmed fanboys - this is one of Tarantino's worst.,"Read on before you complain!I am a fan of Tarantino, so why give Basterds a middling rating, a score similar to such non-classics as Big Man Japan and Silent Hill?Well after the initial scene there just aren't any scenes that ""pop"" or are worthy of a zippy description.IB just isn't as intricate and tricky as I think it wants to be, so we are left with a movie with long drawn out scenes, not enough dialogue worthy of note and insufficient action to fill in the lengthy gaps. I think Tarantino felt this might become known as ""the one where some Jewish guys have a crack at Hitler"".As mentioned the best scene in IB is the first with all the hallmarks of a Tarantino special. In essence it is a German soldier politely but forcefully interrogating a Frenchman who he believes to be harbouring Jews, so I'll leave the description at that, because Tarantino makes it so much more that trying to describe it in more detail would be pointless.In broad terms though it has crackling dialogue, the tension builds throughout and the scene is allowed to play out over about 20 minutes, where other directors might give it 3, get to the payoff and move on.In Chapter Two we meet the Basterds – in another example of ""taking their word for it"", as we are informed that the Basterds are an elite team of vicious, mostly Jewish, soldiers hellbent on killing as many Nazis as possible and striking fear into enemy ranks.We are introduced to a couple of Basterds, a German named Hugo Stiglitz who is infamous and feared (again because we are told so) and the ""Bear Jew"", a man who carries a baseball bat and beats his victims to a bloody pulp, but mostly they remain a faceless bunch headed by one Bradley Pitt - you might have heard of him.Speaking of baseball bats, in the real life game of ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" I'd take a machine gun over a baseball bat every time. What does the Bear Jew do in combat, hang in the background until someone runs out of bullets? Or wait until a German soldier shows up with a club or bat so it is a fair fight? Seems a pretty inadequate weapon 99% of the time.We are given a couple of examples as to how the Basterds work, and EVERYONE has seen the speech Aldo Raine (Pitt) gives to his squad applicants, ""And I want my scalps!"" but they just don't seem that scary or menacing really. Nonetheless (because the plot says so) their reputation gets all the way to Mr Hitler himself, who deems them trouble enough that he takes time out of running a conflict involving several million soldiers to consider how he might deal with them.The remaining Chapters involve events that bring the main combatants into close proximity so that we might have some sort of climax to the film. In this case a Nazi propaganda film is to be premiered in a small French cinema, with many German dignitaries in attendance, including a man with an abbreviated mustache.This gives a small window of opportunity for assassins to kill most of the Nazi war machine in one crack, thereby ending the war (apparently). At least in this circumstance Tarantino didn't think small! Of course it leaks out that the premiere is happening and the British intelligence formulate a plan to bring in the Basterds and have them meet with a liaison to crash the premiere and do what they do best.Need I mention at this point we are about an hour and 40 minutes into the film, and the titular Inglourious Basterds have two on screen kills? Seems a little light in a war movie when they are the most feared soldiers in the entire war doesn't it? This movie isn't overlong, just ""over-nothing-worthwhile-happening"". I can sit through 2 and a half hours standing on my head if the movie justifies it, but I can't say that Inglourious Basterds gave me sufficient reward for my time, let alone ""Bang"" for my buck. There were almost more rounds fired in the standoff at the conclusion of Reservoir Dogs! Nazi Colonel Hans Landa, as the ""Jew Hunter"", is the best thing in the film and it is no surprise that he gets the best dialogue. The scenes in which he features provide some tension and menace that is not really tangible for the remainder of the film.As mentioned before the Basterds are largely under-utilised but that is also reflective in the fact that they are soldiers and this is a movie largely without battles and action.Tarantino sticks to his guns though and IB is again a movie made solely on his terms, the long drawn out scenes (many of them boring), considerable use of subtitles - even a bizarre section with a voice-over by Samuel L. Jackson for some reason - the music at times is also way too contemporary for a WW2 film, and if I bagged 300 for that then I must definitely point it out here.I think it's interesting that Tarantino chose to plot his film in an alternate version of WW2, because in an alternate universe Inglourious Basterds would have far more action and be a far superior film.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. As a director Tarantino aims for ""cool"" above all else. This just ain't that cool, regardless of what the sweaty palmed fanboys think.P.S. When I looked to IMDb to make sure I spelt a couple names right I saw that IB is currently in the top 100 ranked films of all time. This is surely just a sad joke.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"""Inglourious Basterds: A Cinematic Triumph""","First of all i want to say, ""I have NEVER seen such a performance ... ever!"" I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! Christoph Waltz's portrayal of Colonel Hans Landa in ""Inglourious Basterds"" is nothing short of mesmerizing. As the charming and cunning SS officer tasked with hunting down Jews in Nazi-occupied France, Waltz delivers a performance that is both chilling and captivating. What sets Waltz's performance apart is his ability to convey Landa's charm and menace simultaneously. Even in moments of apparent friendliness, there is always an underlying sense of danger lurking beneath the surface. This duality adds layers to the character, making him a formidable adversary and a captivating presence on screen. Christoph Waltz's portrayal of Colonel Hans Landa in film rightfully earned him critical acclaim and accolades, including an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His performance elevates the film to new heights, leaving a lasting impression on viewers and solidifying Landa as one of cinema's most memorable and complex characters.Now Movie review: Possible Spoiler!!Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglourious Basterds' is not just a movie; it's an experience. From the opening scene to the final frame, this film captivates viewers with its dynamic storytelling, expertly crafted characters, and a unique blend of genres that only Tarantino can deliver.Set during World War II, 'Inglourious Basterds' follows the story of a group of Jewish-American soldiers known as the Basterds, led by the charismatic Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), on a mission to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. Concurrently, the film introduces us to Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), a Jewish Frenchwoman seeking revenge against the Nazis who murdered her family.What sets 'Inglourious Basterds' apart is Tarantino's ability to subvert expectations and defy traditional genre conventions. The film seamlessly transitions between moments of tension and humor, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats while also eliciting laughter at unexpected turns of events. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and delivered with impeccable timing by a cast that includes Christoph Waltz, Diane Kruger, and Michael Fassbender.Visually stunning and meticulously crafted, 'Inglourious Basterds' is a love letter to classic cinema, paying homage to the spaghetti westerns and war films that inspired Tarantino. The cinematography, set design, and costume choices all contribute to creating a rich and immersive world that feels both authentic and heightened.But perhaps the most striking aspect of 'Inglourious Basterds' is its bold reimagining of history. Tarantino weaves a fictional narrative that allows for a satisfying sense of justice to be served, as the Basterds and Shosanna orchestrate a plot to assassinate Nazi leaders during a film premiere in Paris. This revisionist take on history is not only audacious but also thought-provoking, challenging viewers to reconsider the ways in which we engage with stories of the past.'Inglourious Basterds' is a tour de force of filmmaking that entertains, provokes, and ultimately leaves a lasting impact. It dares to push boundaries, defy conventions, and remind us of the power of cinema to transport us to new worlds and explore complex themes. A true masterpiece that deserves to be celebrated for its innovation, creativity, and sheer audacity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Inglorious Letdown,"I'm a die-hard Tarantino fan, so I was pretty psyched going into the theater. When I left, the most feeling I could sum up about the movie was 'meh'. It's got some great bits, don't get me wrong - the acting and the dialog, at times, are just amazing. But things draaaaag out, and between trying to be funny and trying to be serious, it fails at both.It's hard to cheer for the heroes, because their actions make them just as bad as those they torment. The film takes itself far, far too seriously, and that's really what ruins it.I don't mind the fairy-tale style, I don't mind the hyperactive violence. The acting, dialog and cinematography are amazing. But when put together, someone forgot how to edit a film for time and pacing, and found it all so amazing they couldn't cut a second more.It's disjointed, lengthy to the point of nausea, and amoral to the point of making the heroes no different from the villains.

Inglorious? Quite the opposite in fact,"I screened this movie tonight at USC, and I've needed the past few hours to organize my thoughts well enough to coherently describe the obscenely beautiful cinematic achievement that is Inglorious Basterds. Have you ever seen a movie and been struck nearly speechless when you're walking out of the theater? This movie blows those out of the proverbial water. I would have said speechless, but I was able to say the word wow, which I said an ungodly number of times. It wasn't until around now that I find myself able to at least write a slightly more aesthetically pleasing grouping of words. As usual Tarantino has given me deeper insight into the art form that is cinema, but even when compared to his previous, outstanding work, this film stands out. I would go into the depths of his work, analyzing the intricate beauty of each individual shot, but there isn't nearly enough room in this forum to do that. I will tell you that throughout this film you will be amazed. Brad Pitt delivers an amazing performance that is equal parts knee-slapping ""good ole boy"" and unrepentant mass murderer. You'll certainly laugh at his Tennessee accented minimalist Italian, and you'll definitely cringe at his inspired cranial ""artwork"". Christoph Waltz defines the phrase ""stand and deliver"" with his portrayal of Col. Hans Landa, an SS officer and noted Jew hunter. He'll make you cringe with his speeches, both at their content and the calm yet weighted manner with which he presents them. His manner has the feel of a kindly uncle, but you can feel the immense tension that each word he utters carries, as if a monster is lurking just below the surface, waiting to be released. Finally we have Eli Roth. To call his performance of Sgt. Donny Donowitz impressive would be a disservice. Even in the trailer his rage is palpable, but in the film it emanates from the screen, reaching out and touching the audience. With each swing of his already infamous baseball bat, this ""Bear Jew"" radiates that much more of his righteous anger. These performances would be more than enough to make this a great film, but they're just the tip of the iceberg. Supported by amazing actors such as Til Schweiger, Diane Kruger, Mélanie Laurent, B.J. Novak, and Daniel Brühl, these roles are pushed from simply great to truly inspiring. If you believe in the raw and awesome power of cinema then this is a film for you. If you just want to be entertained for a few hours then this is also a film for you. Regardless of how you feel about Quentin Tarantino I urge you to see this film, to be open to its powerful energy. This film will not only entertain, and teach, but will also provoke many philosophical discussions about the ethics, or lack thereof, displayed by its many characters. In closing I will merely say I intend to see this movie again, in theaters, and I hope you'll do that same.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Waltz with Pitt,"C. Waltz is the new discovery in this movie. He might have had a following in German speaking countries, but with this movie, he's getting world famous. Speaking 4 languages (and that's only in this movie, who knows how many more he is able to master) and being the main actor in this, despite the title of the movie. Which leads us to one thing that might be appalling to some people (especially to those who love(d) the original ""Inglorious Bastards"").The thing is that the ""Basterds"" (and yes the spelling mistake was intentional by Mr. Tarantino) do not get that much screen time. It's almost as if their story isn't the main act. You could have a problem with that (not only as a fan as stated above), so be aware that this is more an ensemble picture. And as said, Mr. Waltz is fantastic (I'm pretty sure we're gonna see more of him soon). Brad Pitt would be the second one to mention. Eli Roth on the other hand, as fun as it is to see him on the big screen, he just doesn't fit the bill. Til Schweiger and the other German and European actors are all really good. I'd say that some give the performance of their life.Speaking of the actors, one of the things that I really loved, is the fact that the movie is at least tri-lingual (is that a word?), french/German/English (with a bit of Italian thrown in there for good measure). That means a lot of subtitles if you watch the original version. But it works (imo) and makes the movie that much better.Another thing that you shouldn't expect though, is too much action. I heard quite a few people that criticized the movie, for being too talky. But that's Tarantino for you. There is action of course, but the long running time (might be a bummer for some) is made up by many conversations. There is tension, there is fun to be had, but the movie does take it's time to reach it's goal. Again, something that won't work for everybody. Great movie that cements Tarantinos status as great director.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
A Unique Masterpiece from Tarantino,"Every Quentin Tarantino (QT) fan must see Inglorious Basterds, like every QT movie a person's unable to assign one drama, this movie is a perfect blend of war, comedy, action, thriller, drama, and romance. I was unable to take my eyes off of Christopher Waltz's performance as Colon Hans Landa or 'The Jew Hunter.' The story is a masterpiece, but I can tell that this movie, like most QT movies are going to be underrated and will lack in awards it deserves. I think Christopher Waltz should easily be a nominee. I think this movie should also win Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. But even if this incredible film doesn't get recognized in awards I can tell that it will go down as one of the best war movies ever made in history. I think its amazingly creative of QT not to follow the criteria that history gave him, he changes the actual history of the war with his characters. Pure Genius.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Brilliantly offbeat wartime western,"Wow. It's been a while since I left a movie theatre so overwhelmed. From the first minute to the last this movie is shocking, amusing and horrendously entertaining all at the same time. The prologue is vintage Tarantino. The way the tension is build up throughout that opening scene is truly magnificent, and the camera pans down just at the right time. And by that time you've already learned to absolutely despise Landa, probably the most disgusting character Tarantino ever came up with. He's truly a man you love to hate, and his charming persona just makes him seem even more evil. He's if possible even more threatening than Jules Winfield was in the infamous breakfast scene from ""Pulp Fiction"". The segments with the basterds are probably the ones Tarantino had the most fun with, and these segments really know no boundaries in any way. Not only are they hilariously violent (the baseball bat!), they also ignore every possible historic fact. I wouldn't really want it any other way really. Another highlight is the bar scene, which illustrates perfectly how unpredictable this movie is. There are too many good moments to be naming them all, but this movie benefits so much from its outrageousness you really need to see everything for yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Larger than life in the best cinematic ways,"Inglourious Basterds (2009)We all know by now that Quentin Tarantino is in love with the movies, so it's no surprise that much of this film centers are around an astonishing movie theater. But his love of movies also shows in the way he works with classic ideas and great visual strategies that come from decades of the best of Hollywood. The very first scene is like a remake from some classic Western--John Ford or Sergio Leone, take your pick--with the isolated family seeing trouble coming in, ever so gradually, from the far distance.And then trouble arrives, and it unfolds here like a croissant in the morning sun, steam slowly rising into the French Provincial air. This, you'll see, or you know already, is film-making at its best, old-school or new-school, it doesn't matter. The suspense, the elegant and fluid camera-work, the astonishing writing and even more astonishing delivery by the two men at this very first juncture, playing a kind of ""I know what you are thinking"" kind of game, all drawn out in a breathtaking, poetic, nerve-wracking way.Then all hell breaks loose. This is the other side of Tarantino, the violent violence, where the blood is too red and too balletic to be real. I don't have the ability to step out of this kind of on screen gore and so it shocks me every time, and it seems like the movie might work just as well (or better) with implied violence, rather than splattering it in your face. But this director, I think, sees all of it from a director's point of view--that everything is artifice, including the preceding scene with the two men, where I, for one, was impressed partly by believing it, by being completely sucked in. Which makes the offputting violence that follows all the more upending.I have no doubt it is this push-pull effect that makes all of Tarantino's films have that energy few others can match. In this case, there is a lot of plain old fun built into seeing the bad guys get what they deserve (I felt a weird pleasure, which I confess and which I don't understand, in seeing one very particular bad guy shot to pieces near the end), and a lot of suspense as you root for the unlikely heroes. The archetypes, like Brad Pitt's good bad guy role with a Kentucky accent (better than your Italian, Brad), and the more original characters, like the young woman who owns the theater and is truly trapped by circumstances, equally make their scenes larger than life.In fact, Inglourious Basterds is pure Hollywood in the way it makes everything on the screen larger than life. Isn't that what the golden age of Hollywood was all about? Yes. And it is exactly what some directors like Tarantino are still bent on pulling off. A great film. Whatever the problems and the gore, this strikes me as a perfect film the way Fargo is perfect, or Reservoir Dogs. Tastes aside, you have to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"A slight return to form for Tarantino, but there are still problems.","Quentin Tarantino. While the majority of people would tell you that he is a genius filmmaker who hasn't one bad film to his name, there is a small, but vocal minority who will tell you that while he is talented, he hasn't made anything fantastic for a while. Sure, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are masterpieces and Jackie Brown is his most mature work, but his other work has been deeply disappointing to say the least. The Kill Bill movies were self- indulgent, badly written and overly sadistic, and Death Proof was just boring. So would Inglourious Basterds be a late return to form? Well, while good, it doesn't present Tarantino at his best, and the film is still problematic as a whole.The story is that during their occupation of France, the Nazis premiere a propaganda film at a theater to celebrate their achievements. When this is found out, many use this as a plan to kill the Nazis once and for all, including the British army, the theater's owner Shoshanna who has a vendetta against the Nazis and a group known as the Basterds, a bunch of American Jews who have traveled to France in order to kill Nazis.While the plot is non-linear like Tarantino's other films, it suffers from the fact that there is a lot of pointless material in the film. Many characters who have no effect on the story are killed off, some scenes go on for way too long & some of the protagonists are deeply unlikable. This mainly implies to the Basterds themselves, who despite their cause, are portrayed as sadistic psychopaths who kill and torture many Nazis, despite some of the Nazis having legitimate grievances (i.e. having a child, keeping quiet to protect their fellow men). I'm not expecting a film like this to portray Nazis with Downfall-esque sympathy, but considering that most of the Nazis in the film are shown to be more human than in other films, the constant sadism feels unnecessary, and you can't help but feel that the Basterds are no better than the Nazis themselves.The film's sadism is a major problem. Tarantino has a weird love for extreme violence, which would be fine provided that this was a more tongue in cheek context, but considering that the movie has a mostly straight face, you can't help but feel that the movie goes too far in places. This includes cutting the scalps off Nazis, beating them to death with baseball bats, torturing an innocent witness by sticking their fingers into a bullet wound and seeing someone get strangled to death, made even more disturbing by how it is partially real (Tarantino actually strangled one of his actresses to make the film look more real). Lovely.It's a shame that the film is bogged down by being overly long and overly sadistic, as there is some great stuff in there. As many others have pointed out, the opening scene is brilliant. Great acting, dialogue, cinematography and pacing. It's also a perfect example of how Tarantino should use his unique brand of dialogue, to be quirky and advance the story, instead of using it to ramble. It's definitely the best scene in the film, and continues 2009's tradition of having great opening scenes (i.e. Watchmen, Up) in films.On top of this, some of the characters are very well done. Shoshanna is the best character in the film, being the most three-dimensional and interesting, and her story arc in the film is the most compelling because of it, essentially being the brilliant female revenge story that Kill Bill should have been. You just wish the whole movie was focused on her, but still, her scenes are where the film reaches its peak, and Melanie Laurent delivers one of the best (and sadly underrated) performances in recent memory. It's also a very well- made film. The cinematography is gorgeous, the sets and production design are well done, and the acting is very good from everybody, even though I feel that some are wasted, mainly that of Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz, the latter of whom does the absolute best with a weak character. If you want to see him at his best, watch The Zero Theorem instead.It's because of these things that I feel that while Inglourious Basterds is a slight return to form for Tarantino, it's still dragged down by many of Tarantino's usual faults. From the overly sadistic violence of the film, to the overlong running time, to the self-indulgent touches to the film (i.e. having a Mike Myers cameo, or Samuel L. Jackson as a narrator, clearly his easiest paycheck yet), the film's positive attributes, while present, are still balanced out by the film's many faults. It's definitely a step forward, but there's still some work to be done.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Garbage Movie,"This movie was garbage. A pretentious, self-indulgent mess. It consisted of interminable dialogue and a paper-thin plot stretching out over nearly three hours. Booooooooring!

And another thing: why do the opening credits have to be modeled after a film from the 60s or 70s? For what possible reason? In Jackie Brown and Death Proof it made sense, as each was an homage to styles past. But why do it for this one? Yes, Quentin, we know what a big fan of these eras you are. We get it. Move on. And why the cartoon title over Hugo what's-his-name? Tarantino didn't do much else like this in the film. It just threw it off balance for me. What'd he make this stuff up as he went along? And is it true that Tarantino rushed production to get the movie done in time to compete at Cannes? If so, that is the dumbest and most narcissistic thing I've ever heard. I'm tired of listening to this guy talk about how much god-given talent he has. Make an entertaining movie, for pete's sake! Reign yourself in!

Inglourious Basterds Review from Melbourne Film Festival,"Last night I caught a screening of Inglourious Basterds as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival. Before the movie even begun, I'll say that there was a great atmosphere by being surrounded by two cinemas filled exclusively with excited Tarantino fans. A film like this is always going to be much more enjoyable if you're watching it together with like-minded individuals.So as the trailers show, the film is basically a spaghetti western set in Nazi-occupied France from 1941-1944. The trailers would also have you believe that this is Brad Pitt's movie and that he and his Basterds are the stars of the show. However, the Basterds themselves are only one of many parts that make up the story, as there is a very large ensemble cast that all have different narratives, only linking up towards the end of the film.One of the highlights of this film for me was Christoph Waltz as the sadistic Nazi Jew Hunter Hans Landa. You can really see why he was rewarded with a Best Actor Award at Cannes for his effort here, as he truly dominates the film. The first scene of the movie in particular, where he slowly interrogates a Jewish family to find if they are hiding anybody or anything, is truly thrilling, suspenseful and possibly my favorite part of the movie.Violence is used sparingly, but effectively. Some of it is jarringly realistic (yes, there is some scalping) but most of it is done in a darkly humorous way. There is also a great shootout scene that is so fast and choreographed so well that it is a real blast to watch. It's not Tarantino's most violent film, in fact it would probably be one of his tamer movies, but you've got to remember who we're talking about here. When things do get bloody, it makes for a bloody great time at the movies.Unfortunately, some things don't work out quite as well. The main thing that bothered me is that the cast is so large, that it feels like we don't get to know the characters as well as what we would like. The film is split up into five different chapters, and these chapters are generally made up a scene of lengthy dialogue that eventually leads towards a vicious conclusion. While this is enjoyable to sit through and it feels as though the dialogue is always taking us towards a relevant ending, it also makes us feel as though we have only really sat through 5 scenes and then the movie is over. In fact, despite the two and a half hour running time, I could have been happy if this movie went for an extra hour or more. Even if he split it into two films or made it into a miniseries it might have been more satisfying.The ending was good, but a little underwhelming. This didn't leave me with the same emotional high as the ending of something like Reservoir Dogs. In fact, when the credits came up I just felt a little disappointed that it had finished so soon. However, if two and half hours go by that fast, with your eyes glued to the screen the whole time, I guess you can't complain too much. I suppose I was just hoping for a little more of an exclamation mark in the movies final moments.The music is always a very important part of a Tarantino movie, and in Inglourious Basterds I felt it was a bit of a mixed bag. Some of it was sublimely awesome, such as David Bowie's Cat People, while some of it felt a little autopilot. For example, some of the music that Tarantino uses he has also used in his Kill Bill films. I know that the music is not original to those films to begin with, but hearing it again so recently from another film from the same director, I found it a little distracting. Then again, that might just be because I have seen the Kill Bill films so many times that I now find the music attached to those scenes. If I watch Inglourious Basterds a few more times then perhaps my opinion might change.All in all, it was a great movie, but it wasn't up there with Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction. Still, if you are looking forward to seeing this I don't think that you will be disappointed. This is truly an event film and something that will work at its best on a big screen with a big audience. I'm already excited about seeing it for a second time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Golden Acting from Waltz!,"I've always been a big fan of Tarantino films, and this was certainly a good addition to his line-up of entertaining films, even though it wasn't his best.The overall plot, in my opinion, wasn't the strongest. It didn't feel like it was well drawn up and instead felt quite disorganised, in particular, I didn't feel as if the Basterds fitted in well with the rest of the plot. Their role in the movie felt rather forced, and the scenes with the Basterds were, in my opinion, the weakest scenes in the movie.Yet, while the plot wasn't really rich, the film made up for it with its tense, memorable scenes and memorable performances. As expected with Tarantino, he builds up the tension with lengthy scenes and long periods of dialogue. Oh, and of course the comedic over-the-top violence that Tarantino is renowned for does occur in this movie don't worry, but at no point was it out of place.But really, what made the film was the acting from Christoph Waltz. Before this film, Waltz was a relatively unknown actor hailing from Vienna, yet afterwards, he was transformed into a mainstream actor who all of the film directors are chasing after, and after watching Inglourious Basterds, you can see why. Waltz played the part of SS Colonel Landa to perfection. Honestly the character is one of the best villains ever in cinema history in my opinion. It was just the sheer competence, elegance and ruthlessness the man possessed made him absolutely compelling. Tarantino himself had fears that the role simply could not be played, yet Waltz completely smashed his fear, with style.As for the rest of the acting, I have to give good mention to Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger, and overall the general acting performances were solid, although, I am critical of Brad Pitt. I felt, especially as one of the main characters, he didn't really create any connection with the viewer, and the role was relatively pedestrian and simple, so this shouldn't be a film that Pitt is renowned for.Overall though, whilst the film wasn't Tarantino's best, it's certainly a film that was very entertaining and kept my interest the whole way through, so it's certainly worth watching, especially to witness the incredible acting from Waltz. I'd give the movie 8.3/10, which is what it currently is rated at.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Very good!,"I liked it a lot to tell the truth. Again Tarantino giving us good characters like Aldo, Emmanuelle and obviously Hans Landa, the music is very well placed and I liked how the stories that are presented in chapters are connected very well to reach the final climax. The whole scene that happens near the end is one of the best I've ever seen in a film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Weird in a good way,My first watch of Inglorious Basterds left me uttering with raised eyebrows. Like all of Tarantino's movies it is really violent. However the style of this movie feels a little different compared to his other movies. It feels like a story is being told but every scene still feels real. I think this is because of amongst other things the oscar worthy acting of Christoph Waltz. I have never seen a stare that intimidating. It is one of my favourite performances in a movie ever. Rivaling that of Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. Overall I didn't really like every scene in the movie especially with the Jewish Americans. It felt out of character to have them with the elegance and intimidating Hans Landa. But is also makes for a nice contrary.Overall I realise the movie has enough flaws and doesn't deserve a 10/10 but it still is my favourite movie ever.9/10.,9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Inglourious Basterds,"Drama comes from the people to the subsequent paragraphs dialogue will happen violence expectations, the so-called ""the calm before the storm"", quentin use dialogue a little approaching the critical point, that is his forte, similar examples are ""true romance"" theo Ken Wright and history in his dad's dialogue, ""reservoir dogs"" at the end of the dialogue, etc. The dramatic tension would not be as strong without the explosive ""tipping point"" that gives the audience expectation, such as the opening of Reservoir Dogs and Quentin's passage in Four Rooms, which is pure lip service.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
What shall the history books read?,"As Christoph Waltz's Nazi colonel states at one point, ""what shall the history books read?"" is an important theme of this Quentin Tarantino movie that subverts history to present an alternative look at how World War II might have shaped up with a few unwise choices from the Nazis. The plot has Hitler, Goebbels and other high ranking officials attending a propaganda film premiere together - something that gives two factions the same idea to blow up the Nazis. As per Tarantino norm, 'Inglourious Basterds' benefits from snappy dialogue and memorable characters, but this is very much an ensemble piece and sadly not all the characters are fascinating. Waltz is excellent with his cunning interrogations and Mélanie Laurent has some excellent moments as Jewish woman living under a pseudonym and operating the theatre where the propaganda film will be shown. None of the other characters are particularly remarkable though (same goes for the performances), especially Brad Pitt and the over-the-top Italian accent that he inflects at one point. Pitt does get some of the film's best lines though, including in the final memorable scene. Add in some superb spinning shots from Robert Richardson and this is a pretty good- looking film too, but whether it has much to offer beyond its novelty of twisting historical fact, as sometimes happens in the history books, is debatable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Trash,"Some people have outgrown prepubescence and find this a very disturbing sign to were the world is heading with morons making films such as this one and influencing western youth. That's somewhat hopeful.Even seen from a purely aesthetic standpoint and not a moral one putting Jewish people under hiding in the south of France to the sounds of a spaggeti western and cutting into the fake southern accent of Brad Pit can only be the work of a true cretin.This tired provocation and disrespect to human suffering is as insidious as it is boring. And that's the most tragic thing of all to me.Just cause some video store freak once got lucky throwing in a few old clichés doesn't mean we have to perpetually suffer as a global culture to this garbage. And what is worse he's created a whole new generation who savour artifacts that are worse than dirt, and favour and proliferate them.I am barely holding back from wishing this guy a fate similar to the many splatter scenes he's subjected the world into. That would make some sense, if some idiot chooses to replicate scene after scene after scene of sadistic graphic brutality enabling and recreating it in the world it would make sense that he suffer through it, wouldn't it. But that would be going along his mentality, the twisted, stupid vindictive one. So I would reason that more awareness of this trash is the imperative, so more people can avoid their insidious ways, and will thus be better off. But I don't foresee much hope there. Anyway.As for the holocaust read Primo Levi, watch Shindler's List, and the lovable Mel Brooks take on it, and try educating yourself on the reality of this unnamable horror that was the persecution of the Jewish people by the German people. And let's bear in mind that this hasn't been of course the sole genocide, but there are other ones in history that are comparable and even more brutal. Some are occurring right now in the genocide of the Kurdish people by the Turkish people, and of the Chinese people on their minorities. Others like the genocide of the Indian people by the American people occurred further down in history. And also becoming aware to the fact that the Jewish state has committed atrocities of immeasurable magnitude to the Palestinian people, atrocities that should never have been committed by a people that suffered so much in their own persecution by others.And vote this garbage down to send this moron back to shelving videos.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Perfection,"One of the few movies I watched two or three times when it premiered in theater- very special case for me. Movie is a unique blend of action, comedy, drama and war thriller I don't think previously achieved before. Script is amazing, for me it is the best Tarantino movie. Production values, sound, picture and soundtrack are all fitting perfectly. The main gem of the show is, of cause, acting of all involved and especially Waltz. His depiction of SS colonel Landa will forever be one of the greatest examples of pure acting ability rarely reproduced before or after on a big screen. Brad Pitt is hilarious as hell and a few scenes ( introduction scene with Landa, bar shootout, Laurent heroine killed) are iconic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
This is my new favorite movie!,"QT did not disappoint. When a friend recommended this movie, i had only heard of it. I had never watched it. But this is absolute cinema! The blend of Brad Pitts quite upbeat character in the combination with Christoph Waltz' serious and psychopathic acting makes this movie a must-watch! Now, i really don't know what all these people are saying about, that Brad Pitts performance sucks or, that QT missed the mark with this movie. I mean, awards speak for themselves: 25 for Waltz and 8 for Brad Pitt. This movie is genuinely great. It is pretty violent, but my friend normally hates violent movies and loved this one!

I love the way that the stories here intersect and at one point you are watching Brad Pitt select his troops for his new mission and the next thing you know we are right in the thick of it watching them do the mission, we skip over all the boring stuff that happened in between, that is good story telling!

Inglourious Basterds,"What is ""Inglourious Basterds"" about? In my opinion, it's not about World War II, it's not about history, it's actually about liars. As soon as the film started, a French liar appeared on stage. Look at how calm he was. He was washing his face and smoking, looking like he loved someone, and looking like he had a clear conscience. He looked like an honest man. He looks like a human being. It is said that his acting skills are really good. It takes two years of practice at least. Ordinary people like us really can't spot Ziwu Maoyou. It's a pity that the little liar met the ancestor. He is as good as his master. One foot, when Colonel Hans Landa pulled out a giant pipe, I burst out laughing on the spot, pretending, I asked you to pretend, look at your aggressiveness, you must be stupid this time. Sure enough, the liar had a nervous breakdown and burst into tears. He felt sorry for the Jewish family hiding under the floor. They met unkind people and trusted unkind people. If you want to find someone who is good at cheating, you can do it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Tarantino - settled down already??,"For the freshest and most important director of the past two decades, 'Inglourious Basterds' is not a step in the right direction. It's a step in the wrong direction. Though enjoyable at times and extremely well crafted, it is a smug and arrogant piece of work; one that has little maturity and is essentially a joke.Having time to think about the film, it's not actually THAT bad. Just being a huge admirer of Tarantino (Though 'Jackie Brown' set me awry slightly) i expected so much more. I wanted a vision and more of Tarantino's desperately engaging dialogue, and instead i got a completely mediocre story with a mediocre (in fact quite a poor) script, with a director who seems to have stopped taking himself seriously!The film ultimately revolves around killing Nazis. Killing, slaughtering and laughing at Nazis. Now, that seems like a cheap shot to me. I mean, I just think there has to be more to a film than just killing and making jokes about the tyranny of Hitler. That's just too easy. Of course everyone in the world would agree that that is acceptable and now, more than half a century later, OK to laugh at, but it just upsets me that a director with the power and class of Tarantino would go for such a simple and easy story. It just feels like he's giving in to film as an enterprise over film as an art-form. I'd hate to use the term 'sell-out', because the film isn't that bad exactly, but it's definitely a step in that direction.Though amidst the (maybe slightly unfair) pounding and hammering I am giving Tarantino and this film, there are some great moments, and great new acting gems. Til Schweiger is definitely someone to look out for, as is B.J. Novak, though contrary to popular opinion, I really didn't think Christoph Waltz was that impressive. He just didn't add enough to the character of Col. Hans as a real great actor would do.Tarantino found time to keep the film self-referential and stylish, with lots of French New-Wave and Western homages to appreciate, though it just failed on me with such a silly plot. I've not quite lost my faith in Tarantino, just jarred it a bit, and I won't expect as much when he makes another film.So, overall, a good film if you don't take it too seriously; a very disappointing film if you had Tarantino on some sort of Godly pedestal. Because it really did make me upset. I don't think we'll see any improvement in his work from here on. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Words as weaponry,"Note: this comment was edited to meet IMDb length guidelines.I first saw ""Inglourious Basterds"" in late July and concluded that it would flop and Tarantino would never again be relevant. Needless to say, I didn't like it and didn't even expect to see it again. Late August and Tarantino certainly seems relevant again. His biggest opening at the box office, rapturous media reviews, and a surprising amount of hype. Word of mouth is excellent. It remains to be seen how steady the movie's box office performance will be, but after the tepid reception at Cannes, the movie proved an unlikely hit. Two viewings later and ""Inglourious Basterds"" is probably my favorite movie of the year.Why I initially reacted the way I did is increasingly mysterious to me, was it expectations of a men-on-a-mission film unfulfilled, the then seemingly tedious and over-written verbal jousts? Consciously or subconsciously, I didn't want to like the movie. I tutted at the glee with which the movie portrayed the violence the basterds inflicted. I resisted the charm of the film's construct, acknowledging that it was more than I expected it to be while at the same time lamenting Tarantino's juvenile and silly handling of such serious subject matter.The truth, which has been revealed to me by two further viewings of the film, is that ""Inglourious Basterds"" might very well be Tarantino's greatest film, eclipsing even his most mature work to date ""Jackie Brown"". This is a glorious subversion of the dreary holocaust drama, a Spaghetti Western with WWII iconography, a love letter to the movies, and it is, every step of the way, aware of exactly what it's doing. In the end it basically comes down to personal opinion on whether this was a success or not, but what seems plainly obvious to me is that there is absolutely nothing about this film that is clumsy. The time and care taken with the screenplay is obvious, as is the time taken to edit the film. The Cannes cut wasn't longer, but it was apparently different in construct and differently-woven. When we're talking about a movie which depends entirely on: a) tension built through dialogue and character interaction, and b) the pacing of those scenes and how the scenes fit together, this could explain the significant difference between the reception at Cannes and the critical reception upon actual release.The performance of the cast collectively is probably the most obviously praise-worthy aspect of the film. The Basterds are lovable and humorous, but also portray just the right amount of savagery to make it clear that what they're doing isn't child's play, and Brad Pitt is a standout as Aldo Raine, giving a fun comic performance but also creating perhaps the most sympathetic character in the film outside Melanie Laurent, whose Shosanna Dreyfus is the emotional core of the film. She also feels more like a film character than a real person, something Tarantino is aware of, as she is written as a classical tragic hero, complete with a deliberately clichéd romance and a climax to her story which really sums up everything this movie is about in its self-aware artifice and theatrical grandeur. Diane Kruger impresses as Bridget von Hammersmark, despite being given the tricky job of playing an actress. Undoubtedly the performance of the film, of the year, is Christoph Waltz's Hans Landa. It's perfect. It's exactly what it needed to be, and the wrong actor in that role would have destroyed the film.In Tarantino's own words, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is about the power of cinema bringing down the Third Reich. An even better description would be the power of words challenging the power of violence. Intentionally or not, that is one of the most interesting parallels drawn in ""Inglourious Basterds"". In more than one scene verbal battles turn into violence, but in as many scenes the threat of violence is kept at bay by the power of words and acting, a major component of cinema. Tarantino's wordplay here isn't just characters saying cool stuff to one another, it's the entire language of the movie, the weapon of choice for his characters. Many say Tarantino should write plays if he's just going to have characters talk to each other for ages, but that wouldn't make sense because he delights as much in the conversation and his actors' performance as he does in their context in his film, and his films always feature the cinematic, except for ""Reservoir Dogs"".""Inglourious Basterds"" is all about the cinema, and where the movie references in ""Kill Bill"" were part of a pastiche of B-movie cinema, ""Inglourious Basterds"" works the references seamlessly into a genuinely involving story, albeit one with a healthy dose of silliness and dark humor. Where I initially thought Tarantino failed most significantly was where he succeeded most greatly: in his attempt to create a grand love letter to the power of cinema. Tarantino proves literate in more than just junk film here- for all the allusions to macaroni combat films and spaghetti westerns, it's ultimately a gonzo celebration of high art. The entire film is burlesque in nature, best seen as a deliberately artificial cinematic recreation of WWII rather than straightforwardly as a WWII war film of any nature.More than any of his other movies, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is about cinema. It's not just subtext, it's the reality of the film which is so tied to the world of cinema. The film may be total fantasy, and it has no qualms about depicting the cathartic power of violence, but it's ultimately taut, tense, entertaining, funny, and most importantly sort of beautiful in its own grandiose, bizarre manner. As Aldo declares his final act of brutality in the film his masterpiece, Tarantino seems to be declaring this film his own. Call it kosher porn, call it whatever you like, what I ultimately see this as is a tribute to cinephilia made with far more heart than I expected.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
War has never been so much fun,"Inglourious Basterds is a funny, bold and very well-acted tale about a group of Jewish-American soldiers targeting Nazis in France during World War II. I'd say it's easily Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction, and contains his trademark mix of serious violence, off-key comedy, and hair-raising drama.It's also fuelled by Tarantino's favourite theme of revenge. The central characters are the highlight, and very well drawn; particularly the German Colonel Hans Landa, who's a mix of Hans Gruber and Dr, Evil. Equally standout is Brad Pitt's no nonsense Lt. Aldo Raine replete with thick southern accent, whose deadpan humour and stoicism run-up nicely against the film's macabre tone.It's a long and dialogue-heavy film and some scenes run well beyond modern cinematic time norms, echoing the pace of 70s classics such as The Dirty Dozen or Bridge Over The River Kwai. It's also divided up into sequential chapters separating out characters' lives, but tells a story in a coherent way Kill Bill didn't.There are a couple of scenes that are very long (particularly the basement rendezvous set-up) but they sort of torture with their tension and you remain hooked in. At times Inglourious Basterds is very violent and comically so, and that will turn some people off. It's also sort of flippant about serious themes (in the same way Guy Ritchie treats his subjects) and that might also bother some. Personally I laughed at the outrageous breaking of taboos and remixing of history and so did the audience. Tarantino shows in this film how much mastery he has in the difficult job of mixing the grotesque and the comedic.There are also some nice, wry post-modern touches such as a film critic being recruited as an assassin. In Inglorious Basterds he does what he does best – great characters in extreme environments doing mad things in a funny and violent fashion Finally, the ending is excellent. Masterpiece indeed. I'd happily watch it again.This was shown as a preview in London and Tarantino did a Q&A afterwards.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Hey, It's Tarantino!","I've read so many of the naysayers. Giving this a one rating seems really spiteful. They speak of Walz's excellence in his role. If there is an actor of such incredible skill, how can one give it one star. Yes this is violent. Yes it is gratuitous. Yes it stretches the bound of reality. But Tarantino pushes the envelope at every turn in every movie. My God, what about ""Django Unchained."" There will always be flying body parts and characters of almost supernatural proportions. The plot that leads to the face-off in the movie theater is very intricate and does stretch our believability meter, but it is really engaging. Yes, the Germans are interesting in their own ways. Remember, this is not a propaganda film. We are put into a setting that is not for one instance a real portrayal of an historical event.

a master popularizer at his very best,"Tarantino was never much of a philosopher, humanist, or world historian – just someone so utterly immersed in cinema that he could translate his obsession into terms that seemed not just relevant but also emotionally engaged. Now, at a rather troublesome and ambiguous moment, he takes on the Nazi film, with Bowery Jews and Southern lieutenants teaming up in a simple-minded crusade against Evil. In so doing, he offers more evidence that he's drinking from a bottomless well – that the movies can, and should, do anything. This is especially propitious since it comes along at a moment when cinema history is going down the toilet almost as fast as world history. More than ever he's playing the film prof here, but unlike his Americanism, his cinephilia is not triumphalist: he knows too much about his subject to lie about it. Glorious tributes to Sergio Leone and Raiders of the Lost Ark (and King Kong!!) vie with articulate digs at Pabst and Jannings and nitrate film. And yet it's anything but an in-crowd movie; I'm sure I don't get half the references myself. Instead, he sculpts these elements as a master popularizer, boiling them down into a teeming, bizarre concoction that is both devastating and offhand, manic yet full of grace, a jokester who delivers the punchline as if his life depended on it. And while you can always hear him talking, it's the overtones and cross-rhythms of his superbly attuned cast that bring it to life. This is as close to profundity as this man will ever get - pretty damn close.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Bold, brutal and brilliant.","Even though the title is virtually identical to Enzo G. Castellari's 1978 Italian warsploitation 'classic' The Inglourious Bastards, Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is most definitely NOT a remake. Far from it. Not only is it one of Tarantino's more original efforts to date, but it also one of his best films for a long time, a riveting tale of derring-do that features plenty of everything that made his first two movies such a success: great dialogue, wonderful performances (Christoph Waltz is brilliant, as is an almost unrecognisable Mike Myers), excellent pacing, impressive direction, explosive violence, fantastic use of music, and more than a few playful visual touches of the kind that only Quentin seems to be able to get away with.Despite being fairly talky in places, with the bulk of the dialogue spoken in either German or French (and subtitled in English), the film is a thoroughly absorbing experience, with not a boring moment in its entire 153 minutes. The long conversational scenes are brilliantly executed and entertaining in their own right, but they also serve to make the violence seem even more explosive and brutal when it happens. And boy, is it nasty when it wants to be, with bloody scalpings, repeated baseball bat blows to the skull, and point-blank gunshots to the nether regions amongst the graphic carnage on display.It's not all typically cool Tarantino monologues and OTT gore, though: in an extremely bold move, the writer/director eventually steers events into fantastical territory, rewriting history to suit his whims. Those who have slated the film for its lack of historical accuracy are completely missing the point: Quentin is giving us his version of events, entertainment being the number one priority, facts be damned. It's daring movie-making and a whole lot of fun when approached with the right attitude.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Inglorious Basterds 2009 Review,"Tarantino does it again. Although not my favorite Tanantino film, it's still really great!
If you've seen any of his previous work you know exactly what to expect.
Inglorious Basterds does some masterful buildup. It all builds up to that finale, which is satisfying and so worth the 2 hour wait.
Within the two hours before the finale contains some of the best character building i've seen, with some great acting (as usual, Tarantino knows exactly who he wants) that just make the film come alive. That combined with some tense action and some extremely suspenseful moments keep you on your toes the entire time.

Self Indulgent Cocaine Induced Stupor,"I have as many seen all Tarantino's work and loved the majority of it but I have also as many noticed a steady spiral downwards in his work culminating with inglorious bastards. Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are three films that I could easily watch over and over again while Inglorious Bastards I had trouble sitting through once. It was the first films EVER that I contemplated walking out of. . .this might be due to the fact that I rarely go to the cinema on a whim but Tarantino carried so much credit in my book that I went on the day it opened without reading anything about the work.It seems to me that no one really has the courage to say what they think...that this movie is something they would expect from a B or even C production! The story line is absolute garbage and all though I sat through the whole 150 minutes of the film I couldn't help but think that Mr Tarantino should stay of Cocaine and maybe watch some classics again before making a movie. Inglorious Bastards is like a WW2 comedy with a Western Twist...I hated it. There is not a single part of the movie which is historical accurate including things like uniforms, weapons etc. which by the end of the movie was the least of my concern. The acting was by in large rubbish...perhaps Brad Pitts worst performance. The only light point in the movie when it comes to acting is the performance of Christoph Waltz in his role of the SS Col. Hans Landa.All in all there is not much reason to see this film...there a couple of funny moments and several well done gory scenes apart from that tickets for this film should be given away for free.All of this being said I think that this movie will be well received by the general audience who will most likely praise it for being courageous and what not but the reality is that if this movie was made by someone not famous it would have been labeled as what it is...absolute rubbish.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Not that great,"Just another terrentino film trying to be a western with over the top gratuitous violence to try and shock the audience. The story is basic and contrived. It's not that the acting is bad given the material - they do the best they have to work with but to call this a great or good film doesn't make a lot of sense. There is no special underlying message. Just a lot of violence for the sake of violence and to satisfy Quentin's strange fascination with blood and gore and thinking that makes him a great writer and director.

Pornography of violence against Nazis with prominent flashes,"Shortly I could describe this movie as a mess. A collection of barely connected scenes that seem to exist more for themselves than for the plot as a whole. It is unbelievable how one director can make a perfect dialogue scene and primitive vandalism of some barbaric group, one after another. Can't say whether that was by accident or intentional sarcasm. The dialogue scenes are simply wonderful, with tension so dense that could be cut with a knife, all concluded with a good endings and twists. Truly, scenes I unfortunately can't find in any modern American movie. Use of original languages must also not be forgotten. However the problems amount with the arrival of uncivilized Jewish-American death squad. Jews and Americans, no offense meant, but what's seen in this movie is simply ridiculous! A bunch of nobodies, hunting like rabbits, members of the world's most dreadful military machine since medieval Mongols!? A very cheap national morale boost in a manner ""if they can be dirty we can be even more"". It is making fun out of the whole Second world war tragedy. Being the story fictitious or not it does not justify the told. Curiously the movie offers a great irony by itself, lieutenant Raine, the leader of Inglorious Basterds, who is as I see it a parody of prevailing simplistic American misunderstanding of the World in which they take important part. Similarly, mentioned extremes of the movie offer no understanding for each other whatsoever. Deciding the rating is therefore impossible.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

The best inaccurate war film of all time,"Inglorious basterds is without a doubt one of my favourite films, not just from the past decade but the past few years. It combines Taratino's classic satire and intense drama into one amazing viewing experience. Nothing can describe Christoph Waltz's excellent performance which is easily one of my favourite villainous performances of all time. The film is able to pace all of its scenes well and the time flies unnaturally quick. The violence is gory and shocking in the best way possible. Each set piece in the film is gorgeously paced and gripping even on multiple rewatches. I easily rank this with Pulp fiction as my favourite Tarantino flick, and I recommend this as a must see! (Also I have a soft spot for Brad Pitt's southern drawl)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Major surprise,"I am normally the first to slam revisionist history and did not go to see this on cinema release.It came onto television recently and having nothing better to do, and there being not much else on, gave it a whirl. Well blow me down,I really enjoyed it, and had to go away and think why I did so, when the plot is overall quite preposterous. And I think that is the key to the movie, it is sheer over the top nonsense so that it actually transcends revisionist history and becomes a piece of entertainment.There is some stuff in there though that isn't much known that is real history. Both Goebbels and Hitler were huge movie fans and indeed Goebbels produced a version of Titanic that is quite extraordinary in its propaganda but is regarded as the first effort to seriously make a movie about the tragedy (Google Nazi Titanic). It can be bought and I have a copy but it can now be downloaded from You Tube. Goebbels production makes his one just as ridiculous as I.B. which adds to the irony.I found it hard not to watch this movie without a grin on my face because it is very well acted (actually overacted) and so clichéd (deliberately) that it does not really take itself seriously, and you can see that. Brad Pitt is having a ball. But it was the performance of Cristoph Waltz that really blew me away. How good was he? The perfect blend of Nazi evil with a touch of vaudeville thrown in.Recommended.This movie is completely over the top which is why it works. It does not want to try and rewrite history like the goddam awful Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Killer which takes itself all to seriously.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

"It has its moments, strong cinema feeling throughout, but the humorous tone and the ""deja-vu"" revenge story cause disappointment","Inglourious Basterds was a little bit, in fact quite different film than previous Tarantino films which disappointed me at theater personally as a fan of him. The movie has one of the greatest opening sequences ever filmed, it proves how genius Tarantino is, but unfortunately the rest of the film was a let down after this sequence. This sequence is an example of quintessential cinema, pure genius. The vision and the mastery of the director shine such as the timing of the camera down or the suspense, atmosphere or the acting, it is a perfect sequence, but as said the movie was lack of the magic that this part had. For example, the revenge story in this movie was a little bit bland or lack of spark, especially in comparison with Kill Bill. Also, the similarities between the two stories make it even worse! (blonde avenger, the same songs etc.) In addition, the heroine of this movie was not likable like The Bride, she was rather cold that's why I couldn't identify with her throughout the movie. Christopher Waltz's performance is jaw dropping, incredible, however Pitt is not ""so so"" as some people claim, he is great too! I have no idea why some people doesn't accept that he is a very talented actor. His performances in 12 Monkeys, Burn After Reading and Tree of Life were Oscar worthy for example. Diane Kruger is the third best of the cast, her subtle performance is outstanding. Returning to the film, the movie was somehow ""cold"" in comparison with other Tarantino movies and that annoyed me. I don't say soulless, but somehow lack of any real spark except for the famous opening sequence or let's say the movie was lack of emotional involvement. The violence in the movie was very brutal, so unbearable at times, but that's OK. Some action scenes are stylish, but some of those are not, too brutal and raw like the baseball bat scene. If the point of those kind of scenes is to disturb audiences, yes it delivers! Hitler was portrayed in a comical tone which harms the seriousness and realism of the movie (in contrast with the movie, Valkrie for example) He just shouts people around him. I hate Eli Roth because of his sick and sadistic director identity, but his persona and his role suits him very well in this movie and he works as a post-modernism tool of Tarantino. The camera usage in the translation scene was another example as Tarantino highlights ""cinema"" over everything else. The villain of the movie, Hans Landa was a great character study, however, until the end, somehow the character lost his mystery? impact? And one of the biggest disappointments for me was the theater sequence because of the over humor or the funny tone. I had expected a suspenseful, exciting or even interesting climax, but instead got a sequence that works more like a parody! May be Tarantino tried to make his own Stalag 17 or Dirty Dozen (both movies have funny moments which I don't like particularly either), but comedy just doesn't work in this movie. Another problem was the confusing and controversial aspect of the film. In a scene, ""a good guy"" of the film torments a woman to get some information, he is a hero, also an anti hero, may be both may be neither of them! In another scene, a German soldier who has a wife and a baby gets shot, in those scenes, I know, Tarantino tries to throw us a curve, but personally I wasn't amazed, instead frustrated. He did the same thing to the relationship between the heroine and another German soldier, I won't go further not to spoil anything, but many twists in the movie didn't amaze me as the director would expect or wish. However, the last twist at the theater shows that Tarantino doesn't take any side or has some ideological thoughts, instead his only purpose is to amaze or surprise audiences and gets applause! The bar sequence was great, it shows us again that Tarantino is a dialog expert for sure! The ""deserve"" scene was stylish and also powerful. The ""hot"" climax was unfortunately lack of suspense, excitement or real action. At the end, if he can rule his ego a little bit, if he can forget about the cheers that he would want to get, instead focusing on his art, sure he will make much better movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"""This might just be my masterpiece""","Tarantino proves just how flexible the setting can be for a Tarantino film through this motion picture, divided into 5 chapters with two storylines all merging to a thrilling conclusion and a chilling final shot, one can easily assume this might just be Tarantino's masterpiece, although many say otherwise it can really only be decided by the viewer themselves. A majority of the film being spoken in a different language labeling it as a subtitle movie can be a turn down for certain audiences but with Tarantino's masterful dialogue it is not only easy to follow but extremely enjoyable to keep track of, worth also mentioning is the fascist feeling that eminate throughout Christopher Waltz's entire performance as a member of the Nazi party undoubtedly adds to the entire feeling of the 1940's menacing world power.Words are not enough to describe this film's mild impact it has on its viewers, positively or negatively, my only recommendation would be to experience this motion picture firsthand and with an open mind, and who knows just how much this film will surprise you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Glory at its peak!!!!!,"Inglorious Basterds; Tarantino grandeur and glory at its peakThe end credits of the film kick in following the line ""I think it just be might masterpiece"" by Brad Pitt (I'm sure there's a separate fan following for the end credits as well) and pretty much sums up the magnanimous piece of cinema by the legendary Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino,the undisputed monarch of non linear narratives, goes all guns blazing in his alternate-history depiction of the Nazi brutality and the eventual downfall of Hitler. The film revolves around the bloody and gruesome 'Inglorious Basterds', a group of Jewish Americans vowed to decimate as many Nazi soldiers as possible and act as a harbinger of Jewish liberation. Col. Hans Landa brilliantly portrayed by Christoph Waltz is a narcissistic and callous general in the ranks of the German military in German occupied France region where he's known as the ""jew-hunter"",is the textbook definition of movie villians and perhaps widely regarded as one of the finest villians ever to have graced the silver screen. With an astounding command over French,German, English and Italian, Christoph Waltz shoulders an aura of hostility and unpredictability and brings in a wave of energy to the character of Landa. He truly deserves the Oscar.In terms of the writing and characterisation, Tarantino is at his belligerent best with extended scenes of intriguing dialogues, grotesque depictions of violence and an enviable cinematography and music composition. Every second of the narrative gets the audience glued to their screens and appreciate the Tarantino signature style film making. Inglorious Basterds is definitely not for the faint of hearts and those who detest violence in any form. One can't help but notice Tarantino's appetite for violence and storytelling is insatiable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
I wish I could see this film at the theater,"One of the best films I've ever seen in my life!!!Besides our main characters like Aldo, Hans Lada,..., I was so impressed with the below details:+ Richard Sammel - who played Sgt. Rachtman - perfectly delivered and expressed what Quentin wanted us to see in this scene. See how he stayed calm, firmly knelt while getting interrogated and threatened, then his face with the indomitable look in his eyes along with how the camera moved - indeed proved how he got the medal for his bravery. We kinda see how Quentin built him as a courageous soldier even though he's on the Nazi side.+ Sturmbannführer Hellstrom could even identify Wicki and Stiglitz as Obersturmführer München and Obersturmführer Frankfurt. He surely found that Hicox was a fake Hauptsturmführer and decided to play games all along (card, intruder, "" Auf ein tausendjähriges Deutsches Reich"", Scotch) to expose 'em 100%.

"Occupied Paris, unchained","Quentin Tarantino is an exceptionally gifted filmmaker with a serious self-restraint problem. ""Inglourious Basterds"" clocks in at a typically excessive 2h33m, which can be blamed on the conversations, almost all of which drag on (e.g., the long saloon sequence leading up to the 'Mexican standoff'), as does much of the violence. Even the strudel-eating scene is bloated 'mit schlag.'It started out so solidly with a tense and tightly played scene of Nazi Col. Landa (Christoph Waltz) interrogating a French farmer (Denis Ménochet) about local Jews, a few of whom are hiding under the floorboards. But then we meet the basterds of the title, a small unit of Jewish American soldiers under the command of Lt. Aldo Raine (an inexplicably prognathic Brad Pitt). With an overblown Southern drawl, he commands each of them to deliver 100 Nazi scalps-- an excessive number, surely more than they want to carry around with them, rotting, in their haversacks. Eventually, inadvertently, and clumsily, the basterds merge with the parallel and much more compelling plot about a young woman who escaped from under those floorboards, Shoshanna (Mélanie Laurent) and her lover Marcel (Jacky Ido), who plan to blow up a gathering of the Nazi gang: Goebbels, Göring, Bormann, and Hitler himself.Given Tarantino's fondness for alternate views of history, anything could happen-- yet there is very little suspense because suspense wilts when scenes wallow on.Christoph Waltz has a way of stealing movies, and he almost gets away with this one. But there is strong support from the superb young Daniel Brühl as a conflicted Nazi war hero who takes a shine to Shoshanna, as well as from the equally superb Diane Kruger who is the very embodiment of duplicity as an Allied agent, going from cool control to fiery anger. She even manages to maintain her dignity in the exaggerated and ridiculous discussion about speaking Italian-- one of Tarantino's effortful stabs at humor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Wait for the Creme?,One of the most tense movie scenes in recent memory. The way in which Hans Landa Toyed with Shosanna was brilliantly written.

Brutal and Delicious,"Anyone who has read many of my previous reviews will know i have something of a gripe with Quentin Tarantino. Despite his unrivalled genius when it comes to cinematography and dialogue i always find his films to be a strudel without cream; a most unsatisfying prospect as Colonel Hans Landa will attest to. The lack in his previous work of any real tone of emotion and overload of dialogue (no matter how well written) lead me to find his creations far less immersive than the work of many other directors. However, Inglourious Basterds is a completely different batch of strudel. Never before has Tarantino's work been so transcendental, and never before has he made a film that i have found so complete.If you haven't yet seen the film, you have good reason to be confused by my mention of Hans Landa. He is a little advertised character in IB, but no doubt steals the show. Christopher Waltz plays the ""Jew Hunter"" in such a convincing way, that i have felt genuine hatred for his character. His grotesquely charming creation is not only defined by his actions, but also by his ability to manipulate everyone from a lowly milk farmer to the British high command. i felt a pull in scenes involving Landa that i have never before felt during a previous Tarantino film, and it seems a perfect example of the director and actor working together and making something truly memorable. He really does steal the screen from far more well known actors.Despite this, there is a real intrigue behind all characters in the movie. Pitt, making his debut in a Tarantino movie is brilliant as Lt Aldo Raine. He is as funny and smart as he is deep. Everything from his crooked smile to the unexplained scar along his neck adds to his presence on screen, and this is a blanket feeling. Each of the Basterds has their own distinctly different traits and Tarantino explores these in their actions, names and nicknames given by the German forces making a richer tapestry of characters than i am used to seeing. All cast members do a great job at creating an atmosphere as immersive as that of any film, a testament to the casting team, who somehow managed to cast effectively in 4 languages.While all this is going on, the classic Tarantino cinematography and dialogue is still present, and never before have i seen a film incorporate humor alongside so many deeper issues as seamlessly. There is a witty quality to the script that leads to even long periods of dialogue with little or no camera movement to still be immersive and humorous. The blend of laughter and tension in many scenes is a rare and original concept captured perfectly.Now from this review it sounds like a complex film and this couldn't be more true. In true QT style there are numerous story lines interwoven and this leads me to my only major gripe with the movie. Towards the end, it all comes together in something of a mishmash. You lose track of the differing motives of the different parties involved and you aren't aware of how much the different characters know of the others involvements. However, it is some climax. Unexpected, emotional and as always, brutal.I loved this movie. At nearly 3 hours it would have been easy to make a confused mess of different plot lines buried under a mountain of dialogue pouring out of every bodily orifice, but nothing could be further from what we have here. No dialogue feels wasted and all scenes are aimed towards making the finale even more delicious. There is a simple way to describe how much i enjoyed this film. To paraphrase Lt Aldo Raine, ""I think this might just be his masterpiece"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Messy and indecisive,"Being a devoted Tarantino fan, for me this movie was a disappointment. Inglourious Basterds has its flashes of genius, as you'd expect from a Tarantino movie, but they're lost in a muddle of half-baked ideas and characters, and in the end it's probably his weakest movie so far, lacking in the one thing that even Death Proof had - energy and pace. The film does have some mentionable qualities, that are enough to make it watchable and even quite enjoyable - as you would expect from Tarantino, it's fantastically professional in every aspect, especially cinematography and sound. Some of the characters have tons of potential, and the actors are usually spot on (another honorable mention to Christoph Waltz), but there are so many characters that not one of them is developed enough to be satisfying. Tarantino fails to juggle a large number of plots and sub-plots the way he did in Jackie Brown in Pulp Fiction, and they never intertwine in any meaningful way. And worst of all, it's not even that controversial or offensive - Tarantino took a lot of liberties with history, and he certainly created violence that's more realistic and more explicit than ever before, but it's really just violence for the sake of itself. I realize I'm in a minority here, but I don't recommend this movie. I'm not saying don't watch it - there's a lot here to enjoy.

Quentin Tarantino's best movie yet,"I have read criticisms of Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"", saying that it glorifies violence or that it glosses over Nazi atrocities. Some people apparently don't realize that no part of the movie is meant to be taken seriously. This flick should not be interpreted as a historical film. It is basically a comedic spaghetti western set in WWII.Brad Pitt, playing a none-too-educated (but extremely clever) yokel leading a platoon of Jewish-American soldiers into Nazi-occupied France to kill and scalp Nazis, puts on one of the funniest performances that I've seen in years. And let me tell you, this movie leaves NOTHING to the imagination! As is the case with pretty much any Tarantino movie, this is one that squeamish people should avoid as if it was the H1N1 virus. For non-squeamish people, this is the flick for you! Tarantino is not afraid to show anything and play it for laughs.

Not enough fun, in general. Must say that the entire cinema was disappointed, people left in silence, without any enthusiasm or clapping. Too much talking, which is not a brilliant as they say, simply talking. Some developments are ridiculously stupid, too much even for such a far-fetched premise: the risky, aggressive behaviour of the English spy in the bar, the fact that a common soldier in a bar speaks fluent English, the fact they manage to lock down the entire theater - with the cream of Nazi German machine in it - without anyone outside noticing it, or a shrewd Nazi officer negotiating the terms of his surrender with English command... on the phone!

Entertaining but Tarantino is stuck in revenge fantasy mode.,"The film was promoted with the phrase ""Once upon a time..."" both a tribute to one of Tarantino's heroes, Sergio Leone, and a tip off that the film presented would be a FANTASY. Tarantino has been stuck in strictly revenge fantasy mode since Kill Bill, as the two Bill films, Death Proof, and now Basterds are all nothing but revenge fantasies. He clearly let us know he was not making a film that presented us with accurate history. The Nazis in the film serve two purposes, comic relief and symbol of evil and the violent destruction of them fulfills the fantasy.It is well known that Tarantino does not make films that are polite or in ""good taste"" he makes films that satisfy his childhood film fantasies. I can't imagine a person walking into a Tarantino film thinking they are going to get a history lesson or learn something. This has never been the point of a Tarantino film, he makes films to pay tribute to the pop culture and filmmakers he loves so much. He is not a complex filmmaker, he is a kid in a candy store and like that kid all he wants to do is overindulge himself. The ""fun"" in seeing one of his films is watching him do so with such glee.This film is a big goofy mess, not meant to be taken seriously, the thing is you can either laugh along with Tarantino or walk away. I won't argue that there is plenty in this film, including the ending, which could obviously be seen as ""offensive to Jews"" and some of my Jewish friends have already told me they think the film is a travesty but I think the thing is you have to try to take into consideration Tarantino's intention, which was to make a film that would make the kid in him yell ""That's so cool!""

Tarantino is back!,"Tarantino's new film Inglorious Basterds is to me a return to form for the man who gave us the instant classic Pulp Fiction. QT is at his best when he creates situations that build the tension between his characters. He is unfortunately at his worst when he chooses style over substance. A classic example of the Tarantino style over substance is in Kill Bill Volume 1 where there are so many ""references"" to other earlier Japanese films. Tarantino is also at his best in the writing of his dialogue, which, quite frankly, is in most cases, second to none.Luckily for casual and rabid fans alike, Basterds showcases QT's strengths more often than his weaknesses. Two scenes are particularly strong, even to the point of being flawless: the opening scene involving Mr. LaPadite and Hans Landa aka ""The Jew Hunter,"" and the ""Mexican Standoff"" scene involving Michael Fassbender, Bridget von Hammersmark, Hugo Stiglitz, and the uniformed Gestapo officer Dieter Hellstrom. The first scene serves as an introduction to the main antagonist of the film, Hans Landa, as well as a flashback to introduce Shosannah Dreyfus, a French Jew hiding in her neighbors basement in the French countryside, and one of our main protagonists. The tension that Tarantino builds in the scene is exquisite and truly hearkens back to the best work he's ever done in Pulp Fiction. The second scene is perhaps even better regarding the buildup of tension. The dialogue is so realistic that you feel you are not in a theatre watching a Tarantino film, rather you are in that room witnessing a bloody battle about to unfold. These two scenes are absolutely masterful and proves that there is no one better in the business when it comes to writing an engrossing scene.The rest of the movie is standard Tarantino fare: very stylistic, graphic violence, snappy dialogue, and lots of references to other films. Tarantino certainly doesn't mind wearing his influences on his sleeve and this is one of the films weaknesses. At some points it feels over-indulgent with all the stylization and referencing of other films. It gets to the point where you feel that Tarantino is perfectly content to never come up with his own style reasoning that using other films styles IS actually HIS style. That worked well in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but by now the novelty and freshness has worn off. It is a pity QT can't be as inventive with his mis-en-scene as he can be with his dialogue. The other so- called ""weakness"" isn't really a weakness. Most of the scenes seem to go on longer than expected. But, I don't see this so much as weakness as much as a throwback to the slower pace of 70's and earlier films. This film reminds us how much the pacing of films has changed ever since MTV style editing has come about.Overall, Basterds is Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown. It is not however a ""brilliant, or ground-breaking"" film like many on this website may claim. It is simply a very solid and in some scenes flawless movie. Fans will not see anything here that they haven't seen before either in other QT films or in other films in various genres (Spaghetti Westers being the most obvious influence here). However, what audiences will see is a smartly written, engrossing and intense, black comedy about Nazi-occupied France. This film redeems QT in my eyes from the derivative and formulaic Kill Bill and grindhouse films. And, the acting is consistently superb from the entire cast in this film, especially from Christoph Walz and Melanie Laurent. Go see this film if you want Tarantino at his vintage best!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Ehhh... Nothing Special,"This comment is a very generous 6 stars out of 10. This is not Quentin Tarantino's best. I realize when viewing a film you should willfully suspend your disbelief but that is not the problem here. I am more than willing to watch far fetched historically inaccurate movies. Inglourious Basterds was simply a horrible idea. This movie lacked any and all good qualities a movie should have.Plot Development. There were some entertaining scenes that were preceded and followed by very long and quite boring scenes.Dialogue. The subtitles are exhausting and take away from enjoying the essence of the acting, plot development, and cinematography throughout basically the entire 153 minutes.Character Development. There were hardly any sufficiently developed characters. Brad Pitt had some comical dialogue but was hardly a likable character. Like all of the other characters(except Col. Hans Landa) his lacked any sort of complexity whatsoever. Christoph Waltz (Col Hans Landa) puts on a flawless performance and is probably the best and most well developed character. Waltz brings a delightful talent to the screen, which was unfortunately surrounded by sub-par and adolescent writing/direction.I'm usually able to stomach distasteful gore in a movie if it can be supported by a worthwhile story but Inglorious Basterds was not one of these experiences. The film was not really even titled accurately. Certainly there were ""inglourious basterds"" but they didn't even contribute enough to have a whole movie titled after them.In summary, this was 153 minutes of Tarantino's sick and twisted day dream. I am a big fan of his but this one just lacked the talent and creativity we all know he has. I think people who enjoyed this were probably just too excited to really watch and evaluate it carefully just because it was a Tarantino film. Plus it was exponentially better than Death Proof so I suppose he's made a small step up. ha.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Embarrassing....Peinlich ohne Ende,"Tasteless and pathetic ... it's unbelievable how could Mr.Waltz do such a nice professional job in such an ugly, tasteless setting. Rhetoric question - how could the German actors collaborate in such a project where the bloody, painful, terrible real German history is made into a shitty-burlesque black comedy (from the perspective of an uneducated 7th-grader who just started to learn something about world history, but could not yet find the right language to speak about it except the language of a comics strip). Is it than at least entertaining? Not at all ... boring and annoying. Or should these quasi-Jewish bastards be funny? What a pity! What an insult to the real Jewish fighters against the Nazis!

"Brilliant film, Highly misinterpreted.","Over the course of the release of this film I have noticed many people labelling it ""a mockery of the real tragic events"", which I feel is extremely blunt, heres why.. It's not trying to be real.the reason I dislike platoon is because its attempting to feel real, whilst over-exaggerating the killing of innocent Vietnamese citizens, if you really want to know a great example of the events of Vietnam made comical just to the appropriate level to stay immersive, look no further than Forrest Gump.Inglorious Basterds is comical, it manages to stay plausible and tragic, and that is one of the many reason this film is so brilliant, Not regarding the freakishly hypnotic camerawork, incredible performance from all sides of the spectrum and brilliant direction.If you really want an authentic war experience, exploring the ins and outs of this horrific war, don't become angry at this film.

"""I think it just be might masterpiece.""","Always, when it comes to fiction movies about WWII I am a little concerned because of sensitivity of the topic - It's easy to cross bounds. I can say with confident: it didn't happen this time.
Also, when I was starting watching ""Inglorious Basterds"" I had a huge expectations, as I always have when I watch Tarantino's movies. And I wasn't disapointed at all. Everything in this movie just clicked: plot, direction, excellent script, immaculate performances - especially Christoph Waltz as colonel Hans Landa, who I disliked at the very first sight (and hated later). Not to mention brilliant acting of Brad Pitt as Aldo Raine and many others.
Although, Tarantino did enure us to brutal blood baths in his aestethics, some scenes were startling to me. But some of these scenes someone could find even satisfiying.

A modern classic,"I bought this movie about a week ago and I don't know how many times I've reached the first two scenes. The conversation between Col.

Aldo Raine giving a speech to his soldiers, it helps to establish a small connection between Hans and Aldo, being that both of them claim to have come down from the mountains to aid in the war efforts.Reading a few negative reviews, most if not all of them bringing up all the table talks full of subtext in this film, but a few of them praised Pulp Fiction, which when you think about it, is also a collection of conversations full of subtext. Don't get me wrong, I love Pulp Fiction, but doesn't it seem a little hypocritical to praise one thing but criticise the other, when at least in my opinion, the quality of the subtext in Inglorious is just the tiniest bit worse than Pulp Fiction, but not worth knocking it all the way down to 1 star.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

WWII not an ideal backdrop for QT's masterful talents,"""Inglourious Basterds"" is many things, but one thing it is not is a World War II drama. The setting is an alternate version of history, where Nazi-occupied France becomes the wild west for another of filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's Sergio Leone-inspired pulp action movies where various Jews can carry out their revenge fantasies on assorted members of the Third Reich.A true QT film through and through, ""Basterds"" is smothered in the director's many trademarks, and calling cards are left at each of its lengthy and dynamically suspenseful scenes. From '60s-style title cards to narrative digressions to scenes set entirely around a table, fans of the filmmaker who revolutionized the writing and directing of film in the '90s will find his seventh feature film to completely satisfy their itch.But does Tarantino's recklessly violent style have a place in telling a story that circumvents one of history's darkest chapters? That's a matter of personal taste. There's no doubting the filmmaker is in top form -- humorous and attention-grabbing, crafting some great characters and even better scenes -- but it's a style that's seen better applications than WWII.Broken into chapters, ""Basterds"" introduces us to a couple main story lines that lead to an ultimate objective of revenge. If not for its pulp groundings, the film could be called ""Everbody Wants to Kill Hitler,"" for all intents and purposes. First there's Shoshanna, a young Jewish girl hiding in France who manages to escape when the farmer hiding her family confesses to the S.S. The scene is one of Tarantino's best, especially thanks to Christoph Waltz as the charming and delightfully intimidating Nazi Col. Hans Landa (aka ""the Jew hunter""), whose beguiling manner clashing with the serious undertones of the plot makes his performance worthy of nothing less than an Oscar nomination.Then there are the Basterds, Jewish American soldiers under the command of Lt. Aldo Raine, a one-dimensional albeit hysterical character played just so by Brad Pitt. Raine is up for nothing but killing Nazis and making good sport of it, as is Eli Roth's character Sgt. Donowitz aka ""The Bear Jew,"" whose weapon of choice is a baseball bat. But no matter how outrageous it all sounds, there's nothing secretly fulfilling about Jews killing Nazis and that's part of the film's problem.These stories come together in 1944, when Shoshanna is now running a movie theater (another predictable QT move) where the Nazi party hopes to show off its latest propaganda film, ""Nation's Pride,"" inviting the biggest names in the Nazi regime including the Fuhrer himself. This happening attracts the Basterds and even sparks vengeful thoughts for Shoshanna.Of course preparing for such a plot brings need for deception, perfect fodder for these long intense scenes with inevitably violent conclusions along with of course the prowess of Waltz as Landa. Though for every brilliant set up, Tarantino brings it to climax with meaningless pulp. These violent battles and merciless killings send off vibrations that simply deaden upon hitting the air, not resonating through the rest of or after the film ends. That kind of bloody and clever outcome works great in films like ""Kill Bill"" or ""Pulp Fiction,"" where there's no realism to the circumstances of the violence, but it comes off as immature in the context of WWII and the Holocaust.Perhaps I should have expected no less from the master of climactic deaths, but there's an unignorable side to ""Basterds"" and that's the emotional depth of the Holocaust and the terrible war surrounding it. When this sense of humor is effective, many people may feel guilty being entertained comically by ""Basterds,"" and at other times they might find it feels stupid and pointless. Then again, many might push the historical context aside and delight in all of the style and excellent craftsmanship.So despite Tarantino's brilliance, all of which manifests itself through different scenes and character in ""Basterds,"" nothing accounts for the rift between how many viewers think about WWII as they watch a film about it (fictional or not) and how viewers watch a Tarantino film, a genre in itself that carries its own set of expectations. It can almost be best described in this way: Either wild west Ennio Morricone music set to Jews killing Germans in WWII works for you or the clash is a bit too unnatural. Either way, you respect the talents of the filmmaker. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"""This just might be my masterpiece""","The fantastic performance from Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa is the highlight of the film, constantly creating a powerful atmosphere of pure tension, fantastic.

An incohesive film made by an inconsistent basterd.,"In the 1st 10 minutes of the films, Tarantino used about 10 different fonts for various on screen titles. Might not seem like a big deal to most folks, but it is an early example of the films' sloppy inconsistency. QT has always liked to mix genres, most successfully in the Kill Bill films, and I'm fine with that. But here, his A.D.D.-enabled multi-style style is at its most random and really doesn't work for what this film could've been. (I considered offering a list of all the inconsistencies, but my reviews are generally too long anyway.) What I had hoped for, and what the trailer seemed to promise, was a Dirty Dozen homage, where a team of badass characters are assembled with the mission of killing Nazis. Generally, in that type of group mission film (Dirty Dozen, Oceans 11, The Seven Samurai or even QT's own Reservoir Dogs), you'd get to know a bit about each of the members of the team, building some kind of relationship between the various characters and the audience. But QT doesn't take the time to do that. We never really get to know any of the people in the film. Instead, he spends a few slow 20 minute sections in ways that don't enhance our relationships with the characters, the story or the film overall.So what's good? 1. The film does offer some fantastically funny and quirky performances. Brad Pitt is hilarious, and the film's main villain SS Col. Landa, played by Christoph Waltz, is as funny as he is batshit crazy evil. Pretty much all of the supporting cast, with the exception perhaps of 1 or 2 of the 'Basterds', are also noteworthy. 2. No one knows how to use music in films better than Q. 3. A bunch of Jews kick a whole bunch of Nazi butt in some particularly gratifying (and gruesomely violent) ways.Final say? Disappointing, but worth seeing. Not for the kids or for people who don't like seeing Nazis die.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Killing unarmed kneeing people with baseball bat's is tough? The Nazi sign on the head is nothing else as the Yellow star (even worse cause its not removable).

"violent, silly, stupid","I think it takes a great talent to make the viciousness of the Nazis to seem like the good guys in a movie.

That certainly takes some talent. When you are rooting for the Nazis -- the movie may have a problem. And this movie has a problem.

An action packed though mindless world war 2 film,"Lets begin with the bad and end with the good. Inglorious Basterds plays as well as its title sounds, meaning the title embodies the entire movie. Some back country hick, and some Jews, collaborate to perform some not-so elaborate schemes of insurrection against the nazi high command. Sounds fun and appeals to audiences that want to see the nazi's completely debased, which they are to levels I have never seen in any other movie.The movie is totally one-dimensional and revolves around the general notion that ""Nazi's are bad people and they should be killed."" This is the view that many people share ever since world war 2 started and then ended. So people who cannot see the depth in the Nazi schema cannot expect to find it here.This is a feel-good movie that is meant to be fun and one exhilarating ride for today's superficial minded audience. For people who wish to find some depth or at the very least an accurate depiction of the nazi regime and its constituent functionaries, they will be completely disappointed.In the end the only rudimentary principle that this movie follows is: Dumbing down Hitler and his associates and swapping the cruelness of the Nazis with the Jews.

Oh my god they killed history! You Basterds!,"So, the wait for ""Basterds"" is finally over. Was it worth it?Let's look at the negatives first.Criticism 1: It was quite ""talkie"" for a war film.Yes, this is true. but this is no ordinary war film. whilst it is (very) violent in places, as one would expect from a modern war film, the film is an exercise in characterisation and with this in mind, it is very successful. Landa, Dreyfus and Raine are brilliant lead characters whilst the supporting characters, namely Sgt. Donny Donowitz, Lt. Archie Hicox and Bridget Von Hammersmark, are wonderful characters. So while this is a very dialogue heavy film, the dialogue between the characters both forms the story and strengthens the characters.Criticism 2: It was too bloody and violent.OK, let us look at films like Hostel. The violence is so strong and so frequent that we as an audience are numb to it and it becomes boring by the end.""Basterds"" is a war film after all so we can give it some leeway for being violent in places but it was realistic and it served a purpose.Criticism 3: There was no story.Like all of Tarantino's films (Jackie Brown aside) there is little story but whatever the story is, it is well executed and all plot holes are tied up by the end. When you go to see a Tarantino film, you should know what to expect by now.Criticism 4: The music didn't fit.I agree with this one on only one point. The David Bowie song, although it was used effectively and it suited the scene. The rest of the music was perfect for the film.Criticism 5: It wasn't even remotely historically accurate.Yes it was, the soldiers uniforms, set design, weapons, cinema (right down to the type of projector and films) were all accurate. it was only the story that was fiction.So, was it worth the wait.

And the setting and plot has only a remote resemblance to whatever could have happened in France in 1944.

An absolutely terrible movie,"I went to see this one because a Tarantino film is usually a good bang for a couple of bucks-what I saw was a film that tried very hard to be serious film and failed badly, in fact it was like watching old footage of a B-17 get hit by flack and roll upside down as a prelude to flying vertically into the ground at three times its top speed, on fire. The inclusion of Mike Myers as an actor doing a serious role was truly laughable in and of itself. The fact that some US soldier liked to carve swastikas into German soldiers heads is something that I have never heard before and I have heard all kinds of WW2 stories. Well, big deal on that anyway, I could imagine lots of worse things to do to German soldiers in WW2 than giving them improvised tattoos and hitting them with baseball bats. The portrayal of Adolf Hitler as funny man and also the portrayal of Joseph Goebels as funny man treads a fine line dipping into the and of ass jokes with remarkable ease, showing a bit of true bad taste on the part of the film maker. Whats next-pratfall jokes with Joseph Stalin?, who by the way, killed 27 million people, out doing Hitler's period of distemper by quite a few more million dead persons. Boo hiss on this flap doodle. Only good bit is when two guys gets their testes shot off in a bar scene-and not a vampire in sight.I honestly think this film does not contribute to the body of work that deals with WW2. Maybe in kind of a cheapish way it does, but I wouldn't want a WW2 vet to see it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Take an eye for an eye and everybody will be blind eventually,"This movie is shocking in every way, and it should be, because what else should you expect from a director whose trademark is blood-filled-violent-killing-scenes and who is making a movie based on the 2nd World War? Perhaps we could say that Tarantino glorifies violence, but I think that's just the way he expresses his ideas and points of view. Somebody will write a poem, somebody will draw a painting, but Tarantino will shoot an aggressive and brutal movie. It is just a way of expression. So why is this movie so special (or not)? Well, it actually IS an antiwar movie. Too bad the plot is set in WWII time, so basically most people will agree that killing Nazis is good because they don't deserve to live because they are the worst enemies this world has ever seen because human kind has never done anything like that and will never do something like that again and if somebody deserves to be scalped, it's the Nazis, and so on and so on It is quite simple to understand this and accept it as a final fact - if you're a five-year-old kid that is. It's interesting how Tarantino managed to portray that in the movie itself (the cinema scene). So basically we (the human race) kill because somebody else killed us first, we take an eye because somebody took ours eye first, and eventually all that is given to us we take and destroy among ourselves, while somebody is laughing and having fun (and people in my theater did laugh few times on the scalp scenes, actually). It's a sad truth, but not to everybody. The film has great acting though, especially by Christoph Walz.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
His Best since Pulp Fiction? (Yes),"First off this is easily Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction. I'm not going to say that it rivals Pulp Fiction yet, but I might in about a week after this movie finishes swimming through my brain. The choice to have all the characters speak the languages they actually would be speaking adds a weird sense of realism and also works into the plot, in a way that makes a lot of since. Subtleties of accent and mannerism mean a lot. Also, great performances from the entire cast, especially Christoph Waltz, who won Best Actor at Cannes. In the first scene I missed some of the subtitles because I couldn't take my eyes off him. That good.Speaking of the first scene, it was excellent, and sets up the motivations of a major character down the road. This and the bar scene are the two standouts in the movie; a slow, inevitable build, followed by a burst of violence. A-game material for all involved.I'd also like to address the criticisms this film received for ""turning the Jews into Nazis"". That's simply not true. You see one major Jew character's family mercilessly slaughtered by Nazis early on, and you can imagine similar backgrounds for many of the Basterds, given their willingness to do violence to Nazis. The climax can be twisted to enforce the above statement, but I refuse to believe it. It's irresponsible for those critics to dismiss Tarantino as glorifying violence, but what he's actually doing is much trickier; he forces the viewer to deal with their own morality, and where they draw the line between justice and vengeance. The climax, in particular, teeters on the edge of satisfying and nightmarish, leaning more towards the second as the screams of the Nazis and laughs of the movie screen grow louder. It raises questions, and is aware of this. Tarantino is too masterful a filmmaker to be ignorant of his movie's message.Yes, I said master filmmaker. And, I loved the way he worked film into the climax. I loved the way he worked film in this movie, period.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

The Glorious return of true cinematic excitement!,"Perhaps it's partly because I've always been a hugely over-enthusiast and biased Quentin Tarantino fan-boy (I even thought ""Death Proof"" was brilliant), but I can't fathom how anyone could possibly dislike ""Inglorious Bastards"". Tarantino's film is a genuine ode to cinema, and not at all a pretentious and personal hobby-project like some people claim, with a marvelously absurd plot & structure and a deeply fascinating cast of characters. ""Inglorious Bastards"" is the type of motion picture that causes spontaneous adrenalin-rushes inside your body and automatically makes your blood pump faster with its brilliant sequences that are alternatively suspenseful, comical and unbelievably violent. From the teaser trailers and previews we've been seeing months from beforehand, it looked as if this would become a simplistic and insignificant (but nevertheless entertaining) WWII-action flick, but the eventual finished product is a massively surprising epic with style and content that very well could be the most genius movie of the year. Right from the opening chapter, ingeniously titled ""Once upon a time in Nazi- occupied France"", it's crystal clear that Tarantino's amazing talent for writing dialogs hasn't vanished yet (in spite of what QT-haters claim) and that he even improved his skills regarding the building up of tension and atmosphere. Together with his talented eye for acting talent and exact casting (the relatively unknown Austrian actor Christoph Waltz depicts the ultimate Nazi villain in the history of War movies); the intro grows out to an intense and mesmerizing 15 minutes long verbal cat-and-mouse game ending in sheer terror. The next chapters are definitely more light-headed and marvelously over-the-top with the introduction of the titular bastards, the film-within-film plot about a German private who single-handedly slaughtered half an army and Joseph Goebbels turning his adventures into a propaganda movie, the hilarious preparations for a well-planned assassination attack and the return of an orphaned Jewish girl with her mind set on vengeance. The bastards are unquestionably the main attraction of the movie. They're a battalion composed of Jewish soldiers and one lunatic German deserter. Under the command of the pleasantly deranged Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt in an amusing role), they prowl around the occupied French countryside and sadistically kill & scalp Nazi officers wherever they can. This concept is vintage Tarantino, with borrowed ideas from great War movie classics, psychopathic character drawings (for example the Bear Jew with his baseball bat), hilariously witty dialogs and anecdotes and extreme uncompromising violence.""Inglorious Bastards"" is a non-stop series of brilliant sequences and unforgettable little trivia details. I could easily list fantastic moments throughout five whole pages, like the use of David Bowie's song ""Cat People"" and the Strudel scene inside a French restaurant, but the principal message is to just go and watch this film! Only Tarantino could take a serious topic and setting like WWII and turn it into a darkly comical fantasy with absurd twists and a downright demented climax in which practically the entire Third Reich becomes exterminated in one massive shootout. Like always, Tarantino playfully messes around with the fixed values of cinema. Usually WWII movies stick close to the facts and alter the characters' names, but here the names of all Nazi commanders are maintained but the events are completely fictional. Still, and I truly hope that all the negative minded Tarantino critics will finally realize this as well, our director respects and pays attention to little important details like languages and cultural differences. The Germans speak German, the French speak French and the Americans mock the Europeans regarding all the typical clichés. Everything about ""Inglorious Bastards"" is brilliant and this will undoubtedly become another Tarantino movie that I plan to watch and re- watch numerous of times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Unexpected, But Fantastic","I've been excited about this film since I first heard about it and loved what I had heard about the plot. So, now, Basterds is finally here and I love it. While it's not what I expected, I think that's a good thing. This is not the Kill Bill of WWII films that some might think it is. In fact, the Basterds aren't even in the movie for a good chunk of the time. However, there is so much juicy dialogue and tension in so many scenes, that you can't help but be fascinated by what's going on.I won't waste space by repeating the initial plot, but suffice to say, there is so much happening and so many characters that it constantly stays interesting. Everyone here, even Roth, are entertaining. I will say this is a Nazi revenge fantasy come true, as anyone who hates the Nazi's (and who doesn't) will most likely laugh at the inhumanity that is returned to them. Yes, it is also a funny movie, particularly Brad Pitt, who is wonderful, funny, and thoroughly entertaining as Aldo 'Apache' Reins (spelling?).But don't go in expecting a huge action adventure. The film has less action and more dialogue and drama. Some scenes drag on, but they are filled with suspense. And Tarantino is very successful in these scenes by bringing out the worst dread and SS officer could possibly bring out. There are even some big surprises in store, but I won't spoil that here.

The dialog in the movie, which has always been one of Tarantino's specialties, is as superbly written as it is delivered.It can be argued that this wasn't one of Brad Pitt's strongest performances, but given the minute roles he filled the shoes of the basterd Lt. Aldo Raine well enough. The real star of the movie is Christoph Waltz, he plays a cunning and charming Nazi detective who's impossible not to like.The story is somewhat complex as you would expect from a Tarantino film and is worth seeing at least twice. One thing to keep in mind is not to go into the theater expecting historical accuracy. So as not to spoil anything, let me just say Tarantino has a couple twists of his own in this film.Inglourious Basterds has the perfect mix of action, violence, comedy, drama, and music. Its story serves as what I would call (without spoiling anything) poetic justice. It is certain to become a classic and remain one of Quentin Tarantino's best films for ever.9.6/10 (Rounded off to 10)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
It is a masterpiece,It's movies like this and Interstellar that make me hesitant to give out any other 10 ratings because they are the only two movies I see as perfect films.

One too many turns of the screw; and surprisingly pro-German.,"By far the most enjoyable thing about ""Inglourious Basterds"" (sic, sic) are the performances by the cast of outstanding European actors. These Europeans really know their stuff. In fact, this film's real stars are the Europeans, especially Christoph Waltz from Austria and Melanie Laurent from France. Their performances are wonderful. As for top-billed Brad Pitt, he has only a supporting role as Tarantino's 21st Century stand-in for Lee Marvin. Pitt may be the star on the marquis, but he's far from being the star of this film.Some reviewers here seem to think the movie is anti-German. I can't imagine how they can possibly think that. Perhaps the bravest man in the whole film is a captured German soldier who courageously chooses death before dishonor. Sure, there are the usual Teutonic sadists and pigs, but on the level of plain soldiers, both sides seem to be more or less equal in executing their inglorious duties. In fact, in their manner of carrying out their parts in total war, the Americans and British in this film don't seem much of a step up from their German enemies. Indeed, these irregulars of the OSS and SOE employ many of the same methods used by their Nazi opponents: torture, threats of retaliation against families, etc. Is it possible for a particular group of sadists to claim the high moral ground?Despite the excellent acting, and superb photography and costuming, this film eventually disappoints. The last 1/4 of the film descends into the realm of pure nonsense, fantasy and ludicrous, contrived situations: a country bumpkin milkmaid becomes a cinema owner; dozens of the Reich's highest ranking officials and officers gather in a hostile city with barely a guard in sight. That's so ludicrous that anyone from the Secret Service watching this film would have tears of laughter rolling down his or her cheeks. Just like a person who always gives a screw one too many turns and breaks something, director Tarantino just doesn't know how to leave well enough alone or quit when he is ahead. Like a child, he insists on demonstrating how much he knows (or thinks he knows) about movies and their history, and so he winds up damaging his own movie.With his in-jokes and his sly aural and visual references to other films and their makers Tarantino wants to impress us, but he really only manages to foul his own work. I know who Aldo Ray was; I've seen him and the late, great Lee Marvin. Is Tarantino trying to impress me with the fact that he knows them, too?The very talented Tarantino should spend less time being referential and reverential, and more time mastering his movie-making skills.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
The best of WWII films and the best of Tarantino films,"I love war movies and I also enjoy a lot of Quentin Tarantino's films. This is my favorite of both!

Fun Film,"Quentin Tarantino plays around with history and by doing so he created a great film. This is one of his best films he has made.Inglourious Basterds starring Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent. The film tells the fictional alternate history story of two plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's political leadership, one planned by Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent), a young French Jewish cinema proprietor, and the other by a team of Jewish-American soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Pitt). Christoph Waltz co-stars as Hans Landa, an SS colonel tracking down Raine's group who has a connection to Shosanna's past. The film's title was inspired by Italian director Enzo G. Castellari's macaroni combat film, The Inglorious Bastards (1978).This film however is a little long but still enjoyable",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

A war masterpiece,"The thing with Quentin Tarantino is that the way he incorporates so many elements in his movues like the sound mixing, the language, the food, the setup and all those tiny detail's that you see. The pace of the film would be considered slow as compared to other movies but good things come in slow packages (That's small but you get the jist).The pace really builds upon the tension and the suspence in each scene and each chapter. The chapters are masterfully drafted to tell a masterpiece storyline. Each chapter on standalone is real good.The details like the accent and the oh so sweet french that the ""Jew Hunter"" of this film speaks is like music to the ears. Smaller details like the way he intimidates his opposers is something that shines.Would recommend for a rewatch.Would even recommend you to find a film lunatic friend like you and binge watch all the Tarantino movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Tarantino at his best,"This movie is a masterpiece. There is everything that a great movie needs: awesome humour (but the movie is not a comedy), great actors and the most important - the most terrifying villain in movies history, Hans Landa. Whenever he appears you can feel how scarred everyone else is, how smart he is and the actor gave his best playing him. Tarantino made a very radical, but marvelous decision that the movie is not in english - when french people talks they talk in french, germans in german etc. - the effect of that was just incredible amd you can feel how real this world is (i mean... Its Tarantino, he likes to change the history so it's not quiet real). It's awesome, go watch it, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Witty, Quirky, Violent","You really can't go wrong making an anti-Nazi war movie. I think that's the one war everyone pretty much agrees upon. Quentin Tarantino takes some liberties with historical occurrences and I'm not mad. Sometimes you have to tell the story how you wanted it to be even if it's not how it was.The Inglourious Basterds the movie is named after were a band of mostly Jewish-Americans taking the fight to the Nazis in France. They were led by Aldo (Brad Pitt), a Tennessee bred soldier who demanded Nazi scalps from his men. While the Basterds were fighting in their own unique fashion, a French Jewess who narrowly escaped slaughter was planning an attack of her own. While these two separate and capable parties were doing their thing, one SS officer seemed to be Johnny-on-the-spot for every plot. Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) was the German Sherlock Holmes and his demise couldn't come soon enough.IB had Tarantino written all over it.

Good...but definitely not worthy to be placed in IMDb Top 250,"IMDb rating 8.4(Way too high...pull it down,fellas) and thats not all ranked #90 in all time best list(kick 'em off out of 200) Inglorious bast**ds...whatever we may spell is a good entertainer but thats all it is...A good straight forward entertaining hypothetical drama set up in WWII. It starts off with a bang during the interrogation by Christopher Waltz but consistently keep on losing its way. Brat Pitt has given the career worst performance.Am I the only one who thinks so or others are with me on this. But on the contrary, Waltz is amazing as Colonel Hans Landa and I guess has won one of the most deserving Oscars in the history. If I've to rate the movie in parts having Waltz, I would go for a nine pointer and for those with Pitt and co., 5 point someone at best. This is the real problem of the movie, Its good maybe great but only in patches...There are purple patches only to be followed by equally long lean patches. What I expect from a high rated movie is that it allow me to participate in it,let me think and not haughtily show whatever they want. But here in the end I am left like a dumb...Hitler attended a movie premiere with a tight security of 2 GUARDS...Unreal man....

It's inglorious alright,"In Nazi occupied France, young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa. Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller takes a rapid interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theater she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the ""Basterds"", a group of Jewish-American guerilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history...Let me start by saying that despite my love for cinema and the number of films I watch per week, I never payed much attention to Quentin Tarantino's work. I did saw Kill Bill some time ago but I really didn't like it. Having said that, I'm well aware of Tarantino's style and formula and here he presented us with more from the same.The question that ensues is, are you a fan of Tarantino? For someone that enjoyed his previous work this film will probably be a delight; for me, I wouldn't say it was a disappointment, because knowing the kind of films Tarantino does, I was already expecting something among the lines of what I saw but I guess I still had a little bit of hope this film would be different.As I see it, Inglourious Basterds is painfully long and for the most part it feels inert with never ending dialog that isn't really necessary.The acting was completely over the top, specially Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz. Despite being known as the pretty boy in Hollywood I consider Brad Pitt to be one of the finest actors out there and he has starred in some of my favorite movies but his acting here is just all over the place.Then again, this is a Tarantino movie, so this is expected. The beautiful Diane Kruger who I usually enjoy watching didn't stood up for me either,I don't know if it was the fact that she spoke German most of the time and I'm used to see her speaking English or if I was just fed up with the movie by then but something was a little off with her.Anyway, as I mentioned before, in the end, it all comes down to a matter of taste,fans of Tarantino will most likely be pleased and non-fans will probably dislike the film. For me, 20 minutes of witty dialog and explicit( and somewhat funny) violence isn't worthy of watching 130 minutes of boring and pointless narrative.6/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Tarantino's best,"World War II is an ever-popular subject among filmmakers and pretty much everything has already been done, yet Inglourious Basterds is a breath of fresh air thanks to its originality and creativity, far from a typical war movie in more ways than one.First of all, its attitude. There's no glorification of war heroes or one-sided narrative. We don't see the good, only the bad and the ugly. There's a ton of violence, but a lot of humour as well. And there's no regard for historical facts, it's all fiction.Christoph Waltz delivers a performance that deservedly won every award available. His portrayal of a Nazi is unlike what we've been used to: he is charismatic, well-mannered, sharp-witted, mesmerisingly calm and viciously evil. A great example is his conversation with Shoshanna at the restaurant, it really gave me the chills, though the opening scene is also a highlight.The structure also adds to the suspense. It consists of five chapters and each of them focuses, for the most part, on one location and one long scene. The farm, the lair, the restaurant, the underground bar and the movie theatre, all of them highly memorable. Actually, they are done so well that they could stand on their own, but it all comes together in an impressive climax.All the things that make a Tarantino movie great are present here in abundance. Inglourious Basterds is deliciously stylish and beatufiully shot. Also, his trademark use of dialogue is at its very best here, the way tension is building up is absolutely riveting.For example, all these elements combine greatly in the opening scene. The gorgeous scenery accompanied by classical music (Für Elise), the friendly chat that slowly turns into interrogation and then into massacre.The fact that the central part of the action takes place in a movie theatre allows Tarantino to express his love of cinema and especially the European cinema of the time (that's mostly done through the movie itself) and his beloved Spaghetti Western (that's mostly done through the way it is filmed).",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Pains me to see reviews with 1 and 2 ratings.,"Tarantino is wild. He's one of the most imaginatively creative directors of our times. He is that one director who turns wild fantasies, I'm sure the one that every right thinking individual has into a fantastic screenplay. That scene was the most satisfying scene is cinema history.This was Christoph Waltz' first film with Tarantino and also his first Hollywood film I'm guessing. If only we got to see more of this fine gentleman's acting skills. We also get to see him in Django, he's insanely good in this film. He creates an aura of tension whenever he comes in screen. The guy speaks a host of different languages too and that Italian speaking scene is Comedy Gold. The opening scene is one of the most tense and riveting scenes in movie history. A sheer study in how to build tension, credit for which obviously goes to Mr. Tarantino who wrote it and directed it geniusly.I've watched this film so many times as it has such memorable and iconic scenes and is very satisfying.Thank God for Tarantino.Peace out!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
The actors are top notch and the carnage is just right.,"In Nazi-occupied France during World War II, a plan to assassinate Nazi leaders by a group of Jewish U.S. soldiers coincides with a theatre owner's vengeful plans for the same.
Directors: Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth (uncredited). What a great flick.Quentin Tarantino returns with the story of the Basterds, a group of Jewish soldiers performing guerilla warfare and terror tactics behind enemy lines to strike fear into the hearts of German soldiers during World War II. Inglourious Basterds is a very difficult film to pigeonhole. It's part Jewish revenge fantasy, part gung ho war film, part knowing parody of patriotic flag wavers and 100% Tarantino. Tarantino has found his new muse in Melanie Laurent. She was fabulous . The performance of Christoph Waltz, playing the Nazi Gestapo figure Col. Hans Landa, is the highlight of the film. His ability to convey courtliness and sympathy and then go to commit the cruelest of horrors is simply superb.
Inglourious Basterds is naughty, apocalyptic fun -- Tarantino's version of a war movie, with history rewritten to avenge the guilty in ways that satisfy his pop-art cinema. Like a bat to the head, it's not too subtle, but you can't help but watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

The ultimate cinema basted is back but is it cinema bliss or a total miss?,"It's been a long time coming, sure some might argue that Kill Bill isn't a total mess, but for a lot of people Quentin Tarentino hasn't made a good film since Jackie Brown. Does Inglourious Basterds mark his triumphant return as king or does it just dig his grave deeper? The story takes place in Nazi occupied France and a young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa. Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller quickly takes an interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theatre she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the ""Basterds"", a group of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history.Let's face it, the first trailer for this was terrible. It looked and sounded like kill Bill the World War II version, and true to formula it is. Oddly enough however that works to the films advantage rather than as a handicap. In Kill Bill the endless homage and references were almost unbearable. Any fan of The Shaw Brothers or Lady Snowblood could see from the second that film started who and what he was ripping off, which wouldn't have been a problem if it had been done well. reservoir Dogs, fantastic movie, total rip off of the movie ""City on Fire"". Why is it so highly touted as one of the best movies of all time? It's because Tarentino knew how to improve on the formula. With Kill Bill he did nothing but homage. Granted Inglorious Basterds isn't a fantastic movie, it's enjoyable, funny and wonderfully acted but in ten years time nobody will be referring to it as a classic. It has a lot going for it, the story is always engaging and takes several highly amusing twists that you don't see coming.So why doesn't it entirely work? For many of the same reasons Kill Bill didn't work. Tarentino is really smart about knowing what just the right about of good is. He never overdoes it and when it's good it's fantastic. That said the film features some scenes of just monotony, mostly when Eli Roth rears his head but in a movie this well polished the moments of low grade stuff sticks out a mile. Pitt is passable as Lt. Aldo Raine but it's his co star Christoph Waltz WHO BRINGS THE GOOD. He is smart, edgy and most important absolutely hysterical. What it lacks is the texture of felt life; to put it another way, you don't believe a word of it. To fans of ""pure"" cinema this might not matter, because the film creates a world unto itself; it is about technique and spatial understanding, not realism. (The same defence used to be deployed by fans of Brian De Palma). But lacking that human dimension, the QT effect will always come up short. He's a great film encyclopaedist, which is somewhat different from a great film-maker.QT's bullet-speed banter is back (although without the modern pop references, obviously), firing out a hail of comedy moments, with rat-a-tat regularity. The opening act feels like a spaghetti western, as we're introduced to the film's star man, Nazi officer and ace 'Jew hunter' Landa (Christoph Waltz's scene-stealing moments are brimming with malice and ominous humour), before picking up pace as a war flick with the unleashing of the Basterds, a brutal Dirty Dozen who carve swastikas onto the faces of their foes. The director's signature flourishes – close-ups of female feet, biting barroom banter and the Mexican stand-off – all get a fresh and funny update. The soundtrack's decent, too.Verdict: Tarentino's back but not quite on top form. This is undoubtedly the best film he has made this decade but something feels out of place whether it be the underuse of the bastards or the stilted first act this is no Pulp Fiction. It is, however, a good film full of, as I like to put it ""F*ck Yeahs"". it will have you hooting and hollering until the final credits roll. The picture contains all the things his fans like about Tarantino -- the wit, the audacity but at the very same time it leaves in everything we don't favour him for. Hopefully next time he can iron out the wrinkles. 3/5.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Don't know what kept me from watching this before,"A fantastic film, which has an espionage feel to it along with graphic violence and gore, which I personally love watching (especially evil people getting butchered and shot gorily and stuff).This has some of the best performances I have seen from any actor. Brad Pitt did a spectacular job and that accent of his made it more entertaining (don't know if he nailed the accent or not). Melanie Laurent also played her role to perfection. Though being an ensemble piece, the show stealer for me is Christoph Waltz. Man, he had such a great screen presence and I couldn't picture anyone else playing that role! There were no weak links whatsoever. This movie is conversation-driven for the majority of its duration, but was thoroughly engaging and well-written. Cinematography, sound design and VFX were top notch. Another major plus point is the costuming and make-up, though minimalistic and nothing extravagant, but must have been thoroughly difficult to nail it, as simple make-up and costuming often proves to be the most difficult to get it right. The set designs also gave the feel of the 1940's era.A must-watch for all the people who love intense character-driven stories along with occasional gore and bloodshed.

One of the best films I ever watched.Such a good story,"""Inglourious Basterds deserves an unequivocal 10/10. Quentin Tarantino's audacious storytelling takes center stage, weaving a riveting alternate history narrative set in World War II. The stellar ensemble cast, led by Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz, delivers unforgettable performances. Waltz, in particular, shines with his magnetic portrayal of Colonel Hans Landa, earning him a well-deserved Oscar. The film's dialogue is razor-sharp, complemented by Tarantino's signature blend of tension and humor. Cinematically, it's a visual feast, with masterful cinematography and a soundtrack that adds a distinctive layer. Tarantino's nonlinear approach builds suspense, leading to a cathartic climax.

We know it happened, quadrillions other genocides happened throughout history too, without Hollywood making a billion films about them - akin to the effect of a brainwash.

The actors portrayed a lot of punch to it I mean the Germans were really German, American Jews a real American Jews; my point is that with these actors when they acted scenes where the people were speaking Germans or french made the movie even more fantastic the touch of realism is magnificent because well Germans speak German and french Le français, it not being pretentious at all and its very amusing with Tarantino invigorating dialog scripts.Hey Quentin did it again it another masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Not Very Glorious But Passable To An Extent,"So much hype but does the film deliver on its promises? Not exactly. Tarantino has managed to capture the European essence in his film. The sets, the landscapes, the costumes, the actors and the camera-work that gives a spacious feel of old Europe are well used. The film also has a polished look with some fine cinematography and background score. Most of Tarantino's films are ridden on dialogue and violence. 'Inglourious Basterds' is no exception but here he fails to create a balance unlike in his previous works ranging from 'Pulp Fiction' to 'Deathproof' where he succeeded in combining the two. Here, the dialogues are very long but most of the time they lack the meat and after some point they lose momentum. As someone who enjoys violence in movies, 'Inglourious Basterds' fails to deliver on that count too. For me the violence has to have some relevance to the story but here it appears a little out of place and safe (when compared to his other works). I didn't find the characters to be well developed either but some of the acting namely by a tortured Mélanie Laurent and a hateful Christoph Waltz was very good. Diane Kruger too manages to stand out in a brief role. Brad Pitt fails to impress. Daniel Brühl is passable. Overall, in my opinion, 'Inglourious Basterds' is a strictly average film mainly lifted by fine execution and a few notable sequences like the fire scene and the shootout in the bar.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Tarantino's On Fire ..!!,"In Nazi-occupied France during World War II, a group of Jewish-American soldiers known as ""The Basterds"" are chosen specifically to spread fear throughout the Third Reich by scalping and brutally killing Nazis.This is the ending that the holocaust truly needed & millions wished for. The opening scene between Nazi Colonel Hans Landa (Christopher Waltz), nick-named the Jew Hunter & LaPadite is one of the best scenes in cinematic history. This scene will take your breath away & your heart will be pounding all the way through. Brad Pitt does not dominate the film, as one would expect & its not really a bad thing in this case. The scalping scenes with Brad Pitt & his Basterds will leave you in splits or freak you out. I loved the way this movie was told. Tarantino is one of the best storytellers ever.Christopher Waltz, god this man made me hate him & love him at the same time & he won an Oscar for that. I am very happy that he won, he portrayed the most insane character so well. Humour is very much a key part as with all Tarantino films. The violence is sudden & lyrical. This film is a piece of art. Shoshanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) who manages to escape from under Landa's nose & plays a key part at the end was wonderful. There are so many parts to this movie that I can't indulge here. Diane Kruger also gives a solid performance. For a Holocaust movie, Hitler is very much sidelined.This is a beautiful film, inspite of its questionable politics & its textured characters, the poetry of the dialogue & its exquisite images. But more because it is so acutely bizarre that it's the closest we might ever get to the truth. This is definitely one of the most satisfying films in all aspects.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Pulp Fiction goes France in WW 2,"I'm still impressed by this film directed by Quentin Tarantino. The last movie by him which impressed me that much was Pulp Fiction. All the ingredients I loved in Pulp Fiction I found again in Inglorious Basterds. I was totally impressed how Mr. Tarantino handled it to direct a movie with three languages. One of the reasons might be that he made right choices for the cast. Germans/Austrians are speaking German, Americans/British are speaking English and French are speaking French. Only one person in this movie can speak all three (four) languages fluently: the SS Officer Hans Landa. Hans Landa is portrayed by the Austrian actor Christoph Waltz. He must be some kind of a linguistic genius. To be precisely they are speaking a little Italian too. It's worth to watch the movie only to listen to the Italian from Brad Pitt. Unfortunately I don't speak any French but it was wonderful to listen to the other languages I know well. Next to Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt the beautiful French Actress Mèlanie Laurent convinced me.This movie contains a lot of dialogues, humor, bloody violence and perfect acting. It reminded me a lot on Pulp Fiction. The most important thing I was positively surprised as I was about 15 years ago during watching Pulp Fiction. I'm a big fan of Spaghetti Westerns and it was fun hearing familiar sounds in the background. But I wished Tarantino would have used lesser known Music because some of them we already have heard in his former works. Inglorious Basterds includes everything what you need for a pleasant evening: well written dialogues and a lot of killed Nazis.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

I had all the spectrum of emotions while watching this film. I laughed, I cried, I was scared, nervous, I had anticipation....I never thought that I would like a WW2 movie and especially not one about Nazis. But now I can't actually believe and It's weird to say but Hans Landa has become one of my favourite character from a movie... I mean how great is Christoph Waltz??? Without Christoph Waltz I wouldn't have enjoyed the movie as much. He played the best antagonist I've ever seen. And then of course there's so much more that made this movie a masterpiece: The music was just mesmerizing, Brad Pitt played a fabulous role (loved his accent), the cinematography was beautiful and the long scenes built such an amazing tention. Another point that made it so special was that it wasn't only in english. I just loved the fact that it was in german, french, english and Italian (bawn gewrnow ;-)). It made me realise a lot about languages especially for me because I speak exactly those languages. So the first tim I watched it, it was funny because I didn't even realise that they changed language!
I just wanna thank Mr. Quentin Tarantino for always reminding me why I love watching movies and for always making such great masterpieces! That's pure Art. If this movie was a Canvas I would put it in the Louvre! So Merci, Dankeschön, Thank You and Grawzi:-)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Adult puberty?,"I was prepared to write something really mean this time. It was supposed to be about Tarantino wanting us to giggle once again together with the sadist inside us. Giggle about the lynch justice, the reptile morality and the sometimes rather stomach turning violence.But once again I was seduced. Not at least by the dialogues, which go on not only for 5 minutes, but for 10 or nearly 15 minutes. And I promise, even the most shallow action addict will sit quiet, not wanting to miss a word. That's focus, that's great movie-making.But the story is certainly the worst ever by Tarantino, although told in a much clever way. When he leaves the retaliation morals of a 14-year-old, he will not just perform great movie-making. He will also make good films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

cracking comedy!,"I, for one, thought this film was just great. from the tension of the opening scene, to the comedy violence throughout, all the way to the full on denouement: everything was pitch perfect.the colours were just fantastic and the music was spot on (even if not necessarily chronologically accurate!) the best thing about it was the way it managed to be both funny and tense at the same time. i like this in a film. i also liked the way the main languages were used naturally (+ cleverly) throughoutthe acting was phenomenal from one Cristoph Waltz. having never heard of him before this he hit this one out of the park. and then some. Mélanie Laurent, Diane Kruger and Michael Fassbender were great also.

"Interesting, but not the ""New Dirty Dozen"" action film its advertising purports","""Inglourious Basterds"" is an interesting film, but not really a satisfying one. It has the ideas and framework of a cracking 1960's style WWII action spectacle, along the lines of ""The Dirty Dozen"" or ""Where Eagles Dare,"" (Or even Italy's ""Inglorious Bastards"" from which the new film gains its name). But the long sequences that make up IG are really more like outtakes from a Hollywood film. It's as though Tarantinio is presenting the conversations that happened in the big budget 1960s WWII action epic when the camera wasn't on. In that way, it is actually much more like his first commercial feature ""Reservoir Dogs""--long dialog sequences punctuated by violent outbursts; all surface style, no deep characterization; incredibly entertaining dialog, but way too much of it, etc.I had very high hopes after the first sequence, a very skillful lift of the prolonged yet tense opening sequence from Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" But I was soon to find out that the film was just going to be one such sequence after another, each less effective than the last simply due to the repetition. There were no real themes developed, the Basterds (except for Pitt's cartoony ""Psychotic Andy Taylor"") were basically faceless and uninteresting, and the whole thing was unfocused and unbalanced. But even so, the dialog scenes were entertaining while they were taking place—it's just that they served absolutely no other purpose than momentary amusement. It would have been really cool if Tarrantino had collaborated with someone who could have integrated the best of his conversational sparring sequences into an actual story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
The best dialogue in movie history,"In my personal opinion, the conversation at the beginning of the film between the officer and the French farmer is one of the best dialogues in the history of films.As for my opinion of the rest of the film, it is a combination of Jewish revenge against the Germans, as well as the utmost Germans and their arrogance towards the rest of the other races, but the film can be summarized by giving an overview of the manner of the dialogues between the people and its importance for integrating the scenes. It also gave some of the distinctive movements that were among the German soldiers so that you know who the Germans are and who they are They are spies.In short, this film is worth watching more than once.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Some flashes of Tarantino gold, also Nazis","This film has one of the strongest starts I've ever seen. Waltz interrogating a farmer is an absolute triumph of tension building. Tarantino lingers here for far longer than other film makers would, and it's that that pushes the scene to another level. Subsequently any scene throughout the film where Waltz features earns a measure of this same tension. Sadly everything else here doesn't quite stand up. The scene in the basement did something similar and was also enjoyable, with a strong performance from Fassbender. Aside from that, pretty much everything else is frankly ridiculous, yet I didn't find this film funny especially. The dialogue just doesn't hit home in that way very often. The Basterds particularly were both basic and uninteresting, though perhaps that was intended, who knows... I also felt the tension drained from the film towards the end, which is really the opposite of what you want. The more ridiculous and violent the film is, the less compelling it is, but Tarantino wants to get all his tropes in there rather than go with the more serious and exciting film that this truly is at times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

A half masterpiece,"It was so wonderful to escape from all that MTV like trash movies populated with Barbies and Kens and enter a world where good cinema even if crazy is the absolute key word.With the first scene I was put in heaven, with superb dialogs that lasted for minutes and a fabulous camera that managed to captured all the surrounding mysteries and its tinny details as I have seldom seen before. Right there I thought I was in the presence of a second Pulp Fiction. Well, not quite.The movie is a show in originality, specially when Tarantino pulls out his unmatched ability for the long and ultra intense scenes like at the basement bar, another almost unparalleled brilliant moment with dialogs to die for. The way he plays with the German clichés is absolutely incredible. Unfortunately, neither Diane Kruger nor Til Schweiger were a match for the general amazing acting, which reached the climax every time Christoph Waltz entered the scene. Brad Pit's performance was in my opinion far below his capabilities too. He just seemed to be passing by. A big plus was the constant language change between English, German and French, which functioned extremely well.My biggest negative note is the breaking of the movie in too many chapters, which stole some unity. By doing this, Tarantino highlighted the idea that the movie was not thought as a whole, but rather as many different sketches produced in his head over the years and then glued together as a single movie. I also had the impression that now and then, the editing got sloppy.Anyway, a film full of wit and incredible moments. True cinema at its very best with excusable flaws.

A warlike fantasy,"Since his first works, Quentin Tarantino has experimented mixing numerous genres. From violent crime in his early works, to exploitation and martial arts cinema later. In 'Inglourious Basterds' we find a film that also handles numerous genres, mainly western and war, with a good dose of suspense and violence, genres perfectly handled by the filmmaker.
We have endearing characters and masterfully constructed dialogues by Tarantino. And it is that in this film, the long dialogues predominate, but they are written in such an intelligent way that it is impossible to bore the viewer. Dialogues that scene after scene build a suspense that Tarantino makes simple actions, such as serving milk, totally unbearable and keep you on the edge of the seat.
This is, without a doubt, one of the best works in Quentin Tarantino's career. Mixing genres in such a harmonious way and creating a suspense of passage as slow as effective.

8.6/10 - A Stunning Film,"My second Tarantino Movie! :)Inglorious Basterds (yes, it's written that way on purpose) is a 2009 film by Quentin Tarantino. The film follows the Basterds, a special unit of American Jewish soldiers who basically hunts down Nazis, and Shoshanna - a Jewish woman whose family was killed by the Nazis in France during ww2.This film is really sharp and well made, and you can certainly feel it throughout the film - from the amazing cinematography to the amazing acting of the main cast, from the awesome. Thrilling tension-building moments to the very-on-point soundtrack. Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt are both killin it on this film, and the way that this movie got me to the edge of my sit is truly remarkable.However! With all that being said, the film has two tiny problems.1. The pacing feels a bit off from time to time, especially during A German Night in Paris.2. Most of the characters are pretty simple and not so deep.Now, don't get me wrong - I like this movie a lot, and I thought that it was a really fun film to watch (went by so quickly, considering the fact that this film is frickin 2.5 hours) . It does have some good emotional moment (provided by Shoshanna, of course), but most of the film we're more interested in the plot and not THAT emotionally inveseted. It doesn't have to be a complicated film, but it does come with its problems.In conclusion, I find this film extremely enjoyable, and kinda orgasmic on a technical level. It lacks a bit of emotion and interesting characters but it does what it was intended to do very well, generally. Feeling an 8.5/10 on this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made And One Of The Greatest War Films Ever Made. A Tarantino Masterpiece.,"Inglorious Bastards is one of the greatest films ever made that combines excellent direction,brilliant acting,a great screenplay,amazing Action,wonderful soundtrack and black humor. It is one of my favorite movies,a classic war film and a Tarantino Masterpiece.Set in France in the 1940s during World War II,Inglorious Bastards tells the story of a secret army known as The Bastards,a group of Jewish soldiers led by LT. Aldo Raine(Brad Pitt)who hunt,capture,kill and scalp Nazi soldiers. And while The Bastards hunt Nazi soldiers they soon have to deal with Nazi detective Hans Landa(Christoph Waltz)who is nicknamed ""The Jew Hunter"". Meanwhile,young Jewish girl Shoshanna Dreyfus(Melanie Laurant)who owns a local theater wants revenge on the Nazi when the Nazi wants to show one of their films at her theater. The tension builds up to a conclusion that Aldo Raine,The Bastards,Hans Landa or Shoshanna Dreyfus will never forget.Inglorious Bastards is a masterpiece of cinema that will have you mesmerized and glued to the screen,a big and epic War film that is brutal,intense,violent and funny. With Bastards,Quentin Tarantino takes the genre of the Spaghetti Western and applies it to the World War II backdrop and gives viewers not a realistic world,but a Tarantino world where everything is bigger than life and everything is exaggerated beyond belief. Tarantino has never made a conventional film or has never played by the rules and IB is as about as unconventional as it gets because with IB Tarantino gives viewers a WWII film unlike we have never seen before where Tarantino boldly rewrites history and real life characters without a problem and in it's own way makes the revisionist history believable. Tarantino also fills the film with lots of anachronisms using songs and music scores that are not from the 1940s but are from later in the 20th century,it seems like a risky move but songs fit in well with the scenes in the film and you never ask about realism and accuracy. The Screenplay by Tarantino is excellent and unforgettable,with Tarantino giving each of the characters in the film great dialog that's funny and humorous and delightfully over the top. The dialog in the film is very memorable and well-written it stays with you for a days and you will quote lines from the film again and again. The pace of the film is amazing because even though the film is 152 minutes at times it feels like it's 90 minutes thanks to the dialog from Tarantino and editing by Sally Menke making the film go by smoothly and making IB one of the fastest 2 and a half hours you will ever watch. The three main characters in the film Aldo Raine,Hans Landa and Shoshanna Dreyfus are classic Tarantino characters who are very memorable in their own way. The two characters Aldo and Hans are both mirrors of each other in some ways because while Aldo hunts down Nazis and Hans hunts the Jews both characters use similar tactics such as talk,smarts and cleverness to do their job. Both are dangerous and great at what they do. Characters and revenge is a common theme in most of Tarantino's film and Shoshanna Dreyfus is another character looking for revenge. With Shoshanna you feel her rage and anger because of what the Nazis have done to her people and when you see Shoshanna you can relate to her and wanting to have revenge. These are three classic Tarantino characters that will stick with you after watching the film. The violence and Action scenes in the film are done with brilliance and style because every Action done with an air of suspense and great build up and when build up stops and when the Action comes it's like an explosion. This film also has one of the best shootouts in film history and when it happens it will be like someone punched you in the face. The ending of IB is classic Tarantino and it is so powerful that you will be in awe at it's intensity and brilliance and it is truly an ending that you have to see and believe. It's a great explosive ending and is one of the reasons Inglorious Bastards is a masterpiece.The whole cast does an excellent job in their roles. Brad Pitt is excellent as LT. Aldo Raine,with Pitt bringing humor and over the top greatness to the role. Christoph Waltz won a Oscar for his brilliant and masterful performance as Hans Landa,one of the best villains in film history. Waltz is menacing,powerful,terrifying and unforgettable in his role. Great performance. Melanie Laurent is wonderful and sexy as Shoshanna Dreyfus,with Laurent bringing intensity and depth to the role. Eli Roth is funny and tough as Donny Donowitz,nicknamed ""The Bear Jew. Michael Fessbender is great as LT. Archie Hicox,a British soldier who works with The Bastards. Diane Kruger is fantastic as Bridget Von Hammersmark,a double agent working with The Bastards. Daniel Bruhl is great as Freddrick Zoller,a German war hero who likes Shosanna. Til Schweiger is tough and intense as Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz,a German soldier killer who helps The Bastards. August Dieli is wonderful in his role as German soldier Major Hellstrom. Gedeon Burkhard is smooth and cool as Cpt. Wilhelm Wicki. Martin Wuttke(Hitler)and Sylvester Groth(Joseph Goebbels)give fun and over the top performances. Mike Myers(Gen. Ed Fenech),B.J Novak(Pfc. Utivich),Jacky Ido(Mercel),Rod Taylor(Winston Churchill),Julie Dreyfus(Francesca),Omar Doom(Pfc. Omar)and Denis Menochet(Perrier LaPadite)give good performances too.The direction by Quentin Tarantino is excellent,with Tarantino bringing a beautiful and gritty cinematic style to the film and moving the camera at all costs when needed. Great direction by Tarantino.I love music that is used in this film which is mostly composed songs from Ennio Morricone and other composers. I also loved the use of the song Cat People from David Bowie. Great soundtrack.In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,War Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Inglorious Bastards,an epic Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

A definite standout was Christoph Waltz , his performance was very believable and well written just like every other Tarantino film.Since this is a Tarantino film , the bloody fights and gore are still present however there is just too many characters in this one and no one really gets enough time to shine especially Brad Pitt.Waltz steals every scene he is in but the plot just dragged for too long losing focus on characters.I was amazed by the bar scene and everything about it but for every good moment in this movie there is at least 3 boring conversations and scenarios that are just not interesting enough because the characters are not interesting enough for me to care.Reservoir Dogs was a much shorter film but did an incredible job with character , same goes to Pulp Fiction , same goes to Jackie Brown.I am not saying this movie needed more action.

A completely juvenile film,"Sitting in the cinema, I was absolutely furious with myself for paying money to see this trash. The violence was gratuitous, every scene and character was clichéd, QT was just trying way too hard. It was hard to shake the feeling that this film was adapted from a short story written by a 14 year old boy trying to shock his parents, and make his friends think that he is cool. The strudel scene made me ill. Here's the overdone cliché: let's make the bad guy eat food and talk with his mouth full. How many times have we seen this in a film? This film was yawn from one end to the other. When I wasn't rolling my eyes at the ridiculous scenes of violence, I was yawning at the drawn out conversations, and the obvious efforts that went into 'building tension.'

Somewhat of a turning point for Tarantino,"There's a scene in Inglorious Basterds where the Nazi's are cheering on a film depiction of one of their most highly praised war heroes, a sniper who killed over 300 Allies. As they cheer for ""our"" onscreen deaths, we as an audience wait in eager anticipation for theirs, for the cathartic fulfillment of a revenge fantasy. The Nazi deaths, when they come, are not cathartic, but sickening and appalling in their unflinching brutality. The film throws the audience's lust for violence back in its face. The impulse toward violence is not exclusive to Nazi's, but a common human trait.The promotional material for this movie gives the viewer the false impression that it is a Dirty Dozen homage about a ragtag group of Nazi hunters who beat, shoot, and scalp their way across Germany. In reality the Basterds are but one of several intertwining plot threads. The film is more interested in emotionally charged conversations, hidden identities, and subtle expressions of body language than in a stock plot about Nazi killers.Inglorious Basterds is often overwhelmingly suspenseful and engrossing, but I could never completely lose myself in the world of this film. It somewhat feels more like a well rehearsed and intricately constructed stage play than an immersive movie experience. Tarantino indulges in stylistic choices - occasional narration, cutaways, a character title card, frequent cinematic references - that are fun to watch but leave the impression that this is a movie that knows it's a movie, and wants the audience to know that too. The real historical characters in this movie - Goebbels, Hitler, Churchill - are seemingly based more on cinematic caricatures of those people than on the people themselves. Brad Pitt's character is a welcome injection of humor and warmth, but his character feels like it has been transplanted from a 1960's war movie. The Basterds are rarely given any depth beyond one or two characteristics. The best moments of the movie are when Tarantino released the reins and simply let's the story unfold itself, as in the opening scene with the hidden Jews and the conversation in the Nazi tavern.There is a self awareness, a sense of tight, mannered control here that was not present to this extent in Tarantino's earlier films. Although I prefer movies that are more immersive, less self consciously stylized, I still must recommend this movie as a singular feat of filmmaking craft.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Brilliant characters, brilliant dialogue.","The plot of this film was utterly ridiculous.If it had a point, I must confess I missed it.But more importantly, NONE OF THAT MATTERS. This is the film that brought us Christoph Waltz as Hans Landa, who will no doubt go down as the best film-Nazi of all time. This character alone should be sufficient to forgive any and all shortcomings.But, having redeemed itself with Waltz, they also give us Mélanie Laurent's marvellous performance as Shoshanna-Emmanuelle, Diane Kuger's performance as Bridget von Hammersmark, along with numerous other excellent performances, such as those by Brad Pitt, Eli Roth, B.J. Novak and many others.To top it off, we get what is arguably the best use of a David Bowie song of any film set in the 1940's.It doesn't matter whether you like or hate the plot, just sit back and enjoy the absolutely delicious dialogue!Best line: 'I love rumours!

Not a moment i took my eyes or ears from this movie.,"Every scene from this film lingers in my mind, right from the interrogation scene with Landa to the tense moments in the tavern, and all the way to Aldo's final scene. Truly a QT masterpiece, ""Inglourious Basterds"" embodies everything Tarantino stands for-sharp dialogue, rich character development, and his signature blend of tension and dark humor.The opening scene, where Colonel Hans Landa interrogates a French farmer, sets the tone for the entire film. Christoph Waltz, who plays Landa, dominates the screen with his calm yet sinister demeanor. The way Landa toys with his prey, starting the conversation politely and methodically before finally revealing his true intentions, is both mesmerizing and terrifying. It's a slow-burn kind of suspense that keeps you on edge, not knowing exactly when the hammer will fall. This scene alone encapsulates Tarantino's mastery of dialogue as a weapon-where words feel just as lethal as bullets.Landa's performance is contrasted by the ragtag team of the Basterds, led by Brad Pitt's Lt. Aldo Raine. Aldo's brash, southern-accented charisma is almost the opposite of Landa's calculated menace, but both are equally captivating. The Basterds' mission-to terrorize and hunt down Nazis-is depicted in both brutal and absurd ways, balancing the horrors of war with Tarantino's exaggerated sense of revenge. Moments of sheer violence, like the infamous ""Bear Jew"" scene, are shocking yet laced with a macabre humor. The line ""Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps"" Perfect!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Different perspective...,"""Inglourious Basterds"" is a Drama - War movie in which we watch a group of Jewish U.S. soldiers during World War II, having a top secret mission, to assassinate specifically Nazi leaders. They have a great opportunity when they find out that most of the Nazi leaders will be on a theater so, they have to figure out a way to do it.I have to admit that I had high expectations from this movie and I was not disappointed by it. Quentin Tarantino did an amazing job for one more time on the direction of the movie and I believe that he found a clever way to present World War II. The interpretations of Christoph Waltz who played as Col. Hans Landa, Brad Pitt who played as Lt. Aldo Raine and Diane Kruger who played as Bridget von Hammersmark were very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Michael Fassbender's who played as Lt. Archie Hicox and Mélanie Laurent's who played as Shosanna. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a nice movie and I recommend everyone to watch it because it's a different movie about World War II and I am sure that will surprise you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Well, Well, Well, How the Turntables!","Set in Nazi-occupied France with solid dialogues in four languages, vivid violence, a young Jewish girl, bloodthirsty American soldiers, a grand Nazi night and plans to take down the Third Reich that you wouldn't find in any history books. Quentin Tarantino's attempt to right the wrongs of the past brings to life one of his finest films- a dark, comic fantasy.Inglourious Basterds unfolds in five chapters and features one of the best opening scenes.The fifteen minutes segment introduces us to the ambitious, ironic and fantastical Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), Nazi Sherlock Holmes, interrogating a farmer for the whereabouts of the Jewish Dreyfus family. Waltz's impeccable performance blends charm with villainy and earned him the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.The second chapter introduces the Basterds, led by the cool and comical Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), infamous for their barbearic (pun intended) ways of warfare. The British send in one of their own, Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender), a film critic war hero, with a plan spiced up by the gorgeous German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger).Coinciding with their plan is that of the vengeful Shosanna Dreyfus' (Mélanie Laurent). Her story is the film's heart and helps connect the dots. Laurent plays the role our traumatised heroine elegantly. She is symbolic of what a persecuted people feel under tyrannical foreign rule which sometimes manifests itself as the constant annoying presence of Pfc. Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl), the poster boy for Nazi propaganda.Not for the fainthearted, Tarantino stylises violence to the point of cathartic sadism doused with comic relief. Some scenes get so nerve-wracking that even four languages are not enough to describe them and rely on emotions. The movie culminates with a cataclysmic ending at Shoshanna's cinema. The outright unpredictability makes it engrossing from beginning to end despite its long runtime, leaving us wondering how the tables turned (pun intended).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
4 plays Tarantino,"Tarantino explores his own film making career with a fizzing demonstration of his writing and directing craftwork and zeal. Unbridled joyfullness in the extreme finds it's apogee with an adventure pulp fiction regarding cross and double cross under the Nazi empire in occupied France in World War Two with vengence and rebellion and spies and secret agents, Gestapo and SS, and almost every Nazi celebrity.'Inglorious Basterds' has multiple strands unflatteringly and inconsistently brought together in an orgy of climaxes.Tarantino used to write characters in the 1990's but often in the 21st century he seems to write caracitures and archetypes, when it works it produces screenplays that ooze Tarantino's vision and films fetid with his styles and signifiers. In this film I believe that it doesn't quite work out.In 'Inglorious Basterds' this forceful pulp fiction treatment of characters certainly inhibits nuanced or implicit acting by all except for the actors playing the cinema owning French ""undesirables"" who are playing their parts as if in a different film from the rest of the cast. And in many ways they are. Which is the central criticism of the film as a whole.In a worthy effort at irreverent and intemperate iconoclasm and madcap imagination regarding the second world war 'Inglorious Basterds' seems less than the sum of it's considerable parts.At times gorgeous scenes, particularly in the first period, contrast with the vile behaviour of Nazi Germans in uniform and stylish violence and chaotic action scenes are trademark stamped like punctuation through the two and a half hours that the film lasts for.However my sense that this is an incomplete work, because it's own parts are somehow incompatible, despite the best efforts of Tarantino to write and direct them until they do gel, is my abiding impression.I rate a 6/10 overall because there is a good 4 films worth of bombastic and vibrant historical adventure material here and taken in smaller degrees much is to be appreciated but the work as a whole is not a fair comparison to the great work put into it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Apart from some solid performances, this is an overlong and self-indulgent experience for me.","Pitt plays his character as a supposed broad comic caricature but I find the character deeply annoying and unfunny. Waltz is very good as a Nazi and a small cameo from a almost unrecognisable Meyers is surprisingly good, if only the makeup didn't give him away. Fassbender too is very good in quite a small role.There is a nihilistic pleasure to be had from killing Nazis but the pacing in this film is off. First chapter starts well, then by the third it feels like filler then the rest just feels like a period take on the recent Ocean's Eleven films. This film is very dialogue heavy, and while this is historical fiction, some dialogue feels very anachronistic. The whole things feels overlong, self-indulgent and even quite petulant(e.g. the notes that pop up on screen with a big arrow pointing to someone of importance).The cinematography is quite pretty in places, but I never really feel as if it's the Forties.The score would be perfect for a western or a seventies exploitation film but here feels unfitting and too bombastic. It takes me out of the period the film is supposed to be set.Overall: a very frustrating experience for me as the premise has so much promise but the result is too busy boasting the usual Tarantino touches that it misses something vital: heart. Sure, it may mostly look 'cool' but I didn't like any of the protagonists enough to care.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Chaotic experience,"Tarantino films is always a different gravy for me. From Pulp Fiction to Django Unchained, almost all of them are absolute cinema. This film also is it. A chaotic yet glorious tale of two sides who would eventually end up with one goal. It tells the intertwines two plots: a group of Jewish-American soldiers known as the ""Basterds,"" led by the charismatic Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who aim to brutally kill Nazis, and Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), a French-Jewish woman seeking revenge against Nazi's officer, Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) for her family's murder.The storyline is as usually Tarantino's style, nonchronological order. Always love this kind of story and makes me wonder how all the plots will tied in the climax. The films also doing great in building suspense, often starting witch casual or witty dialogue and ended as chaotic as possible. Notably every scene of Hans Landa especially.

Bloody revenge fantasy,"I would rank this movie on the same level as Django Unchained and it contains a lot of similar themes. The historical revisionist fantasy is the main premise, buttressed by gratuitous violence. This makes it natural to compare the two films.

Despite this, the film does suffer from a grievous ethical code which is perhaps intended to be insightful but comes across as crude most of the time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

I didn't care for any of the characters, which I guess I didn't need to but they weren't developed very much which made them quite stale. The movie is quite funny though, especially the action scenes and it does get disgustingly brutal at points which works well for the movie.

This film's a bingo,"Here we have a film that has always had a special place in my heart. It was one of the first hard R films I saw in theaters and the first Tarantino film I saw uncut (I'd watched Pulp Fiction on TV before). As far as war films, a genre I've mentioned before as not being a huge fan of, go, this is one of the best. It's simple escapism without needing to be bogged down with a message that's been done to death. The story is perfectly written, paced, and structured, introducing all the plot points and major players flawlessly. While there isn't as much action as the trailers would have you believe, the film is never boring, thanks to Tarantino's signature quirky dialogue, memorable characters, awesome score, and fantastic art direction (especially the theater) and camerawork. Sure, the gunfight in the tavern is shot very chaotically, but that's easy to forgive since it's such a chaotic scene. And of course, it all leads to an epic third act and explosive (literally and figuratively) climax. Yes, what happens at the end is nowhere near what happened in real life. But, as I always say, why let the truth get in the way of a good story? And this is certainly that.The cast is absolutely phenomenal. First of all, props to the casting department for using actual Germans, as opposed to the usual method of Americans with fake accents. The fact that they can all act in English, German, etc, makes it all the better. Each character, no matter how small their role, is a joy to watch and easy to remember long after. Even Eli Roth, who's usually a director, gives an awesome performance. And, this film gave several future big stars, like Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender, their first big break. At the heart of the cast are two performance that really make the film. One is Brad Pitt, who just looks like he's having a blast making this and it really shows in his exaggerated mannerisms, accent, and quirks, especially during his first speech. The other is Waltz, who plays one of the absolute best villains ever, charming and suave, yet ruthless, cunning, and calculating. And Waltz truly sells this guy, while adding his own personal quirks, from the weird way he eats to his serious overreaction to a joke.Overall, this is one of my personal favorites, not just among Tarantino's films, but in general. It's just a real good time and fifteen years later (still can't believe it's been that long), has yet to lose its luster.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Disappointing to the point of irritation,"First of all let me say that in general I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino movies. But this one left me cold. I've given it a day or 2 to think about it and I've decided that this is not a very good film.Now we all know that Tarantino knows his cellulose - and there is homage throughout all of his movies to some of the greatest films of all time. We know already Quentin! Why keep doing it! Isn't it about time you moved on?For me the worst point of this movie was its counterfactual content. Everyone of a certain age and intelligence knows that Hitler blew his brains out in a bunker in Berlin in 1945. But I wouldn't mind betting that many watchers would have skipped out of the cinema thinking that World War II came to an end in 1944 because of some huge explosion in a cinema! Not so.Now defenders of this movie will probably claim that ""it's an art movie - anything goes"". Okay fine. But it is still a movie. Art films don't have to be counterfactual, but they can be fictional, example, Babettes Feast, Jean de Florette, Once upon a time in the West, they still tell stories fantastically well and look brilliant. You can also have art movies that are factual, for example, the Passion of Joan of Arc, Amadeus. These are some great movies! But Inglorious Basterds doesn't hold a candle to any of these - not even in the same league. Why? On this showing Tarantino has reduced the war movie to a comedy. It's a very odd comedy, a violent comedy, a character's larger-than-life comedy. But it's a comedy nonetheless.Tarantino is trying to do a lot of things with this film. For one thing, he is making a statement about the power of film and its propaganda qualities. For another he's trying to say, "" yeah, the Jews had it rough"". Yes Quintin, we know already. He's also trying to say people will sell each other out if the price is right. Okay, we know. You told us before.The film just doesn't hang together. But then Tarantino films can have separate stories running within them, Pulp Fiction being the classic of this type. Pulp Fiction contains larger-than-life characters and is hysterically funny. I didn't want for this movie to be a comedy especially since it begins with the brazen ( and predictable) murder of a basement full of Jews hiding from the Nazis. Okay Quentin you got my attention. But then the film descends into comedy and parody and homage and we've seen it all before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Very good,"Exceptionally good. The genre ""Guerra"" can only be characterized by the historical context, because in what concerns action scenes on the battlefields; mishmash of human bodies lying on the ground or enemy armies, this is left aside in Inglourious Basterds. The feature film focuses on two stories that are initially parallel, however, as the film develops, these stories intersect in a very interesting way. In general, what most calls the attention of those who watch is the complexity and tension present in each dialogue. It is worth emphasizing the importance of the soundtrack.

Inglourious Basterds - A Stylish but Uneven Tarantino Fantasy,"Inglourious Basterds is one of those films that looks great on the surface, but something feels off. Quentin Tarantino, as always, plays with genres, history, and his signature dialogues, but this time, not everything lands perfectly.It starts off strong- the farmhouse scene where Hans Landa methodically, almost politely, hunts down hidden Jews is a masterclass in tension. Christoph Waltz completely steals the show, making his character both charismatic and terrifying, with just the right touch of dark humor. Honestly, he's the most memorable part of the entire film.The Basterds themselves, despite being the title characters, feel somewhat underdeveloped. Brad Pitt's exaggerated accent is fun, but the squad as a whole doesn't get much depth or screen time. Even Shoshanna, who plays a major role in the story, feels like she's in a separate film, running a parallel storyline that barely intersects with the main plot.As expected from Tarantino, there's plenty of violence-scalping, executions, a burning cinema, and an over-the-top assassination of Hitler. It's all visually striking, but at some point, it stops feeling impactful and starts resembling a stylized revenge fantasy rather than a real story.In the end, I have mixed feelings. The film is stylish, the performances are strong, and some scenes are fantastic. But the pacing is uneven, the plot feels scattered, and I never felt fully invested.

QT does it again.,"INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, like most of Quentin Tarantino's cinematic output, is brilliant. This does not mean it is perfect, but the talent, vision, and skill that permeates this exceptional addition to Tarantino's film canon make it one of his best.So much has been written about QT's films being a breath of fresh (and sometimes foul) air compared, to recent Hollywood productions, that it seems futile to try to add to the critical literature. It has all been said. The remarkable consideration of QT's work is how he came to be regarded as the master filmmaker of his generation: notably his formative experience of working in a video store during the '80s' home movie craze, which gave hungry cinephiles like himself access to hundreds if not thousands of films that had formerly been very difficult to see except during their first-run exhibition in movie theatres or later on so-called all-nite shows that appealed to many of us who thrilled at the discovery of hard-to-find films we'd only read about in film fan magazines. Clearly though, in QT's case, video stores were his university; an institution without formalities where he always got an A+, at least for enthusiasm. The man bleeds cinema.This breeds high expectations from a filmmaker whose autodidactic achievements can only be an inspiration to younger filmmakers. Therefore, when turning his genius to Second World War-themed material the result better darn well be exceptional. INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS delivers the goods.Brad Pitt, the endlessly energetic actor whose classically-perfect leading man's looks serve to only further enhance his appeal, never to distract from it, commandeers a perfect cast, though Christoph Waltz's performance, which puts the capitals in BIG, almost succeeds in stealing top acting honours. There is the expected QT allotment of extreme violence, tempered by its restraint-yes, you read that right. Another QT trademark is his unfortunate and seemingly endless sprinkling of profanity. The Puritan in me will always question his need for that. QT is a master of form, construction and poetic realism in this writing. He doesn't need the ""bad words"" and could do so much more, poetically, without them, but that's also a matter of taste.But to top it off, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS on Blu-ray is full of extras that are well-worth checking out.

A brilliantly unconventional war epic,"""Inglourious Basterds"" (2009), directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a brilliantly unconventional take on World War II that blends intense drama, dark humor, and sharp dialogue. The film is divided into five chapters, each contributing to a grand, revisionist history that showcases Tarantino's unique storytelling style.The ensemble cast delivers standout performances, with Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa being particularly memorable. Waltz's portrayal of the cunning and menacing officer earned him an Academy Award, and his character's interactions are some of the film's most gripping moments. Brad Pitt's performance as Lieutenant Aldo Raine, the leader of the titular Basterds, is equally compelling, providing a mix of bravado and dark humor.Tarantino's script is rich with tension and wit, creating memorable scenes that are both suspenseful and unexpectedly humorous. The opening sequence, a tense interrogation in a French farmhouse, sets the tone for the film's masterful balance of dialogue-driven suspense and violence. The use of multiple languages (English, German, French, and Italian) adds authenticity and depth to the narrative.Visually, the film is stunning, with meticulous attention to detail in its period setting and costumes. The cinematography, by Robert Richardson, captures the film's varied tones, from the gritty realism of war to the stylized grandeur of the Basterds' exploits.""Inglourious Basterds"" is a bold and imaginative reimagining of history, showcasing Tarantino's flair for combining genre elements into a cohesive and thrilling experience. It's a film that entertains while challenging conventional narratives, making it a standout in contemporary cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
I have NEVER seen such a performance ... ever!,"No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them. Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo! He is ULTRA polite with each one; and has supreme confidence in his scary, chilling, bold mannerisms. All I can say is: ""You see this movie for Christoph Waltz's performance; all the rest is secondary""! This is a perfect Tarantino movie. It's explosive and exciting while also deep and well thought out. It took me a minute to get used to reading so many subtitles because of the variety of languages used, but I think that's a quality that makes the movie even more enticing. It is incredibly well done and it had a hold of me from beginning to end. Fair warning for any Tarantino movie, be prepared for the gore and violence. It runs rampant throughout the movie, but it's kind of gratifying seeing it happen to the Nazis.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
An amazing Tarantino film!,"I really loved this film I really like the different points of view of the war from the English, German and American. Christoph Waltz and Daniel Bruhl play frustrating and despicable villains. Brad Pitt and Eli Roth play amazing roles. My favourite role is Melanie Laurent as Shosanna who gets revenge! The female actresses such as Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger played intriguing and amazing roles.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Absolute Cinema,"Inglourious Basterds is an extremely good movie, with plenty of memorable moments that stick with you long after it's over. While the pacing could have been slightly improved in some parts, it's still an incredibly solid film. For me, it's not quite a 10, but it's a solid 9 without a doubt.From beginning to end, the film keeps you emotionally invested. It opens with a strikingly serious tone, making it clear that it's not going to hold back. The story revolves around two seemingly separate plots: the Basterds' revenge mission and Shosanna's journey after losing her family. Each storyline is gripping, filled with tension and drama, especially when Shosanna finds herself face-to-face with the man who killed her family.The acting is phenomenal across the board, elevating every scene. Christoph Waltz as Hans Landa is particularly unforgettable, delivering one of the most chilling and charismatic performances I've ever seen. Every character feels real, and the dialogue, true to Tarantino's style, is sharp, purposeful, and layered with tension.One of the most remarkable things about the movie is its ability to show the fragility of life. Characters die unexpectedly, often in brutal ways, and this unpredictability keeps the stakes high. It's a stark reminder of how fleeting and fragile life is, especially in a world as chaotic as the one depicted here.The only downside for me is that the movie ends too soon. It left me with a strange sense of emptiness, like I wasn't ready to leave the world Tarantino had created. I wanted more-more from the characters, more from the Basterds, and more of that tension-filled brilliance.This movie is a testament to Tarantino's mastery as a director. It's tense, dramatic, and emotionally resonant, with no major flaws to criticize. A true cinematic achievement that leaves you wanting more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

"I Must Say Damn Good Stuff, Sir","Set in Nazi-occupied France during World War II, Inglourious Basterds masterfully blends thriller, dark comedy, and historical fiction to deliver a reimagining of WWII unlike any other. Widely regarded as one of Quentin Tarantino's finest works, the film is packed with iconic scenes and unforgettable moments that leave viewers craving more. Whether through unflinching violence, razor-sharp humor, breathtaking cinematography, or brilliantly crafted dialogue, Tarantino consistently exceeds expectations.With a star-studded cast, every actor delivers a performance worthy of acclaim, but none shine brighter than Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa, infamously dubbed the ""Jew Hunter."" Widely considered one of the best-written villains of the 21st century, Landa is a masterclass in deception-both charming and terrifying in equal measure. Waltz's fluency in four languages, combined with his world-class performance, rightfully earned him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His ability to effortlessly outmaneuver every character in the film makes Landa one of cinema's most compelling antagonists. Meanwhile, Brad Pitt's portrayal of Lt. Aldo Raine delivers an underrated yet hilarious performance, adding a layer of dark comedy to the film's intense atmosphere.Tarantino's signature storytelling style is on full display, using extended dialogue sequences to build tension and immerse the audience in the world he creates. The opening scene, an agonizingly suspenseful conversation between Landa and a French farmer, perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the film. The first hour of this film is largely dedicated to establishing crucial character dynamics and setting the stage for the explosive, high stakes climax. As always, Tarantino masterfully weaves multiple genres together, ensuring every element from action to comedy flows seamlessly.While some history purists may find the film's revisionist approach controversial, Inglourious Basterds is not meant to be a historically accurate retelling. Instead, it serves as a cathartic, vengeful fantasy that revels in its audacious storytelling. If you have a taste for dark humor and bold filmmaking, this movie is an absolute must-watch. However, be warned, this is not a film for the innocent eye.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
A well made movie,"Since it is a Quentin Tarantino movie it's not for everyone. I liked the concept and the idea of the movie. The scenes are well made and the angles are like they should when Quentin is directing.The movie itself reminded me both of Django Unchained and Snatch. It is like Django because there is a lot of action and rage embedded in the characters. But the story is a bit scattered and jumps from place to place. Therefore I thought of Snatch when I saw it. The story is a bit uneven it has its good and bad moments trough out the movie. The ending was in my opinion the worst part. It felt forced and too fast in the Kino.The acting is alright. Brad Pitt's performance was good. His character wasn't that deep and pretty hard to act on but he delivered. But the best performance was in my opinion, Christoph Waltz. He played the SS colonel so well. He was as evil as it gets but still charming and funny. Quentin must have liked him too since he acted in Django Unchained also.Overall a movie some people will find entertaining and some not. It's brutal and leaves little to the imagination.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"""Who wants' to send a message to Germany?""","There are wild differences of opinion on the socially redeeming value of this film. However, the real film that you are buying this for, ""Nation's Pride"" makes ""Triumph of the Will"" look like a B movie.

A stylish Bugs Bunny cartoon with real peoples,"I have to say Quentin Tarantino always make very entertaining films, I do enjoy watching them. This one is very entertaining, but I do have some criticisms. It is basically a pantomime with the nazis being cartoon characters. The guy playing Hitler might as well be in a Bugs Bunny cartoon, so if you're looking for realism then you won't find it here.The writing is very good, except I think sometimes it can be cringeworthy and cheesy. First of all Christopher Waltz is amazingly good at the Nazi guy, he's very charming which makes hi character even scarier, I can see why everyone loved him in this. Then there is Mikey Fassbender, he is as cool as a cucumber a the British guy. The blonde jewish girl is drop dead gorgeous, like a female deer. Diane Kruger is extremely sexy as a hot blonde nazi,I will be fantasising about both of them later yes sir, say what you want about the nazis, but they sure had sex appeal, at times it is hard to tell if you are watching a WW2 movie or looking at a group of supermodels doing an edgy photoshoot.So there is a lot to like about the film, it keeps your attention all the way through, and it looks very stylish and cool. Now for the things I didn't like, well I think that sometimes QT gets praise for being edgy that he doesn't actually deserve, take this movie and Django as examples, it's basically just glorifying murdering nazis and slave owners, there is nothing at all edgy or risky about that in our current culture, it is literally the safest thing you could ever do in a movie.This leads me to the most annoying thing, Brad Pitt and his merry band of nazi hunters, it gave me d**** chills every time they were on screen, this guy is a cookie cutter American square jaw hero, he is collecting nazi scalps, whoah! Look out, captain America is in town, what won't he say? It is just so corny, I know you're supposed to think they're the cool guys, but it's basically just the A team with twice as many members, and taking themselves way too seriously, when you compare them to Christopher Waltz's character he wins by a country mile in the coolness department, does he need a whole crew of yes men with zero personality? No, does he have to try make him self seem tough talking about ripping peoples heads off? No, he has polite but very intimidating conversations whilst drinking milk and eating pastries like a real badass.Now for my least favourite thing about the movie, there is a character called The Bear Jew... really... the character is called The Bear Jew, because he is so big and scary that it is like dealing with a grizzly bear that happens to be circumsided and has keen business instincts, watch out you no good nazis, the Bear Jew is in town, it really makes me cringe so hard. Anyway, if I just make myself ignore the things that annoy me, it is very entertaining and definitely one of Tarantinos best movies, I'd say the 4th best after the first two and then the Hollywood one. I'm going to be very very generous and give it a 9 because Christopher Waltz is awesome, there are two knock out blondes, and lots of stylish nazi imagery, minus one point for the cheesy bear jew and Americans saving the day (as usual) rubbish, I did enjoy it from start to finish and that has to count for something.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

It makes sense when you are in the right mindset ...,"I just wanted to add a kind of retrospective take on the Basterds now we're over a decade after the original release ...When I first saw the film around 2009 I was not a fan at all. Having watched it again today I absolutely loved it. So I asked myself, what has changed? Why such a different feeling this time round?With hindsight, I've realised the reason was because I love authentic war movies, especially those focusing on WW2. The magnitude, the horror, the valour, the world-changing significance; so many things make WW2 a basis for truly gripping action and character stories. Saving Private Ryan and Band Of Brothers come to mind, but there have been countless others. So when I watched Basterds all those years ago, I had a mental map of what a good war movie was; it was admirable strong characters, brotherhood, valour against all odds, and intense believable and historically accurate action.Basterds has none of those features. The characters are mostly deplorable and flawed, brotherhood is shallow at best, it is complete historical fantasy and the action is also pretty ridiculous. It isn't a WW2 movie in any real sense of the word; it's actually a fantasy movie set in a world based on WW2. It brings in all the usual WW2 elements to make it feel familiar, yet pays no real respect them at all. It's a movie comprised of caricatures, if you will.This time round, all these years later, I knew it wasn't a war movie. I knew it was some weird Tarantino fantasy film, and I watched it through that lens. What I got this time were intense fantasy encounters, strong caricatures of familiar historical figures, engrossing dialog jousting, dark twists and turns, unexpected deaths, and a few gritty action scenes. And it was great!In short, I didn't watch it to see a war movie at all. I watched it to see something different ... I wanted fantasy and I got fantasy. I suspect through the lens of fantasy it is deserving of its high praise, and through any of the other lenses that a WW2 based film might prime the viewer with it'll end up disappointing.Now I understand it, I'm looking forward to watching it again in a couple of year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Tarantino's history, rewritten.","Inglourious Basterds is a wild, chaotic masterpiece that's equal parts thrilling and stylish. It's like Tarantino threw history into a blender and added sharp dialogue, unforgettable characters, with just the right amount of humor.There's also the character of Hans Landa: an antagonist who is everything you shouldn't want but can't help falling for. He's brilliant, with a mind so sharp it leaves you breathless. The way he speaks is almost like poetry. Every word perfectly placed, drawing you in without any effort. His charm is magnetic, his confidence unmatched, and there's something about the way his eyes move that feels both thrilling and dangerous.Every moment is just dripping with tension and drama. It's not just a movie, it's a deliciously twisted revenge fantasy that's a little violent, a lot clever, and absolutely unforgettable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

A movie that really got into some details,"Tarantino never lets you down when it comes to cinematography. The scenes are just masterpieces, every one of them. Sometimes camera swaps to a first person and makes us feel the person's anxiety. Sometimes it goes crazy and make you feel like you are in this scene. It makes you feel like you are in this movie. Makes you happy, makes you sad as the movie goes on.But we can't say same things for the plot since it got some corruptions. Althrough the movie got great metaphors (you probably won't notice them, look for a movie analysis after the movie) it still has got some basic disconnections, unexpected character behaviours that cause the movie to be more exciting. Of course we want movie to make us excited but it feels weird when you don't fill the hole between the character and behaviour.Actors did a great job. Especially Christopher Waltz. He needs to be annoying in this movie and he performed very well. But without getting more attention than he needs to get. The actors were great about this. If you play your role unnecessarily hardly, people will notice and your role will be ruined.

ONE HELL OF AN ENJOYABLE WW2 ADVENTURE BY THE LEGENDARY TARANTINO!!!,"Quentin Tarantino is easily one of the greats movie directors of all time!!!
I consider Tarantino to be one of my top 5 fave directors ever along with my number one John Carpenter.
I've loved Tarantino since his blood soaked debut ""Reservoir Dogs"" rocked the world way back in the 90's & of course loved ""Pulp Fiction"" & his true masterpiece in my opinion the excellent ""Jackie Brown"" & his ""Kill Bill"" flicks were great fun too if abit over the top & absolute loved his work on ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" probably the best Vampire film ever made!!! So yeah Tarantino is great & I'm a big fan.Now down to his war epic adventure ""Inglourious Basterds"" it's as expected a fantastically well made & beautifully shot movie, the best of the best from an obsessed movie geek behind the camera & his cast is excellent, even though I'm not a ""Brad Pitt"" fan at all & consider him to be one of the most overrated actors in cinema history along with the terrible ""Tom CULT Cruise"", pitt is good in his role as the scarred Lt. Aldo Raine & he's funny often & has a thick hillbilly accent but the guy that stands out to me was the incredible casting of Horror Director ""Eli Roth"" who plays the baseball bat using big ""Jew Beary"" Sgt. Donny Donowitz who is a scene stealer of a role as beats to death deserving Nazi scum, he's great fun & hilarious at times, now the cast is excellent some truly outstanding performances here from the likes of ""Christoph Waltz"" & ""Michael Fassbender"" & ""Diane Kruger"" & ""Melanie Laurent"" all incredible performances.This is an Awesome piece of Action adventure Thriller & drama set in Nazi occupied France during WW2 & a team of soldiers ""The Basterds"" are sent in behind enemy lines to slaughter & scalp as many Nazi's as possible, there's some Awesome gory scenes & some incredibly intense scenes along with the big pieces of smart & interesting dialogue that Tarantino loves to spill out of his characters!!! It's great entertainment within a work of art piece of filmmaking, Tarantino is a genius!!!
I much preferred this over his ""Kill Bill"" films, it's still gritty & savage but fun & entertaining at the same time with beautiful music.

"""Inglourious Basterds: A Riveting Tale with a Twist and Stellar Performances","""Inglourious Basterds"" earns a commendable 7/10 rating from me for its gripping storyline, sprinkled with comedic twists, and the outstanding performances of Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz.Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece takes audiences on a rollercoaster ride through World War II, blending history with fiction in his signature style. The film's narrative is both captivating and unpredictable, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish.What truly elevates ""Inglourious Basterds"" are the performances of its lead actors. Brad Pitt shines as the charismatic leader of the Basterds, bringing a perfect balance of bravado and wit to his role. Christoph Waltz, on the other hand, steals the show with his chilling portrayal of the cunning SS officer Hans Landa, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award.While the film may not be without its flaws, its unique blend of action, drama, and dark humor makes for an unforgettable cinematic experience.

wtf?,"This movie was so bad that after years of using IMDb, I finally registered purely to write this comment.Crap doesn't begin to describe it.The most compelling evidence yet as to why Hollywood should be banned from making war movies.French and German are used as if trying to give some vague impression that Tarantino isn't completely full of ""unchecked ego"" - I would think that paying more attention to the plot and actual history would have been wise if I'd wanted to retain some semblance of accuracy - otherwise, sod it - why not have all characters speak English for the US audience (let's face it, no one else will be watching this)? A bit of escapism is all well and good, but this isn't even that, just purile nonsense. I'm not even that bothered by Hollywood's usual bending/rewriting/falsification of history for it's own ends - we all expect that - American hero, European baddies (at best numpties) - but this wasn't just unresearched childish adventure rubbish, but also cinematically juvenile - no subtlety, no nuance, just clumsy - like someone handed a 12 year old a camera and said, ""Make a film about WWII - let you imagination run wild"".What is cinema coming to when people rate this rubbish?",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

"At last, a real return to form","First and foremost, Quentin Tarnatino's greatest love affair has been with the cinema itself and if he finds masterpieces in trash and the exploitation genre that the rest of us are oblivious to, it's hardly a crime. Indeed his passion for lost and forgotten genre pictures has rescued many a career and put the odd new face on the international map. Referencing other movies is, of course, nothing new and almost every auteur has at least one 'homage' in him. However, for Tarantino, 'homage' has virtually become his livelihood. And, of course, like all homages sometimes they work and sometimes they don't.Film-buffs love them and often spend most of the movie picking out the references and this can sometimes spoil the fun; the fun of simply watching the movie and enjoying the plot. There is a great deal to enjoy in ""Inglourious Basterds"". This is Tarantino's homage to the war picture but it's just as much a pastiche of the Spaghetti Western, (the score, from opening bars of 'The Green Leaves of Summer' from Wayne's ""The Alamo"", is mostly made up of bits and pieces from other films and all sounding faintly 'Djangoesque'). Primarily, of course, it's a homage to the cinema itself, both the notion of 'film' and the place where films are shown.The Basterds, (the title is taken from the English title of the little seen Italian movie ""Quel Maledetto Treno Blindato""), are a kind of Dirty Dozen presided over by Brad Pitt's gung-ho 'Apache' descendant, dropped into Nazi occupied France with the sole purpose of killing (and scalping) Nazis, but while Pitt is ostensibly the film's star the Basterds are only one strand of a diffuse plot, (the film is told in chapters), that introduces a number of other characters, all of whom become involved in a plot to kill the entire Nazi High Command, including Der Fuhrer himself. And since this is a fantasy, a cartoon of extreme violence, (thankfully only amounting to a very short period of screen time), it bears no relation to accuracy or history. Tarantino gathers his protagonists in and around a small Parisian cinema run by Melanie Laurents' Jewish survivor of an earlier massacre of the rest of her family, and it's here that the Basterds, on the one hand, and she and her partner, on the other, plan the events that will bring about an early end to the War. And like any movie set in and around a cinema, movie references predominate. It's fun if you get them but it's just as much fun if you don't.Long admired for the 'cleverness' of his dialouge, Tarantino's movie is a very talkative picture indeed. From the opening chapter, which is mostly a dialogue between Col. Landa, the SS 'Jew Hunter' and the French farmer who is sheltering the Jews he is hunting, this is a film that is sustained by long conversations and some really first-class acting. Language itself plays a major part in proceedings and Tarantino has a field-day with his use of English, German, French (and Italian!) and the accents with which they are spoken. Indeed outcomes hang on language and what is said and what is meant. Sure, there is action and some very bloody violence, (not to mention some very dubious morality), but this is far from being a brainless, exploitative action picture. But did anyone expect it to be? I doubt it.In a large cast there are some terrific performances. Pitt hams it up but with a knowing wink at the camera. Newcomer Christoph Waltz is a splendid Landa - it's a star-making performance that has already won him the Best Actor award at Cannes and could well win him a Supporting Actor Oscar next year. Michael Fassbender, (Bobby Sands in ""Hunger""), is perfection itself as a stiff-upper-lip British officer who used to be a film critic while Daniel Bruhl continues his upward climb as one of Europe's finest young actors as Fredrick Zoller, sniper extraordinaire, and whose exploits form the basis of the film that is being premiered for Hitler's benefit, with Bruhl playing 'himself' as Germany's answer to Audie Murphy, and Melanie Laurents is superb as the vengeful Shosanna. Here is another French actress about to make her international breakthrough.It's a brave or a foolhardy or simply a vain director who will end a movie so chock full of film references with the line that 'this may just be my masterpiece'. If it isn't quite, it still marks a major return to form for a film-maker whose place in Pantheon is already assured. It's also the best film I've seen this year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"a spectacular achievement of ""movie"" cinema","Inglourious Basterds won't please everyone. It's not a full-blown crowd-pleaser like other (dumber) blockbusters from this past summer. It's a war film, but in the same way that Pulp Fiction was a crime film. Some will be thrown off by things that people tend to take for granted with Quentin Tarantino films: it's ""talky"", with pages and pages of dialog performed sometimes like a stage play, and the violence, when it happens at a moments notice, is graphic and harsh and not with much hope for the character killed or injured or, in this case, scalped. It might not even be a film some will claim is the greatest film ever of a generation like with PF. But, for me, it is about as pure a piece of cinematic bliss I could ask for this year. And, dare I suggest, it's as audacious and genre re-defining as anything Tarantino's done, or may do again.Tarantino makes up his own rules to break them down and see what makes them tick. Godard was like that, but in this case we don't see a filmmaker lose control of his own rules as Godard ultimately did in his career. Instead its a sprawling epic that throws a few really big damn monkey wrenches into Americans vs. Germans vs. French in world war two. It tells concurrent stories that come together in the BIG climactic chapter (and make no mistake, these are BIG, long chapters unlike Kill Bill) about a Jewish girl, Shoshanna (Mélanie Laurent) who runs away just in time before the Nazis kill her family who are in hiding on a French farm, and years later becomes an owner of a movie theater in Paris and is picked out by a popular 'star' Nazi soldier (Daniel Bruhl) to screen a film starring himself in a recreation of his slaughtering 300 people from a roof-top.The other is, naturally, the Basterds. It's actually with these story lines that Tarantino makes up his first rule to break: why not have a movie called Inglourious Basterds and *not* have them in every frame of the movie? Indeed, by my estimation, the Basterds are in about 55 to 60% of the full running time of the movie. But their scenes are the larger-than-life sort where we see Brad Pitt in an outstanding-cartoonish portrayal of a mass murderer/scalper who, in the real world, is a true-blue war criminal. Him and his men, which include ""the Bear"" (Eli Roth in a surprisingly good turn) and Hugo Stigliz, tear-ass around Europe taking down any Nazis in site (the ""killin' Nazi business"" as Ray says very clearly), and its hear we see an exaggeration of the take-no-prisoners philosophy of men in combat. Prisoners? Too much to bring along. Better to sic the Bear on em.And all the while Tarantino provides us with an absolutely menacing presence with Hans Landa, a German colonel who appears in the opening scenes in a manner akin to Angel Eyes in the Good, the Bad and the Ugly (this is surely intentional, of course), only his evil is the smiling, chilling kind that reminds one of a William S. Buroughs line: the face of evil is the face of total need. Landa needs information, constantly, and asks so questioningly and with such cunning that we feel a sense of uncommon dread when he appears on screen, even when its just to eat a pastry with the (incognito) Shosanna. And leading in this role, almost threatening to tower over all of the other great or at least just revelatory performances, is that of Christoph Waltz. Take your eyes off this guy, I dare you. He's about as hypnotic and alluring and subtle as they come, and can floor you like Samuel L. Jackson reciting a Bible quote.But oh, yeah, this film is ""talky"", make that clear again I should. Some scenes go on with a kind of cruel precision that one finds often in Tarantino's work, where you wonder if it might be going *too* long but, in reality, you'll probably be too caught up in the acting, or the suspense that builds (i.e. the basement-bar scene is a classic example) to such a thick point you'll get goosebumps. But at the same time that Tarantino makes a muchly European movie, with small nods to German and French cinema and a surprisingly mature control of the characters and mis-en-scene, he also makes a gaudy spectacle with his Hitler (at first) coming up like Moe Howard of the Three Stooges in You Natzi Spy, or even just Pitt's voice and mannerisms. It's something special to see a filmmaker embrace conventions and then set them with a box of grenades in another. If you see the climax you'll see what that means even more (and that, perhaps, reaches a pornographic exploitation of Nazi carnage).Inglourious Basterds left me intrigued, startled, laughing, cringing, jaw-agape and eyes-widened, and left me hungry for more. Some will leave disappointed and some will complain. There not without their rights in this case. It's also one of a handful of examples in 2009 cinema of true f***-the-world ""art"" you'll come across. I, for one, can't wait to go into it again, even with that final line screaming (delightfully) of its director's hubris.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Vintage Tarantino: YES!,"Not since his masterpiece, Pulp Fiction, has an audience had the chance to view cinematic originality, or at least the appearance of such.IB is exactly what you would expect from a Tarantino film and more.

Loved it. Loved it. Loved it.Pitt's character is fantastic. The villain is evil as all get out. Everyone is just cool like New England breeze.

'Inglourious Basterds'.......or 'How the USA won WW2 with 10 men',"I've seen this film twice, the second time on TV only last week. It's about a group of US Jewish Soldiers who are in Europe during WW2 who go about killing Nazi soldiers in the most brutal fashion. Somehow they get mixed up in a strange caper to wipe out the entire Hirearchy Nazi regime including Hitler, Goebbels, Goring, Nazi Generals, wives and girlfriends etc, etc, by locking them in a cinema where they are viewing pro-Nazi propaganda films. The violence throughout the film is shocking and vile, but of course WW2 was a shocking and vile war. The outstanding actor in the film is Christoph Waltz who plays the Nazi Col. Hans Landa who in his scenes uses excellent underlying menace without always using violence itself. The scenes with actor Denis Menochet, who is excellent, and another scene with actress Melanie Laurent, who is also truly wonderful, were memorable. However, I must say that even Christoph Waltz's portrayal of a brutal Nazi is not as good as Ralph Fiennes Nazi, Amon Goeth, in 'Schindlers List.' And August Diehl, who plays Major Hellstrom certainly deserves a mention as do most of the rest of the cast...... Oh, and I almost forgot, Brad Pitt is in there somewhere but I'm not at all sure why.....",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Such a pleasure watching Nazis being killed!,"Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt): ""Nazi ain't got no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a Jew hunting, mass murdering maniac, and they need to be destroyed. That's why any and every son of a b---- we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're gonna die"".Such a pleasure watching Nazis being killed! Tarantino uses his art for doing what history couldn't do: to kill the f------- Nazis.Inglourious Basterds is a masterpiece. The film is bloody violent (violence which is so characteristic from Tarantino it ends out being funny), but a bit of justice does not hurt, does it? Let's cheer for every f----- German & Austrian Nazi shot and dead!The beginning of the movie is spectacular. The dialog between Christoph Waltz and the French farmer, brilliantly performed by Denis Ménochet, is awesome. The dialog lasts for 12 minutes (it starts at 6'50"" and ends at 18'50""). Tarantino worked on the script of Inglorious Basterds for 10 years. The music of the film is amazing and includes works by Ennio Morricone and a song by David Bowie.The casting, like in all Tarantino movies, is breathtaking. Waltz surprises us speaking 4 languages, Brad Pitt glows in his role of Aldo, Fassbender appears irresistible in his role as a British spy cinema critic disguised as an SS officer. Mélanie Laurent plays well enough the role of Shosanna, Daniel Brühl appears both nice and macabre, Diane Kruger is the perfect diva (her German is exquisite), and August Diehl appears impeccable in his role of a Gestapo pig. One of my favourite basterd is Hugo Stiglitz, performed by Til Schweiger (a German actor who always refused to wear a Nazi uniform in a movie, but he accepted it in Inglorious Basterds because there he was given the privilege of killing Nazis).Inglourious Basterds is the last Tarantino movie edited by Sally Menke, who was the editor of all Tarantino's movies from Reservoir Dogs (1992) (she died in 2010).Inglourious Basterds got 8 Academy Award Nominations (Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Writing, Original Screenplay, Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Achievement in Cinematography, Best Achievement in Film Editing, Best Achievement in Sound Mixing, and Best Achievement in Sound Editing), and won one Oscar (Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role: Christoph Waltz).Just as Saul fia is the best movie about the Holocaust that I've ever seen (it is terribly real, breathtaking and depressing), Inglourious Basterds is the great antidote to all the sadness, pain and anger that one feels when reading about the Holocaust and watching WWII movies. A pleasure for the eye, the ear, the mind and the heart. Tarantino makes justice to the horrible history of humankind. A cool, funny, brutal and surprising film.Fun facts: Samuel L. Jackson is the narrator, Tarantino appears twice as a cameo (he is the first scalped Nazi and an American soldier in 'Pride of Nation'), and the OSS American commander who talks to Waltz on the phone at the end of the movie is Harvey Keitel. These performances are uncredited.In Germany all the swastikas had to be removed or hidden from all movie posters, since Nazi symbols are banned by law in Germany (except for historical documents).The best: the dialog between Waltz and Méchonet, the names that Brad Pitt gives the German Nazis, Hitler asking for a chewing gum, Fassbender's irresistible smile, the music, the script, Tarantino's style, and the dirty Nazis burning in flames.The worst: the bad French actress at the tavern, some cuts, and some anachronisms.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Tarantino's point of view,"Quentin Tarantino is truly one of a kind. His well-known earmarks are always fun to watch. I think it's phenomenal how he can make films which are so full of personality and quality - brilliant performances, epic quotes, satisfaction. Inglorious Basterds had been waited for some time and I gotta tell you, it absolutely delivered. I thought it might be good, a real shooter. What I didn't think was that it would make a list to my elite films. It was a surprise at times, but when I think now, it isn't. Why? Because it's Tarantino's. You just know you get great stuff.Obviously, it is Christoph Waltz in the role of Col. Hans Landa, to whom all the applauds are going to. His performance is second to none. But I wouldn't underrate Brad Pitt's role as Lt. Aldo Raine. Terrific actor, extremely versatile.Believe me, Quentin Tarantino gives a new look to the WWII. It may like you, it may not. It probably does. In the end, it's your call. I arrant enjoy it. I thought it was a work by a genius. Well done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Best film of 2009,"I hate violence. Over the years, I've avoided Tarantino's other films for purely that reason. Yet I watched this one for an artist's interpretation of history, a personal passion of mine. I was floored. Everything about this film is perfect. I knew of his particular use of music, his snappy dialog, and general film-making style. I was not prepared for how this film would affect me. I'll break it down in the following way:VISUALS- While much of the film involves simply conversations between little groups, it still looks beautiful. The lighting in the first scene is especially stunning. Being a period piece, the colors are somewhat muted, the costumes autumn hues, with bursts of brilliant crimson at the right moments.SCRIPT- I knew prior to viewing this that words were the director's strength. Excuse the pun, but I didn't know how that would translate into other languages. With a film half in English, and the rest in German, French, and Italian, it remains funny, witty, poignant, and crackling throughout. Actors shift seamlessly between dialects, for both humorous effect and key thematic moments. I could write volumes on the script alone. It's that incredible.ACTING- Everyone's brilliant of course. The cast is huge, the nationalities varied and every actor makes scenes their own. Thanks to the brilliant lines, they all get to shine. The two standouts are Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent. While Melanie's Shosanna is restrained and her arch towards vengeance both powerful and quiet, Christoph's Hans Landa seeps onto the screen, attacks and probes at the viewer, and infects them. I laughed with and at him, hated him, was fascinated by and loathed him. He's just that good.MUSIC- A soundtrack makes a film for me, and this did not disappoint. German standards from the 40s mixed with Bowie and vintage Ennio Morricone, perfectly accentuating a line or scene. It's playing in my house or in my ear at least once a week.THEMES- We manipulate, we love, we hate, laugh, misinterpret, destroy. Evil begets further evil, and hatred breeds further hatred. Moments of pure beauty or jubilation are contrasted with sudden and extreme violence, one balancing the other, each necessary for the other's existence. All these are universal truths, and film the universal language. Tarantino addresses all these, and more- is violence the answer, if it is justified; how do you define a hero; and who ultimately writes history. War is merely a backdrop to tell a story, probably told before, of heroes and heroines, villains and tyrants, victory and defeat. In the same vein, film is merely a backdrop to tell a story, hopefully NOT told before. Inglourious Basterds is film making at its grandest, where the players, the words, and the visuals move in perfect harmony. I've seen it a dozen times over, and with each viewing I catch a new snippet of dialog, a sly look, a sneaky sight gag. Could not all history be re-worked in such a magnificent style? But I digress. Where were we?",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Highly predictable but entertaining,"If anyone is a master of making a formula movie, it has to be Tarantino. The formula = An emotionally intense opening sequence/ first act + Nicely build up a scene, and then kill off everyone + Gore + Cartoonish CGI + Lots of tomato ketchup + Excessive use of the N-word . . . Oh, and, + A beautiful lady's feet :DChristoph Waltz is terrifying as a Nazi officer and has done a great job intensifying the opening sequence. The coldness in his eyes! Amazing performance.Brad Pitt plays Brad Pitt. He leads an American team in killing off Nazis.I loved Fassbender's role as well, and he's such a charm. He plays a British movie reviewer and writer who does not really like violence. The tavern sequence is also great and keeps the tension high.The thing is, I am not a fan of Tarantino's formula, especially the mindless killing, making almost all the characters dispensable. And in the end whole film appears to be a survival game - whoever survives will be crowned the protagonist.Since I like war films and Nazi - Allies portrayal, Inglourious Basterds gets a pass.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

"""My honor - loyalty""","Have you ever been feeling mixed emotions such as squeamishness and interest, love and hate while watching the film? If not, you must contemplate a masterpiece by Quentin Tarantino ""Inglourious Basterds"".
The main action happens in Nazi-occupied France, where the American, British and Jewish spies try to kill as many German soldiers and officers as they can and, of course, not to forget to murder a key figure of the II World War - Hitler. The story is far-fetched but I think that filmakers have this opportunity of changing an outcome of War.
""My honor - loyalty"" - a motto of this fast-moving and breathtaking film. Characters want to protect pride of their nations. Despite the terrible scenes, viewers look forward to see a sequel of plot each moment. Many actors were recieved rave reviewes: Brad Pitt, Melanie Laurent, Christoph Waltz,Til Schweiger, Daniel Bruhl and etc. They were given the highest ratings, espessially Christoph Waltz who's got Bafta and Oscar for his supporting role.
There are not so many special effects but despite this in 2009 film grossed 322 mil$ and was added to the list of the best movies.
The portrayal is so plausible and that's why you hate negative heroes and love positive. If you ready to change your attitude to War, you're welcome. I think it's worth watching.

Circumcised Saviours,"Our Tarantino reappraisal continues on, landing this time on 2009 War/Western/Thriller ""Inglourious Basterds"". Seeing it again, this is another entry into to Tarantino's canon that I think is alright, rather than exceptional and another with a lazy ending, that will, for me, mar a few more of his films.In Nazi occupied France, German high command are amassing on a small Parisian cinema, for the Premiere of a film about the exploits of German Sniper Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl). Though Zoller is smitten with the cinema's owner Emmanuelle Mimieux (Melanie Laurent) he is unaware that she is living under a pseudonym, since the execution of her Jewish family at the hands of Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) several years earlier, and the event offers her a chance for revenge. Unbeknownst to all of them, the Basterds, a Jewish American guerrilla company known for slaughtering as many Germans as they can find, is also targeting the affair.I feel like ""Inglourious Basterds"" suffers on repeat viewings. I really dislike the ending and knowing that it's coming colours the whole endeavour for me. There are scenes that I remember liking much more the first time, with their inherent tension, specifically the opening scene - with Landa hunting for the Jewish family and the central bar scene where Diane Krueger and Michael Fassbender star. I feel like the ending ultimately undermines what comes before it, much like the conclusion of ""Once Upon A Time in Hollywood"" does to all the good work in that film.It's not without good performances though, none more so than the Oscar-winning, star-making turn from Christoph Waltz. He is a charming mild-mannered crocodile, with the menace bristling in his eyes the whole film, until one moment of release right at the very end. Brad Pitt chews the scenery (in a good way) as Aldo Raine, leader of the Basterds and Daniel Bruhl has the right level of pride and revulsion to his cinematic exploits.Let's not go overboard, it's not a bad film, there are entertaining sections and some good performances - but shorn of his ability to write the trademark snappy dialogue, I do feel like this is Tarantino's worst.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Great Movie,"A very memorable movie, both funny and a great revenge flick. I'm a big Tarantino fan and was happy to see he's still putting out great stuff. For those that say it was too long, I feel the opposite. Didn't want it to end. The acting was first rate all around. In particular Melanie Laurent's role. The emotions she portrayed as the victim and then the avenger were incredible. Christopher Waltz as the Nazi SS colonel was superb. Best role I ever saw Brad Pitt in hands down. For those of German descent I could see how it could offend, but you need to keep some perspective. Look what kind of stereotypes blacks and native Americans have had to put up with and they didn't even do any of the disgusting things the Nazis did. Some very funny moments all through the film. At the end, at the theater I attended in Provo, Utah, the audience burst out into applause. The movie does have some gory scenes in it, so be forewarned. Oh, Til Schwieger (german soldier that joined the bastards)was incredible. Particularly in the bar scene.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Tarantino's Masterpiece?,"In my opinion this is (so far) what I consider to be Tarantino's masterpiece. Why? It has everything in it that defines what Tarantino's films are all about. A lot of heated dialogue between a mostly male cast with scene's escalating slowly but surely to deliver a spectacular pay off. Most people would not be able to sit through 2 and a half hours of this and there are some very humorous moments throughout the film, whether it be dialogue or at times the almost comical violence. The Tarantino fans will know when to laugh and not feel guilty about it. It also features quite the opposite, dark sadistic violence. However my one gripe is that (as Jonathan Ross pointed out) the soundtrack consists of scores from other films and consequently if you've heard the music before it can become distractive. The acting from each and every one of the cast members is fantastic and each actor fits the role perfectly and Pitt continues to impress as he shows how diverse he really is. I don't need to go into detail about how utterly brilliant the dialogue is. My words could not justify it, however i will say that only about 30-40% of it is in English so to read the subtitles and see the characters could at times be hard to see the brilliant performances. Although it's long length i never once stopped and wondered how far through we were as from the very start you are gripped and compelled to see how the story plays out. It also moves at a very fast pace for a long film as it was supposed to be a mini series so although there are lengthy conversations they make sure they keep the story moving and it doesn't drift into anything meaningless. I do intend to see it again and as I've only seen it once it takes a lot to digest all at once and multiple views may be required to really study this in depth. By the time you've finished the film you'll see why i AND Tarantino will be calling this his masterpiece. Tarantino films are what the cinema is for so be sure to see it on the big screen as all the way through the imagery is superb, particularly the last chapter is some of the best I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Tarantino is back in form...,"Tarantino's films always have a certain anachronistic quality to them: they take place during a particular time period, yet none of the characters seem to portray the qualities or mannerisms of people during that period and, thus, seem strangely out of place. However, this method has proved to be successful in the past due to Tarantino's uncanny ability to completely ignore the conventionality of the real world and, instead, bring life to a new and exciting alternative world where characters speak poetically, improbability becomes the new likelihood, and Mexican standoffs are commonplace. With his latest endeavor, ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Tarantino's distinctive ability shines through once again with perhaps his most ambitious film to date.""Inglourious Basterds"" is a World War II movie like none you've ever seen. Most of the time, you'll completely forget the fact that you're even watching a War movie, as, deep down, this isn't really a War movie at all; rather, what we're given is an eclectic mixture of genres (action, comedy, drama) blended with Tarantino's typical fan-boyish references to the nostalgic films and sub-genres of his past. Both the spaghetti western and the grind house film movements demonstrate their presence throughout the film and help to develop the quirky and eccentric characters we've become accustomed to seeing in Tarantino's previous films. Lt. Aldo Raine, played by Brad Pitt, is one such character. Raine is the all-American southerner who just happens to also be Jewish. This unique dichotomy of traits necessitates a hatred of Germans (and, more specifically, Nazis) and thus motivates Raine to lead an exclusive group of Nazi haters called the ""Inglourious Basterds"" whose sole business is ""killin' Nazis."" Oddly enough, I found that the most captivating scenes didn't include Pitt or any of the other primary members of the ""Basterds"" at all; instead, the majority of the film's memorable sequences feature Col. Hans Landa, played by Christopher Waltz, a ""Jew hunting"" Nazi detective whose ability to methodologically turn seemingly casual discourses into rigorous interrogations is truly remarkable. In essentially every scene Waltz is in, you have a strange feeling that at any moment something bad is going to happen, which manifests a constant feeling of anxiety, creating an almost omnipresent edge-of-your-seat type of experience throughout most of the film.""Inglourious Basterds,"" unfortunately, is not without its faults. While the film starts off and ends with spectacularly well-directed and suspenseful scenes, the slightly overly long running time, featuring a few unnecessary extended scenes (mostly in the second chapter), tends to disrupt the otherwise smooth flow and thus makes the pace seem marginally inconsistent at times. As mentioned before, the film features several astonishing sequences (and some of Tarantino's best), some of the more notable ones include: the opening chapter, the rendezvous bar scene, and the ending Theater scene. However, the weakest points in the film are the scenes interconnecting these aforementioned sequences, which at times feel like they're there for the single purpose of moving the characters from one place to another, or solely for Tarantino to indulge in his signature masturbatory character obsessions.""Basterds"" is not for everyone. It is violent, unrelenting, and its completely inaccurate portrayal and glamorization of events may put off or offend some viewers unfamiliar with Tarantino's style. That being said, most viewers should have a lot of fun watching the film. It is smart, daring, and contains mostly all of the previous elements that Tarantino so admirably captured in his previous films. It features strong performances (including perhaps the best performance in any Tarantino film to date by Christopher Waltz), sharp writing, and unparalleled suspense. Though not perfect, it is one of the better films to come out this year.4/5 Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

With Inglorious Basterds, once again he makes a simple film...that anyone can understand. After he made Resovior Dogs and Pulp Fiction, Tarantino told the world (many, many times) ""I am a story teller"". We know that. Where he fails (in relation to Capolla and perhaps Scorsese and the Coens) is his in-ability to change his style. There is always blood accompanied by incandescent music. We know he does death....very well...anything else ??",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"A wonderfully insane pulp fantasy; Tarantino's best since ""Pulp Fiction""","""Inglourious Basterds"". ""Inglourious Basterds"". How I love this title. I first saw the previews for Tarantino's new film at the beginning of this year, and it seemed to me a non-serious version of Bryan Singer's ""Valkyrie"" (which I haven't seen). Not being exactly a Tarantino fanboy (I love ""Pulp Fiction"" like everybody else and know he will never do anything as good again, but moderately enjoy his other films mostly for their specific qualities than for the overall results, which don't always engage me), I was very excited for this - and not only wasn't disappointed, it exceeded my expectations.First of all, to enjoy ""Inglourious Basterds"", you have to put aside any deeply moral or analytical issues about World War II - and definitely dis consider, just for the moment, Adorno's theories about the banality of evil after Auschwitz. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is by no means a seriously intellectual, let alone humanistic, piece of work; but a brilliant, unapologetically entertaining mix of pulp, fantasy and propaganda. In Nazi-occupied France, a group of Jewish-American soldiers, led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt, whose superstar persona and charm fits the part like a glove), kills and scalps Nazis throughout the Third Reich. Their paths will cross with a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent, who had a supporting role opposite Gaspard Ulliel in the criminally underrated ""Le Dernier Jour"" and shows her full range here), whose family was massacred a few years earlier and now owns a movie theater in Paris. Shosanna has some revenge plans of her own, after Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz, Best Actor at Cannes for this performance) and a young war ""hero"", Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl, of ""Goodbye, Lenin!"") decide that Joseph Goebbels's (Sylvester Groth) new propaganda film, ""Nation's Pride"", which stars Zoller as himself, shall premiere at her venue - with the Führer himself (Martin Wuttke) among the attendees.Highly original, extremely violent (it's Tarantino, after all), and visually intriguing, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is more than just 153 minutes of bloodbath. Filled with all of Tarantino's trademarks (even his notorious foot fetish is back, with Diane Kruger as the victim this time), great soundtrack (more discreet than usual, appropriately with more instrumental pieces than pop songs) and unique dialogue (""Let's burn down the cinema on Nazi night"" and Pitt's deliver of ""Arrivederci"" are two of my faves), this is easily his most satisfying and ambitious work since ""Pulp Fiction"". Favourite scene: a momentarily shy Zoller introduces himself to Shosanna, as she stands on top of a ladder changing the titles on the marquee of her cinema. ""In France, we respect the directors. Even the Germans"", says she. A witty, almost tender moment that epitomizes what Tarantino really is: an overgrown film buff with lots of talent, who sometimes knows how to get the best out of his lovely self-indulgence, and presents us, geeky film buffs ourselves, with wonderful treats like ""Inglourious Basterds"". 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
WW2- Tarantino STYLE,"The first thing I did after watching Inglorious Basterds was laugh out loud!!!Not for the entertainment,but for the intelligence infused in the entertainment.This in fact became the second best movie I watched after PULP FICTION.There was this time when movies ,which had ""world war 2"" as their theme,were hard hitting or really serious as in ""Schindler's List"",""Saving Private Ryan"" or the ""The Pianist"".No doubt these movies were masterpieces to say the least,but none of them had the story of how the rebellious Jews took or could have taken their revenge on the Nazis.Maybe that's why I liked the movie even more.And all these films had a sorrowful tone of those times.But this was the first movie which was a fresh fiction with a sardonic tone of those times.The sardonic tone was implied to the Nazis,not the Jews!This is first movie in which the Jews ill treated the Nazis in the most entertaining way!!Never will you find a sad or a morose scene ,but only a lot of violence in this movie.But then again which of the movies I have listed does not have violence?In fact you can digest this movie compared to the other.The whole movie is set in the Nazi occupied France.The story is how a group of Nazi hating Americans called ""The Basterds"" plot to kill Hitler with the help of a French actress(Diane Kruger).The group is headed by Col.Aldo Raine played by Brad Pitt in a surprisingly brilliant performance.As much as I know he is known more for his looks than acting. But this movie proves that he has both the qualities.The movie is directed by Quentin Tarantino with the usual Tarantino taste of direction-chapter wise adaptation of the story,lengthy but brilliant dialogues,unpredictable but gripping screenplay and sudden violence!.The action in this movie is not over-the-top as in Kill bill series.Frankly speaking,this the most straight forward and a simple movie scripted by Tarantino unlike his previous non linear films -""pulp fiction"" and ""reservoir dogs"".Brad Pitt wonderfully fits in to the role of a ruff N tuff Jewish American with his Accent whose only aim in life is KILLIN Nazis.But the most brilliant performance is by the Austrian German actor Christof Waltz as col.Hans Landa ,chief security officer of Hitler.His acting as a paradoxical character showing a steadfast attitude with a masked cruelty,simply bowls you over(He won the Oscar too!!Thank god my prediction of this award did not go wrong at least this one time.)!The others have done a commendable jobSo to summarize -please watch this movie ,not to learn something new about world war and Hitler as it is a fiction set at that time, but for the unusual take of those times and the perfect blend of hilariousness and violence",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"In a word, fun","I completely understand why some people would hate this film. I had no expectations for this film, except that it was helmed by QT and all that entails. I was pleasantly surprised, enough to order the Blu-ray immediately after watching it.To the naysayers... was it needlessly gory? Of course! Jesus, did you expect something else from QT? Were the characters over the top? Again, would you expect anything else from QT? This isn't Ingmar Bergman we're talking about, it's Quentin Tarantino. If you think Sergio Leone's characters weren't also overdone and almost comical, watch his films again. Tarantino just takes it one step further. Please don't tell me that you expect characters to fall in love and get married after one day as they did in most spaghetti westerns. You accept that nonsense because it's a product of the day and the genre.I loved the language play in this film. Thank god QT didn't pander to stupid audiences who don't like to read movies. The nuances of language are new for Tarantino and a welcomed addition. It definitely added depth to the scenes.The acting was also at least on par with other QT films, if not better. Waltz was amazing, sheer genius. The Nazi characters were given a respect that I didn't expect in this film. They weren't bumbling idiots, nor were they completely evil automatons. They were humanized. To those who fault this treatment, you are doing history a disservice. You don't need to be a monster to do evil things. Humans are capable of such atrocities en masse and we have seen this time and time again.If there is a fault with the acting, it would be the Basterds themselves. There's not enough back story to justify their actions. Their treatment is too comical. Give me more back story if you want me to believe they can completely suspend all human decency. Don't rely on history, because at that point most of the Nazi atrocities were just rumor and speculation. Perhaps the Basterds were comical to lessen the impact of their atrocities. To those who fault Brad Pitt specifically, I think he was exactly who QT wanted him to be. Was Eli Wallach any worse as Tuco? John Wayne's acting was laughably bad and yet people adore Ford's spaghetti westerns.Unlike some, I was held in complete suspense by this film. Why? Because I had no idea what to expect. I didn't know if QT was going to take it completely over the top or not. I kept waiting for some reason why the plot would fail. I should have seen Hitler's demise coming, however. After all, this is QT. Someone else said it best. This film never would have been released if not for Tarantino. That's the reason why it succeeds. It IS a Tarantino film.I also watched District 9 the same weekend I saw this. I found myself saying how stupid all those characters were and how unrealistic were their actions. That's the difference. In District 9, you present me with a situation that is supposed to be real and yet you give me people who act ridiculously out of character for their situation. In Inglourious Basterds, you suspend everything because it is complete fantasy. Everything goes out the window with Tarantino. If you can't suspend that, you won't enjoy this film. If you can, you will be rewarded with a fantastic romp through cinematic silliness.Is this Citizen Kane? Hardly! Was it completely entertaining and outstanding for it's purpose, absolutely! If you are not a QT fan, stay away. You won't like it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Basterds is Irony!,"This movie is special because it is IRONIC. It is the exact opposite of what you would expect a WW2 movie to be about. The usual fare is the persecution of the jews in most WW2 nazi films. IBasterds is different because it takes that premise and then reverses it: What would happen if WW2 had been about the persecution of the Nazis? This movie manages to make the Nazis look evil, but at the same time it turns the Jews and the Americans into the true evil making victims out of the Germans. No mercy is shown to the German army and the movie is about revenge and taking the evil that the Germans personified in WW2 and placing that evil intention into the hands of the allies and the jew.The movie manages to have a fair bit of tongue in cheek humour mixed in with an interesting intellectual plot. This movie succeeds because it manages to do something that no other WW2 movies have managed to do, and it does it rather well! The true star of this movie is the 'jew hunter' Nazi. This guy is very intelligent, and comes across as a nice guy on the outside with a true hidden diabolical intention buried beneath his friendly intellectual exterior. His wholesome milk drinking friendly approach to solving his mysteries makes for a very interesting character! Brad Pitt, while doing an excellent job of acting out his character is not seen very much in the film at all.The movie is controversial beyond belief and is the kind of movie that leaves you thinking about it long after you have watched it. I rate this movie an 8/10. In my opinion a little more action would have done this movie more justice, and a little less screen time to the artsie visuals and what seems to be at times drawn-out conversations would have made this movie a 9.A good movie for sure, and an instant classic",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho, To Kill the Nazis We'll Go. . .","Who would have the audacity to create a film about a group US Army soldiers, composed of Jews, that are commissioned to either capture, kill, scalp and swastika-brand any Nazi they come across in World War II? Quentin Tarantino, that's who! And he had a more than interesting time with the film, under the name, ""Inglorious Basterds"". Slightly sharing the name of a 1978 grindhouse take of ""The Dirty Dozen"" (the second ""a"" is purposely replaced with an ""e""), ""Basterds"" isn't a remake but another mark of art-house action by a mad cine-fanboy. Both are shameless and brave.A character actor in an A-lister's body, Oscar nominee Brad Pitt (""12 Monkeys"", ""Snatch"", ""Burn After Reading"") is half-Indian Southern boy Lt. Aldo Raine (a homage to the World War II hero-cum-actor, who played Lt. Muldoon in the awkwardly pro-Vietnam War film, ""The Green Berets"" with John Wayne), an ambitious sort with a lynching rope burn scar around his neck, who leads the band into Nazi-occupied France, striking fear into the fear-mongers.But there's a second narrative involving Shosanna Dreyfus (a fetching Melanie Laurent), a movie house owner/manager who's the sole survivor of her family's slaughter by the Nazis, conducted by the panther-like Col. Hans ""The Jew Hunter"" Landa (brilliant Christoph Waltz, who won the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival, slightly echoes Richard Harris's role in ""Major Dundee"" and could be a possible Oscar nominee). Under an alias, Dreyfus learns her theater has been chosen to showcase a propaganda film, featuring the Nazi hero, Frederic Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), who has a ""love jones"" for her. Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich cronies are slated to attend, making this a trap for Dreyfus to execute. The Basterds, using the intel of double agent/actress Bridget von Hammersmark (the equally lovely Diane Kruger of the National Treasure films), get into the act, and the effect is a cinematic hellstorm.If you expect ""Saving Private Ryan"" by Tarantino (Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction and the ""Death Proof"" vignette of the underrated ""Grindhouse""), get the **** lost and stay the **** lost. This is pure exploitation fare, bowing at the feet of exploitation classics like ""Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS"", ""SS Hell Camp"" and the original ""Bastards""(its'director Enzo G. Castellini has a cameo here) while using a five-part narrative that alternatives between the vengeful Jewess and the slap-happy ""Nazi-busters"" at 152 minutes. Sure, there's a lot of dialogue, but it's Tarantino dialogue; movie-referential, playful, intricate, campy and subtitled (the French and German languages are spoken).Pitt and Waltz are sly dogs, and the ladies are too exquisite for words. The Basterds are polluted by violent and loyal oddballs. My favorites are baseball-bat swinging Donny ""The Bear Jew"" Donowitz (director Eli Roth of the Hostel films); knife-wielding Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger) and the dutiful Smithson Utivch (B.J. Novak of ""The Office, US version""). Comic Mike Myers is notable suitable as British c.o. Ed Fenech where there's a wish for more from Rod Taylor (""The Birds"" and the original ""Time Machine"") as infamous Britain P.M. Winston Churchill. Tarantino stock actor Samuel L. Jackson has a nice part, narrating on how a certain prop in the film is flammable.The other Tarantino trademarks are here too: brutal violence, nods to older cinema (a movie trivia game is played among German soldiers, Ennio Morricone's spaghetti Western tracks, Dreyfus's escape echoes the ""doorway shots"" from John Ford's ""The Searchers"") and foot-fetishism.""Basterds"" is the only summer 2009 film I've seen (""Watchmen"" spoiled me, being an art-house cake with blockbuster frosting, and I think its' villain, Adrian Veidt, is probably Landa's nephew) and it's damn good one, being a throwback to dirty tough action films.

You put beef in the stew!? You know I'm vegetarian!,"Roughly translated, Inglourious Basterds means an old, shameful unpleasantry, like a vegetarian who is tricked into once again swallowing a piece of beef. Tarantino plays devil's advocate, the person playing the practical joke, who puts the beef in the stew, thinking that if we are conscious of what we intake we will be aware of the tomfoolery. If not then our blindness will lead us to the immorality we strive against, in this case, that meat is murder.He is telling the audience to not be a pushover, to stand up for what you believe in, and to not be scorned by ignorance. The last line, ""This just might be my masterpiece,"" is a mathematically crafted answer, his ""Therefore, QED"" statement that tries to answer sets of matrices. It takes a well trained eye to calculate the numbers as they grow exponentially throughout. This is no test problem, more so a bonus question. It reads, ""Solve the differential equation,"" and the answer demystifies a single stereotype that math teachers can only hope to demolish in students brains, ""That math has no application in the real world.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Tarantino Can't Top Real World War Two with His Fantasy Version,"""Inglourious Basterds"" wants to be World War Two on steroids. It wants to be bigger, stranger, bloodier, meaner, funnier, more stylish than WW II ever was. Here's the problem: World War Two WAS on steroids. It WAS bigger, stranger, bloodier, meaner, funnier, and more stylish than anything a sheltered film geek like Quentin Tarantino could dream up.Tarantino didn't have to invent a group of Jews who fight Nazis; there were such Jews, including the Warsaw Ghetto fighters, who staged the first urban uprising in occupied Europe, The Bielski Partisans, who fought in the forest, and the Treblinka and Sobibor Uprisings in death camps. Nothing Tarantino could invent could be stranger than the life of Oswald Rufeisen, a Jew who survived by posing as an SS man; his memoir, ""In the Lion's Den,"" is far freakier and gasp-inducing than anything in Tarantino's film. No filmmaker will ever make a more over-the-top or diabolically stylish production than Leni Riefenstahl's 1935 documentary of the Nuremburg Nazi Party Congress, ""Triumph of the Will."" Tarantino has a reputation for stylish violence; the violent scenes in ""Inglourious Basterds"" are not as violent nor as innovative in their use of violence as those in ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""The Passion of the Christ."" Tarantino also has a reputation for witty, stylish dialogue. Again, the real World War Two produced plenty of unforgettable lines: ""Peace in our time,"" ""Who remembers the Armenians?"" ""I shall return,"" ""Nuts."" Tarantino's most daring ambition is to provide a more ignominious end for Hitler than Hitler's real demise. Sorry, can't be done. Hitler died a betrayed, solitary loser, knowing full well that everything he had strived for was lost. A far better movie, ""Downfall,"" depicts Hitler's nightmarish real life descent into Hell; Magda and Joseph Goebbels' historically accurate deaths in ""Downfall,"" preceded by their murder of their own children, are as creepy as it gets. Tarantino can't top history.""Inglourious Basterds"" consists, for the most part, of a series of relatively disconnected dialogue scenes; the sensationally violent scenes are few and far between. Dialogue goes on and on and on. Yes, there are some gems, and some tension is created, but the simple fact is that Tarantino needs an editor. I never thought I'd be so bored in a lurid, violent movie about Jews wrecking revenge on Nazis. There are three different scenes of Nazis and resistance members who are hiding something sitting around tables, consuming food and drinks, and hoping that the Nazis don't discover their secrets. The first time Tarantino does this it is very powerful. The third time it just drags, and you think, ""Come on. Don't you have anything else to say?"" Suspension of disbelief and conventional narrative structure work magic on the brain, inviting identification. Tarantino does everything he can to push his viewers away from involvement in this film and to remind viewers that he, Quentin Tarantino, quirky film genius, is the real star.The Basterds of the title are minor characters; the plot hops from place to place, character to character. When top Nazis appear on screen, a hand scrawled note appears on the film, with an arrow and the Nazi's name. Some scenes, like the opening involving a Nazi interrogation of a French peasant, are played as if real, and other scenes are obviously played with lots of winking and nudging at the audience. Musical styles shift throughout the movie. ""This is really a salute to Spaghetti Westerns!"" some of the music shrieks. Experimentation is welcome, but all this ""Hey, don't forget, Quentin Tarantino is behind the camera; I'm famous for quirky films"" winking and nudging broke my involvement with the film and made it a real slog for me. I didn't care about what I was looking at, and I got bored.""Inglourious Basterds""' opening scene is flawless. Nazis arrive at an isolated French farmhouse. A girl is hanging sheets on a line. Given Tarantino's penchant for saluting past films, I immediately thought of Andrzej Wajda's ""Ashes and Diamonds,"" and was ready to see a character bleed to death all over those clean sheets. Not so. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), a Nazi ""Jew Hunter,"" is there to interrogate the farmer (Denis Menochet). Menochet is brilliant in this scene, a study in stoic, peasant masculinity. Waltz waltzes into movie history. His fastidious, precious, melodramatic performance as a perfectly evil Nazi enters cinematic history. His life will never be the same.The rapturous embrace of ""Inglourious Basterds"" by critics and film fans is kind of depressing. It's sad to think that there are young people who will think that this is what World War Two either was like or should have been like, and it's sad to think that they are so divorced from history that they don't get how wrong both assumptions are. Years from now scholars will study kids who think that no Jews fought back till Tarantino invented them.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Must Watch!,"Just went to watch this with a friend of a non-English speaking background. Spent most of the time translating everything - including the subtitles, but to my surprise she managed to pick up most of the important parts without much explanation.This is one of those films that'll get lots of criticism - and is therefore successful. This movie has REALLY REALLY random things going on. Fully unpredictable (at least up to 0.5 seconds prior to each significant event).Note the amount of detail he puts into each shot. Its pretty crazy >< but its so clean cut.Good for laughs, great for discussion and will probably be one of those HSC texts in the future. When we look back at how random people are, lol...P.S. The opposite of this film would be something like Cloverfield (cough)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Long, Gory, and Not Quite Glourious","Taking its basic inspiration from a subpar '70s actioner (same title, but spelled correctly) by Enzo Castellari, Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" is the story of a group of Jewish-American soldiers scalping Nazis at the end of World War II...or maybe it's about the plot to kill the officers of the Nazi high command at the world premiere of a propaganda flick at a small French art theatre...or maybe it's about sitting around in a pub, trying to guess what cultural icon is written on that card pasted to your forehead.To say ""Basterds"" takes the 'scenic route' to its inevitable conclusion would be a vast understatement. There is almost too much nuance, subtlety, and craftsmanship to absorb in one sitting, but in its own novel-like way (like the ""Kill Bill"" films, this is also divided into chapters), it all comes together, somehow.An avid disciple of trash cinema with an undeniable knack for recycling said trash into creations of originality and cinematic slickness, Tarantino's love--first and foremost--is his characters...and their ability to jaw away on subjects ranging from crucial to superficial. Critics hailed this approach most notably in ""Pulp Fiction,"" Tarantino's 1994 breakthrough. But by the time ""Death Proof"" rolled into theaters as part of the ""Grindhouse"" double bill in 2007, many seemed burned out by what had, at that point, become formulaic (scenes of winding conversation juxtaposed against moments of shocking violence). Those disappointed by ""Death Proof"" are not likely to be won over by the ambitious–yet garrulous–""Basterds.""Neither will those who have viewed the ""Basterds"" trailer (a shrewdly assembled string of highlights from the film's scattered--yet potent --action scenes) expecting a slam-bang fiesta of Nazi scalpings and bodies riddled with machine-gun fire. As exciting as it would be to see Tarantino truly cut loose with a scuzzy, exploitative homage to his forefathers, I think that duty will be forever be supplanted by frequent collaborator Robert Rodriguez (""Planet Terror""; ""Sin City""). Still, Tarantino has pulled off quite a feat with ""Basterds"": he has made an art film that will play on nearly every screen in America, has the misspelled taboo of its title to draw in the curious, and makes sure most of the film's dialog is spoken in an array of languages (French, German, broken Italian)–that's right, this is a film that, for the most part, is READ. The opening-day crowd I saw this with expressed audible displeasure at the near-constant barrage of subtitled dialog. ""C'mon, when do we get to see more scalpings?"" it seemed to cantankerously demand.As a period piece, ""Basterds"" is aesthetically interesting in that it straddles the line between the tropes associated with low-budget independent film-making and infuses them with a distinctly mainstream slickness (by comparison, this fictionalized take on the fall of the Third Reich and the end of WWII boasts a better plot and more excitement than last year's fact-based ""Valkyrie""). The result is an oft-confounding collection of seemingly disparate events and characters (including frequent flashbacks that, puzzlingly, lack any sort of context), but I can't deny the sheer genius of certain passages, and the way the climax doesn't shy away from upending the proceedings in an unabashed orgy of blood and madness.Above all else, the film is a showcase for Tarantino's distinctly well (some would say over)-drawn characters. Frequently, he will bring the story to an unexpected halt to give a newly-introduced face a monologue that shades in every nook and nuance, often before said character is unceremoniously blown away minutes later. While the result is an arrhythmic pace in a film that could have easily benefited from some dialog clipping, it also portends a depth that goes largely unseen in our attention-deficit era of film-making. And while Brad Pitt earns top billing as Lt. Aldo ""The Apache"" Raine (and is perfectly serviceable in the role), the film contains standout performances from Melanie Laurent (as the Jewish survivor of a Nazi raid, who runs the aforementioned French art theatre and conveys a detached, ice-cold beauty) and especially Christoph Waltz as Third Reich Colonel Hans Landa, whose ingratiating smile and laugh portends a darkness that's nothing short of horrifying (don't be surprised if he snags a Best Supporting Actor nod at next year's Oscars).",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Tarantino's World War II movie - I don't get it.,"The opening to the film is exquisitely shot. It carries a fantastic level of suspense and emotion that made me think that we were in the realms of greatness. I was misled. If anything, the opening to the film is the film's peak and everything subsequently meanders down hill. The story of the film, as put out in the media is of a rag tag bunch of men led by Brad Pitt on a marauding crusade into enemy territory with the sole purpose of killing as many Nazis as gruesomely as possible. And the film is, in part, about that. But there is a much more interesting story of revenge that begins in that very first sequence that I didn't feel was adequately explored, as it somehow became second fiddle to the Basterds of the title. I guess Tarantino has his pick of people to work with and that, it seems, may be his downfall. There is no doubting that in Christoph Waltz, he has unearthed a gem, but that is far outweighed by the bizarre turn of Brad Pitt and needless cameos. For some reason Brad Pitt plays his character with a conscious under bite, by which I mean it only seems to appear when he thinks about it needing to be there. Where Pitt's good friend George Clooney can excel in the screwball characterisation as a wannabe Clark Gable, Pitt flows and crashes and burns badly. Mike Myers appears in a pointless cameo and the use of Eli Roth seems questionable at best. All of this lends the film a boy's club smugness in the same way that the Ocean films seem more like a gas for the stars than the audience. So, it comes across as a big laugh-in for the actors, all, except the European trio of Waltz, Bruhl and Laurent, mugging to camera in what seems like an effort to get laughs. The dark humour and snappy dialogue of Tarantino's early movies has gone. To be replaced by laboured dialogue in the style of Tarantino – something we saw enough of in the 90s with the numerous Tarantino-esquire efforts. It felt much like a film student in the late 90's, wishing to be the next Tarantino, has gone a bit too far for his student film in trying to include snappy dialogue unrelated to the screen imageryexcept this is Tarantino and it no student movie. The film also produces too many nods to Tarantino nerds (if they even exist) with the shootout where you're not sure how everyone got shot to the use of Harvey Keitel and Samuel L Jackson as voice cameos and the endless ""all the characters looking down to the camera"" shots that would have once made it new and exciting. It now seems a little tired and is definitely too self-congratulatory. At times the film is beautiful to watch. The cinematography is immense and one thing Tarantino does still manage to do to a high standard is choose his music well. The film covers a range of music that is often used in other film first, but does not look out of place here. The audience, however, seemed to be tuned into the humour and the style much more than me. There were laughs and guffaws as Pitt stuck out his chin and I had the general feeling that everyone was really enjoying the show. So, perhaps it was me. Perhaps I was not in the mood for it or perhaps I just didn't get it. But from the opening sequence that, to me, showed so much promise and, more importantly, showed what Tarantino is capable of, the rest became a damp squib (many of which were used throughout, as you can imagine).",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

"""I Think This Might Just Be Your Masterpiece""","Tarantino does it again helming a virtuous war / retribution film. There are so many unforgettable scenes. Hans Landa's interragation of the French farmer, Perrier La Padite is unparalleled. Lt. Aldo Raine's recruitment speach to the basterds is hilarious and brutal. Shosanna's vengeance film premiere is poetic. Lt. Archie Hicox's confrontation with the Nazis in a bar is intense. Its impossible to pick a favorite. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, score and acting. All the actors involved deliver realistic and superlative performances. In particular Waltz, Laurent, Fassbender and Pitt are commanding. The plot revolves around Lt. Aldo Raines whose mission is to seek retribution against the Nazis by putting together a squad of eight Jewish soldiers known as the ""Basterds"". The Basterds join forces with an undercover agent to take down the Third Reich. Their plan is set to take place in a theatre owned by Shosanna who is seeking to avenge the Nazi's slaughtering of her family. The plot is clever, funny, vengeful, gritty, intense, violent, poetic, unforgettable and has one of the most cathartic endings on film. The last dialogue in the film is delivered by Sgt. Donny Donowitz when he says to Lt. Raines, ""I think this might just be your masterpiece"". This viewer believes Tarantino was being symbolic and referring to the film as his masterpiece to date. The film is certainly a memorable and sublime work of art.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

The worst Tanantino movie I saw so far but still not uninteresting,"I loved all Tarantino movies I saw so far. This one - I loved less. Why? Because the setting is too artificial (history re-shaped) and because dialogs/plot are not as fascinating as in his previous films.Nevertheless, Tarantino is Tarantino, and the movie did have enough suspense to keep me watching until 1:30am.I wish WW2 would have ended this way, a few years before it did: this would have saved the lives of many and, specifically, the lives of many of my people. (Well, I wish it could have been avoided in the first place.)As in Tarantino's other movies, casting is good: Brad Pitt is convincing and funny as Aldo, Mélanie Laurent is excellent as Shosanna Dreyfus and Diane Kruger makes a convincing Bridget Von Hammersmark.Am looking forward to Tarantino's forthcoming movies, hoping they will be better than this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
One of Tarantinos best!,"I have always been a fan of Tarantino, and so far the only movies of his i have not had the pleasure to have seen are death proof and Jackie Brown. With pulp fiction being one of my favourite movies, and having just seen the hateful eight in the cinema, i asked myself the question of why I had never seen this movie? I was gazing over netflix and saw ""Inglorious Basterds"" just waiting to be watched. With a lot of time on my hands, I sat down to watch the lengthy film. And with no regrets, i can easily say this is tarantinos second best behind pulp fiction! From the over the top violence, to the classic Tarantino dialogue, I was gob-smacked by how much of a true masterpiece this movie really is!If you haven't seen this movie, and have a couple of hours to spare, i suggest watching this movie.

Pitt's southern accent is actually pretty good (I'm a southerner, and very critical of fake southern accents), and Waltz's multilingual abilities were very impressive. Seeing their characters finally face one another towards the end was fulfilling and perfect.

Fun but flawed,"Inglorious Basterds is a flawed but fun film. Christopher Waltz was an absolute blast! What an exceptional performance! Every time he spoke, it just felt harrowing, even his obnoxious laugh just made you feel so uncomfortable. This was more his show that any of the other casts for sure.Overall, IB was very much Kill Bill-esquire, playing on the spaghetti western and used chapters to go through each proportion of the movie. The opening sequence was strong on dialogue but it was enough to keep me on the edge of my seat and that was down to Waltz, but also credit to the house owner, whose presence made the scene even more effective because of his size.Whilst the film was entertaining, I felt there were some major flaws here. If this movie came out last year with Slumdog Millionaire, it wouldn't get a sniff at the Oscars, because these films usually don't.One of the biggest flaws is Brad Pitt. He was atrocious. He tried way too hard with his fake accent and just made it feel like every word that came out of his mouth was forced. I'm not American let alone a redneck, but I know his accent didn't sound natural. His acting was like watching a shy school kid who was made to stand in the middle of a class to do a role play using a French accent. It just didn't work. Tom hanks would've done a better job looking back on his previous films Forest Gump and the Green Mile. But why didn't Tarantino think of Clint Eastwood and take him out of retirement? He may be 70+, but he would've been fantastic. I'm sure working for Eastwood would be Tarantino's ultimate dream! The Basterds in my view took a back seat, with the Jewish girl's revenge plot being of much greater significance. The Basterds seemed incompetent and their whole team besides Pitt and one of the others were destroyed. And if this was a major event just for the Nazi's and Germans, why were guests supposedly from Italy easily let in, especially with dynamites strapped around their legs? Wouldn't anyone have body checked them? And with the Basterds being so renowned, surely the Nazi's would have had intel on their looks. And are the Nazi's really stupid enough to not have guards around the auditorium? How easy was it for Marcel to lock up the doors and the Basterds kill those guarding the Fuhrer? Waltz character was so domineering throughout but his credibility was ruined by his stupidity of trusting the Basterds in giving him what he wanted, which was a war hero warrant and a life in paradise. It didn't make sense for someone who just went and mercilessly strangled Diane Kruger's character to become a guy who thought he could negotiate a deal for him to go scot-free.The film itself doesn't really deserve an Oscar, but it hasn't been a very fruitful year for movies besides Avatar. Waltz however definitely deserves a best actor award and I sure hope we will see more of him in films to come. Overall, Inglorious Basterds was entertaining, but everything that happened seemed too convenient.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
The nails in the coffin of Brad Pitt's acting career...not funny,"Evidently it is now politically correct to make a movie about the slaughter of wartime Germans because they are/were Nazis! Of course the director is Quentin Tarrentino, who reinvented the old blood and guts movies by making them more graphic, and in the process has gotten many fans who can't get enough of the genre. And the other draw for the movie was Brad Pitt, whose career has been reduced to making movies like this and Ocean's 11-25 sequels. Anyway this movie is supposed to be a comedy as well, but I thought it was basically disgusting and only about as funny as laughing at scenes from Schindler's List. People laugh at this stuff? Slaughter some Nazis in increasingly more horrible ways as they try to make it seem comical-that's the movie in a nutshell. Brad Pitt and everyone else associated with this piece of garbage should be ashamed.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Forget it's Tarantino, forget it's Pitt, just watch and learn","I can only imagine like me, there are a load of people who both can't wait for, and dread the release of a new Tarantino movie in equal measure. This is because despite being one of the most followed and admired film makers out there (Not to say copied) he has that sort of vulnerability about him that I feel like I want to protect, because despite creating a legendary flick in Pulp Fiction, it seems like some people revel in seeing the mighty fall.Granted it will be a mean feat to emulate the dizzy heights of PF, I doubt it'll happen, so what you've got to try and do is take each movie on its own merit and enjoy it for what it is. Now if you can forget who made it and watch it as a piece of war-fiction and it's actually really good. Second thing to put aside is the thought that this is a Brad Pitt film. It's not. Crafty advertising will draw QT & BP fans in by the bucket load but really this is like having an elaborate, wordy novel acted out to you on screen. Saying that, get your reading glasses on because most of it is subtitled and apart from the quality of the way it's made, the real stars are the relative unknowns Mélanie Laurent & Christoph Waltz – the latter in particular, is amazing.So many films these days are churned out in a way so that they appeal to the masses, which I spose is fair game, most people do in fact fall in the category of 'the masses' so we enjoy them, but this makes the movies feel like business rather than art which you got to question which is more important. I suppose making money, and it is the 'movie business' after all, but occasionally you get a film which was clearly made to be a film that the maker wanted to see and this is one of them. So I guess what I'm getting at is not everyone is going to like this, but there will be some that love it.So again you've got a chapter styled story here and again, it's told in a way where it has a few bunches of stories going on independent of each other which ultimately culminate and mash together in the climax. Tarantinos' style I guess, but done so well that every little chapter feels like an epic in itself and I recon you could quite easily just watch one of them on their own without finishing the film, like catching an episode of your fave show - they're that good. The dialogue is snappy, but not too hip (It is the 40's after all) and to get this sort of snap from four different languages takes something special. It's fair to say that every angle of war has probably been shown on film so why not twist it up a bit? And that's what happens – don't go in expecting a accurate history lesson because it's not that, so what? I can't see why people are getting annoyed with that? So what if it doesn't tell history as it was – even films like Braveheart had people up in arms because William Wallace didn't sport long hair and blue face paint, so just go with it.So there was a bunch of Nazi hunters that did exist and what they did was horrific and this follows them for the short part, the other parts of the film though are the gems, the movie within the movie is a cool touch, directed by Eli Roth who isn't half bad actually. The standoffs, both verbal and physical are brill and the ending, although no spectacular twist, is really satisfying and gutting in equal measure. I literally cannot wait for the interviews and ramblings on the disc, it will no doubt be a treat!OK so he doesn't follow the rules, and he sure as hell doesn't in this film, but you've got to give it to him he has had a stab at most things right? Gangster, Kung Fu, Hammer Horror, and now War, I mean what's next I wonder? A Rom-Com? Now that would be interesting...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Not as bad as expected,"This was a really well made film, but the story was just pure nonsense and probably disrespectful to some soldiers who died for their country during WW II. I am not happy to see brutal treatment of defenceless soldiers passed off as entertainment.A band of trained Jewish American killers go on the rampage near the end of the war, brutally torturing prisoners of war. Some of the scenes were disgusting. Their objective is to take out Hitler and his acolytes, and so end the war.It is a long film beautifully shot in northern France. Some of the performances are superb, and to be fair not all the Nazis are cardboard cutout baddies. Daniel Bruhl plays a German war hero who has romantic desires on a Jewish woman played by Melanie Laurent, who is also being hunted down by an SS officer played by Christopher Waltz. This drama brought little bit of sanity amidst the mindless violence, and those three actors were outstanding in this film.Just as I was enjoying the film, the ending descended into B movie madness. On the whole it was an enjoyable film, but obviously (as is always the case with Tarantino) there is far too much graphic violence. I did expect a much worse film after seeing some reviews, but I think Tarantino managed to pull off a quite a controversial film in the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
I think it might be his best work yet!,"Loved it! Very very juvenile. Hideously violent. Tighter than a drum, and a barrel of laughs.

Right down to Christoph Walz as the nastiest Captain Hook ever and the ticking alarm clock. Clever!! But then I realised I how stupid I was being, what the hell! Still, fun for all the family, as long as your family are Nazi-haters. Maybe better to leave the more impressionable kids at home, though. Wouldn't want them trying to copy the actions of the Apache and his homicidal crew .Smart, not too intrusive echoes of his previous work and lots of irony there if your looking for it, Operation Kino is drenched in it, and not the sad kind, but the laugh out loud kind. Is this Tarantino filling in the application form for the job of Obama's Propaganda Minister. I certainly hope so.I'd give it 10 but for the soundtrack.

In one word: amazing,"This movie was totally amazing. Everyone should watch this, except for the people who can't handle blood. It's another masterpiece from Quintin Tarantino who really knows how to make movies. It is cruel and hilarious at the same time. If you want a real happened story about World War II then don't go to this movie. It is all fiction. Tarantino has repeatedly stressed that ""Basterds"" is a, ""Spaghetti Western but with World War II iconography."" The influence on Tarantino's vision by Western director Sam Peckinpah can be felt in the film's agonizing tension, punctuated by sudden violence. Tarantino has embraced Peckinpah's cinematic revisionism.

As for Christoph Waltz as Nazi Col. Hans Landa -- he is incredible. If Lanz doesn't win a Oscar, the Academy won't ever have been more unfair... That man can express more with his eyes than most actors can with a ten minute soliloquy.Anyhow, dark but perfect humor, intellect, brutal but necessary action and gorgeous cinematography.

A tad underwhelming!,"Technically brilliant, like every other Tarantino feature, but it falls short when it comes to the narrative and its ultimate implications.

Another incredibly entertaining film from Tarantino,"I don't even know where to begin. Quentin's style oozes from every scene in this film. Once again he breaks all the rules of what is expected of a major Hollywood film and does so with style. His quirky, odd sense of the way things should be keeps this film fresh for the entire 2 1/2 hours it plays. Perfect choice of actors, scenery, violence, humor and action. He uses several languages in this film, but the subtitles never seem to get in the way of important action scenes. His sets are incredibly believable, even stunning at times. I don't want to sound as though I'm in love with the man, but I find his movies to be refreshingly different.

Downhill since PF,"Seeing this film with an 8.5 rating beggars belief. Tarantino's finest moment was undoubtedly Pulp Fiction. Clever story, interesting characters, roller coaster ride and a well thought out, interwoven plot. This film is quite the opposite. Almost lazy. Weak and insulting script, AWFUL acting from Brad Pitt (embarrassingly bad given how much he's manage to shine in other, more challenging roles (i.e. Snatch), and predictable throughout. So, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and downhill ever since. Where's the spark gone? Or perhaps QT's just lost it for good. Pity.It seems many people these days are just happy to hail any old tripe he roles out as 'original and daring', when in reality it's quite the opposite - shallow and intellectually insulting. There were a couple of moments when the dialogue started to show some of the old sparkle, but generally (apart from the main German officer) performances were weak or, worse, comical. Each film he brings out I hope for a return to form, but what once was concentrate now just seems to be over-diluted tripe.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
A welcome return to form after 15 years,"I still remember the rush I got when seeing Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction for the first time. I ended up seeing both multiple times and took something new away from each viewing. The media hype around Tarantino, which I believed at the time, was that he could do no wrong. It really seemed in '94 that he was not only the greatest director in the world, but would change cinema forever. Unfortunately his produce since Pulp Fiction was neither prolific nor impressive. The primary weakness with Tarantino's three works post Pulp Fiction and pre Inglourious Basterds was his constantly parroting or paying tribute to other works he had admired instead of going out and doing his own thing, creating something original. An excess of verbosity slowed the pace as well. Viewing the trailer and reading initial reviews of Inglourious Basterds led me to believe it suffered the same shortcomings. To be honest, the trailer for Inglourious does not sell the film I saw. And Tarantino's frequent arrogance and more recent track record have opened him up to a lot of criticism - much of it unjustified in the case of this film.Anyone who has read any review of Inglourious would know that the villain is a sinister Col. Hans Landa and that the opening sequence is one for the ages. He is a unique movie villain like Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men or Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs. He doesn't speak, he interrogates and interviews in a eerily calm manner. It requires nerves of steel to maintain your composure with him around! His audacity in the last 20 minutes is breathtaking. The opening sequence was worthy of Sergio Leone, whose Once Upon a Time in the West and Lee Van Cleef in The Good The Bad and The Ugly no doubt influenced Tarantino's handling of the entire sequence.I actually liked the criticized bar sequence even more than the opening. Long yes, but it slowly builds up to a brilliantly directed climax. The twists and turns, the playful banter which turns into something deadly are among the memorable sequences of cinema history. Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus has given a performance that is almost on par with Christopher Waltz's Col. Landa. If his performance is Oscar worthy (not that that should be the yardstick!), his interview of her and her reaction when he exits is also equally worthy. I should mention here that the name star of the film, Brad Pitt, is really only one part of a great ensemble cast. His performance is superb and not the caricature that the trailer implies. A sequence where his hick officer is forced to act 'Spanish' is just brilliant comedy. He has the accent of a southerner down pat. I only wish he'd been given more time. I hope the director's cut adds something to his role.In closing, I'll add that Tarantino's knowledge of cinema was never in doubt. His camera-work and understanding of the mechanics of film-making were always good, but he has exceeded himself in this film. There is something classical about the photography (beautiful long takes) and cinematography, which almost no director can emulate. As a former fan and later critic of Tarantino, I'm blown away by Inglourious and despite his cheek, I do think he may just have made his masterpiece!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Favorite Movie Which I Saw in the Theater the First Time,"I remember that this was my second Tarantino film. A few days before, I watched Reservoir Dogs with my brother, introducing me to Tarantino movies, and I was ecstatic that my Dad agreed to take me to Inglourious Basterds since the trailers made it look like a good revenge film. I was surprised that the film went beyond this notion and was simply fantastic overall, leaving me smiling as I left the theater.Let me just say, the early trailers for this film are deceiving. They make it appear that the premise is simply Brad Pitt and his men killing Nazis in a brutal manner throughout. This is definitely not the case, and actually touches on subjects I never would have imagined. Tarantino shows his knowledge for German cinema throughout as the main character of the B plot - Shoshanna - comes to own a cinema, and the Nazis are dealing with where they should hold the premiere for the new film by Joseph Goebbels - Nation's Pride.The villain, played by Christoph Waltz, is such an amazing character to watch. At certain points, he exhibits intellect and detective skills near Sherlock Holmes levels, and at other times he makes us laugh with how out of touch he is with certain customs. The first twenty minutes of the film is almost fully dedicated to this Hans Landa, and it proves to be among the best sequences Tarantino has ever written.I fully believe this film had a better screenplay than Django Unchained, but to me, it makes sense that the academy went with The Hurt Locker for best original screenplay. It makes sense not because The Hurt Locker fully deserved it, but because The Hurt Locker was a film that this country needed in 2009 to shape our perspective on the war being fought over seas.While Inglourious Basterds is not an accurate depiction of World War II or one of the most important World War II films, it is certainly one of the most fun to watch. It is tense, funny, crowd-pleasing, and at the same time it is a very smart movie with well-developed characters, an intricate plot, meta characteristics, and above all, extremely well-written. This now holds the spot of my 2nd favorite film by Quentin Tarantino, behind Pulp Fiction.4.0/4.0",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Tarantino has lost it...,"Tarantino did a few things right: Pulp Fiction, Four Rooms, Natural Born Killers, From Dusk till Dawn. He did it in between '94 and '96. Compared to those films, all his others suck, although, if you compare them with other films, they may be OK or even great. This movie is neither. It's all like a long (very long) bad joke.What's it about? There is this group of American Jews that fight a guerrilla type warfare behind German enemy lines. It's what today would be called terrorism. Is this film about them? No. Are you confused yet? There is this Austrian actor, Christoph Waltz, who plays the role of a German psychopathic officer, speaking English, French and Italian to perfection. He does it well, got an Oscar for it, although I suspect more for the fact that he can speak 5 languages, which is rather astounding to Americans. Is the film about him? Not really. There is an actor playing Hitler. About him? No! Brad Pitt? No.As any Tarantined story there is a lot of talk. Only in this film, it amounts to nothing. The characters are completely impossible to identify yourself with. Actually, the one taking the top for this would be the psychopathic German, so that says a lot about the others. The script makes no sense, mostly, and the little it does, it is completely boring. As for any message the movie would have, I call them racist, any of them, as every nationality is stereotyped to the absurd.Bottom line: one thing the movie got right.

The sheer idea that a group of criminals can appear in France and kill Hitler so easily with brute force is simply ridiculous.I know tarrentino is known for his films in terms of their violence and gore, and the kill bill series was good, this simply was not.

Tarantino's Top Three,"If you love Quentin Tarantino's style, Inglorious Basterds is going to be an absolute treat for you. It's widely considered by many, even Tarantino himself, to be his ""masterpiece"" or his best since Pulp Fiction, and it is absolutely, undoubtedly worthy of such praise.The dialogue here is arguably sharper than it has ever been - even Pulp Fiction has a couple minutes worth of conversation within it that aren't particularly entertaining, as only one scene in this film failed to completely hold my interest, and that is quite possibly the shortest scene in here! Every other moment of IB manages to completely hook you and draw you into the world, whether it's the vibrant Brad Pitt making you laugh, or the scene stealer Christoff Waltz making you anxious, with Tarantino crafting some of his most memorable characters and using dialogue in this film to fuel the suspense, making conversations that go on for 20 or 30 minutes worth of screen time a never-ending spiral of anxiety that reaches a satisfying peak each time.The performances and writing are even more worthy of applause considering a great deal of the movie is spoken in another language, an element of war that other directors choose to ignore, but which Tarantino uses as a tool for suspenseful storytelling and sequences, fixing an issue which we didn't really know we had as an audience. As Tarantino so eloquently put it, other films ""have this opportunity for a great scene, but you're pissing it away by having German be English"".It also offers a great deal of memorable Tarantino moments, including a tense 20 minute opening, a baseball bat, quite possibly the longest bar scene known to man, and an ending that doesn't limit itself with what really happened throughout history.As a result, while Pulp Fiction may be a more iconic and witty flick, IB is the Tarantino film I think about most, from the characters, to the conversations, to the ending, to the direction, if you weren't already obsessed with Tarantino, Inglorious Basterds has a good shot at changing that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

"Amusing, but hardly a masterpiece","The hyperbole being bandied about regarding this film is certainly Tarantino-esqe. It is an amusing film, well crafted and fun to watch, but there is nothing incredibly artistic about it. It has little of the writing brilliance that Pulp Fiction has and doesn't convey brutality the way Reservoir Dogs does.It has a little bit of everything, though, and is certainly a fine film. The dialog is snappy, the comic timing is decent, and Christoph Waltz does a good job of being over the top without being over the top about it. The acting, in general, is top shelf. Production, in general, is solid. It is a good movie.But it is NOT remotely as good as many here would have it. There is little sense that the movie was written to convey anything much beyond a comical telling of a slightly Stooges-esqe, though rather bloodthirsty, war tale.

"Not a fan of Tarantino, but I can't argue with this!","I'm going to be honest, I haven't been a fan of Quentin Tarantino's work. Most of the time, it's just too much. Django Unchained (2012)? This movie played it nearly perfect though.Tarantino's writing captures logic, thought, and, most of all, suspense in a way that few have. It's an excellent piece of satire with some of the most expertly written scenes I have ever seen. The opening scene might be my favorite opening scene of all time. The story was great, as was the plotting.The performances are all around great. No surprise that Christopher Waltz sticks out the most in the cast. He definitely deserved his Oscar for his work done here. He plays Colnel Hans perfectly.Tarantino's direction seems more confident here. And it reflects his own writing perfectly. Props to you, Quentin!The production design is actually quite well done, surprised nobody pointed that out. It's something that seems glossed over but, for some reason, really stuck out to me.Disclaimer: Don't watch this with your kids. Very gory and mature at several points.Overall, it's a 9/10. Very well done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Tarantino is a film genius,"I really enjoyed this movie, it's violent and gory, but also emotional and suspenseful at times. I absolutely loved ""The Jew Hunter"" and the basterds themselves. I loved Shoshanna and her storyline. The film ends quickly and amazingly, with some good surprises. And the opening scene is some of the best dialogue I've ever heard, it is stunning, how it keeps reeling me into the world deeper and deeper. Michael Fasbenders performance, though short was good and the score matched the film perfectly. Overall a funny at times, a serious at times and an all around great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

"A collection of good sketches, but an uncomplete film","I think that this film could have been really great if it was simply made as a collection of unrelated sketches, because some of the situations and dialogue are just amazingly awkward and yet extremely fun.The thing is, that this is not enough for a feature film, because this piece is missing a story or believable relationships between the characters. Even the most absurd films need to have some sort of connection with the viewer other than some great lines and situations, and I think that Tarantino has realised that he can go by just throwing out wise-ass characters who never want to make any sense or difference, in the end resorting to a bloodbath as the only way to truly sort things out.This film has some of the tensest scenes I have ever seen and some of the most hilarious, especially with Christoph Waltz, who deserves an Oscar for his role. Tarantino though should really think his next film through, as he is almost becoming predictable and sometimes rather boring, which was not always the case. With his older work like Pulp fiction he was on a good path to truly balancing out his randomness with some sense, but after that he just quit and has gotten worse ever since.I find this truly disappointing, because if he would try to remember the background of his work and why his stories and characters turn out the way they do and incorporate that into his new work, he would be a timeless filmmaker and not just your local wise-joker turned director.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Rating: 9.6
Overall, a true masterclass in building suspense as we see Tarantino take control and mature as a filmmaker through his brilliant direction and incredible writing, with this this been taken control of on-screen through Christoph Waltz's brilliant performance as the menacing Hans Landa.Brilliant Direction (The best use of subtly to build tension I have ever seen in a movie as he does so much to build suspense throughout the movie with so little; the macro-scenes are incredibly executed and the micro-scenes are done very well as the acting feels so natural between the cast (especially in the opening scene and the bar scene); moves the story incredibly well as he uses the chapter format to begin story arcs and build each piece on each other up until the climax), Great Acting (Good to Very Good from Brad Pitt (A very over-the-top performance that helps bring a comedic element to the movie), Brilliant from Christoph Waltz (He can switch between motions so fast and effortlessly as he can switch between humor and hour in a snap; he also commands all the scenes he is in with his menacing figure, and he uses different languages to help be very persuasive in the scenes he is in), Very Good from Michael Fassbender (Holds his own very well in his scenes and does a good job in working with his cast to progress the story forward), Good from Eli Roth, Great from Diane Kruger (Really steals the scenes she is in and has somewhat of a duel personality as she works with both sides of the war), Very Good from Daniel Brühl, Good from Til Schweiger, Great from Mélanie Laurent (Does an amazing job in helping build empathy with her struggle as her disdain towards the Reich and cool persona make her somewhat of a neo-action star), Good from B. J. Novak, Good from the rest of the cast (Not a single bad performance turned in as everyone works well with each other as the acting helps make the scenes so captivating)), Incredible Story (Uses the chapter format very well to help break up the movie into smaller pieces that build on each other as we get to see different perspectives from the war and how they converge to the climax; each chapter is also very captivating as they can be real short stories on their own with how well written and captivating they are (especially the opening and bar scene); the character writing (especially for Hans Landa) is incredible as he creates very memorable icons through the use of nicknames and actions they do; the foreshadowing of the movie is pretty prominent because the movie at the end of the day is a revenge story; there is also a lot of symmetry throughout the movie), Incredible Screenplay (The dialogue is just so iconic and memorable as it flows effortlessly between the characters and has iconic lines throughout; the jokes were very typical to other Tarantino movies (so funny and helps move the story forward); the symbolism is very present), Great Cinematography (Does a good job in helping build the suspense of scenes), Great Sound (Does its part in helping build suspense and be a part of the action scenes), Great Editing, Good Visual Effects, Great Production Design (Helps with setting the period), Plot Structure was very similar to Pulp Fiction in that the movie was split into chapters (and this a very good design as it helps break up the long runtime into a smaller movie as each chapter builds on each other as they all converge to the climax), Pacing was good as the movie really changed its tempo based on the scenes (it was quick when trying to progress through scenes but slow when trying to build suspense), Climax was executed very well as it was very Tarantino is style and was a very captivating part to see all the storylines converge to one point, Tone was similar to WWII themed movies but felt very similar to other Tarantino movies in feel and style; there never really felt like just a thriller or a comedy, There wasn't really a score but the soundtrack was used very well to help build suspense throughout the movie; one of the best-executed uses of using tension to help build suspense I have ever seen in moviesORIGINAL (05/21/2017)

Spoiler Alert.,"To be given prior warning that Quentin Tarantino is a master of the offbeat genre of movie making still doesn't quite prepare you for this classic,where deciding who is good, will test your average moral expectations. It is 1943, the Allies have yet to land in Europe as German bad guy Col. Hans Landa aka the Jew hunter ( Christoph Waltz), strikes panic into the hearts of the local village communities with his charming smile and relentless interrogation technique. A pretty young French-Jewish girl, Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) escape s his merciless execution of her family, and establishes a new identity as a cinema owner. Simultaneously, an Allied plan is enacted sending a small squad of American-Jewish soldiers into occupied France to create an atmosphere of terror and havoc by killing Nazis. American Army Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) leads this scalp hunting, head splitting, band of brothers across France, frustrating a comic styled Hitler and narcissistic Josef Goebbels as The Fuehrer and his Propaganda minister prepare to launch a major cinematic misinformation program in a small French village theater. Raine, whose artistic embedding of the swastika into the foreheads of his victims using a Bowie knife, is an inspiration to his troops as they bludgeon their captives to death with baseball bats. After a bloody shootout in the basement of a side-walk café, he meets up with film star and undercover Operative Bridget Von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger). Together they plot the demise of the German High Command at Goebbels' lavish film premier, unaware that it will be held at the theater owned by Nazi hater, Shosanna Dreyfus and her black French lover, who have devised a deadly plan of their own. The film is rich in dark humor and there are moments in-between the violence where you want to laugh but the uncertainty of what might come next, holds you back. Christoph Waltz gives a chilling performance as Hitler's SS detective Landa, such that watching him enjoy a glass of milk in a farmhouse while his subject sits inwardly terrified, or in a restaurant eating apple pie and cream with such poise and refinement while he interrogates the placid Shosanna, leaves you holding your breath and willing her to withstand the mental pressure. Brad Pitt clearly enjoys his character's easy going, lay back style complete with a southern Tennessee twang and his not-quite-there appreciation of the moment, giving us some occasional and cherished moments of comedic respite in the middle of the sadistic manner in which his character Raine, pursues his mission. Claiming an Apache bloodline, Raine chills the blood of the ordinary German soldier at the mention of his name, and his hapless victims shudder at the thought of capture. In return he grants them no quarter. It is, however, the demure and so-lady-like nature of Mélanie Laurent's character Shosanna Dreyfus, and the devastating nature of her plan for retribution that grips you, as she plots against the German hierarchy, and deals with the unwanted advances of a young German war hero, Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl). 'Inglourious Basterds', is Tarnatino at his very best, with continual action, never a dull moment and a musical score that carries the viewer along at varying speeds whether we like it or not. Cameo appearances by Mike Myers and Australian actor, Rod Taylor almost unrecognizable as Winston Churchill are just another example of Tarantino's eccentric cinematic mind working overtime. While his critics will find flaws in some scenes, only the most fastidious nit-picking for whatever reason could betray this thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking classic. Comparisons with earlier features such as 'The Dirty Dozen' are a waste of time. This film stands alone in creative genius, cinematography and outrageous script writing, and one wonders what Tarantino is dreaming up in the dark recesses of his mind, to top it. Completely absent are the street combat, crumbled buildings, hand to hand fighting and tank battles one expects of a war film; some scenes such as the meeting of the boyish war hero Zoller and Shosanna outside her theater after the evening's performance are positively refreshing when set against the harsh realities of an Occupation army. Their exchanges give us a moment to experience some peace and sanity in a fractious world before returning to the brutality we know is just around the corner. Following the fiery climax at the premier, the final scene in the forest where Raine's Bowie knife cuts deep into Lando's plans for a safe retirement leave us uncertain for the future of both men and the world at large. This is not a film for the faint-hearted or those who struggle with erratic time-lines that zig-zag backwards and forwards telling a complicated, interwoven tale not quite consistent with historical realities. One has to keep in mind that with Tarantino we are dealing with a seductively wicked imagination and a penchant for re-writing history the way he thinks it should have happened.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Risky, Unique, Fresh, And Fun","Many people regarded Death Proof as a disappointment and they were all hoping that Tarantino will come back to his best form in his next film, though I did think highly of Death Proof, and what a come back he did. Inglourious Basterds is his 6th film and it shows Tarantino going back to the things that made his film great whilst doing something unique.Inglourious Basterds is written by Quentin Tarantino, and he has definitely made something fantastic here. Tarantino here has brought back the non-linear approach to his storytelling. He dedicates the first three chapters of the film as an introduction to the key players of the last chapter, and having the 4th Chapter 'Operation Kino' as the driving plot point. It kept me hooked because with each chapter, as he adds on more information that we didn't know which builds it all up for the last two chapters of the film. The film shows off entertaining and quirky characters, which hasn't been found in his films since his 90's flicks. Tarantino has given his characters much more depth here than most of his previous films would give, and he continuous it with his next film, and it does allow me to connect with these characters more and understand their inner workings due to their given back-stories. The dialogue in this film is top notch, at times very reminiscent of the style that was used for Pulp Fiction, as it kept me more interested as more words come out from these characters. To some people, they may see it as a return to Tarantino's indulgent style of dialogue but that's what makes his films special in the first place, so the more the better.Not at all did the film bore me, this is because Tarantino is in love with his own dialogue and he makes it the star of the scene. Tarantino fills the scene with dialogue, as a build up of sorts towards the violent and explosive ending that the scene needs in order to be relieved and pumped for what comes next. As I said before the non-linear storytelling of the film and using the bulk of the film to create and introduce it's characters, it doesn't get boring as it doesn't repeat itself and always give off something new. Some people find a lot of Tarantino's films to have a pacing problem and I can understand where they are coming from, but Inglourious Basterds is one of those films that felt like it moves forwards all the time regardless how still a scene may seem because it keeps throwing interesting things your way and in a lot of scenes, Tarantino was able to convey tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat thinking something might happen. Tarantino has used non-English dialogue with subtitles in his previous films, Kill Bill, and now he has put that up front with this film, using it as a style in making this film unique and allowing the film to feel more genuine.Robert Richardson is back to do another of Tarantino's film and with each film I start to see a connection and understanding of each other's visions. Richardson understands what the film needs to create that homage atmosphere that Tarantino intends his films to look like. Richardson and Tarantino has brought back their trademark shots like long takes and the trunk shot. Because this film is a dialogue driven film, Richardson contains a lot more closeups than his previous films and this does allow us to get in touch with these characters and see the emotional rumblings that they hide behind the facade due to the current situation, especially Melanie Laurent's character. The film's photography seems to strip away the over saturation of it's colors, like Kill Bill and Death Proof, and takes a more darker and grimier look for the film.The film doesn't contain a composer writing an original score, instead it uses soundtracks that are more score driven. The tracks that are chosen are Sergio Leone/Ennio Morricone inspired, which on paper would be an odd choice as it suits more of the Western era but after seeing this film, you hardly even notice it and at the end you realize that it actually works. There are specific moments that are supported by a track that makes the moment seem perfect but Tarantino has the habit of cutting it off and not giving the scene a proper conclusion, which gives off a comedic feel and prevents it from being too melodramatic.Brad Pitt may be seen as the frontrunner of the film but the film is more of an ensemble piece. The first three chapters are dedicated to a certain character(s), and this allows these actor(s) to shine in their segments. Brad Pitt definitely brings a surge of energy in this film, working with a character that feels almost specifically written for him. The other standout was Christoph Waltz, playing a character that has a personality that I have haven't seen before. Waltz brings such charm and personality to a character that is regarded by most people as the ultimate Jew killer. Tarantino has used an international cast before but not as diverse as this film. Inglourious Basterds has made a star and showcased the talents of actors like Melanie Laurent and Daniel Bruhl. Though Michael Fassbender has been on films before this like 300 but this film put him on the map, the bar scene segment was tense and thrilling and a part of it is due to Fassbender's performance.Inglourious Basterds is a remarkable film and a demonstration of Tarantino's ability to take something that has been used a billion times in films and make it feel fresh and unique. The film boasts wonderful dialogue, amazing sequences, fantastic performances front actors, smart choice of music, and excellent photography. Inglourious Basterds is a rival for the number one spot for my favorite Tarantino films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Not Quentin Tarantino at his best.,"Our story begins in World War 2, where Lt. Aldo Raine(Brad Pitt), puts a group a Jewish soldiers together, who are called Inglourious Basterds, there mission is to hunt and scalp Nazis at all cost. They have a plan to into Germany. But another story comes into play with Shosanna(Melanie Laurent) a Jew disguised as a french, who escaped the Nazis years earlier, in which her family was slaughtered by the Nazis. Who now runs a movie theater, and is ploting her own revenge.Now Pulp Fiction(1994), and Kill Bill vol 1 and 2(2003-2004) are what I considered to be masterpieces. But Inglourious Basterds is not in that category, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Most of the character don't really grab any interest, Tarantino does not across with interesting dialog with any of the characters, except in the beginning, but it goes away after that. And Eli Roth is clearly no actor, he just doesn't do much. And Brad Pitt wears himself out fast. Now it did have some good shoot out scenes. And it also had a great setting. But after it got to be boring, where one scene, i nearly dosed off. But I did like Melanie Laurent, who becomes the only interest through out the whole film. Not Tarantinos best work, but not his worst, but it could have been better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Another cool yet shallow film by Tarantino,"I understand the overly enthusiastic user reviews of this movie very well.. I was also 18 once and thoroughly enjoyed all of Tarantino's films. His characters, the conversations, the action were all very cool. And that seems to be the keyword in all of Tarantino's movies: cool.However, when watching a film of war (or any movie for that matter), I'm interested to see what the director has to say on the subject - what is his philosophy on revenge for instance? This is where Tarantino's films suddenly become very boring, as they contain little more philosophy than, e.g. revenge is sweet.The other thing that pisses me of, are the shallow characters in this film. After watching the movie's first scene, I thought this was going to be a great movie. The characters were excellent, the suspense was killing, and you felt this could actually have happened.. This was before the ""inglorious basterds"" entered the screen. What a waste - who were these bastards and where did they come from? Ironically, they spoiled the movie most. Had the movie been about the hunt (and revenge) of Shoshanna I think it would have been much more interesting. Now it became a slap-stick comedy like ""Allo Allo"" where the Germans were simply ridiculed. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
World War II has never been so exciting!,"The Pianist, The Schlinder List or Saving the Private Ryan are one of the best WW2 movies ever made. But for me which one is the number one? Of course Inglorious Basterds. History movies always give us serious messages such as the meaning of life or human cruelty, and usually filmmakers told their stories in a very slow, serious and politically correct way. Honestly I am so done with those kind of films. I mean, we can learn that on school. If I want to see a history movie I don't want to be told the story as if I was reading a book or watching a documentary, films should be interesting, emotional and clever and if to achieve that is necessary to add fiction, welcome that! In that sense, Quentin Tarantino didn't want to make ANOTHER WW2 movie, he didn't want to give us a history class, HE WANTED TO ENTERTAIN US, and I love him for that. However, If I still don't convince you to see Inglorious Basterds here are some facts about the movie that justify spending you time on Tarantino.1: Has one of the most scary villains of all time, the one and only Hans Landa. He won an Oscar for his role.2: English is not the only language, the film tries to be accurate with the context, you can find entire scenes with German, French or Italian.3: Is a combination of history and fiction. So you the story IS NOT TOLD. Tarantino specifically didn't want to be a teacher of the most known history event. Instead, he gave us a finale very VERY satisfying.4: The dialogues are exquisite as it is usual on Tarantino. However, the contructions of scenes are set with more mistery and tension tone than in Pulp Fiction. We are talking about Nazis and the MOST VIOLENT context in human history here, so obviously Tarantino took advanatage of that.

You Know What? This Just Might Be Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece!,"The sixth film by Quentin Tarantino finds the esteemed filmmaker in sublime form as he blends the genres of war & spaghetti western into one stylish, violent & vengeful cinematic delight that brims with Tarantino's patented wordplay, fascinating characters, uninhibited violence, outstanding cast & excellent performances to deliver a thrilling ride that enthrals, entertains & satisfies on all levels, and keeps getting better with every subsequent viewing.Set in Nazi-occupied France, Inglourious Basterds intercuts two story lines. First concerns a young Jewish girl who, after witnessing her family being killed by an SS officer, plots her revenge several years later when a German war film is arranged to premiere at her theatre. The second plot follows a team of Jewish-American soldiers who plan to assassinate all the Nazi leaders attending the film premiere. The two plots of revenge eventually coincide as the story nears its conclusion.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, Inglourious Basterds is told in five chapters and features the best opening scene of any Tarantino movie to date. The first twenty minutes is a pure exercise in unabridged, patient & flawless filmmaking for the director allows the dialogue-heavy segment to instil an unnerving ambiance on its own and keeps a firm check on the pace & camera movements. It also introduces us to the villain in grand style and by the time the first chapter ends, we know all there is to know about Hans Landa & his cunning tactics.Tarantino's direction is terrific while his screenplay is a gem in itself. Adding enough meat on every character's bone, he manages to carve out many suspenseful moments from the most unexpected corners and while his usual elements, such as pop culture references, dark humour, blood-soaked violence are in tact, the writer-director also removes the veil of hypocrisy to show that all humans, regardless of their labels, are capable of intense cruelty. Also, by setting his narrative in a fictional alternate history, he frees himself from following the fact formula and plays as per his wishes.The technical aspects are fabulously carried out, each adding something to the movie. Production design team does a really fine job in setting up the World War II iconography, albeit with little dose of western landscape. Cinematography gives its images a sumptuous look n feel, while exquisitely moving the camera around to capture the drama in splendid detail. Editing is expertly carried out & its 152 minutes of runtime is consistently paced. And as always, Tarantino manages to put together an amazing soundtrack, comprising of wonderful tracks that seamlessly integrates with the scenes and effortlessly uplift the whole experience.Coming to the performances, Inglourious Basterds features a stellar cast in Brad Pitt, Christopher Waltz, Mélanie Laurent, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassbender, Eli Roth, Daniel Brühl & others, and all of them are fabulous in their given roles. Pitt plays a character that belongs to his comfort zone & does well with what he's given. Fassbender is present in just one chapter yet manages to leave his mark. Kruger & Brühl balance their act really well, Roth gets to play the coolest basterd of them all as that skull bashing scene had all the build-up elements of a spaghetti western Mexican standoff. However, the best performances come from Waltz & Laurent.Making a lasting impression right within the opening segment, Waltz brings this ingeniously written character to life as per the exact demands of the screenplay and delivers an absolutely impeccable performance that easily goes down as one of decade's best. The character of Hans Landa is one of Tarantino's finest creations and Waltz only gets better in that role as the story progresses. Without Waltz's contribution, Inglourious Basterds amounts to pretty much nothing plus it's a rare instance of perfect actor-character marriage. Laurent is another revelation and plays her part with stunning finesse plus and just like Waltz, her input is devoid of any faults.On an overall scale, Inglourious Basterds is another original, sophisticated & downright captivating extravaganza from Quentin Tarantino that, like few of his earlier flicks, requires a little getting used to. Jam-packed with vibrant flavours & accomplished in nearly every filmmaking aspect, the movie brilliantly exhibits just how far this master storyteller has come over the years in tightening his grip around his craft. One of the best films of its year and certainly amongst the finest from Tarantino's filmography, Inglourious Basterds is a slow burner but it has all the ingredients of an instant classic and considering numerous other positives, I think this just might be his masterpiece.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Brilliant Actors, unconventional, absolutely convincing","I just watched the movie and found it worthy to post my first IMDb comment after using the IMDb for years. One point motivating me is the fact that i am a German and i'm sure a lot of people might find it interesting to hear from a German point of view that this film is hilarious. Please excuse my untrained school English.First of all i want to name the hilarious acting of Christoph Waltz. I'm afraid not to have seen the original Version of the Film yet so i can only imagine the dialogs being mixed in English french and German. What i have seen for now was really inspiring. The Dialogues which take a lot of room in the plot are special special and special. Each Plot has a Main Dialogue or Monologue (Pit when Introducing the Basterds) which is originally written and full of turnarounds. Waltz gives a wonderful Van Cleeve like Bad who is brutal intelligent and cold but in a way admirable. Tension is created through every word he speaks cause one never really knows how intelligent tarentino lets him be. Pitt does a great job playing the cool American nazi killer. Melanie Laurant is beautiful in every situation she's in and her acting ins absolutely convincing i won't forget her FACE for a wile. Schweiger (i don't really like him) does what he has to and is both amusing and absolutely cool. And especially to mention doing a great performance in one of the long Dialogues is August Diehl. He creates Tension out of nothing and is releasing it through laughs only to create it again. For me the best ""side acting"". Kruger is as i feared before the only bad part of the acting, but maybe that's because she is so German in trying to be an American playing a German. The synchronization she does for the German version is bad, really bad. But i could bear it since the rest of the acting was so good. Tarentino did the best job since pulp by giving the actors room to unfold.As i mentioned Dialogues in the Film are given most of the 150min of the Movie but no dialog is destroying the tension. It's like Turn and River card all along like Leone does in a fistful. They are simply captivating you i didn't want them to stop.I thought the film would only be a brutal American interpretation of Nazi-Germany and how to best give them what they deserve which is the main aspect of the Trailer. Tarentino is doing this in a way, but for me not too much and concentrates more one originality than on brutality. He played with my sympathy all the time by giving all the Germans in the movie some sympathetic aspects and making fun out of cultural mix-ups.The western elements are there, and he is not trying to hide that he wants some Leone in his movie. The main characters are good bad and ugly. These attributes can be distributed in many ways just find out for yourself. The nazi's in the movie often show Wallach like behavior.The Germans in the movie seem authentic to me which is another plus. Casting German actors was an important decision for the authenticity of the movie. Ohterwise i guess a lot have Germans would not buy it and simply call it typical American interpretation of German cultural aspects.To come to an end Dialogues as creative as only tarentino can create, tension which is worthy to call it Leone like , a bad guy who can compete with Van Cleef, Actors who are set in scene in this special tarentino way. Best Fim since Dark Knight.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Must see film,"Before I start this review I must say this movie was amazing, so amazing it should be number 1 on the top movies list on this site. QT's best film ,a must see, I loved it, now there are some things I must warn though. If you are going into the theaters expecting all blood and gore then think again. The film has great action scenes but it isn't all gore and it isn't as violent as you may think. On that note if you don't like reading subtitles, if it bores you don't see it. The movie is in French mostly and has English subtitles. Well those are the warnings about this film, although me not knowing about either of those and not liking to read subtitles (I feel it distracts your attention from what the people in the film are doing and makes you take your time reading the dialogue instead)still loved this film. I wouldn't say it's my favorite but it is up there on my list. It has no faults that I noticed and a brilliant story. It really catches you in and has a great ending. Not having come out on DVD yet, I'd still have to say this is a must see in theaters movie. You need to see it on the huge screen with the loud volume it brings out the movie and really catches you in it. Now many of you reading this may have noticed I said it deserves to be number 1 but said it wasn't my favorite, that's because unlike many of the films I enjoy, it seems to please many different groups of people. I even saw old ladies at the movies watching this. Without a doubt I would say go to the theaters and see this film. If you are a QT fan, action fan, drama fan, Brad Pitt fan, war movie fan, or just PLAIN OLD MOVIE LOVER or even just AN AVERAGE MOVIE WATCHER or even if you HATE MOVIES you MUST SEE THIS FILM!!!! run out to the theaters with a friend or even by yourself and watch this, and pay attention to it too, it is amazing. 10 out of 10 best movie that has come out in the past few years and one of the best movies that has come out PERIOD",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Ehh,"Marvellous director, needless to say, this movie is geniously written. And the acting is just exquisite. I mean it is worth the money just to see the Nazi officers - the one getting killed by a baseball bat, the one in the pub with the accent ear and of course Hans Landa, probably one of the best performances you get to see in the cinematographic world.But is this movie Tarantino's gift to the Jews or what the hell is wrong here? I mean.. this is probably something he did not intend, but this whole movie very, very much resembles the movie all the Nazi officers and leaders are watching in Shosanna's cinema. Just consider it, how all the Nazis sitting there are enjoying the mindless killing, and just look on the focus of how the Basterds enjoy killing Nazis, and the emphasis put into portraying it.This I did not enjoy, since I was left with a feeling, that in order to enjoy this movie, I'd have to be same as a Nazi watching 'A Nation's Pride' (or a Jew watching Inglourious Basterds).Just my two cents.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"""Basterds"" was worth the wait.","The man who brought us ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"", and ""Kill Bill"" has finally brought his highly-anticipated WWII film, ""Inglourious Basterds"" to the screen. Quentin Tarantino lives up to the hype in his highly-stylized, albeit not so factual, war epic with the intertwining stories of a Nazi-detective (Cristoph Waltz), a Jewish-French survivor (Mélanie Laurent), and a group of misfit, Jewish-American soldiers also know as The Basterds (Brad Pitt and company). The Basterds are focused on one thing and one thing only: ""Killing Nat- zis."" The opening scene takes place in 1940 French farm country, where Col. Hans Landa (played by a vicious and brilliant Cristoph Waltz) has arrived on a family's farm who he believes is sheltering Jews. The scene is a long one, filled with Tarantino the witty Tarantino dialogue we came to love. As the end of the scene nears, Mr. Tarantino gives us the chills with the eery music and the inevitable climax (yes the scene itself has a climax!) that is about to unfold, and we see the true evil of Waltz's Col. Hans Landa and his Nazi brethren. If Cristoph Waltz doesn't get an Oscar nomination, I will be greatly surprised. At the end of the first scene, we see a girl escape (Mélanie Laurent) Landa's Jew-massacre, who will vow revenge on the Nazis who killed her family. Next we see The Basterds, led by the hilarious Brad Pitt. He lets he and his fellow soldier's ""distaste"" for Nazis and their leader be known. The stories of Shoshanna, Col. Landa, and The Basterds all collide in the final scenes of the film, and it is both literally and figuratively explosive! I'm not going to give anything else away, but the rest of the ""Inglourious Basterds"" delves into the sick and brilliant mind of Tarantino, who gives us one hell of a stylish and unique interpretation of WWII. The acting is amazing, Brad Pitt was meant to be Lt. Aldo Raine, and is comical to the last. Critoph Waltz gives an Oscar-worthy and menacing performance of one of the greatest villains in film history. Our leading ladies (Laurent and Kruger) fit well into the story and dazzle in their respective roles. Tarantino definitely puts his stamp on both the script and in the direction, as the viewer sees and hears many songs, lines, and stylish undertones that they have seen in previous Tarantino films. ""Inglorious Basterds"" is not for everyone. It is a gory, biased, and non-factual WWII film. Many will be turned off by the nonfactual accounts of the film but then I guess that means that those people must hate the ""Indiana Jones"" films as well... However, if you have seen and liked Tarantino's other films than you'll be just fine. If you have not liked Tarantino's other films, I'm puzzled as to why you would watch this in the first place, because you will hate it. The running time is a tad long and some of the scenes are paced a little to slow, but all in all, ""Basterds"" delivers and it delivers more than well. Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a glorious masterpiece and is the best film of 2009 thus far. It's heavy and stylized action and witty dialogue shock and make us laugh all at the same time. ""Basterds"" was worth the wait and I'll add it to my collection of other Tarantino masterpieces when it comes out on DVD. ""Basterds"" is a movie-lover's movie and does not disappoint.9 out of 10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Despite the excessive runtime (a few minutes shy off 2.5 hours) there lingers a strange feeling that everything has been rushed up in a way.,"This is quite a long film. The premise and plot are both simple and straightforward. Save Waltz (Landa), there is nothing at all worth mentioning when it comes to performance, except perhaps Laurent (Shosanna) in a few of her scenes, especially the restaurant confrontation with Standartenführer Landa where she managed to form a living driving force only with her eyes and facial expressions.Pitt (Raine) kept a cowboy accent and an annoying Marlon Brando imitation to the bitter end. Brühl (Zoller) played the classic méchant chevalier with an extra layer of innocence up to his last scene.Music is nostalgic with many homage pieces, a characteristic of Tarantino's work.At least two stand-off's occur to satisfy the director's passion for pasta; the first one is a three-way (Chapter Four) and the second one is a hit-miss-hit (Chapter Five.) Now I have to watch the film one more time when it goes on DVD to form an opinion on the cinematography and décor work. However, as far as it goes for a first watch, I cannot but fail to find any possibility for this title to achieve any honours (except for Christoph Waltz)-- there is almost no memorable pieces in the dialogue, and the performance of many actors sealed the film's fate, especially the flat performance of Pitt-Brando and the secondary high-ranking characters, notably Gruth (Goebbles) Wuttke (Hitler.) The other Germans did put up a not-so-bad performance though.For a final verdict: An extremely boring, very Tarantino 'loan-y' film, with emphasis on tics, accents and speech patterns over any intelligent or comprehensible dialogue. Lukewarm, straightforward flat writing which favours in-scene slow tension-building over the overall progress of the story, again in a usual Tarantino style. The assassination scene (Chapter Five) and its build-ups turned out quite nicely though, in a genre-blending manner.3 out of 6 (for Waltz' and some of Laurent's performances and the assassination scenes. The remaining 4 points to the 10 mark are reserved for cinematography.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Funny?,"Firstly, my comments and my marking in no way reflect my opinion of the ability of the actors. It's the substance I take exception to. I'm appalled to find that this film is intended to be funny. Several contributors to the 'comments' section have used the adjectives 'humourous','hilarious' etc to describe it. Warfare may be many things - awful, soul destroying, mentally scaring at the same time as being honourable and even uplifting if done in a worthy cause. Under no circumstances can it, or should it, be funny. Quite honestly, I find it a sad reflection on the malaise of our culture that so many (I'm sure otherwise good people) should want to find it so, even in cinematic format. I found the film to be a repulsive and awful attempt to achieve a large audience at the expense of appealing to the darkest elements within our psyche. What are we to take from this? That the Allied side in a what was one of the few justifiable conflicts in world history contained the very same sadistic and homicidal element that existed in the evil we were trying to defeat? This film is an insult to those who fought and died. They deserve a better epitaph than this skin-flick for closet psychopaths. My only regret is that I don't appear to be able to give it a lesser mark that I have done",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Let's kill as much Nazis as possible,"How the hell can people rate Inglourious Basterds with the lowest possible score? That is just completely ridiculous. That you don't like the movie I can get but scoring it a one is just infantile behavior. So those reviewers never saw a worse movie then this one? It's just pathetic. I guess they must be right wing Nazis scum and they don't like watching Nazis getting beaten. Well I give it a ten. I thought it was an excellent movie. One that I will watch again in the future, and even more then once. Even if I remember every line in the movie I will watch it again. The dialogues are just sublime. The acting is far above all the crap we are used to watch. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa is just outstanding. Probably the best role he ever played. And even though he plays a mean German Nazi Jew hunter he's still very enjoyable to watch. He should get an Oscar for his acting in Inglorious Basterds. Brad Pitt as Luitenant Aldo Raine is just great fun to watch. I mean what is not fun about watching killing dirty Nazis? It's just hilarious, certainly the conversations they have about killing as much Nazis as possible. The rest of the cast is also very good. Every single character in this movie is top notch.

Quentin Tarantino's vision of WWII is a must-see.,"If you have not seen this movie yet, stop reading this review and go. In a nutshell this is Tarantino's version WWII and it is a dandy. Tarantino's exceptional writing skills on display are further enhanced with exceptional acting thanks to Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz. In particular, Waltz' performance of the multilingual-Gestapo-juggernaut is dominating. This film is filled with satire, suspense, and drama which is likely to garner awards. I could easily call this film this years Dark Knight. Whats interesting about this film is that although WWII films have become tiresome, Tarantino has put together an avant-garde war film which is rare and should not be overlooked.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Brilliant.,"I went into this movie expecting nothing and hoping for something. I had really enjoyed Kill Bill vol 1&2 and after recently re-watching them on Blu-ray back-to-back, I can say now that I REALLY enjoyed Kill Bill 1&2... but it still did not hold a candle to Pulp Fiction or even Reservoir Dogs for that matter.I'm here to tell you that Inglourious Basterds is an absolute masterpiece... FAR surpassed my wildest hopes and blows Kill Bill out of the water. I dare say it may even top Pulp Fiction in my books after a few more viewings.I Very Very rarely, at the end of a movie in the theatres, before I even get back to my car... want to watch the movie again. And then for days after I Can Not stop thinking about it, and how much I want to watch it again... and again!!! I've seen it now 3 times in theatres, with different friends and family members who all express different opinions.The movie is simply an experience. Tarantino immerses you into this world of his with extremely well done characters and some of the best dialogue exchanges I have ever witnessed on screen... plus the greatest last 15 minutes of a movie probably ever done. There is not a single character in this movie who doesn't deserve an award - but Most of all was Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa.

Waltz gets The Oscar ......that's about it.,"I became a Tarantino fan rather reluctantly . To be honest I had formed quite an unfavourable opinion of the fellow after watching Kill Bill many years ago .But as they when wisdom comes slowly it comes for good. In the light of Tarantinos entire filmography , I admit he has to be one of the most ingenuous brains around in the movie making business today.Pulp Fiction need not be cited here as an example of his ingenuity. We all know how good the movie was. Our purpose out here , however is to analyse and then give judicious responses to the movie which was titled ""Inglourious Basterds "" thereby affording Microsoft Word the opportunity to cyclically raise the spelling and grammar check warning.This movie friends is beautifully made and true to the Director's claims, falls right in the lines of the Westerns which preceded it. Playful screenplay. Some exquisite acting and a highly unconventional form make this film a delightful piece of 21st century cinema.Christoph Waltz dominates the screen through some splendid method acting which never allowed anyone in the movie hall to take their eyes off him. He executed his role perfectly. Linguistically one the most refined and impeccable performances I've seen. I mean to speak to Languages for a character who in the movies knows none of them perfectly is surely one great concept conceived by the writer.Brad Pitt is not as impressive but his presence can be tolerated.The opening seen is perhaps one the best scenes in the movie and sets the ball rolling.Like all his movies the Director sometimes succumbs to the seductive charms of his own proclivities , thus ending up in a slightly ugly area of moribund plot progression . But then such instances are rare.Not his best by any means though better than most other films on offer today.I give it 8 for Waltz, who has just earned an Oscar (he should have received it in the Leading role category..!!!!!) and for the Tarantino effect in the screenplay.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Tarantino is a Nazi in denial,"This movie tries to ""empower"" the good guys with the wicked means of the enemy (the Nazis in this case). This IMO is insulting to the people who actually fought those \nazi bastards.I think Tarantino is your average repressed sadistic white male who can't come to peace with his own intrinsic sadism and thus needs to pretend like he's actually being altruistic when portraying Jews as vicious killers who are basically behaving no better than the Nazis. The same thing he did with Django unchained only there we had black people behaving just as bad as white slavers.What pisses me of is that he won't admit it. He won't admit that he's just as evil as all the white men who committed horrible atrocities in the past and he desperately feels the need to bring Jews and blacks to that same level so that he may feel better about his own whiteness.It's OK, Quentin, just admit who you are! People will understand. We'll still watch your movies! Just spare yourself the pain man, it's OK.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Destined to be another cult classic from Tarantino,"From the twisted but brilliantly acclaimed mind of writer/director Quentin Tarantino comes a movie so shocking but also surprisingly entertaining that it could only be described as a guilty pleasure.Once upon a time in Nazi Occupied France Lt. Aldo Rayne (Pitt) leads a team of Jewish soldiers known as The Basterds to do dirty business and work above the law. Their job is to brutally scalp and kill every Nazi, who comes their way. The job becomes bigger when they intend on blowing up a movie theater with the German army attending. Meanwhile the theater owner (a Jewish/French refugee) has another revenge plot in mind for the Nazis.Tarantino once said he's always dreamt of killing Nazis and glorifying it on screen. Now his dream's come true. Inglorious Basterds does what it sets out to accomplish: shock & entertain viewers with dark humor and over the top Tarantino style violence (it's comical but graphic.) For me though this is another cult classic from Tarantino. Every suspense sequence was chilling, every joke was a riot, and every line was quotable.Brad Pitt has outdone himself again, by acing another memorable comedic performance coming from an unexpected character. The supporting cast including Eli Roth (Hostel), Diane Kruger (National Treasure), and a cameo from Mike Myers all finely turned their roles. That said the biggest surprise here is Christoph Waltz's portrayal of the clever and terrifying villain Col. Hans Landa (AKA: The Jew Hunter.) Waltz captures the dark and menacing tone of his character perfectly, and is convincing for every on screen moment. His mesmerizing performance left me speechless so therefore he has my vote for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars next year, and he's sure to be this year's Javier Bardem of villains as well.That aside keep in mind that this is still Tarantino so expect gory, over the top, realistic violence, along with a teaspoon of profanity. If your family has a code of conduct then this isn't something that should come on your list. A lot of this movie is also in foreign dialogue so if you hate reading subtitles wait for it on rental.To conclude this is a bloody and intense portrayal of World War 2 but with tremendous writing, breathtaking suspense sequences, a great composing score and the right amount of dark humor, it succeeds at being an instant Tarantino classic is a great way to end the summer.

I know why there are so many subtitles in this movie!,"After having sat through this film, I can say with certainty I know why there are so many subtitles in this movie.

Great End-Of-Summer Movie (mild spoilers),"Had the fortune of seeing this the day after Labor day (furlough day) in an almost-empty theater. Loved the titles, the music, the storyline....Tarantino is already pretty well known for tense scenes but this movie is packed with them, and surprisingly less gore than expected, save for the last 10 minutes and the ""scalping"" scenes. One of the main action sequences the movie hinges on lasts only about 10 seconds of screen time, which gives the movie a great feeling of existing in real time, in the moment.Great performances all around, especially Pitt (who seems to be playing a variation on his Thelma and Louise character) and Shoshona, the heroine and movie buff. By going against audience expectations (140 minutes of expletives and flying Nazi body parts), Tarantino creates one of his most fully imagined worlds yet. And I love the use of subtitles and the actors speaking primarily French or German (or bad Italian)- one of the characters even taunts the Americans for speaking only one language.Entertaining completely. One of my favorite Tarantino movies, better than Jackie Brown, not quite as good as Pulp Fiction. A grower for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Fantastic, by far the best movie of the year so far","Inglorious Basterds was hyped as a wild ride gorefest by the legendary Tarentino. QT slipped up a bit with his last few films, but he has created what I believe is his best film since Pulp Fiction. The dialogue is not nearly as cartoon-like as Kill Bill's, it just felt uch more real, but it had that same elegance that all Tarentino films are suppose to have. And that is what makes this film, it is as elegant as it is brutal.The opening scene was one of the most powerful scenes I've ever watched in theaters, it was extremely tense, not so riddled with jokes. The performances were all fantastic, down to the smallest characters. Of course the big name here is Brad Pitt, and he truly delivers a great performance, funny, and exciting. Eli Roth surprised me in this one, giving a good performance as the Boston native known as the Bear Jew. Even the smaller roles, Mike Myers and BJ Novak delivered in what manner they needed to as well.The highlight is the dialogue, Tarentino truly delivered what I consider to be his most exciting and real dialogue ever. The music was fantastic also, perfect placement, from the very beginning to the end you don't even realize how long you have been in the theater due to the fact that the movie grips you so much.All and all, what a fantastic movie from QT, he is back and I can't wait for his next on already.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

And I don't care that I had to read subtitles for the majority of the film. What spoiled ""Inglourious Basterds"" for me was the lack of character development. Quentin Tarantino has a talent for creating irresistible characters that could do laundry for the entire duration of a film and we would still think to ourselves, ""Ugh, if only I could be that awesome!"" Each character had enormous potential, but so little time was spent exploring them individually, that they never drew me into the story. Tarantino set out to make the ultimate revenge film, and he achieved a wholly satisfactory plot, but he neglected his characters in the process.

QT's Dirtey Douzen,"After the amiably simple pleasures of seeing some hot chicks kickin' the crap out of Kurt Russell, our favourite pulpinator QT is back in his self-glorifying Kill Bill mode, which means countless more or less dubious movie references, in-your-face violence and (oh-so-)clever verbal exchanges.To be frank, Tarantino's dialogue is partly first-class, with the opening chapter being particularly effective. And his ability to create tension and make the Nazi terror palpable should be stated to all those grumpy critics and humourless spokespersons of political correctness who don't get the gist of this huge Jewish revenge fake history joke.But all in all, the pic's just above average: some scenes go on for too long, some jokes fall flat, most characters remain opaque and while the cinema showdown features some nice gags, the last scene (concerning Hans Landa's fate, who's, by the way, brilliantly portrayed by Christoph Waltz) isn't half as clever as it should be.6 out of 10 marked Krauts",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

A Nutshell Review: Inglourious Basterds,"While Quentin Tarantino's love for movies is unquestionable, Inglourious Basterds tops his previous efforts in genre revolution, tossing a whole of of ingredients together and mixing them up, and you'll be put into a mental dizzy just keeping track of the numerous odes, homages, and pure love for the cinema that Tarantino included in this film, a misnomer most definitely that this is anything but a WWII movie about a group of US-Jewish guerrilla soldiers inserted into enemy territory to strike fear through their inhumane ways of exterminating Hitler's army.Told in chapters (which I felt could actually stand alone as short films) and running some 153 minutes, Inglourious Basterds isn't your father's war movie, where it's flat out action from end to end. In true Tarantino fashion, you've got to brace yourself for a lot, and I mean a whole lot of dialogues and conversations as only how Tarantino knows to craft in an engrossing, engaging fashion. While the violence and F-bombs have been considerably toned down, the way the characters interact, from egoistical monologues to a pair of lovebirds realizing their calling, from intense conversations to foolhardy game play around a table, are pure gold, with such talky scenes getting milked dry, before mayhem got unleashed akin to pressing the reset button, only to have the next chapter repeat itself stylistically all over again. I continue to stand amazed at how Tarantino fashions and crafts his dialogues.If you're geared up for some rowdy action as the trailer made it out to be, then you'll be disappointed outright, since you don't really get to see the Basterds in action all the time, especially after that rousing speech by Lt Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) outlining the Basterds' mission, with the narrative fast-forwarding many years to the tail-end of the war. Not that I didn't mind of course, as there are a lot more going for the film, than a straight-out action whack fest, knowing Tarantino being at the helm.And in Tarantino-verse, the chapters here are designed with a lot of precision, despite having a lot going for it. I especially enjoyed the opening, quite unconventional in a way, but what an introduction to the villain, played in such low key terms as it built up toward quiet revelation. The gem of the film is undoubtedly Christoph Waltz's chilling performance as Col. Hans Landa, aka The Jew Hunter, earning a reputation of always getting his man through extremely convincing techniques of interviews, interrogation and negotiations. Tarantino has crafted a highly complex villain, and I dare say the best amongst his stories thus far, who's always full of surprises for his enemies. A cunning linguist as well, he's tremendously gentlemanly in his demeanour, never betraying the sick and ruthless core hidden behind that shiny medal-filled uniform. Waltz is definitely worthy of all accolades coming his way by virtue of his sterling performance here.The other scene which worked magically, was that in a tavern, where Lt Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) and Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger) meet up with double agent actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) to discuss plans for Operation Kino, only to be constantly interrupted by Major Dieter Hellstrom (August Diehl). What transpired is something that bordered on the hilarious, yet constantly teething on knife's edge given our heroes' bluff on the verge of being exposed. And with two Mexican stand offs done in Tarantino style, what more can you ask for as it continued being played out with pure glee.The story arc of Shosanna Dreyfus may run typical of a revenge flick, where the victim swears vengeance over her once German hunter, but thanks to Melanie Laurent's luminous presence as Shosanna, it got elevated to a lot more as she held her own, allowing you to sympathize with her plight and steely resolve in her mission. This arc is also one of the most beautifully shot (especially the scenes in the movie theatre), having importance as the melting pot primed for regime change. Filled at every moment with nuggets of cinema information that only Tarantino can weave together in an engaging fashion, it even features a movie-in- movie directed by Eli Roth, who had also donned his acting hat as one of the Basterds.Tarantino continues to leave his indelible mark on modern cinema, and like the final, permanent branding, this film has certainly served to be the masterpiece reflective of what he does best. Definitely worth repeated viewings just to lap up all the gems you've missed the first time round.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

An Inglourious Pick for the Best Film of the Year!,"This summer, everyone I know waited for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Me? I waited in great anticipation for the new film from my favorite director Quentin Tarantino, a World War II revenge epic entitled Inglourious Basterds. And, I will admit, it did not disappoint.While Tarantino is known for his over the top violence, it's not the blood and gore that makes his films so good. It's the long sessions of dialog. While this may turn some film goers off (like my friends who preferred the aforementioned Transformers), to me it's what makes his films roll. If you pay attention, the dialog is very funny and entertaining. Plus, the action is more exciting and unexpected when QT sticks it in the middle of the conversation.In his previous films, Tarantino used mainstream Hollywood stars for his films. However, with the exception of Brad Pitt and a cameo by a nearly unrecognizable Mike Myers (fans of The Office will recognize BJ Novak aka Ryan), you probably won't recognize nearly three quarters of the actors in the film. All of the foreign actors in the film are terrific, and they give a sense of realism to the film. Melanie Laurent, a French actress, is Shosanna, a young Jewish girl who plans to burn down her cinema with Nazi leaders inside. Among the Basterds are Til Schweiger, a sadistic German who kills Nazis in creative ways, and Michael Fassbender as a British war leader. As for Pitt, he portrays the leader of the Basterds, a hillbilly named Aldo Raine. Raine is an awesome character, and a role only Pitt could play. He leads his all Jewish team into France where they do ""one thang and one thang only-(kill) Nazis"". Myers's cameo is small, but you can't believe how unrecognizable he is. Hopefully, Myers gets his career back on track after duds like The Love Guru and The Cat in the Hat (easily one of the worst films ever). Eli Roth, best known as the director of Hostel, is on hand to portray Donnie, a Bostonian Jew who beats Nazis with a baseball bat. Roth is not only a good director, but a good actor as well. He previously cameoed in Tarantino's Death Proof, and hopefully more roles are on his way. But Christoph Waltz steals the show as the crazy Nazi general Hans Landa. Waltz speaks every language in the movie, and portrays Landa perfectly. You really can't like Waltz since he portrays a Nazi, but hopefully some better roles are headed his way. Some film goers will recognize Diane Krueger, who portrays German actress Bridget von Hammerstark, a spy working for the Allies. Krueger is best known for portraying Nicolas Cage's love interest in National Treasure. There, she seemed pure American. In this film, she speaks her native German perfectly, showing her versatility.So, as the summer ends, I have to say I came in with a bad attitude about the summer of 09 (movie-wise anyway). However, with films like Basterds, The Hangover, and District 9, I think film goers will remember 09's movies for long to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Best Tarantino Flick EVER...,"This is not to say that he won't be able to top it. I have a renewed faith in his abilities in writing and film-making. The sky's the limit. Yesterday, before I went to see this movie, somebody at IMDb criticized it for being ""jingoistic"". Jingoism is a political term. Inglourious Basterds is a SPIRITUAL film, about a SPIRITUAL WAR, and political correctness be DAMNED. What happened in this film was PURE POETIC JUSTICE, and it is a danger to try and dilute that by giving Nazis some sort of courtesy they DO NOT DESERVE, nor would they give us. I encourage ALL JEWS (and all those of Jewish sentiment) to see this movie, and have the time of their lives, like I did. I am going back again because it's THAT GOOD, and the ending wouldn't be the same on a smaller screen. Tarantino, you had me fooled, You Glorious Bastard!!!

Tarantino in top form with brilliant WWII anti-Nazi salute that dares you to look away...,"Quentin Tarantino has taken his anti-Nazi fantasy to new heights with this engrossing dark comedy/fantasy that has ""The Basterds"" (led by BRAD PITT) out for Nazi scalps to add to an ever growing collection. But first and foremost, he has constructed a screenplay that never lets up veering between tension and laughter, and gives several members of his cast a chance at Oscar-winning performances.Foremost among these is CHRISTOPH WALTZ who waltzes off with all of his scenes by playing the ""Jew Hunter"" with subtle bits of characterization that remind me of a young Conrad Veidt at the height of his powers. He never misses an opportunity to give greater depth to his character's personality quirks and sudden changes of mood that always heighten the tension. The farmhouse scene that starts the story rolling is one of the greatest pieces of sustained suspense I've ever seen any director pull, even Hitchcock.My only quibble with the film, in fact, would be the extended bar scene in which a clever plot to trap some Nazi officers goes awry. The director could have tightened the whole sequence with a cut of some ten or more minutes.But who's going to voice complaints when the film is fiendishly clever from start to finish, and so well executed that you leave the theater after being spellbound for the duration of the lengthy story. All of the performances surrounding BRAD PITT and CHRISTOPH WALTZ are pitch perfect and Pitt himself is mighty amusing as the Southern lieutenant who likes to cut Swastikas into the skulls of his German foes.DENIS MENOCHET is superb as the farmer in the film's opening scene, matching the convincing performance of CHRISTOPH WALTZ every step of the way. Not enough praise can be said for the performances Tarantino has gotten from his entire cast and that includes MELANIE LAURENT who has a key role as the only woman who manages to escape the massacre that opens the film. Her interaction with a German officer (DANIEL BRUHL) who is attracted by her is a fascinating one, especially since she has no intention of succumbing to his courteous flirtations.This is definitely putting Tarantino's best foot forward--and if it doesn't end up with several Oscar nominations in both acting and technical categories, I'll be very surprised.Just brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Hillbilly Brad,"Motor-mouth director, Quentin Tarantino is rather good at killing people. Fast. Slow. Or slo-mo. But always inventively. Death may be delayed with deviously droll asides or a bit of creative torture. An ear deliciously sliced off in Reservoir Dogs. An all-girl singalong with action replays of our fatal car-smash for Deathproof. Wedding massacre in Kill Bill. Or death requiring an internal carwash in Pulp Fiction. Inglourious Basterds is no exception. Death is nasty, funny, almost operatic. But never boring. One could almost write an outline based on who dies and how.Brad Pitt (Aldo Raine) leads an unconventional group of Jewish Americans behind enemy lines in World War II. Their fighting style includes Apache Indian tactics to terrorize the Nazis. Graphic violence is mixed with tongue-twisting wittiness in Tarantino's peerless signature style. The dialogue is developed to delay inevitable slaughter with ingenious irreverence. Stock characters are engineered with comic book gusto - and are so colourfully convincing that departures from historical fact seem mere details. A mesmerisingly multilingual special officer, Hans 'The Jew Hunter' Lands (with an award-winning performance from Christoph Waltz) is main antagonist to Brad's 'Basterds', as well as two other camps (French Jew Shosanna, and Churchill's Brits plus Diane Kruger) who similarly plot to blow up Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels and the big bad guys. All in a giant conflagration of dynamite, double-agents, guns and plenty of old nitrate film. This happens at an old cinema which is showing a triumphant Nazi propaganda movie-within-the-movie, coincidentally directed by (Jewish) Eli Roth. Who coincidentally plays baseball-bat-bearing Donny Donnowitz, 'Bear Jew,' and who dispatches Nazis by beating them bloodthirstily to a pulp.When you expect violence, you get just sardonic wink. When you don't, you get full-on, glorious, extended, blood-and-guts. Femme Fatales meanwhile deconstruct stereotypes and inject fashion into daring mise-en-scene and plot-devices. Shosanna (Melanie Laurent)'s enviable red dress kicks off a climactic chapter with feminine visual splendour and predictably subverts the traditional macho of war films. Obscure soundtrack references are abandoned for Bowie's more visceral Cat People which explodes into our eardrums, and the fire of the Fuhrer is threatened with a heavy dose of gasoline. Zoe Bell leaps invisibly from Deathproof leading lady to stunt-double for Laurent and Kruger and the action finale delivers pay-off for a rather wordy middle section.There are more historical and cult film references (of varying levels of difficulty) than you could shake from a shibboleth of war movies. It is very clever. It is very Tarantino. It is very art-house. But is it good entertainment? Stylistically, it recalls Pulp Fiction more than any of the director's other work. But the extended inter-action dialogues sometimes flag more than in his earlier glories. It still has great commercial appeal - fortunately for Mr Weinstein, whose flagging production company needs shekels to offset 500 million dollars of debts. But is it Tarantino's masterpiece that has been ten years in the making? For some, Inglourious Basterds could seem like Tarantino-lite. Perhaps more blood-letting and less word-games would have better satisfied our lust for passive cinema, big stars, three-second cuts and more explosions than obscure eponyms. And for serious cinema-goers, while acknowledging Tarantino's nod to French New Wave, are we not entitled to ask if his films are going to have a point? ""We're French. We respect directors in our country,"" Shosanna quips. Yes, but should they not also demonstrate substance to deserve it? Godard shot a lot of film just to question film-making styles. Only later did he seek to make films of depth. Each of Tarantino's films is like the arrival of a new voice in cinema. Yet having found his voice, what exactly does he want to say? Any new ground with Inglourious Basterds is firmly in the realm of genre manipulation. I didn't feel it said anything new about Jews and Germans. And questions of race or language seem necessary conceits within the film rather than earth-shaking profundities. Tarantino can justify every aspect of the film to anyone who listens. Maybe I'm making ungrateful quibbles. Maybe our children's children will speak of him with reverence. And if you are a Tarantino fan like I am, you will probably watch it twice anyway, whatever it's faults. Does a film need any further justification?",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Surprisingly Fantastic,"After hearing this movie criticized so much on TV and radio i was quite surprised at how good this is. Firstly, a lot of criticism is directed at Mike Myers in his role as the general. Now i presume most of this is coming from people who have never met an English 'Toff' as he is absolutely fantastic and completely believable and i feel i must stand in his defence. From the outset this movie is much darker than i'd have thought and usually Tarantino films are full on one liners and quotes and this movie moves away from his usual style. I think this was brave and a masterful change of direction. Its a great war movie, and not just war movie, it's great full stop. The acting by everyone is fantastic and Christoph Waltz excels himself, although i will admit that i have seen Brad Pitt perform far better. The cinema-photography is good, the dialogue too (and using actors that actually speak the languages is a great touch and something that should be done every time anyway in my opinion), and like Tarantino himself said 'Should these characters and situation have existed in the war then this storyline is highly plausible,' which i think is true. I am not a Tarantino fan, i thought Jackie Brown was over rated, resevior dogs definitely worth seeing but not all that, and kill bill was aimed at young teenagers, this however is a masterpiece and i can't fault it. Well done Quentin and everyone else involved, and to anyone who reads this then go and watch it, it's well worth the money.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Inglorious Basterds: Bastards? Maybe. Inglorious? H*** no.,"I've read so many reviews of this movie that complain about the few action scenes there were in reality when the trailer promised more, but I thought that more scenes like that would have dragged the movie out and took away its biting nature. The thing I liked about this movie was the wit and irony which could only be accomplished through the long conversation scenes. I think the ""modern"" score in this ""period"" piece added to the irony in that we are looking back on history and wishing that this was how things had actually happened.This is a movie that truly deserves to be seen in a theatre. It is a communal event, the way that a good movie should be. Films were designed to be seen in theatres, and this is one movie that would not be the same viewed otherwise, no matter how big your home kino is. I felt connected to the other people sitting around me as all one hundred of us clapped when a dick-head officer (I won't say which one and spoil the fun) FINALLY got shot. We laughed when two characters debated through subtitles over whether to start speaking in English. The facetiousness of this film is just too great to be experienced alone.So, if I were you, I'd go see this movie. I'm probably going to see it again. Yes, it was that good. It made me feel good about being an American (which is something you don't experience too often these days). It made me want to go watch Pulp Fiction for the fiftieth time in a row. And it made me remember that there can be comedy in everything. Even explosions. Especially explosions. In short, this movie just kept getting better with every minute, and although at times it seemed almost too ridiculous, I remembered that that was the point, and if I am not a happier person because of this movie, there is no hope for this world.Read my original review at http://themoviemistress.blogspot.com/2009/08/inglorious- basterds-basterds-maybe.html",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Top notch Tarantino material,"He does it again. The king of blood and gore once again proves that he can keep audiences entertained for almost 2 and a half hours. Inglourious Basterds is a Tarantino classic in many aspects. One, it offers plenty of violence and bloodshed. From Start to finish, heads are blown off, people are shot fatally and scalps are cut off gruesomely. Second, it has Brad freakin' Pitt. Tarantino movies always have one or two stars and a million up and coming actors. In this case, Pitt and Roth shine out while the rest of the supporting cast do an outstanding job of portraying their minor roles (not to forget Melanie Laurent.) Third thing is, the direction is wonderful. The sound effects, the camera shots, all the cinematographic aspects are excellent.In short, Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is an exhilarating action flick that is full of entertainment from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
The best anti-anti-Semite film i have ever seen,"Do not take this film's delicate premise too seriously and you will enjoy the film. I am not Jewish nor am I German.

It is very sad that she does not speak English, because she would give the butter-acting actresses a run for her money.Christoph Waltz was a proper villain, cunning and deceitful.My only warning is that the film is gory, though if you go to watch Tarantino you know blood will be involved.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Tarantino Fails,"Quentin Tarantino has always been throwing out movies which are quite different from the regular ones. But looking at ""IB""(I can never spell it), I'd say this is one of his worst movies. I am definitely surprised by the reviews and ratings this movies has received. I am actually from India. People here are average viewers and not critics. When I was at the theater people were actually moving around and shouting at the long and boring conversations in the movie. What I expected was some action or at least some fun in the likes of Kill Bills or Pulp Fiction. There were two long and boring conversations in the movie which weren't of any importance to the storyline. Not only did they bring dullness but they even added some extra boredom into the movie. And there's more of French and German where people actually spent their time looking at the subtitles rather than the movie itself. But the ending was very good I never expected things to turn in an amazing way. For the normal viewers I would suggest u to ignore it (Atleast the Indian viewers).",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Astounding performances,"Austrian Christoph Waltz' menacing performance ranks among the top 5 of any actor I've ever seen (anyone tried to memorize 30 pages of dialog for a single scene and switch between languages lately?)--- reason alone to see this movie. I read where some reviwers found the scene ""boring"" (?????!). The film itself is thoroughly entertaining. Tarantino delivers phenomenal performances from everyone, wrapped around historical revisionism with an anachronistic score straight out of a spaghetti western (yes, there are innumerable minor historical flubs, but yeesh, history it ain't!). The set design and visuals are remarkable. I had some very minor gripes: Pitt's character lacks depth, to the degree that I felt like some of his stuff was left on the cutting room floor, the Basterds deserved more screen time doing mayhem and Hitler's make up was iffy (contrast that with Mike Meyers' pasty British)---- gaaah! I didn't recognize Rod Taylor as Churchill (!). The visuals are stunning (the image of the screen burning: astounding) and Tarantino is obviously up on his knowledge of WW2 German cinema (Emil Jannings was a cool touch).

If you don't appreciate this movie you are either completely void of emotion, or are over sensitive to brutal violence scenes against the most evil force of the last 500 years. Some of the most well developed characters in the movie are that of the third Reich, but in the end it doesn't matter.

Glorious Quentin,"As the lights of the theater began to brighten and the credits began to pop up I found myself struggling to close my jaw. I guess that's just one of the many side effects you get from watching something as amazing as Inglorious Basterds. The movie is everything it needs to be: A Tarantino movie...that's it! If you like Recervoir Dogs and If you liked Pulp Fiction don't think twice about watching this flick, it's simply Tarantino doing what he does best: long dialogs, amazing action scenes, brilliant characters and an incredibly unrealistic yet attractive situation. Q.T somehow took the secret spices out of all his best movies and combined it into a genre that's old as the event itself but always great to explore: The second world war. The cast is as close as you can get to perfection. I don't understand why people complain about Brad Pitt using the southern accent, I thought it was one of his best performance not simply because he pulls it off so well but because the character is so over the top you can't help but notice him having fun as he recites his lines. The rest of the cast does an amazing job at filling the atmosphere with that intensity and humor that Tarantino has trademarked and you simply can't get enough of any of them. Although it runs for more than two hours, I.B feels short, mainly because the times goes by really fast as you watch it. Many will undoubtedly hate this movie and that's why I suggest the following: if you like Q.T movies (like me) go see this film. If you DON'T like Q.T movies....well...don't go see this film.

Tarantino does World War II with Glourious results!,"I have to admit that I've not always been the biggest fan of everything that Quentin Tarantino has released; but I have always admired the man both for making exactly the films he wants, and for trying his hand at different genres. World War II was not the obvious place to go, and it becomes even less obvious when you take out any ties to actual history and replace it with a black comic surreal style that is fleshed out with absurd characters and intense violence; but Tarantino has done just that, and for me has masterminded the best film of his career! Tarantino himself calls this a 'men on a mission' film, but really it's much more than that and the film would better be described as a World War II themed ensemble. The bulk of the film takes place in 1944 and the stage is set in Nazi-occupied France. A group of Jewish-American soldiers nicknamed 'The Basterds' have been dropped into enemy territory in order to hunt down and kill as many Nazi's as possible - a task they carry out with relish. Meanwhile, it has emerged that the Nazi's are holding a film premiere in a small theatre in France owned by a Nazi hating French-Jewish girl. Naturally, the Basterds soon take an interest in the event - since every major Nazi will be in attendance - but their plans to spoil the Third Reich's evening coincides with those of the theatre owner...who has a revenge of her own in mind.Like most of Tarantino's films, this one is executed in chapters - there are five of them and they all follow in chronological order. Each chapter has a distinct style and purpose and in fact each one could almost be a film within itself. Tarantino sets the benchmark immediately with the first scene - an intense sequence that sees ruthless SS Officer Hans Landa turn up at the house of a French farmer whom he suspects of hiding Jews. This scene is unbelievably intense; Tarantino expertly builds the pressure throughout the scene until it finally reaches boiling point in spectacular fashion. That's basically the crux of the film; each sequence featured is completely gripping and intense, and this makes the two and a half hour running time fly by. The film is peppered with Tarantino's trademark sharp dialogue, (which is featured in English, French, German and Italian!) and it is unbelievably good - almost every line uttered is infinitely quotable, and each of the conversations between the many characters is interesting in its own right. Every scene appears to have been meticulously planned to the finest detail – and there honestly isn't one moment in the entire film that isn't extremely well done. I'm also amazed at how funny the film is – several sequences in this film wouldn't be out of place in a comedy, and yet they blend seamlessly with the intensity and violence on show elsewhere.Throughout his career, Tarantino has excelled at casting the right people for the right roles; and Inglourious Basterds is another success on that front. Brad Pitt is the biggest star name in the cast, his Lieutenant Aldo Raine is a gloriously over the top stereotype and Pitt pins down the role fabulously. However, it is in fact Austrian actor Christophe Waltz who comes out of the film with the most praise; his subtly psychotic portrayal of SS Officer Hans Landa is absolutely brilliant and will surely go down as one of cinema's great villains. The mesmeric French actress Mélanie Laurent also stands out (both for her beauty and acting), and there's also memorable roles for Michael Fassbender, Til Schweiger (his awesomely cool character doesn't feature enough!), Diane Kruger and Hostel director Eli Roth, who gives a surprisingly effective performance as a baseball bat wielding lunatic nicknamed ""The Bear Jew"". All of the central characters are very well written and Tarantino excels at getting the point of all of them across, even though the screen time is generously shared between them all.Rumour has it that Inglourious Basterds was ten years in the making, and I can say that the wait was worth it! I really am struggling to comprehend just how amazingly brilliant this film is. Tarantino has made a movie the likes of which has never been seen before, and if a better movie than this one is released in my lifetime, I will be surprised.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Entertaining but not his best,"I am a huge QT fan so went expecting a lot. My short take is that if you want something as fresh as Pulp Fiction or as eye popping as Kill Bill you will be disappointed. This film plods painfully along in the first half, setting up the later story but not in a slick way like his earlier work. It almost stumbles through the usual QT violence (although less gratuitously than you might expect from the trailers) before flowing nicely for the last half hour. It is like the first half of the film was edited by a student. Brad Pitt is a caricature and most of his band of merry men are not very well developed. The villain is maybe the best fleshed out and most interesting. Not to say Pitt isn't good because you want to laugh every time he opens his mouth and he looks like he's having fun. Not bad by any means but QT and Brad Pitt together set the bar pretty high and I don't think they quite reach it. Pitt's Italian dialogue is memorable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Quentin Tarantino is truly a genius.,"You can call him crazy, you can call him violent, you can call him whatever you want, but I think Quentin has, with this film, proved he is a genius when it comes to making movies.After it premiered at Cannes, many critics were saying it was a hot mess, beautiful and unorganized, entertaining but reckless. I agree with half of that; the film is beautiful, and really truly beautiful not just through the shots (some of which are incredible, no doubt) but through the atmosphere created by the film. It is like Tarantino took what makes him a genius and added a much needed dose of beauty and sophistication while still retaining his edge, his able-to-make-fun-of-itself-with-a-big-ego kinda attitude for his film.I don't need to write a long review. This movie is incredible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
A failure to fuse different movie genres into one feature.,"Tarantino was in my opinion a master in fusing different movie genres into one. But he miserably and painfully fails to do so in Inglourious Bastards (IB).Where in the past in movies like Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill saga there is a constant mix of both comical and gritty scenes which are consistently applied throughout these movies, in IB Tarantino tried to only loosely paste them together. The result is an unfocused string of scenes in which each displays another facet of the different genre. In one scene it's drama and violence followed by one that would have perfectly fitted into a Naked Gun type of film. This simply doesn't work and I found myself being highly irritated watching this failed experiment ruin an otherwise fine movie idea.Another failure of the movie is to not present the viewer dialogs which are actually worth the elaborate time it takes to conclude them. The dialog often proceeds at glacial speeds and likewise just as easily melds and vaporises as time progresses, leaving a pile of scattered moraine in stead of something actually contributing to the, as it already stands, paper thin plot.In the end IB is nothing more than a mismatch of ideas with a steal from Pulp Fiction here and a pinch from Reservoir Dogs there. These rehashed ideas, far superiorly employed in the past, will perhaps fool the younger moviegoer into believing they are watching something fresh and innovative, but people who have seen these other movies by QT surely wont be impressed. The movie ends at two and a half hours featuring long, drawn-out scenes that could have been easily compressed into one and a half. And like with Death Proof, there is far too little pay off to warrant stealing people's time and attention over these all-heard-before and talky routines.Through most of the duration of the film I contemplated suggesting to my friend, who was clearly not being entertained either, to leave, but I decided to see it through till the end. Suffice to say I have never been so glad the ending credits finally rolled so I could get up and make my way to the exit.The pro's:Excellent acting (apart from a horrible Pitt who was clearly miscast) and good cinematography in a film with some solid and interesting ideas.The con's:The film's criminally in need of an editor and serves perhaps a bit too much dialog in a foreign language for the average moviegoer to swallow. Not enough suspense to justify bludgeoning the audience with endless routines of mere dialog and no character development to make the audience care about whatever outcome these scenes, and ultimately the whole movie, might bring.3.5/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
When a parody becomes its own movie,"When I say parody, I mean this movie literally takes a piss on the history of Nazi-occupied France.

Everything from the dialogue to the characters to the overall structure of the story, this historical flick means business.Upon watching the very fist scene, I was digging my nails into my palms. Christoph Waltz delivered one of the most terrifying antagonists ever written in the most amazing fashion. Tarantino almost effortlessly grips you through creating incredibly tense scenes, almost making you beg the get it over with while still wanting more.Tarantino hits almost every spot when it comes to character dynamics - whether its rivals, leaders, lovers, or strangers - characters are extremely well utilized to create the most intriguing relationships that continue to drive the story. However, I did personally feel that the Inglorious Basterds were a bit too laid back and gave too much comic relief. Felt slightly awkward, especially since the movie title is literally named after them. Sure, you may need a break from those tense scenes, but maybe more depth to their characters would have made it easier to root for them.Overall, this film will suck you into the chair and give you the most agonizing pleasure conceivable, so sit back and enjoy it for what it is!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Quentin Tarantinos crazy World War II show.,"After my second attempt to watch this film, i have to hold up my hands and admit that i was wrong. On first attempt, i felt the film was handicapped by Tarantinos writing style, i felt as though the characters in the film all sounded like Quentin which i felt was a problem. The second time i saw it, i relaxed a lot more and just let the film play. I must say, i enjoyed the strands of the story very much and the individual set pieces were very well acted and directed. The use of language was also very effective, French, German and English all play a crucial role in the film at various points. The performances are also a lot of fun and huge credit must go to Christoph Waltz for what is a the best depiction of a Nazi since Ronald Lacey in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. So, another big success for Quentin Tarantino, and a film that plays a lot better if you just forget he is in the directors chair and just enjoy it for all its madcap, gory brilliance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Such great expectations...,"So disappointed that I could cry ... I expected controversy, free but clever violence , dark humor, sarcasm, fascinating characters, memorable, the kind you condemn and admire in silence, intelligent dialog,.. a lot of dialog, with apparent calm and timeouts spread throughout the whole and much much more. Can't really say that these were missing completely but they weren't really there either. Tarantino's presence was felt and recognized only in the first chapter, to which I have nothing to reproach, it is clearly and indisputably the climax of his art in this movie. So much has been written about this movie, so many were excited and so many cheered and praised it. It just makes you sad. It's a painful proof that very few can recognize and enjoy the genius of Tarantino. He became a standard, a pattern in which the world situates him, no longer standing to judge the choice, a pattern which can already exist without the help of its creator, and also without any extra effort from his part. Any movie he makes, will have a default label, and the people would hardly even wait to watch it before assigning it. Well, for us to be able to enjoy original Tarantino creations, and to be able to boost him into making the effort to be ... himself, we have to cross over our hearts and give up that already prepared label and admit it when he fails. It's not a film entirely unsuccessful, it has its moments, the usual irony and humor, less subtle here, but present, although that only makes me give credit to the author's cleverness, but not to his genius. Oh, and to be mentioned two characters that made an unforgettable good impression: Christoph Waltz (Land - genius actor) and Melanie Laurent (Shosanna) plus Michael Fassbender (Hicox) who had too little time on film(a pity).",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
I'm confused...  Which one is the evil side again?,"The message of the film is clear. Americans can do everything better than the ""evil"" ones of the world: Americans are tougher than you, smarter, more clever, fight harder, and you'd better believe if we can't torture more sadistically than you too. Of course, as a rile-up-the-righteous-masses kind of film, it succeeds rather well. However, in demonstrating the ""better than thou"" virtues of the Jewish-American soldiers of the film's focus, the film paints them as reprehensibly worse than their enemy. They are committing atrocities as bad as their enemy, all in the name of fighting evil. The sickening and disgusting depiction of the actions (scalping, etc.) of this renegade group certainly does not help endear viewers to their cause (unless the viewer is either well propagandized or sick in the head).Remember that in real history, no allied forces knew of the Nazi atrocities until near the end of the war, when the first internment camps were found. Therefore, this group of soldiers would be brutalizing Germans out of pure sadistic pleasure, not yet knowing the reasons which we as viewers today apply retrospectively to rationalize their actions. Most today have been sufficiently preconditioned to seeing the Nazis as the evil oppressors, and to seeing Jewish people as perpetually afflicted, so that any outburst of evil by Jewish soldiers is reflexively taken as a 'hurrah!', root-for-the-underdog moment. However, in complete contrast to its supposed goal, this film does not present the virtues of liberators, but rather the virtues that brought us Abu Ghraib and Guantanimo. The presentation of this film is one thing the American nation can well do without.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Review from 2015, A Perfect Movie","I remember that this was my second Tarantino film. A few days before, I watched Reservoir Dogs with my brother, introducing me to Tarantino movies, and I was ecstatic that my Dad agreed to take me to Inglourious Basterds since the trailers made it look like a good revenge film. I was surprised that the film went beyond this notion and was simply fantastic overall, leaving me smiling as I left the theater.Let me just say, the early trailers for this film are deceiving. They make it appear that the premise is simply Brad Pitt and his men killing Nazis in a brutal manner throughout. This is definitely not the case, and actually touches on subjects I never would have imagined. Tarantino shows his knowledge for German cinema throughout as the main character of the B plot - Shoshanna - comes to own a cinema, and the Nazis are dealing with where they should hold the premiere for the new film by Joseph Goebbels - Nation's Pride.The villain, played by Christoph Waltz, is such an amazing character to watch. At certain points, he exhibits intellect and detective skills near Sherlock Holmes levels, and at other times he makes us laugh with how out of touch he is with certain customs. The first twenty minutes of the film is almost fully dedicated to this Hans Landa, and it proves to be among the best sequences Tarantino has ever written.I fully believe this film had a better screenplay than Django Unchained, but to me, it makes sense that the academy went with The Hurt Locker for best original screenplay. It makes sense not because The Hurt Locker fully deserved it, but because The Hurt Locker was a film that this country needed in 2009 to shape our perspective on the war being fought over seas.While Inglourious Basterds is not an accurate depiction of World War II or one of the most important World War II films, it is certainly one of the most fun to watch. It is tense, funny, crowd-pleasing, and at the same time it is a very smart movie with well-developed characters, an intricate plot, meta characteristics, and above all, extremely well-written. This now holds the spot of my 2nd favorite film by Quentin Tarantino, behind Pulp Fiction.10/10This review was written in 2015.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Arguably Quentin's best work,"I could rave on about this movie, but i won't. I believe this film from start to finish is flawless. You have to at least respect the level of creatively Tarantino is able to portray for this time periodWould highly recommend this movie to anyone who knows what they're getting their selves into when it comes to the Tarantino style of Directing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Raw excellence.,"Inglourious Basterds is nothing short of a masterpiece. The unique Tarantino style: taking a walk with history, historical characters and events and melting it down into a over-the-top cinematic masterpiece.That what makes Inglourious Basterds great is first this unique style. Tarantino ignores the rules of cinema and creates unique and unorthodox characters and plot. The score is very bizarre, but spot on. In one scene the music can change from modern hardrock into a very old school 30's thriller movie score. And yes, they pull it off.Also the acting is excellent. Christopher Walz in his role as Hans Landa will haunt you for a long time leading the long list of terrific actors in the flick. People that were negative about the Nazi characters saying they were 'sympathising with them' really didn't get the point. In the very first scene the character of Walz is established as a highly cunning, brutal and despicable character. Comparing jews to rats in a skin-crawling way. Also the way the 'jew-hunter' practices his job is simply horrifying, because he always wears a smile on his face while mentally torturing other characters. This mind-messing way of putting a character out there is not only original but also extremely brilliant.This movie has (just as many other Tarantino films) the feeling of a comic book, patched with unorthodox scenes and angles, mixed with a bizarre, brutal alternative to reality. Long dialogue in the many thrilling scenes will leave you on the edge of your seat. People that hate this kind of movies don't see the art in this 'devil may care' way of making movies.This is not a history movie. This is another unique view on making movies by Tarantino. Hate it or love it. This is excellence. There are many who love it, because I remember watching this in the theater and every scene people were cheering. Give this film a try, you might just love it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Good but somewhat overblown.,"The movie is a bit long, drags in the middle and has a corny, hokey comic book story style, nevertheless the movie is good but definitely not great. Instead of an action packed movie focusing on a bunch of angry Jewish soldiers going after vicious, unrepentant Nazis, the audience is given a complex story with plots and subplots that are pursued to the point that the Basterds are almost shunted to the sidelines. There is solid acting, with Brad Pitt demonstrating a definite flair for comedy and Christopher Waltz giving a commendable performance as a suave but sinister SS colonel, but the muddled, absurd story is what keeps this movie from achieving anything approaching cinematic greatness. Solid acting coupled with a goofy story does not make for good cinema. This movie also continues the now time honored tradition of bashing Germans, which is nothing new in Hollywood cinema. Once again the Germans are portrayed as hapless buffoons. Yet despite the fact that they started and lost the war, and that it is highly tempting to mock their outrageous conduct, it is a stretch to present the Germans as bumbling fools. They might have been fools but they were far from bumbling and what they did in Word War Two was not a laughing matter. If someone wants to make a movie about inglorious basterds then make a movie about inglorious basterds and place them squarely on center stage where they belong.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Tarantino takes on Hitler, no wonder so many people chose to hate this movie.","Tarantino takes on Hitler, no wonder so many people chose to hate this movie. Baffling however, why they chose to watch it in the first place as it's likely very certain that they knew they were not going to enjoy it.A quick scan through user reviews here on IMDb will show you an unbeieveble amount of reviews with 1/10 ratings claiming it's 'one of the worst films I have ever seen' or 'complete waste of time and money'.Why watch a movie from a director you don't like, complain about violence, long drawn out dialogue scenes and unorthodox story- telling of a controversial historical topic? Why complain about plot holes and rate is as 1/10 because of this? People don't like Tarantino yet they still pay their hard earned money and spend their precious time watching his movies at the cinema simply to go home and give their two cents worth of how awful it was and how unintelligent you have to be to be entertained by such garbage.Inglorious Basterds may not be perfect but it is exactly what I expected from a Tarantino film. It's violent yet not as violent as some of his other works, some of the scenes are graphic but nothing that I would class as morbidly excessive. The dialogue is impressive in stops and starts with a couple of the scenes in the movie being among his best work in terms of dialogue, the opening scene in particular was so tense and perfectly constructed that it truly did showcase Tarantino's skill at creating such great film. Setting the bar so high in the opening scene had a slight negative impact on the rest of the movie though as the remainder of the film couldn't live up to that first scene on the milk farm.Split into 5 chapters which is essentially 5 long scenes, Tarantino tells the story of a Nazi-occupied France during World War 2, following the harrowing journey of 'The Jew Killer', the backlash of the 'Inglorious Basterds' and the story of a Jew with cold revenge on her mind. There is no sole focus on any one character as the story isn't told through anyone's perspective, the story simply moves through the different characters scene by scene.We are lead to believe from the movie title and trailer that the movie will focus completely around The Inglorious Basterds. This isn't the case and they act as a cog in a big wheel of different characters, they never really feel like the main people, we are given little back story to them and develop no emotional attachment to them. Brad Pitt was the poster boy for this movie yet he didn't feature half as much as I thought he would and sadly the screen time he did get was quite disappointing. His character wasn't very interesting and contained far too many clichés, often looking out of place and struggling to adapt completely to his role. Some of his script did however add some humor to the movie but the better scenes in the movie were ones which he wasn't a part of. Christoph Waltz was fascinating as 'The Jew Hunter', his calm and somewhat friendly persona makes him so edgy giving you the feeling that he could do anything at any moment. His performance was completely faultless which was by far the strongest aspect of Inglorious Basterds and the best scenes of this movie are ones which he was in.There are some big plot holes in this movie, which i will not go into as they would contain big spoilers. The plot holes didn't stop me enjoying this movie though as it isn't a movie of realism, you would be a fool to believe that Inglorious Basterds was trying to even attempt that. I don't necessarily think it is down to lazy writing either, I personally think that some of the plot conveniences were purely to move the movie along. Tarantino may have stuggled to fit all of the story he wanted to tell into the two and a half hour run-time and in doing so, possibly in the trimming down process to keep it a respectable length, some of the the plot lines got a little choppy and dysfunctional.Overall, Inglorious Basterds is a movie made for my tastes so my rating will be high. I can see it isn't a perfect movie and I can acknowledge these flaws however I wouldn't be telling the truth if I said that I didn't enjoy it. The time flew by and i found myself completely captivated in the story, the tense scenes made me tense, the humor hit the spot, the violence was graphic and uncut and the climax to the movie felt fitting and powerful.Tarantino creates a unique movie experience on a topic which was never going to please anyone. He made complete fiction out of one of the most notoriously disgusting people in the history of the world and did it completely on his terms. I have no issues with that whatsoever.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
From annoyingly isolated to cynically satisfying,"I do not consider Quentin Tarantino to be the godfather of auteur-driven cinema nor do I consider him to be one of the men who continue to ""ruin"" it, so to speak. I consider him to be a director with a solid style, a talent for witty, eccentric dialog, a natural at erecting characters that we like for their quirky societal views and their strange talking points, and overall, the non-linear coherency of it all. What I like about Tarantino can easily be turned into what I do not like about Tarantino without changing a single word above. After viewing Grindhouse: Death Proof, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs, I was convinced that the man was a breath of refreshing cinematic air; a man more concerned with the things in cinema that can easily create a wonderful cacophony of energy and spunk. But after viewing Inglourious Basterds, my enthusiasm for the man hasn't lessened but came to a stunning, unexpected trip back to reality realizing like many other directors working in the medium, the man is not perfect.Perhaps in the right eyes, Inglourious Basterds is a perfect movie. I suspect that everyone who will see it or has seen it has emerged with completely different viewpoints. That's the beauty of a Tarantino film, again, one person can like specific things about the film and love it for those reasons and another can point out those same little things and hate the movie just for that. Dissent is a beautiful thing, and it seems that's one of the many things that ""The Tarantinian Formula"" intends to do.The film begins rather maturely as we are presented with a title card saying that the film is set in the Nazi-run areas of France, and then we see Colonel Hans Landa (also known as ""The Jew Hunter,"" played by Christoph Waltz) arrive on a desolate country farm to meet farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa is going around to different locations to try and find out if people are hiding Jews to protect them from Nazi persecution, and after a lengthy discussion with Perrier, the farmer informs Landa that he does in fact have Jews hiding in the house and Landa's goons immediately try to kill them under the floorboards of the house. The scene is particularly tense and gratifying, mainly because of its constantly unsettling nature and intimate shots, and serves as one of the best scenes in the film.From there on out, we are greeted with a number of other scenarios seemingly taken from all over the grid. Now we are three years in the future and see Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) giving a mean pep talk to his boys, eight Jews recruited to accomplish one assignment; to kill Nazis, or in Raine's southern, twangy accent, ""nat-zees."" Among Raine's crew is Donny ""Bear Jew"" Donowitz (Eli Roth), a rather unnecessary, obnoxious caricature who is used as the violent soul of the whole operation. In a later scene, we seem him viciously beat a man's head in with a baseball bat, even after he breaks his neck upon being struck the first time. Certain scenes like that do not offend me, particularly, but I question their presence in a film dominated by dialog and sequences set in bars or elegant locations.Another subplot, arguably the most interesting, involves a German sniper (Daniel Brühl) striking a friendship with a young Jewish woman who owns a French cinema (Mélanie Laurent). And another subplot involves a German film critic named Lieutenant Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender), who will become involved with a secret operation to bomb the premiere of the Nazi propaganda film the German sniper is a part of.Now that we've got the continuously twisty, absurd narrative out of the way, we have the content and the aesthetics to explore. For starters, one can not deny, this is probably the strangest work of Tarantino yet, drastically different from his previous installments, for the sole reason that it does not rely much on the things that I listed above. He breaks form, creating long, somewhat poetic dialog scenes to set the mood, rather than the cut-throat, bloody, unapologetic goriness the trailer promised us. The problem with Tarantino, which even existed in Pulp Fiction, a film I awarded a perfect rating of four stars to, is that once the man gets started, he doesn't know when to stop. Certain scenes become long and winded, many of them overstaying their welcome, and consistently thriving on repetitive, uninteresting chatter that obscures the purpose and the enjoyment one anticipates walking in.On the plus side, the film has some of the finest, rawest performances of the 2009 year. Brad Pitt gives a fine, no-nonsense performance as Raine, Eli Roth is capable as ""Bear Jew,"" and Michael Fassbender, once more, is continuously wonderful in one of the many diverse roles of his career. Yet the highlight here is the merciless, unmatchable, truly divine work of brilliance done by Christoph Waltz as ""The Jew Hunter."" His performance alone elevates the film to the point where when he's on screen, we forget all the monotony and watery dialog we've just sat through.Consistent readers of my work will take note that I do greatly appreciate dialog in my films. But even I have a limit. There is enough dialog here to sustain two or three films, and that's a sign of a prolific, uncompromising auteur. If only the dialog had been easier to listen to, rather than just a good chunk of it being nonsensical, irrelevant banter would we have had some substantial meat to this story. This is a film that fluctuates from annoyingly isolated from its audience to cynically satisfying during a majority of its highlighting scenes. For a Tarantino fan, I can't expect they'll look for anything less.Starring: Brad Pitt, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender, and Christoph Waltz.

The first IMDb disappointment ever,"I don't usually trust reviews and ratings, but IMDb had never failed me, until now. I used to think that enough intelligent people vote over time, to get the rating about right. I've changed my mind.I don't care one bit about the brilliant performance of the SS officer, the colors, the pace, or the jokes. The message is so disturbingly wrong, that it trumps any of the positive aspects of this piece of trash. If over 90% of the people who watched the film can not see anything wrong with it, then this world is certainly doomed.I have enjoyed many of Tarantino's films, regardless of the violence. Up until now, the violence was due to personal and largely justified revenge, or part of the character of very sick individuals. Putting Vermacht foot soldiers in the same basket with SS and Gestapo officers is just plain wrong. I wonder how this film would be rated if it were about a Palestinian squad scalping Jews or marking their foreheads with the star of David.These issues are not to be trifled with. Not all Germans were Nazis deserving the wrath of Jehovah. Any attempt at generalizations about a large group of people should be condemned, first of all by the Jewish people, who know what discrimination and persecution is. Hateful films like this would barely make it as war-time propaganda and you hail it as one of the best films of all time? I would like to tell you what I think of you, but I bet my review would not make it through the editors, so I will simply suggest you watch it again after you've grown up.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

So that's how the war should've ended!,"Tarantino presents challenging work. This is no less challenging than his previous efforts. There is a multi-faceted lot, with two key events coming together at the end of the story. And the film is a story, set in WW2 but not as we might know it! And this works well. Back to the film.The characterisations of the key characters are stereotypical, and this is not a bad thing! It clarifies motive and method for the film. The SS officer, Colonel Hans Lander, is played across the full range of clown to chilling murderer very well.Action sequences are well staged, and the build up to them very effective. The blood and gore often presented in Tarantino films is present in this one too.The film is travelling towards the assassination of Hitler and his cronies. The method by which this'll be done is then developed with the plot centering on the showing of a film celebrating an outrageous feat of arms on the part of a German soldier.The French girl who owns the cinema chosen for this event being the Jewish girl who escaped from Lander at the start of the film.The remainder of the film covers the assassination attempt at the cinema. It is splendidly shot, and in a style which stands up to multiple viewings! But I'll not tell you what happens!Lander takes off with the basterds at end of the film, getting his just deserts!The film tells its story well, and the violence featured reminds the viewer that war is terrible, but that people are responsible for that frightfulness.

Tarantino's WW2 drama is unorthodox and spectacular,"Nazi-occupied France, June 1944. Lt. Aldo Raine leads a squad of crack Jewish US Army soldiers deep behind enemy lines. Their job: killing Germans, as many as possible. Meanwhile Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels is about to premier his latest propaganda film at a cinema in Paris. All the high-ranking Nazis will be there, making it a perfect target for the Raine's squad. Meanwhile, the manageress of the cinema, a Jew whose entire family was wiped out by the Nazis, has similar plans.Superb film. Not your average WW2 drama - this is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino so it was never going to be conventional. From rewriting history to the use of David Bowie's ""Cat People"" in a scene, there is nothing conventional and very little historically reverent about this movie, but Tarantino makes it work, and work spectacularly.Great action and great plot. As is his custom, Tarantino methodically builds the plot and the tension yet the film doesn't drag. It is engaging throughout thanks to Tarantino's fantastic dialogue and a wonderful sense of menace and impending action.On that note, although Brad Pitt is billed as the lead actor, the star of the show, for my mind, is Christoph Waltz as the cunning and sadistic SS Colonel. Superb performance, part charm, part menace. It's his fiendish charm with the sense that he's building up to something despicable that makes the non-action side so riveting. Waltz deservedly won Best Supporting Actor at the 2010 Oscars.Brad Pitt, Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger also put in great performances. The remaining cast is star-studded: Michael Fassbender, Eli Roth, Til Schweiger, Daniel Bruhl. Mike Myers, Rod Taylor and Lea Seydoux also make brief appearances.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
It is what it is...,"When Inglorious Basterds came into theatres last summer, I studiously avoided it, like all other Tarantino films. But after some pestering, I finally sat down and watched it, and to my great surprise, made it through the entire movie with only a moderate amount of eye-rolling.I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that lead characters, aside from Pitt, were not American actors and Tarantino had done the one thing that Hollywood has been avoiding for, well ever; cast foreign stars where they were required, instead of having American stars butcher the foreign languages and the accents.However I have to agree with the critics concerning the French dialogue, you can very, very clearly tell it was written by someone who does not speak French. As for the German dialogue, I'm not sure but I can only assume the same.On the flip side, Christopher Waltz's performance made this film. If I had to recommend one reason for seeing Inglorious Basterds, it would be his performance. He is believing, moving and quite frightening.But one of the things that irks me the most is the title. Even if Tarantino had a reason for spelling Basterds wrong, it's still annoying. The second being the bloodshed. Yes, it is a war film. Yes, that means there will be blood, somewhere. But in true Tarantino style, it's mostly needlessly shown beatings and blood. Although I was pleasantly surprised by some of his more artistic choices vis-a-vis the scenic shots.Also irritating is the lack of back-story on the characters. Except for a look at Shoshanna's past and a few glimpse's of the others, we have nothing to go on about the characters, which makes for frustrating conclusions come the climax.It is what it is... a Tarantino film. I don't put much stock in that, and I personally would not recommend this film for more than something to watch before a better movie comes on/out.Oh, and finally, whoever did the music for this movie should be shot. It's that bad.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
The Masterpiece,"Inglorious Bastards is a cinematographic masterpiece. It has a fantastic plot, where history is recreated to a point that makes you think it couldn't be done, bringing this movie to another level. Alongside this, there are spectacular dialogs, most of them evolved by great tension, since most of them are done between enemies, or between persons that have animosity between them, which I believe was one of the great challenges writing this movie. Also, Tarantino took a great decision, when he chose to put actors playing characters from their country, since it enriches the movie, and plays it is his favor, creating scenes based on the language barrier.But to talk about this movie is to talk about it's actors performances, in particular a German actor, named Christoph Waltz. In an interview he said he had the opportunity to play one of the greatest characters ever written. I believe he is right. And the most amazing, is that he was able to be up to that character.

6/10 is still a positive rating. Keep that in mind.,"Please keep in mind that 6/10 or 3/5 is still a positive rating, a lot of people seem to think that giving a 6/10 means you don't like the film. I like inglorious basterds and think it's a good movie. But I have a fair amount of issues.Most of my enjoyment comes from Christoph Waltz interacting with people and ""gorlami"", which left me wanting more for lots of the fairly long runtime.I don't like the story very much at all, I didn't care much for Shosanna's storyline, it dragged quite a bit in my opinion and the Fredrick Zoller thing was unnecessary and shoved into the story for whatever reason. I also don't enjoy the basement scene, this scene is frequently regarded to be the best or one of the best in the movie. I was bored for most of the sequence, I love Fassbender's performance but that wasn't enough to save the scene.I don't connect with any of the characters involved and they are not developed much or well. My favourite character is Hans Landa but because he is fun to watch not because he is well fleshed out or relatable. I also didn't know who I was supposed to care about and not, I don't care about anyone as they are obviously bad people. I don't want to read further into this movie to figure out whether this is a statement on the war or humanity as a whole just cause I don't want to so that's all I'll say about that.The rest of my issues are not as significant so I'll run through them quickly here. I think the shot composition and cinematography is really boring, bar the opening scene. The makeup looks very fake, Aldo's scar, the German scalps, basically any wound except for bullet wounds. Finally we don't get a sense of the grand scale of the war, I know this is not the point of the movie, it's about these smaller actions that ended with the same result anyway, which I don't have a problem with. But giving the war a more dangerous feel would the tense scenes, like the basement scene, feel more tense. I didn't care about what was happening because I didn't feel a real sense of danger. This might just be me but that's fine.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Glorification of violence and unnecessary reanimation of old hostilities!,"Yesterday, watched ""Inglorious Basterds"" together with my boyfriend and as a German, I really have to comment about it! My expectations were really quite high because I had read that all the characters would be portrayed by actors of the matching nationality, which I regarded as a brilliant idea! I also knew that the story wouldn't be historically correct, but I didn't bother. In my opinion, the cinema is free to alter history, as long as it's good entertainment.Well, the movie started with the scene about the French guy being visited by SS Colonel Landa - brilliant acting, especially on the part of Christoph Waltz, good story and I loved the switching of languages. (I was a little bit disappointed though that the Americans didn't speak English in the German version, but also German - why not be consistent and let every character speak their mother tongue? - Perhaps that would be to daring for a mainstream movie and you can't expect the average audience to read that many subtitles? I would have appreciated it to hear English spoken in the movie!) Anyway, so far I enjoyed the movie, but the moment those ""Inglorious Basterds"" entered the screen, that soon changed. Brad Pitt's speech full of hatred already made me frown. Take Nazi's scalps? Be as brutal as possible? - Excuse me, are those the guys I am supposed to sympathize with? - Okay, I thought, it's a Quentin Tarantino movie, so you're bound to hear a lot of language and and see graphic violence. I really enjoyed the plot line with the Jewish cinema owner and the Nazi officer / actor and the whole movie would have been brilliant, if they had just made this the main plot and left out the whole stupid Inglorious Basterds thing! What really gave me the creeps was this scene with the German soldier being beaten to death with a baseball batter. Don't get me wrong, I'm not generally against portraying violence in movies, but it always depends on the context! And it's really unacceptable to portray this violent execution as fun, with cheering and laughing people around, without ever questioning if this is the right thing to do. The ""Inglorious Basterds"" are the characters the audience is supposed to sympathize with because, obviously, they don't want to be on the side of the bad Nazis, though you see them committing much less bloody crimes on screen than the Basterds. Therefore the audience is supposed to enjoy the beating and take it as a righteous action! Pure mischievous joy! I can see all those teenagers laughing who the next day on the school ground stand by a fight, film it with their mobile phone and then upload it on youtube to have a laugh with millions of users who are just as stupid as themselves! I really couldn't believe it! Come on, in which century are we living, Americans? - Do you first need to have your very own Third Reich before you finally get the fact that such violence is NEVER EVER justified? When will you get it that you stop being the good guys the moment you take up the methods of the bad guys and use them against them? - It's the same all over: Iraq, Abu Ghraib, Inglorious Basterds! It is NOT funny to kill and mutilate people, whatever it is they did! Of course movies can portray people who think killing is funny, but they should never portray them as being good and right! And especially not in the context of the Third Reich! And by the way, does there have to be a ""funny"" insult against Germans every five minutes? - Why do you so reanimate the old hostilities of World War II? I thought we were over that! In Germany, we have learned our lesson of tolerance and peacefulness. Everyone who enjoys the movie has proved they haven't learned it yet!Though I certainly don't sympathize with Nazis, the truest moment of the movie was the scene at the premiere of the movie ""Stolz der Nation"". Three American members of the ""Basterds"" tried to pretend to be Italians because they thought the Nazis wouldn't notice that they can't really speak Italian. But then Nazi officer Landa turned out to speak Italian fluently, to which Brad Pitt's character could only reply ""Grazie"". I just thought: ""Serves you right, ignorant Americans!"" I mean, they have no clue about Germans or Italians or Frenchmen, but they just think they can go into some other countries and kill a lot of people and have fun making a bloody mess in the presumed name of justice.It's really a pity that a movie with such brilliant ideas has to be so awful, just because it glorifies violence and encourages intolerance! Inglorious Basterds certainly didn't improve my opinion about America and it certainly doesn't improve anybody's opinion about Germany. In recent years, Germany has produced sensitive storys about conflicts of conscience like ""The Reader"" - the U.S. gives us senseless beating and cheering about violence! Congratulation, Tarantino, for your contribution to international understanding! :(",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
The Alternate History of WWII,"Quentin Tarantino. Love him or hate him, there's no denying the man is an auteur who has changed modern filmmaking. His films ooze a peculiar flair that, more often that not, is reminiscent of the ""style over substance"" breed of movies from yesteryear. Tarantino has a dark sense of humor that tends to balance out his absurdly complex (though sometimes serious) plots, and, thankfully, he's got an eye for characterization that tends to save his movies from oblivion.Though I enjoyed his recent Death Proof, it was somewhat underwhelming when viewed in the context of his other goliath, game-changing offerings (though that was the whole point, I still felt there was more that could've been done–and Death Proof is one instance where I think he let his ""too cool for school"" dialogue get away from him). But I digress; we're here to talk about Inglourious Basterds, a movie that's had a lot of buzz surrounding it ever since it went into pre-production.Basterds is unlike anything Tarantino has ever tackled, yet it's strikingly similar to what I consider two of his greatest films–Kill Bill (Vols. 1 & 2). It explores the familiar theme of revenge, has the same ""Chapter"" scene dividers, and even recycles much of the same music for its soundtrack. Some might view this as lazy filmmaking, but I think it's a sign that Tarantino is starting to mature as a director. Like all noteworthy filmmakers with certain stylistic hallmarks, he seems to have found his rhythm, as it were, and has crafted a movie that's more emotionally resonant than any of his previous offerings.The opening scene, for example, is simultaneously understated and absorbing. It features Tarantino's trademark dialogue—as do virtually all other scenes—and it gives all of the players involved a chance to fully flesh out their characters. To avoid spoilers I won't go into detail, but suffice it to say that it'll have your heart thumping; it's also immediately evident that Tarantino has become a master of wringing every drop of emotion from his actors and actresses.Then, in the very next breath, we're thrust into the realm of Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and his squad of Jewish-American soldiers known as ""The Basterds."" Their mission is simple: to brutally murder Nazis and spread fear throughout the Third Reich. Forget what you know about the history behind World War II—though there is apparently a kernel of truth as to what inspired the plot, Inglourious Basterds is, on the whole, a completely fictitious endeavor. While this has upset some critics, it is, in many ways, a credit to Tarantino as a writer, as this decision causes us to remain on our toes throughout the entire 153 minute runtime (because, of course, we have absolutely no idea how the events in the film will unfold).But I digress. Let's return to our previous topic—that regarding the violence found in Inglorious Basterds. As you'd imagine, Tarantino allows Raine and company to accomplish their assigned mission by forcing us to watch the most gruesome of occurrences (such as captured German soldiers being scalped, knifed, and beaten to death with a baseball bat). While the subject matter automatically calls for an undisclosed amount of violence, there are times—as with his other films—where it's obvious that Tarantino is indulging his own insatiable desire to douse the screen with blood. The question, then, is this: Is all of that gory violence a bad thing?Essentially, Tarantino has used the backdrop of World War II to create a combination revenge flick/dark comedy—but Inglourious Basterds is so much more. What makes this stand out from his other movies is the fact that it's often deeply serious—much more so than I would've imagined, in fact. Many critics have found the movie disrespectful because of the liberties it takes with history and its comic nature. I take some contention with this assessment. Based on the emotion present here (and the care with which its so skillfully woven into what would otherwise be a blood and guts revenge story), it's clear that a fair degree of ""respect"" was front and center on the director's mind as he worked on this uncharacteristically affecting piece. Really, Basterds is a sort of non-comedy that knows how to keep its very adult themes serious without being so serious that they're steeped in an inaccessible gloom that makes viewers feel cold and detached from the things happening on- screen.My only problem with the movie has to do with the shift in tone found at the ending (I'm talking the end-endthe very end). Based on the level of maturity found throughout the bulk of the movie, it felt just a little too out of place—just a little too whimsical, perhaps—and it seems to undermine an especially powerful scene that appears only moments before.On the whole, though, Inglourious Basterds is superb. It's got that certain Tarantino flair, and, if you can handle the gore, you'll see a smartly written movie that's both entertaining and emotionally gripping.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
I'd like a glass of milk or whatever the heck Martin Wuttke was on,"'INGLORIOUS BASTERDS' was directed by Quentin Tarantino and stars Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Melanue Laurent. ​It is the first year of Germany's occupation of France. Allied officer Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) assembles a team of Jewish soldiers to commit violent acts of retribution against the Nazis, including the taking of their scalps. He and his men join forces with Bridget von Hammersmark, a German actress and undercover agent, to bring down the leaders of the Third Reich. Their fates converge with theatre owner Shosanna Dreyfus, who seeks to avenge the Nazis' execution of her family.Inglorious Basterds is a fantastic war movie. No it is not overrated. It is rated perfectly as far as I'm concerned and is one of Tarantino's best movies. Christoph Waltz is god damn incredible in this movie and provides a truly chilling, milk obsessed villain that will go down in the greatest of cinema. I'm not exaggerating. Tarantino was at his best with this retelling of history. You know what, screw it. This IS how WW2 went down. Tarantino has convinced me of that. I defy anyone to prove me otherwise!Let me break it down how incredible this movie is. The story is a genius intertwining of two entirely separate stories that mould into one during a simple five chapter story. This movie is so well written that it changed history. Tarantino convinced me that this was exactly how WW2 went down. The ending is perfect and mirrors the entire movie as a whole. Well done Tarantino, you done did good!To top of the excellent story, we have a stellar star studded cast to pimp out Tarantino's epic war movie. Honestly, if Christoph 'The Milkman' Waltz didn't at least get NOMINATED for an Oscar in this movie, I would have started a riot. This was probably one of the best performances in modern movie history and sends shivers down your spine. If one man can make me fear him for ordering a glass of milk, he deserves the Oscar trophy to be redesigned after him. Accompanying Walkz' Hans Landa is Brad Pitt's awesome Aldo Raine who, while having a smaller role than expected, elevated the movie above it's previous pedestal and made me think of Brad Pitt whenever I think of WW2. The jury is still out on whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. Diane Kruger was also great as Bridger Von Hammersmark as was Michael Fassbender as Archie Hirox and Daniel Brühl as the creepy Frederick Zoller. Melanie Laurent was good as Shossana Dreyfus. Martin Wuttke was on steroids or something as Adolf Hitler. Despite possible drug use, he was great as the most evil man to grace this Earth; good look adding that to your resume.This movie is also nearly technically flawless. The effects were great and the inclusion of blood and gore was, while not necessary, a welcome addition that was the definition of Tarantino style. I will say, however, that some shots and scenes were overly comical and it took me out of the movie for a brief short moments.One minor, minuscule gripe is with the dialogue. Not to say it was bad, it wasn't but the movie is VERY dialogue heavy and due to the majority of it being in foreign languages, it could sometimes be difficult too keep up with the subtitles and could be sometimes frustrating to decipher what was being said. Probably not an issue for many but was certainly one for me.You can dislike this movie all you want, I don't care. But if you dare say this movie was made up and FICTIONAL(?), I will hunt you down and... I dunno... order a glass of milk... and then shoot your floor. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie, it will change your perception on history and is honestly just an amazing war movie that will stand the test of time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Weirdly epic,"Even though I'm a massive fan of Quentin Tarantino's work, I have to admit that he's had a few 'misses' here and there. However, I'm pleased to say that, despite possibly nothing ever reaching the dizzying heights on 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Inglourious Basterds' comes about as close as it can in terms of entertainment value.Before I watched it, I have to confess not knowing an awful lot about it. The fact that it was a 'Tarantino movie' was enough for me to know that I was going to watch it. All I knew, from the posters mainly, was that it was a World War II film. And, seeing as I do occasionally dip into that genre, I figured it would be Tarantino's take on that particular period in history and that, like most war movies, it would attempt to be 'historically accurate.' How wrong I was.I'm sure most people know the 'basics' of history surrounding that dark period of 20th Century history and that's all this film relies on. You have the setting, i.e. Nazi-occupied France where fearsome German SS officers ruthlessly hunt down Jews, up against the local resistance and an American platoon dropped behind enemy lines to generally disrupt the occupation. However, don't expect much in the way of 'historical accuracy' after that.You've probably seen Brad Pitt's face on much of the marketing material surrounding this film. Yes, he's the biggest star so why not promote that fact? And, yes, he gives good value as the leader of the American Nazi-hunting band of brothers. However, what this film never anticipated was how well Christoph Waltz would play Pitt's opposite - the fiendish Colonel Hans Landa. He steals every scene he's in and you'll be hard pressed to find a more terrifying movie villain in recent times. He's right up there with Darth Vadar, Hannibal Lecter and Heath Ledger's Joker. And, even if you don't enjoy anything else about this film, you should watch it just for him.The 'structure' of 'Inglourious Basterds' is typical Tarantino. It's split into about six (quite long) 'chapters' through the film's two and a half hour runtime. Each of these could almost be a separate story on their own, if it wasn't for the fact that they all link up in the end perfectly. This sort of story-telling may feel a little disjointed at first, but the way they're told makes them impossible to look away. I may go as far as to say that this film could possibly be the 'tensest' ever made. Because the stories all have their individual characters, you never know who may or may not make it out of the chapter alive. The tension in every scene is cranked up to the max and you probably won't guess everything that's to come.Whether you're a die-hard fan of Tarantino, Brad Pitt, or the genre in general, it doesn't really matter. You only have to enjoy good story-telling, fantastic memorable characters and good films in general to appreciate this (just be warned about the no holes barred violence and bad language, ala every Tarantino movie ever made).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

100 %  Quentin Tarantino  written all over!!,"I have read some of the other reviews and was surprised about comments that mentioned Quentin had either lost touch or had reached his end of fame etc and I beg to differ. I feel this is one movie which thoroughly has Quentin Tarantino's stamp. Every chapter was good, engrossing and built enough tension for the story. Graphic violence - like I said - had Quentin Tarantino's stamp all over and I loved the reality behind that. Okay - the story , the screen play, the music , the violence , the plot and the sudden twists of events in the plot - like for example when Fredric meets Emma in the projector room - all are good. This movie can be seen twice or thrice as the dialog give it the special touch making us want to hear it again and again. My rate - 8 to 9.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Inglourious Basterds,"""I do believe this is my masterpiece""The final line spoken by Brad Pitt in the 2009 film, Inglourious Basterds is one I have often hoped was a declaration of director Quentin Tarantino's. I do believe Inglourious Basterds is Tarantino's masterpiece, excelling his 1992 film Reservoir Dogs, and his 1994 classic Pulp Fiction. The script is airtight with every line of dialogue having a purpose. Starring Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz-- in an American breakout performance for the ages, Inglourious Basterds exceeds the film mastery audiences have grown to expect from Tarantino.Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) has found a home in German- occupied France harboring Jews in 1941. Landa slaughters the family with the exception of young Shosanna (Mélanie Laurent) who is able to escape. Shosanna vows to get revenge against Germany and bides her time plotting after her escape. Three years later, the cinema she owns is selected to host an illustrious movie premiere to honor German war hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl). Zoller immediately takes a liking to Shosanna, convincing Hitler (Martin Wuttke) through his reservations about the venue. Shosanna isn't the only one plotting a massacre at the movie premiere, however. Unbeknownst to her, a group of Jewish- American guerrilla soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine also have a plan for a massacre at the cinema the night of the premiere. The group who does one thing only ""kill nazi's"" have developed a plan with German movie star Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) to sneak explosives and artillery into the cinema which will be filled with German military and the high command. The two plans are developed, independently of each other, ensuring that, one way or another, Hitler will meet his demise on the night of the premiere.I am, unashamedly so, a big fan of Quentin Tarantino's. He's one of, if not the best, modern dialogue writers, in my estimation. A script carries a film, and if the script is good, the film will usually be good, as well. No one writes dialogue like Tarantino, with the notable exception of Woody Allen. The other unique thing about Tarantino is his lack of formal film schooling or training. Tarantino never went to film school, yet amassed a wealth of film knowledge from reading an extensive amount of film history, and screenplays. Every Tarantino film is riddled with bits of film history throughout the film, making his movies a cinephile's dream. Film scores are also incredibly important to Tarantino and pivotal to his films. He is able to arrange a film score that seems like it doesn't work, only to reveal that it's perfect. I could spend decades writing about how riveting the interrogation scenes are in Inglourious Basterds, solely due to the fine script, or I could spend an equal length of time talking about how many plot points Tarantino brings seamlessly together by the film's end; Inglourious Basterds, however, is simply a film that begs to be seen and experienced first hand. The lighting, the nods to classic cinema, and every Tarantino-esque moment comes together perfectly creating a film that will be difficult for the director to top.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Basterdized Gloryholes,"This starts out silly/cool, getting sillier by the minute and ends up something like a twelve year old's revenge-fantasy of what should have happened to those meanie Nazis. Sort of like Abbot and Costello Meets the Nazis. Or The Three Stooges' Kooky Trip to Göring and Hitler. I admire the hell out of QT, but this is a miss and the praise lavished on this movie is a sad case of the emperors new clothes. The key scene for me is in the Parisian cinema. With Hitler enjoying the Nazi-propaganda film. Hitler seated in medium close-up; moronically joyous at the violence inflicted on the allies by the nazi sniper on screen; slapping his knee and wheezing laughter from his sweaty face. Disgusting as his reaction may be, this is a mirror-image of the faces around you in the theater five minutes later, at his extended come-uppeance.-So, if you had the same moronic joyous reaction; I guess yet another Gloryhole got Basterdized during the showing of this movie.

Truth and aspiration,"This film is remarkable for several reasons. The first is that it does not take sides in order to glorify any one philosophy. Another is its brilliant depiction of the people who are ""good"" at war, sadistic,distorted, prejudiced, brutal people, on both or even all sides of the conflict. Which seems to declare, war happens, it is wrong, and the reason it is wrong, is it attracts people who are almost caricatures of evil.But what most surprised and delighted me was Brad Pits performance, an actor I had dismissed as just a pretty boy, playing himself, with empty swagger[ a la Tom Cruise, except for collateral, brilliant ]. Even in Spy Games with Robert Redford, always masterful, he played Brad [ bad boy swagger Pit]. In this film he gave a flawless, awesome performance, albeit brutally distasteful.

Very deliberate introduction of the players involved accompanied by a clear purpose for the movie sent everything in motion and carried through to the finale. A really enjoyable movie. It is really easy to enjoy a band of freedom fighters led by Pitt (Aldo) who kill Nazi's in an effort to end the war. A few twists and turns make this movie a standout. I finally caught this movie 3 years later and it is awesome.

Movies about movies,"Like all of Tarrantino's films, he's really making a movie about movies, or about a type of movie. Inglourious Basterds is by far my favorite, and it's about war propaganda films.I realized a long while ago that there were two important, yet distinct, types of ways to enjoy this movie. There are those who get excited at the prospect of seeing ""our boys"" kick Nazi @$$, and there are those who realize that is exactly how a propaganda film wants you to feel. It's more harmless today, since the actual Nazi party is a thing of the past, but it is important to realize that this film is trying to make get us to realize that we have selected a category of person and we generally tend to glorify subjecting them to horrific levels of violence.Much like with fairy tales, it is important to ask when watching a movie ""Why does the movie think violence against this person is justified?"" Why is it okay for Rumplestiltskin to be ripped in half, or the witch in Hansel and Gretle to be burned alive? Why is it okay for Omar to fill the collaborating French interpreter with as many bullets as they do to the higher ranking members of the Nazi party?To counter the inevitable person who thinks I'm reading too much into it, recall that the film premiere at the end is a fictional Nazi war propaganda film, where Zoller slaughters close to 250 people in front of a laughing, cheering, and energized audience. Hitler laughs at dying Americans in much the same mood that we might have earlier laughed when Donowitz bashed in a soldier's head with a bat.Again I am impressed with Tarrantino's ability to write lengthy dialogue scenes about topics as mundane as glasses if milk and King Kong which are nerve-wrackingly suspenseful due to their context.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Can't believe I'm saying this but I wish Tarantino didn't direct this,"First of all I want to say that Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite movie directors and when I saw the trailer for this movie, my expectations couldn't be higher. Tarantino + killing Nazis = yes. So when I saw this movie I had already made up my mind that I was going to love it. But shortly after seeing this I had to admit that I was disappointed. As with all Tarantino movies there is a lot of dialog, however most of the dialog was in German and French so there was a lot of reading which was annoying since most of it had little to do with the plot. In fact the talking didn't add much to the story or character development and all it accomplished was slow down a story that in my opinion would be more entertaining if it were faster paced. This movie needed less talking and more killing Nazis. Also, this movie seemed to be lacking the silliness found in many Tarantino's earlier work. I'm not saying there is no humor in this movie, but I think it would have been more enjoyable if it had the amount of dark humor found in Kill Bill Vol. 1. I wish that Robert Rodriguez directed this movie. He has a similar style of directing as Tarantino but Rodriguez cuts much of the useless chatter. Despite saying that, Tarantino is still one of my favorite directors, but I hope that he realizes that this movie was not on par with the rest of his work and that he should learn from the mistakes made in this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Shallow and pretty forgettable.,"As pure entertainment this movie is solid as most of Tarantinos movies are. But he has nothing to say or add to the history of WW2. The major idea of the movie, it seems, is to present cool violence in a different context compared to his other movies. Watching this movie you get no idea what so ever of the sufferings and horrors of the war. It's very shallow and forgettable with exception of 2 scenes and Christopher Waltz interpretation of the Nazi officer Hans Landa.The opening scene of the movie when Landa visit a house in which the house owner is hiding Jews in his basement is already a classic and can easily be lifted out and shown as a separate short. The dialog is brilliant and shows Tarantino at his best. Another memorable scene is the supper in the basement of the inn where the basterds have an appointed meeting with the Nazis. Again Tarantino shines in his abilities to write an outstanding dialog. As a whole the movie rests on Waltz performance and the most brilliant with this film was to cast him.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

"Actively provocational and excellent, but not for everyone.","Just like pretty much everything in life, it's very hard to combine different elements together in a way that works, and this movie is a prime example of those rare and wonderful combinations.Tarantino has again proved himself to be a master that is able to combine the elements into a provocative film that pushes all the right buttons. He strives at every turn to insult, disgust or shock you into some form of a reaction to what you're seeing, then to make you laugh at the very next moment, sometimes at things that should horrify you instead. To be honest I believe that is the point of Inglourious Basterds, to force you into some form of self-questioning. Your job is to feel these questions and accept the fact that no matter what reaction you're having, the movie is right... and so are you in another way.Aside from being provocational, the film never tries to take itself too seriously, a point that is repeatedly hit upon. Usually just at the time when you're starting to settle into a new set of personality labels for each of the characters The plot is not important, it's the characters that really make this movie come to life, and everyone did a very very good job. I'd rather not put particular emphasis on any single actor because everyone performed as they should have. The mish-mash of languages throughout the film was a special treat for me since I understand all of them, I always applaud filmmakers who won't settle for the American public's lazy attitude towards languages or subtitles.

This movie should be studied in film schools!,"Let me start with the fact that I am not a die hard Tarantino fan.

Until I saw this.Every theatre and film school, college, university and academy should have a semester long course studying ""Inglorious Basterds."" I do not know how Tarantino wrote this script, and how he directed it, but it is a perfectly assembled puzzle.The script is so well written and rewarding to the actors, who are all brilliant (except for Diane Kruger, who is just ordinarily). Even side characters who have a line or two, because of their acting, make stunningly memorable performances.I have never watched 2 hours of dialogue and 30 min of unequally dispersed action, and enjoyed it so much. The camera and the tensions, and the actors' freedom in building the amazing characters they build is nothing short of phenomenal.Watch the movie.

Fun and entertaining joy film that's done in a unique fashion a real action packed bloody treat!,"I must say that director Quentin Tarantino does it again, as if you've watched his films you know he always makes them entertaining by blending them with humor and action. While going over the top with violence and human blood. Well this 40's era comedy fantasy drama ""Inglourious Basterds"" is no different as it's a film that some may find to long or overstated or drawn out still it's script and story is interesting to hold a viewers thoughts for the entire time.As one knows Tarantino tells stories in his own unique and assertive ways as here he shows that World War II was won through a combination of luring Germans, to the power of their own cinema which brings them to the prowess of a band of renegade soldiers all supposedly Jews. This band of outcast is lead by Lt. Aldo Raine(Brad Pitt)who's a southern country mountain moonshine hillbilly as one can tell by the twang and draw of his accent. Pitt who gives a good turn is mostly overshadowed though by the supporting cast, especially that of Christoph Waltz who as a villain Col. Hans Landa starts the film off with a direct and cut and dry scene as the ""Jew Hunter"" as he begins his search in Nazi occupied France which is the films setting thru and thru. And well worth the watch and a good treat is Eli Roth as ""Bear Jew"" Sgt. Donny Donowitz who smashes the heads of German soldiers to a bloody pulp.Now that the battle lines have been drawn the film moves along like chapters from a book as many scenes seem like a game where people whether Jewish or German always seem in trouble. As this moves along with it's over the top blood and gore and a lot of reading German script as it's gross yet fun to see the gang scalp German heads. A clever and interesting plot develops to rid the evil Germans out of France. Enter Bridget a German actress who's an undercover spy played by Diane Kruger who lures a bar scene of good and bad guys to face blood. Yet the most climatic plan after this is when French Jew Shosanna who changes identity after her family is slaughtered and opens a new cinema to plot revenge. As now the Germans have fallen to the trap as they love war cinema only they will literally come to a climactic blowout in her French cinema of paradise or should I say German hell! Overall this is a fun thrill good film that's over the top with blood and unique gore that's funny as many scenes tease the audience. As it was interesting to see Quentin's interesting take on how War War II was won. Clearly always he has fun with history as historic villains like Hitler and Goebbels are played as jokes, and the female leads are interesting by ending up doomed and the performances are strong especially Pitt's southern accent, yet the strongest and most magnetic is Waltz's. So overall really this unique fun alerted history film even though full of propaganda can be classified as glorious work. Clearly count it as a feel good film to see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"A WWII masterpiece from Tarantino that shoves a lot in our face, but luckily knows what to do with it.","Quentin Tarantino has a way with dialogue, and a way with plot. Along with that, he has a way with throwing too much plot into a movie, or too much dialogue into a film with not enough plot (like Death Proof). This film has quite a large amount of dialogue, and it also has many different story lines and characters, none of which are elaborated on until near the end, so it almost seems as though they've been abandoned. By the end of the movie, it's quite apparent that nothing has been abandoned and all these story lines have been calculated as to how to end them perfectly and how to connect everything. Tarantino knew what he was doing.Like all of Tarantino's films, this one is split up into chapters. Unlike any of his other's, this one is almost completely chronological, aside from the infrequent flashbacks. One story revolves around the Inglorious Basterds, a group of Jewish-American soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Rein (Brad Pitt), and their Nazi scalping. Another story involves Shoshana (Melani Laurent), an escaped Jew who ran away from the evil ""Jew Killer"", Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), who is out for revenge. Perhaps she will get the revenge she wants when Landa is security at a movie premier at the theater she owns. And there's dozens of fairly main characters and actors along the way to go along with the main plots.If this film could be compared to any other Tarantino film, it would have to be Reservoir Dogs. Not because of any plot similarities, or similar scenes, but this film is devoid of emotion. Tarantino has his more emotional films, like the second Kill Bill, or Jackie Brown, or even Pulp Fiction, but this isn't really one of them. With that said, this still has characters that are likable and that the audience cares about, this movie just overall isn't an overly emotional film. But that's not what it's about anyways, it's a war film.The movie is rich in characters, and boy are there a lot of them with quite a bit of screen time. Brad Pitt is definitely the main character of the Americans, and he gives an over the top, often times comedic performance, but he plays a great contrast to the German's lead actor Christoph Waltz, who plays the sinister and evil Col. Hans Landa. Melanie Laurent plays a reserved (for the most part), but interesting role as the woman hell bent on revenge. Diane Kruger plays a rather minor, but interesting role as a German movie star who is actually a spy for the Americans. Every role played is played well, but unlike as it would seem by the trailers, all these actors aren't wrapped around Brad Pitt's finger, but instead Christoph Waltz's. He's the bad guy, and not just that, but he's also the smartest and most cunning of the characters. Really, this film revolves around him, and it works well that way, he's a great character.My only major quibble with the film is it's set-up. The way the movie is set up, it's only loosely thrown together until everything at the end brings the stories together. So for the first hour and a half (or around there), this movie felt like a constantly changing anthology. Once chapter five binds it together and gives us a typical great Tarantino ending, it makes the movie whole. But the looseness of the film towards the middle brought up questions as to what the purpose of different characters were. Luckily, the answers are all in the last chapter.Quentin Tarantino has yet again made another movie masterpiece. This one is one of leisure, but at the same time a constantly changing story. By the end, this film has delivered the goods. The rest of the film sets up what will happen with typical rich Tarantino dialogue, and some bloody violence. Definitely it's a unique take on World War II.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 154 mins. R for strong violence, language and brief sexuality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Tarantino's supposed 'basterdisation' of World War II sees him zoom back to form with an enthralling; gut-wrenching and stylistic war-time thriller.,"Inglourious Basterds sees Tarantino 'glouriously' return to form. What was the debacle called Death Proof, one half of an 'experiment' entitled Grindhouse, has been tried; tested; acknowledged and now buried with Tarantino close to being back in top gear. The film is pure Tarantino, with the sorts of winks, nudges and acknowledgments that are subtle, and compliment the viewing experience, rather than bash you around the head by announcing the whole damn thing is a pastiche in the first place. We've returned to the sorts of Tarantino pieces that check progress with chapters; manipulate time; break the fourth wall; flashback; present us with interesting and dynamic characters that are brought to life brilliantly – even Tarantino's love for the female foot makes an amusing appearance when it transpires an entire plot point must revolve around a woman's foot/shoe. Yes, it's a mad, mad film; but it's as equally high in quality.Tarantino is still operating within that realm, or aesthetic, of escapism; and while his past, more better, work unfolded under a very grounded umbrella of realism and seemingly real-life people thinking, talking and interacting amongst a plateau of realistic, mostly unfortunate, situations; Inglourios Basterds tears The Second World War a new one with a series of scenes that rip up the rule book; re-envisage, and even have its characters outwardly speak of how certain others, inhabiting certain spaces, at certain times can be fate or ""just an amazing coincidence"". What we get is what Tarantino has confessed to being a Spaghetti Western that just happens to take place in France, in the 1940s, and with a bunch of colourful characters of whom some are French, German and British. The film even makes room for cameo appearances from some of the eras more famous faces and possesses the sheer confidence to spend a good ten or so minutes filling in detailed back-stories to characters before completely removing them from the text.The opening to the film is pure Tarantino; kicking things off in a lone, road side location as Christoph Waltz's Nazi colonel Hans Landa visits a French farmer. We are plunged into a game of fear, honour and suspicion. The scene is reminiscent of Jules' visit to the apartment full of young guys in Pulp Fiction, when retrieving a suitcase. The man is in total control; he requests a drink of milk more-so than Sprite and calmly banters with the hapless home-owner as he senses exactly what he's after is in very close proximity. His guards loom, ominously, just the other side of a muggy kitchen window out in the yard; out of focus but visible enough to tell us they're there and threatening. It is a brilliant start to what turns out to be an enjoyable romp; but never really exploitative of The Second World War. We do not enjoy any of the deaths in Inglourious Basterds; American, British, German, Jewish or otherwise. Nor are we excited by the shootouts, however well constructed they are.The Basterds of the title represent a group of American soldiers in Nazi-occupied France; flitting from German platoon-to-German platoon and injecting fear into the Nazi war-machine by killing, maiming, bashing and scalping the enemy. They're led by Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine, a mostly expressionless lieutenant, who self-confesses he and his men are in the ""Nazi killing business, and business is a-booming!"" I was surprised by just how much Pitt's Raine was in it; that being not very much. All the build up, talk and promotional material seemed to include him or revolve around him and his Basterds of the title. Indeed, Tarantino spoke at length about how long it took him to write the character and how much he realised he needed Pitt in the role, etc. But Raine's there for a bit at the beginning, then for about fifteen at the end. It is in no way a criticism, merely an observation, but my guess is that the script was chopped so much that Raine became a supporting character around which Tarantino's finale (which he has stated he had great trouble coming up with over the years) was built up to; and that itself involved a whole new bunch of characters mingling in and around a plot involving raw film stock and a cinema.Along with these Basterds; of whom Tarantino might be drawing on real life parallels with current American soldiers-come-involvement in brutal, immoral activity in foreign wars; even if I respect those that would disagree through lack of development of this idea; we are presented with a young girl named Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent), whose family are killed by Landa and who has retired to a Parisian cinema to wait out the war. That premise alone might inspire a dynamic, revenge-fuelled, cut and thrust adventure set amongst World War II; but instead, she gets a chance encounter with a young German soldier, who is involved in film production through various reasons. Dreyfus' transition under her alias of Emmanuelle Mimieux, as a submissive and quietly nervous in the Nazis' presence, to a laughing; cackling, rather frightening face that illuminates the setting of the finale is equally refreshing to watch; the final stages of the transition is best highlighted by a montage of fetishistic close ups as she dons clothes and make-up for the climax of a screening.The film is a sweeping display of tension, horror and distinct black comedy; forever flicking, effortlessly I might add, from the nastiness involved in the hatching of a dangerous plan between two lovers within the walls of a cinema; to an ever-diligent German officer attempting to piece everything together; right the way through to the ever-present, but relegated to looming in the background, group of Americans known as The Basterds. As a multi-equilibrium and frequently non-linear piece, complete with an array of influences and film references within itself, Inglourius Basters is, this time, a welcome addition to the Tarantino collection.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Fun filled entertainment - Best since Pulp Fiction,"Since Pulp Fiction, I have not liked Tarantino. I found his films to be over long, self indulgent and often boring. However with Inglourious Basterds, he has reminded me of the talent he clearly possesses as a writer, but this time, even more so as a director. For this film has improved leaps and bounds in cinematography and pacing to his previous few films. He has developed a method of using the camera to project his themes and ideas, which only the best directors are capable of. For example, in one of the best scenes of the movie, set in an underground bar, his camera waltzes around tables and pauses for tension and floats to show certain items under tables. A technique that must have some Leone influence to it. It wasn't self indulgent 'look at what I'm doing with the camera' like in Kill Bill with the slow motion gun blast. It as kinetic, like QT himself and had a large element of fun to it.The camera-work in this film is some of the best he has done but, to be honest, when I read the script last year, I was worried. My immediate thoughts were 'Oh dear Lord! What is he doing? This mix of romance, action, thriller, comedy and drama will never work. He needs to be reined in. His imagination has got the worst of him.' And who can blame me for thinking that? The chapters go from one to another without proper linkage and I wondered how QT would make the audience care about all the different stories going on. Then I remembered, this is the guy who made Pulp Fiction. This is the guy who revolutionised cinema storytelling techniques, going from present to past to future to present with dozens of amazing characters. I shouldn't have worried about the script. I should have known he could pull it off. When I saw the film with a friend, my friend complained, 'it was dog food. That's not a film. It's laziness.' However, I answer that by reminding them what QT's favourite films are. Kung fu, men on a mission movies, Leone movies. He has said on countless occasions that he is interested in making high powered cinema that he himself would go and see and if that was his aim, then surely we can not fault him and even if it isn't our cup of tea, we have to admire his sheer audacity.The one flat note of the film is the character of Shoshanna, who I found rather unpleasant despite her tragic life. She doesn't come across well at all, in my opinion and the chapter 3 with her in it is definitely the poorest. Melanie Laurent wasn't particularly good either. She didn't seem to give Shoshanna any sort of humanity to her so the audience would cheer her on in her mission. I think we were all hoping the Basterds were the ones who finished off the job. However, Tarantino can be proud that he's back to near his best and maybe his next film will be back on par with his two modern classics of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. This film isn't quite up there with them, as the characters aren't quite as dynamic and the story not quite as ingenious but as a testament to the cinema, (you have to see the end as a metaphor) Inglourious Basterds reminds you of the thrills you can experience watching a motion picture.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
a inglorious let down,"Like all the above comments QT has been on thin ice with a lot of his recent work and I don't think this really makes up for it. I will say the movie is filmed beautifully every scene nice detail great lighting a lot of thought into each frame but seriously QT is a seasoned directory I expect that type of work. I found nothing shocking about the violence and that it is used to string you along with anticipation of good gore that you can get away with in a war movie and I feel that casting Eli Roth was a tease to good gore that never delivered. Some of the dialogue was great and had a lot behind it, but some was just unnecessary almost to extend a scene so he could film more. I think QT was mixing a lot of things here that in the end just did not come out well. I really hope for a Unrated or re-cut version.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Pretty weak,"This was definitely one of the weakest films by Tarantino. And there was a simple reason why.He chose too serious and dramatic topic for his style. Yes, it fitted perfectly for Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs but to rape World War II in that way is a bit too much.First scene was very promising when the Nazi was explaining the French man why Nazi regime hates Jews. Secondly we were introduced to Inglorious Basterds. The group of brutal Jews killing Nazis. First I thought it was a fine idea but later it got pretty tiring.Then everything started to go downwards. Too long table scene showed the Jew girl Emanuelle who had escaped in the beginning from Nazis thinking about showing the great Nazi movie in her cinema. Afterwards another very long and weak table scene came by which ended with shooting.And then the finale where Emanuelle let her lover burn down the Nazis filled cinema including Adolf.Some big mistakes were that the table scenes and empty discussions were awful. They didn't lead nowhere. History rewriting in such a way wasn't believable as well. All great Nazis including Hitler were killed in a movie theater. And finally of course Tarantino's jokes which for me have been usually fine but put in such a plot wentjust too far.Still, if you can put it up you may enjoy this film. I wouldn't say it was a complete waste of time but Tarantino crossed the line from where it got controversial for even myself.More on the plus site there was some fine acting, some laughs and overall interesting point of view.So let's just say below average, don't expect it to be Pulp Fiction.. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Great movie, one of QT's best.","If your a Quentin Tarantino fan, see this movie! If you are not a Quentin Tarantino fan... see it anyway (you will be). A pretty bloody like most QT films but all the blood is justified and works in the movie. This is NOT a movie for kids. The movie's style is reminiscent of the Kill Bill family (but in order this time :)).The plot and story lines are great, the actors are great, Brad Pitt plays the roll well. The movie is a little long at two and a half hours but in no way does it lead you looking for the exit with 30 minutes to go. Given the length of the movie there is no ""filler"" material to stretch it out, the whole two and a half hours is pure content.Now, stop reading this and go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"One Word, ""Classic""","This movie has reinstated my faith in movie pictures. Quentin has delivered an instant classic of this portrayal of WW2. The movie is a good representation of how it should have gone down. From the opening scene to the glourious finale ,Tarantino delivered the goods from A to Z. In fact I had no clue how long the film was when I first went to see it, when I exited the theater 3 hours later ,it seemed the movie was only an hour and a half to two hours. Not only is the film 2 hours and 40 minutes, but I was mad when it was through, I could have watched it all night!!! There aren't too many films I want to see over and over again, but this is one of them. If you're a fan of movies where the good guys kick the villains ass, this is the one to see. It's like Tarantino took an old ""Speggetti Western"" and made a Nazi movie from it. This movie is one of my top 10 of all time, it's tied with Pulp Fiction in my opinion.

"Tarantino's epic black comedy. Inglourious Basterds is a sprawling, rhapsodic, triumphant, ridiculously original cinematic experience","Tarantino is possibly the greatest cult director to ever live -Originality and Passion is something that is relatively scarce in the contemporary film industry, many directors now simply produce films for the whopping pay check after release (Michael Bay, Jason Friedberg...). Yet, Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is a gleaming example that there is still raw passion and bundles of originality nestled in the undercurrents of cinema. Tarantino's films most definitely have an acquired taste, his style is marred with obscure film references, heavy dialogue, dark comedy and you'd usually expect his characters to go into a burst of pointless chit-chat about pop culture. This is what his cinema is and he sticks to his guns, he's not tempted by the majority audience to cash in on. The beauty of Inglourious Basterds is that he sticks to his style, but he puts it into a totally different use to produce a wacky piece of cinema of the like that I've never seen before or never will!Inglourious Basterds is split into five chapters that all have a distinct tone and direction. It involves two bloody stories of revenge and redemption coming together in a simply outrageous fashion. Melanie Laurent plays Shoshana Dreyfus, a vengeful cinema owner who witnessed her family get massacred by Nazi Colonel, Hans 'Jew Hunter' Landa (Christophe Waltz). Whilst, Brad Pitt plays Lt Aldo Raine as he leads a battalion of hate-filled American Jews on a rampage to kill Nazis. Both stories unite in a simply epic conclusion.Once again, Tarantino gathers an admirable cast that fit the script. Waltz pulled off a great performance that should expect Academy recognition, Pitt was very good as the simple American lieutenant and Laurent was perfect as Shoshana. I could only complain about Eli Roth, but I don't want to waste my time explaining why as the reasons should be obvious!Like a typical Tarantino film, there are flourishes of Morricone music, brilliant yet perhaps superfluous dialogue and plenty of violence. The film doesn't take itself seriously, it's just great fun and miles away from your normal war film. Tarantino treats sensitive issues like Nazism like anything else, producing a multitude of violence never seen before in his films.Inglourious Basterds is a black comedy, we find ourselves laughing when in fact we should be shocked and disgusted. Yet, this doesn't suggest the story is lousy, it's actually brilliant. It's ironic and surprisingly gripping, all thanks to a script that I would describe as spectacular. The writing is subtle and at times, hilarious.Tarantino's films have always been quite comical, yet this is his first all-out black comedy. The farcical story structure encapsulates a great atmosphere of stupidity, so much so that you can't help but laugh out loud at the end.The film is most certainly an acquired taste, some may find the heavy scenes of dialogue as excessive or some may see Tarantino's attempts at black humour as immature and juvenile. Opinions were always going to be polarised as they were at Cannes. But I can tell you one thing, Inglourious Basterds sees Tarantino back on blistering form and I can't wait for his next project.""Tarantino's hilarious film is an epic celebration of cinema""""Laurent and Waltz shine in the best film of the summer""""Wildly Original. A crazy, twisted, bloody war film that certainly has its dramatic moments exemplified by Tarantino's exhilarating music choice""""Awesome, Dazzling, Beautiful. Inglourious Basterds fails to disappoint""""Entertainment of the highest calibre""""Has everything you'd expect from a Tarantino film.

My father fought in World War II -- he would have loved Inglourious Basterds,"Somewhere in France, my father directed Canadian canon fire at a Nazi canon battery that was killing Allied soldiers. The Nazis spotted my father and fired a canon at him, blowing him and his radio man out of the 2nd floor of a farm house. My dad, although injured, crawled back into the farm house and continued directing the fire of his gun crew by radio until they took out that Nazi group and their guns.I wish that dad could see Inglourious Basterds. In fact, I think that everyone of age should see this movie, because in World War II, mankind was scarred by the evil of the Nazis. Although I was born a year after the war, I discovered that I still have emotions about the events that almost killed my father, and I wasn't even there. Imagine the emotional scars of someone who lived through it.Today, thanks to Quentin Tarantino, I feel happier - some repressed emotions have surfaced and dissipated. I hope that many others see this movie and feel better as a result.I have enjoyed many movies over the years, but for me, Inglourious Basterds has raised the bar. No other movie has affected me this much. I rank it the best movie ever made, because it shines the spot light on the most evil event in Earth history, and actually helps to heal the wounds from that event - an amazing achievement for a movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Quentin Tarantino's Blast!,"I am a big fan of Quentin Tarantino. I completely loved Pulp Fiction, and has some of the best dialogue ever written. I was a fan of his Kill Bill films, and I loved Death Proof almost as much as Pulp Fiction, and had a great time with it. Inglorious Basterds is another remarkable achievement from Tarantino. It is a clever, funny, audacious and entertaining spin on World War II. I loved it. I did not know what to expect, if more of a comedy or a drama, but ultimately it had the classic Tarantino features. The film is superbly written, and I enjoyed all of the dialogue, which of course is what Tarantino does best. This is no exception. I was completely emerged into this other world, one we have never seen before. The performances were all very strong. Brad Pitt shines here, but then again, I have always found him to be a very charismatic actor, and I enjoy almost all of his work. Christoph Waltz did not disappoint after hearing all of the praise. His performance is not overly-flashy, but it works perfectly. He is without a doubt the best in the film, and that is saying a lot. Classic performance I am sure. But a lot of others impressed me a lot also. Mélanie Laurent and Diane Kruger were very good, Til Schweiger and Daniel Brühl almost equally as great as Waltz. Pitt, Waltz, and these four made the film. Eli Roth was quite good, and I enjoyed seeing him perform in this. The cameo by Mike Myers was very funny, and Martin Wuttke created a very memorable Hitler. Similar to Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, the film had a lot of blending music, and I loved it for that. The costumes and set designs were all exquisite, and I loved all of it.Although I am a quite a big Tarantino fan, sometimes his films do overload in my viewings, sometimes I have some sort of resentment towards them. Pulp Fiction, sometimes I feel it is very disturbing and very violence-oriented, and Kill Bill the same, and I feel like it is stuffed with style, but sometimes I wonder about the substance. Also, I find Kill Bill sort of overrated, whereas I find Death Proof very underrated. I still love them, yeah, but I feel that way sometimes. I am not sure whether I will feel the same way from time to time with Inglorious Basterds, but I do think it is equally as great as Pulp Fiction, and I think it will fare very well with time!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Good... but not great.,"The first thing to say about Inglourious Basterds is that it is definitely worth seeing after all for two and half hours it does at least entertain. The problem is in the end you might be left wondering what was the point of it all, Tarantino certainly conjures up some great thrills but to this viewer it all felt like one of those Roger Moore Bond films all flash but no real soul - worth the entry fee but not a lot more besides.That said the opening is extraordinarily well done (though in a way it handicaps the rest of the film) and Christopher Waltz's performance is truly brilliant but beyond this there is not really anything to mark this film out as memorable even in terms of Tarantino's previous works. Reservoir Dogs will always be cleverer and Pulp Fiction always more entertaining. You cannot deny that as a war film it is different from anything else you might have seen but this alone doesn't necessarily make it all that worthwhile.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Another stinker from pain in the ass Quentin,"No words can describe how dreadful this movie is. Brad Pitt can't really act. That's evident from watching this. He thinks that he needs to pull a lip like Benjamin Buford Blue from Forrest Gump for the whole film. There are no real characters, just caricatures. The rewriting of history is the most objectionable bit. If the real Nazis were as oafish as portrayed here, the war would have lasted a week. The part that I cannot stand is the way that Quentin makes no apologies for setting up scenes of inordinate length, with no editing, and leaden dialogue. Every director has their own style, but Quentin does this kind of stuff in every film. He's no master like Scorcese. No thanks to Quentin for his ridiculous take on history.

Finally.....My Belief in Quentin Tarantino has been restored,"Inglourious Basterds (IB) is an awesome movie, praise that I seldom lend to movies, especially recent Quentin Tarantino (QT) movies........ The last QT film that was worthy of my praise, was Pulp Fiction, as the characters and dialogue were some of the best ever written, IB is a true return to form by QT.I went to the movie theatre to watch this movie, dreading the 2.5 hours that lay ahead, as my husband wanted to go and watch IB, and I had been cajoled into attending with him. Within minutes of its start, I was hooked, the Colonel Hans Landa character played by Christopher Waltz was amazing, what a sense of intense buried evil he portrayed beneath the outward cool exterior. The dialogue between him and Monsieur LaPadite was intense, what a menacing portrayal. I hope to see Christopher Waltz in more movies in the future, as usual QT has found an excellent unknown actor that perfectly fits the role.What a revelation Brad Pitt was in this role, Diane Kruger held her end and the lovely Melanie Laurent was brilliant.I can not praise this film enough, loved it, loved it, loved it!!!! One of my favourite movies so far this year, in my top 5. I hope that QT can follow up this movie with something of a par, as no-one writes dialogue like QT, if he can, then I for one will be waiting with baited breath for his next movie.Well done QT, I salute you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"War is hell, but even hell has its humorous side","Not having read the user comments section of this web site before I saw the movie (I had read a couple of favorable critical reviews), I was quite taken aback by the divided response. No-one walked out of the packed session I went to. For one thing, it passed the watch test – in the 150 minute running time I looked at my watch not once. The blend of comedy, film buffery and action overlays some seriousness of purpose. Yes, in war both sides are capable of atrocities and generally commit them without much thought. Yes, some Nazis were witty, intelligent and charming, if not actually lovable. Yes, the world would have been a different place if Hitler and his gang had been disposed of in the summer of 1944. This is entertainment, not history, however, even if the German uniforms and wartime French bars are painstakingly reproduced.I thought the whole thing was very well constructed. The 5 long ""chapters"", with their own denouements are all carefully linked. Apart from the final catharsis, they all feature the quiet build-up of tension through conversation to an almost unbearable degree – final moments of mayhem come as a relief. Yes, it's a very talky movie but the dialogue has many flashes of brilliance. I'm sorry for all those who don't like subtitles – I thought they were well used. But wasn't there too much sadism, blood and gore? That's war folks.Even the sternest critics concede the Austrian actor Christoph Waltz put in a stunning performance as Colonel Landa the urbane SS Jew hunter. Brad Pitt's hillbilly chief basterd, Aldo Raine, was somewhat overshadowed, but it was not a very demanding part. Melanie Laurent as Shosanna, the young Jewish cinema owner bent on revenge, relied more on her beauty than histrionics, but her presence was unforgettable. It was nice to see that Rod Taylor at 80 can still do Churchillian tones. About the only below par performance was Mike Myers (""Austin Powers""), totally miscast as a British general. Daniel Bruhl from ""Goodbye Lenin"" was excellent as Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels' blue-eyed boy who falls for Shosanna.As for the film buffery, some I appreciated, some went over my head, and some was below my radar, but I can't say it interfered with my enjoyment of the film. I didn't really see this movie as a spoof of the World War II film genre, a major part of my movie diet when I was growing up. Tarantino has added something of his own here – he's Spielberg with a sense of humour and an understanding of that allegedly rare American trait, irony. As the unfortunate (and unfortunately named) Lt Archie Hicox), film critic turned not terribly successful secret agent, might have said ""I await with eager anticipation and great trepidation this director's next work.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Completely unexpected,"When I decided to watch this film, I was clueless about it. The ads suggested that it was a comedy. It is, but not in the way one would think. I also didn't realize that it was directed by Quentin Tarantino. So basically, the whole thing was a surprise for me.In many ways, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a good surprise. It's an intriguing, interesting, highly fictional story, with tension throughout, especially in the beginning scene where Colonel Landa (Christoph Waltz) questions a French farmer (Denis Menochet) about hiding a Jewish family.The Basterds, led by Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) are out to scalp Germans, and their mission collides with that of a Jewish woman (Melanie Laurent) who has fake papers and runs a film theater in Paris. She has a mission, too, and on the night a film is shown that is to be attended by Hitler and SS officers, the plans take effect.Brad Pitt is very funny as Aldo, and Christoph Waltz gives a great performance as Landa. Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger, playing a German actress who is collaborating with the Americans, are both wonderful in their roles.""Inglourious Basterds"" is filled with horrible violence done as only Tarantino can - you're laughing one minute and repulsed the next - it also has an excellent cast.

"Great Cinema, and a classic movie...but...","I am a huge Tarentino fan. That being said, I cannot give this movie a 10/10 as I was hoping. I would of is there had been that ""Crazy 88's"" scene from Kill Bill, or a Pulp Fiction ""Gimp Scene"", but alas there wasn't. The action is great when it happens, and the acting it top notch. However, in the interim, I only saw bits and pieces of the Tarentino I have been a loyal fan of for the better part of 2 decades now. From the opening scene of this movie, there is a certain intensity, and that is kept by the scene stealing Christoph Waltz, who IMO stole the show, and the rest of the cast has a strong showing with witty and often times unforeseeable moments of hilarity. Still though, conflicted at times this movies drifts into plot points that are hard to follow, and you're not quite sure what direction the movie is going. A second viewing will hopefully clear some of these up. The best point of this movie are the acting and grainy om-age' to cinema. I feel as though Tarentino really captured the feel of WWII Nazi occupied France. The pacing is good, and in Tarentino is still the king of diologue only to pull the ""pin"" on the hand grenade when you least expect it, derailing th entire scene...and if you haven't been paying attention, leaving you in shock as to what just happened. I will say though, if you are expecting an action thrill ride (Which is what I was expecting based on the previews), you will be disappointed. I must score this a 9 out of 10 based on the acting, the intensity and at times ""awkwardness"" of anxiety Tarentino is a master of creating. Pitt was awesome by the way...and needs an honorable mention. This movie is a must see and only loses a point because it was missing that pinch of ""Oregano"" which is that great scene of action I/we were all wishing/waiting for. Yes, this is a Nazi killing movie...so I wanted to see an awesome Nazi action sequence of wading knee deep into Nazi's with a belt fed machine gun...or a scene of someone like Til Schweiger (Stiglitz) go to work on killing some Nazi's...and killing them brutally. There were small cuts of such scenes, but where was the monumental ""House fight"" from Kill Bill between Vivica A. Fox and Uma Thurman equivalent? I am using Kill Bill as a reference because there were so many GREAT cinematic action sequences in that film, and the previews lead us down the path that such action was in this movie, when it's not. In closing, a GREAT movie...just not an action packed flick like the previews lead us to believe. So go into it with that expectation, and you'll be fine.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
I think this might just be my masterpiece,"I think a lot of people were waiting for Tarantino's great comeback, which would include all the components that made his earlier features cult movies (I'm talking about Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction of course): good storyline, stylish dialogue, cool characters etc. Although Tarantino has never made a really bad movie, Death Proof is still unforgivable for director, who made above mentioned movies. Tarantino fans can now sigh with relief because with Basterds he prove that his talent is not lost.Inglourious Basterds is a bit similar to Pulp Fiction. Both films are a bit over the top (Basterds over the top parts are more over the top than in Pulp Fiction, but serious parts in IB are more serious than in PF), full of great (but not likable) characters and feature story lines, which collide during the coarse of the movie.It is difficult to say, what genre of film does Inglourious Basterds belong to, but I would call it a thriller-spaghetti western with humor set during the WWII, but don't expect a war movie.Tarantino has made a movie, which is very close to masterpiece (yes, IMO even closer than Pulp Fiction). I am saying close because in the middle of the film there is one scene, which is just too long. If ten minutes were cut in the correct places, this could have been a real classic, but it was very entertaining movie nevertheless.My verdict: 8.5",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Its all right but really its not all that good......,"Its a thing these days - do I spend 50 euros for an afternoon or evening at the movies? I really looked forward to this move because of a reflection to a movie from the late 70's with the same name - which I recollect with far more enjoyment. Brad's character is interesting and so screams the input from the director as its so like a Tarantino character from another movie. He plays his role well - but sorry its just not that good a role. I was fascinated by the under stories and the roles of the German actress; the German Jewess that survived the massacre... Just like pulp fiction,,, I guess this is what I don't like about this movie its so Tarantino. The comparison is logical as the side stories of pulp were as entertaining as the core story and the contribution all made to the outcome were logical. However this concept does not carry true for this film - the side stories are good but the main ""story"" just does not exist and what is there is weak.I am not sorry to have spent the time watching it - just glad I didn't pay any money to see it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

The end of the movie was absolutely terrible as it turned into a complete joke.This film is an abomination for spoiling the history and making a mockery out of people who truly fought to save the world.

Tarantino Keeps Getting Better,"For a movie pertaining to World War II, the action sequences are rather sparse, yet captivating. Instead of endless battle scenes, Quentin Tarantino creates optimism, enthusiasm, terror, and even humor through several characters and scenes. Brad Pitt showcases his acting ability with some similarities to his role in Burn After Reading, including humor. It is not the most historical relevant movie, but if that's what you're looking for, you're better off with a documentary. It is a classic Tarantino movie, full of violence and fanatical scenes. If you were a fan of the Kill Bill saga, you will enjoy this movie, it is definitely worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
One of the Most Entertaining War Films for Decades,"With the standard of Tarantino's films declining to surprisingly low depths ever since the release of his second film Pulp Fiction, many have debated as to whether or not Tarantino really was the immensely talented director we had been lead to believe? With his latest film, however, Tarantino seems to have redeemed himself with this new war epic.Based around a fictional event in which a group of American soldiers and a vengeful young Jewish woman in Nazi occupied France plan to blow up/burn down and cinema during a premier, with many of the German high command, Hitler included, in attendance, Tarantino is able to bringing into play his usual directorial traits: his extensive, yet entertaining, conversation scenes; tough, though likable heroes; violent imagery; pre-recorded music scores and discreet film references - not to mention his obvious love of cinema, made especially clear through the events and technicalities of the film's cinema based plot.Despite these familiarities, this is still new ground for Tarantino, mainly because this is the first of his films that doesn't take place during the in contemporary America (bar several key scenes in Kill Bill). Gone are the distinct fashion traits or the familiar pseudo brands that scatter his previous films that we would normally expect. Instead, he is stuck in 1940s Europe and is perhaps closer at times to directing a period drama rather than a ""Tarantino film"". However, he still manages to get his own distinctive edge on his WWII interpretation - strudel arguably becoming the new ""Big Kahuna Burger"" - and even finds room to fit David Bowie onto the soundtrack score.Perhaps the thing which we can be most grateful for is Tarantino's attempt at redefining the genre. With most recent war films, made within the past thirty years, attempting to bring out the raw, grittiness of war and the obvious, yet constantly used, ""war is hell"" messages it is a relief to finally to have a war film that is made purely to entertain, à la Where Eagles Dare, Kelly's Heroes and The Eagle has Landed. The story itself is too absurd to be taken seriously yet gripping enough to be intrigued by, along with the suspense and tension constantly building to levels that would have impressed the likes of Alfred Hitchcock - pretty impressive given the audience is in on the plan and the inevitable conclusion, all they don't know is how the scenes are going to play.Far from perfection however, the film does suffer from a few flaws, namely the Basterds. Whilst the characters in the remaining episodes seem to have their work cut out, the Basterds side of the story comes across as a forgotten and undeveloped. Their role as American soldiers dropped into France to randomly kill and terrorise Nazi's lacks the depth and plausibility to make their characters or stories interesting enough. Likewise, the characters themselves are incredibly bland to the point that even Brad Pitt struggles to bring something worthwhile out of his character, not to mention the bizarre miscasting of Eli Roth.Despite the flawed Basterds, Tarantino has nonetheless managed to assemble a selection of memorable well cast characters. Much praise has been given to Christopher Waltz (and rightly so) for his performance as the villainous ""Jew Hunter"" Hans Landa, however much credit also ought to be given to Daniel Brühl as the young, innocent-looking Nazi war-hero Private Fredrick Zoller, trying to start relationship with the Jew-in-hiding, cinema owner Shosanna Dreyfus (brilliantly played by Melanie Laurent). Their juxtaposing relationship alone keeps the film alight with tension. Michael Fassbender also makes a hugely memorable performance as the charismatic British spy and film historian Lt. Archie Hicox along with Mike Myers' amusing cameo.Whilst not quite on the same level as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, Inglourious Basterds is certainly a huge step up from Kill Bill and Death Proof, proving that Tarantino still has much to offer us.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
A Very Entertaining and Compulsive Viewing Experience,"I didn't have any expectations when I went to see this film, but I was impressed how Tarantino took the WW2 story and turned it into his own fictional portrayal of the Nazis in France.While demonstrating the evil of the Nazis, mainly via the great acting from Christoph Waltz, he introduces a level of dark humour that flows in and out of the film very well. It's like eating a fine meal and finding a new taste in every bite you take....making you want more and more. 2.5 hours goes quickly and you feel stuffed, but very satisfied..As always with these type of films, you become sceptical with the marketing bandwagon used to promote the film. But, in this case it was justified. Brad Pitt does a great job of being the gung ho American leader of a group of professionals sent into France to kill Nazis in Tarantino's realistic style. Melanie laurent plays the lady who earlier escapes a close encounter with the Nazis who kill her whole family. The story used show how she gets her revenge is an original idea for me and just adds to the magic of the film.I saw this film in Sweden and the film is a mixture of French, German and English. Even though my Swedish is not perfect, I managed to follow the Swedish subtitles for the non-English conversations and it had no affect on my enjoyment of the film. In fact at the start of the film, the languages used are part of the film, which is cleverly used by Christoph Waltz as the Nazi general.So, go and see this film. Even if you're not a Tarantino film, you will enjoy the story, but you may have to cover your eyes for some scenes if you don't like that kind of thing. But, really, those scenes compliment the film and are much less than in the likes of Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction. In fact in felt like the films I grew up with where the acting and the storyline made the film, not the special effects. The filming style reminded me of the older generation films gone by. It is one of the few films I have attended where people applauded at the end. That says it all in a nutshell.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Narrative and Cultural Solipsism,"This flick was great!Racial stereotypes, reputations(narratives), and cultural narratives (especially as they are created in film) = the real theme of this movie. The real star, Christopher Waltz.Brad Pitt's unconvincing accent highlights the fact that nativistic cultural ID is overrated. This is the domain of the sinisterly sophisticated Waltz.Historical inaccuracies are made irrelevant by the fact that the film is exploring narrative construction. QT builds a 'Tall tale' version of history that tries the vindicate the horrors of that war.Still, one should not miss the doubling that occurs when the the Nazis gather in the theater laughing at their violent film. The story of Fredrick Zoller mirrors that of the Basterds that we gather to laugh at.If QT is such a fan of Native Americans (e.g. Bill and Brad Pitt in this film)why doesn't he create a film about the genocide committed by Americans against the indigenous of America. This blood is so rarely referenced in film that it might very well be the domain of the ever provocative QT. Don't you think QT should write a Western anyway?While we love to see Nazis slaughtered in film, do not be so culturally solipsistic as to forget that America has also committed genocide.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

"Disturbing, impressing, disgusting, funny... and even teaching","I can't say I was a great Tarantino fan - though I like ""Pulp Fiction"". And I am German, which might be an interesting fact reviewing a movie about killing Germans (equaled to being Nazis). And - with a night gone by and time to think about it - I appreciate this one as well.Because I hate stories dividing the characters into ""good ones"" and ""baddies"", drawing forth the line of good-prevailing-over-evil-tales just once more. Those are often the ones whose heroes can serve as models for a one-sided point of view and violence as means of a solution to a problem. In this movie almost everyone is or at least intends to become a murderer, fully justified by his or her own point of view as it seems. This leads to an excess of violence, cruelty and retaliation which, I was a little surprised to become aware of, had quite a disturbing effect on me. It's not that I wasn't used to bloody war movies (finding it inadequate to conceal the atrocities of war). But the unscrupulous way of (over)killing, this continuous mistreating of other human beings - consequently dehumanized by their killers - ends up in a kind of nightmare where there are no ""good ones"" anymore. It really urged me to think about the way we are treating others, how small the gap to the ""dark side"" is. How suddenly the feeling changes from desire for revenge to compassion with the punished. Wrath is more than comprehensible but hatred and revenge lead to a disastrous Nemesis. (Even the average American might know about the infamous Nazi-German ""Vergeltungsmaßnahmen"" (retaliation actions), often against civilians. Or take a look at the middle east. It's a vicious circle.) You could even call it a spiritual movie this way... weird way of delivering the message though...This has nothing to do with my nationality: I would have said the same if it was a film about Germans killing Russians or Jews - f****d up all the same! But maybe I could identify even more with the ""baddies"" this time. Tarantino fosters feelings of empathy for them (for a soldier, trying to protect his comrades or for a father, trying to stay alive to see his new-born son), partly even more than for the members of the Basterds. So I suppose it's intended to blur the borders this way. Great job! In addition the multinational casting and the different spoken languages do an incredible job creating a tense atmosphere! Thumbs up!Great job of course by Christoph Waltz as well, I must agree! His action alone is worth watching the movie, awesome!!! I wasn't bored by the longer dialog parts - other than in ""Death Proof"" I don't regard them as unnecessary. And they serve as counterparts to the actions scenes. I'd say it's still quite a bloody one (and I can understand everyone disgusted by such gore) but very well worth watching - and thinking about it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
The new film by Quentin Tarantino,"Inglourious Basterds is not a war film. Nor is it historical. Inglourious Basterds is a spaghetti western. Nazi-occupied France is no more than a canvas for Tarantino to scribble his colorful stories and characters. Sometimes the results are insultingly simple doodles, but more often than not they form into cathartic assaults of aesthetics coalesced from the director's encyclopedic mind of cinema. History be damned.Because of this emulation I found the film decidedly more fun than QT's previous efforts. That distinct ""movieness"" is more present than ever, in large part due to a literally film-oriented plot. Cinema is is the mcguffin here, and there were some unsettlingly surreal moments, for me as a viewer, in which the camera paints the characters as audience members themselves.Though too high-concept and stylized to resonate emotionally, the film left me pondering the deterrence and deception of not only war propaganda, but the figurehead-edness of modern media. During the climax when the film bravely barrages into alternate history (more so than before I mean), consider the alternative; the obvious fabrication is anything but.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
. Entertaining Tarantino film with troubling subtext,"When Quentin Tarantino's new film debuted at the Cannes film festival this year it was met with indifference and derision in more or less equal doses. Although Tarantino managed to win the top prize at the same festival fifteen years ago with his landmark film Pulp Fiction his new film's modest launch was not surprising to many. In spite of a few instances of pandering to both French citizens and cinema-goers in general Inglorious Basterds just isn't the kind of film that does well with the film festival crowd. The film industry folk in the movie reference legendary directors like Charlie Chaplin, Leni Riefenstahl, and G.W. Pabst at every opportunity but the style of Tarantino's movie has a different type of pedigree: once again it's easy to see the influence of ""B"" film genres such as the Spaghetti Western and Grindhouse.Still, it isn't just the visual and narrative influence of lurid genre films that divest Inglorious Basterds of its film festival appeal: it also has a muddled (if not downright inhuman) subtext. While the film is tremendously entertaining on the surface level thanks to several cleverly designed suspense sequences and a touch of Tarantino's trademark dialogue it's impossible to examine Inglorious Basterds without noticing some disturbing underpinnings. The film's villain is Nazi Col. Hans Landa, a suave, clever man whose detective skills have earned him the nickname ""Jewhunter."" His opposite is downhome American Basterd Lt. Aldo Raine. Raine hardly considers his enemies human and he likes it that way, as he explains, ""I sure as Hell didn't come...to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity."" Raine and his crew of Basterds (as he unlearnedly dubs them) exhibit a bloodthirsty savagery unmatched by any of the Nazis they encounter. In one slightly nauseating scene Raine expresses happiness that the Nazi officer he has captured isn't going to give him information about troop positions since he'll derive entertainment from watching one of his Basterds beat the man to death with a baseball bat. Raine also carries a large knife with him to scalp his enemies and carve swastikas into any Nazi he leaves alive.Unlike Raine, Landa seems to have at least some respect for his enemies. He generally only uses violence as a last resort and he even admits he is impressed by the Basterds' exploits. Further, he exhibits a fluency in several languages while Raine can barely speak one. With these two characters the film seems to imply that there's something undesirable if not downright evil about intelligence. Further, the one Basterd that performs the most poorly and nearly ruins one of their missions is an intellectual British film critic. At best, Tarantino is playing into anti-American stereotypes by portraying his American characters as stupid but powerful brutes and at worst he's praising this brutality while suggesting that intellectualism is a negative attribute.Subtextual concerns aside, Tarantino's latest film is a welcome return to form after the feeble barbarity of Death Proof and the puerile pastiche of the Kill Bill films. Inglorious Basterds is exactly the kind of film Tarantino does best: a viscerally exciting entertainment that works really well as long as it isn't taken seriously.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Good head smashing fun ...,"* * SPOILERS * * Great movie.When the basterds decide to smash the head of the uncooperative nazi officer I was worried that the first hit would render him unconscious but no. He started screaming when the bear jew started his work with a nail studded baseball bat. Judging from the audiences response this was Tarantino's crowd pleaser.My only complaint was that there were not enough scenes w/the basterd's exploits, too much overlong dialog. The finale was great when the basterds and Shoshanna trapped a whole bunch of nazi's in a movie theater and burned / exploded it. This was a badly needed reprise of the basement scene of the dirty dozen. Those animals were actually cheering when they were watching Americans being killed in Italy, now it was their turn.The last scene was priceless when Aldo ordered the shooting and scalping of Landa's driver. The look on his nazi face was astonishing, 'the war is over and I am only a flunky'. He got what he deserved, good job Tarantino!Great job Tarantino.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

A WiseGuy's Review: Ending saves the day for this good but ultimately disappointing Tarantino film,"This being what I believe to be Quentin Tarantino's first writing/directing work since the Kill Bill movies my expectations were certainly high for this movie. I was discouraged to read so many mixed reviews so I went into see the movie with an open mind. Overall I enjoyed it. After the second chapter the film slows down and gets pretty boring until the thrilling and violent final chapter really saves the day. Brad Pitt is by far the most entertaining presence in the film but Christoph Waltz really steals the show with his acting performance. I felt there was not enough time devoted to the Basterds themselves and the excitement factor really suffered as a result. All in all though great acting performances and an acceptable amount of action and violence.I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino. Pulp Fiction is one of my all time favorite movies and I've loved just about everything he's done.

Great collection of scenes.,"I was captivated by the German lead actor. He was sensational. The opening scene set the stage for me and the pacing. The French guy in that scene with him was also great. And the British guy who plays a German spy and gets busted because of his accent and the way he displays three fingers (I thought that was clever) was great, along with the German guy who interrogates them at the bar. I'm a chick and I love seeing female actors and I thought both the spy German actress and the Jewish theater owner actress were awesome. I couldn't decide which one was me (I always relate to the female characters). They were all great and believable and even the smaller roles were good, for example, the guy who was a German soldier and then sided with the basterds, the army hero, Hitler and the guy promoting the who event (sits next to Hitler in the movie theater) were all great. Had a problem with the basterd troop more than anything. Love love love Brad Pitt (super hot), but the rest of the crew (especially his main right hand guy, the guy with the bat who is the bear) was a little on the weak side, it's like he was a not as good actor that someone put in the movie because they were his 'uncle' or something. A tall glass of water so to speak, pretty, but he had a couple of chances to be as good as the actor's in the movie and he fell way way way short. He made me realize I was watching a movie.

"Great start, damp end","This movie promised to be one of Tarantino's best.. with the exquisite beginning (the subtle tension, the gradual build-up of the charming Colonel who chillingly transforms into the hunter - fabulous job from Chris Waltz), the intriguing middle part with its mysterious and haunting scenarios, the introduction of the exquisite Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) in her new avatar as cinema-owner, the Basterds themselves on their glorious vengeance trail (Brad Pitt deserves particular mention as a great character actor in this part of the movie), and Diane Kruger in all her beauty playing a rather nervous but credible role (the only in- credible role being that of the person who played Hitler himself).. despite the great build-up, however, this humdinger of a movie collapses into farce in the end, leaving one wondering what exactly was the director's intention..with such a tremendous start and accelerating suspense combined with some of the most divinely-cinematographed sequences, one is led to expect a great denouement.. what one gets however is a typical, Pulp-Fiction, Quentin Tarantino ending which is completely meaningless and indeed comical.

A movie fan's movie.,"I haven't seen every Tarantino movie yet, but this one is clearly the best one next to Pulp Fiction that I have seen, I can say that much. Quirky, blazing with the kind of wit that Tarantino is famous for and topped off with a dose of nasty, gritty and rogueish violence. This movie is pretty sprawling, featuring a host of characters and plot niches that span over a huge 2.5 hour timeline, and surprisingly it manages to entertain for most of it, despite some scenes that could have been trimmed down for the sake of the story. Throughout its duration, Basterds delivers memorable scenes, memorable and witty dialogue and outrageously precise directing that all comes together for a smash hit of a movie, right on the bullseye.And I think what sets this apart from the other recent Tarantino films is that it actually stands on its own two feet and delivers its story mightily and without the somewhat doddering eccentricity of Kill Bill or Death Proof - both of which were good, but not this good, not quite this complete and breathtaking. This is a movie fan's movie and I am proud to have seen it. Highly Recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Highly recommended, even for those of us who aren't die hard Tarantino fans","I'm not a particularly big Tarantino fan, I find some of his work a little over the top, though always stylish in his own way. Inglorious Bastards however is a very... interesting two hours of movie. I'd say pleasing but if I'm certain of anything it's that Tarantino didn't set out to please with this particular work of art and succeed he did.One of the things I like best about this movie is that Mr. Tarantino made an honest effort to ground his movie in some 'reality'. Such as having a WWII movie where the Germans actually speak German! How very novel! I won't say there isn't a fair share of surrealism - it wouldn't be a proper Tarantino without it - but it doesn't disrupt the flow of the story.All in all I'd highly recommend going to see it, even if you're not particularly fond of Tarantino's earlier works.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
A Groundbreaking Masterpiece!,"Quentin Tarantino mesmerizes the viewer in this dramatic war film set in World War II.The main theme is revenge, ways of executing it - stylish cinematography, unique one-of-a-kind characters, brought to life by breathtaking acting, excellent music and most-importantly - a perfect script and direction.The dark humor found in this story is irresistible, the drama is heart wrenching, the action is blunt, gory and brutal - simply the best way to portray it, the authentic use of German, French and Italian languages lifts this piece of cinema high above all those movies, which are afraid of subtitles and gives the watching experience a fresh sense of realism.Christoph Waltz shows his immense talent playing the German officer, his multi-linguistic skills, character transformations and charisma deserve nothing less than the Oscar award.In fact, everyone who created this amazing film deserves an Oscar.

Spectacular!,"Saw Inglorious Basterds last night and I thought it was spectacular! The epic sweep -- the revisionist history -- the whole thing. Just loved it! There hasn't been a climax like that since ""Day of the Locusts."" I thought Brad Pitt was just terrific. He has a real talent of comedic roles -- a real actors' actor -- a leading man who tackles character roles with gusto and finesse. My major concerns were dramaturgical -- too many scenes depended on someone or something being ""discovered"" for their dramatic tension -- so much so that it got a little boring and predictably tense. And, I don't know if the Nazi everyone is going crazy over could have lived up to the hype and I wasn't in love with the casting for Shoshona -- but, it all pales in the full experience. I thought it was a great movie. And I wasn't expecting to like it at all -- I really liked Jackie Brown -- and wasn't so hot on Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"A fake war, a real director.","As if we needed any reminding, Quentin Tarantino remains as one of the five best directors working in movies today. His previous film, Death Proof, billed together with a gory zombie movie was more than just an entertaining 70's schlock movie. It was a tribute to all the films of that time as well to show that Tarantino could direct a new kind of action movie.Here, he shows he can direct a new kind of movie altogether: the war fantasy. There is as much historical accuracy here as there is in Hogan's Heroes. Yet, that is the point and anyone who would dislike the movies simply because of that is missing it altogether. Tarantino is doing what Steven Spielberg did with Raiders of the Lost Ark, rewriting history as more entertaining and more to his liking. Here, history occurs as Tarantino (and possibly many of us) would like to see it, which makes it more fun to take in and all the more beautiful.The opening sequence is astonishing: long, tense and utterly engrossing. We know there is going to be a wild climax, we just don't know what or when. Tarantino feeds off our anticipation and goes all the way with it. Indeed, nearly every sequence feels like that. This being Tarantino, it will be very violent and shocking, but it is in a whole new way. I cannot think of one moment when it is boring or uninteresting. There is a lot of French and German, but even that dialog is entertaining to listen to. It seems that QT has evolved tremendously in his writing, going from tons of pop-culture references to more mature and deep talking; these people have something to say. As for his love of the cinema, it is never more apparent than here, as we get an enormous, over-the-top climax in a movie theater that I know Tarantino was enjoying in his head as he wrote it down. References to German cinema abound and he treats it with respect despite what it looks like.All in all, this is QT's best work since Pulp Fiction; dazzling, amazing and utterly mind-blowing. His cast rises to the occasion with Brad Pitt and Eli Roth hamming it up as the leaders of the Basterds. Of course, I must point out Christoph Waltz as the Nazi Col. Landa, so ferocious and frightening he deserves an Oscar nod. Just as good is the stunning Melanie Laurent, a Jewish girl who runs the theater the Nazis intend to celebrate in. QT films her with all the affection and love a director can and it all the more increases her performance to new heights. A fake war, but a real director. And one I hope to watch for years to come, no matter how inaccurate it may be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
This film does not entertain.,"I simply ask one question, if this film were directed by anyone other than Quentin Tarantino, would it have even been released? The answer, I fear, is a resounding 'No"". It fails at almost every level between the opening scene and the final action scene. In between we have pointless scenes of gratuitous violence and long periods of tedium. I love Pulp Fiction, Snatch, The Long Good Friday, Kill Bills, Lock Stock, Layer Cake and many other 'violent' films. In each case there are excellent story lines woven with genuine humour. In this film the humour is completely lacking, apart from a few, nudge-nudge, wink-wink ""this is an in-joke and it really is VERY clever, trust me, I'm a great writer and film director."" I hope this proves to be a one-off failure for Mr. Tarantino.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"It has been a long wait for Tarantino fans across the world. Question is, was it worth it? The short answer is yes.","When writing a review there are normally a handful of things that stand out (either good or bad) that I know I must write about. Unfortunately Basterds doesn't have a few, there are a multitude of elements worthy of discussion. The next problem is where do I start? Tarantino's famous ear for classic dialogue? Waltz's Cannes award-winning performance? The mesmerizing music and score heard throughout? The abundance of movie references and parodies used with affection? The list is almost endless. Well, hell, let's just begin with the man calling the shots.Tarantino has been working on this script for well over a decade. Just when we thought he was ready to make it, he decided to take time out to make his kung fu epic Kill Bill. Then he put Basterds on hiatus once again to work with long-time pal Robert Rodriguez in making the double feature Grindhouse. It has been a long wait for Tarantino fans across the world. Question is, was it worth it? The short answer is yes. It may not reach the heights of Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill Vol 1, but it is an entirely different beast altogether and succeeds on its own terms. His lengthy talkative scenes are sometimes dragged out slightly but make no mistake, this is a master of his craft at work. No word is accidental or incidental, each conversation from the mood-setting opening scene to the tense talk-off between opposing officers and onwards to the closing scene featuring two fan favourites is pieced together with intricate care and a clear love for his work. In fact, Tarantino obviously doesn't care if the audience don't get the plethora of references to German cinema or old-school war movies, he expects you to go away and see these films then revisit his cinematic opus with an even greater adoration for what you hear on screen. But fear not, he's not stupid either. He realises 99.99% of viewers won't understand these bite-sized references so never do these moments hinge on your film knowledge, just your appreciation that there is more importance to the chatter then you may know.A picture is worth a thousand words and QT ensures that your eyes are in for a feast as well. The action as it unravels in front of you may not be quite as captivating as the dialogue however there is still one iconic visual after another, evoking all sorts of emotions. Your heart will sink when you see poor Shosanna running from the fate of her family; great delight will wash over you when you see the sanguinary Nazi-turned-Nazi-hunter Sgt. Stiglitz (Schweiger) on top of a mound cackling away; the graphic violence will have you cheering then instantly feeling guilty afterwards; and the penultimate scene (to give any more info would to give too much info) will sear itself into your brain for better or worse. In one particular breathtaking scene with French actress Melanie Laurent, Tarantino combines striking visuals with a truly exceptional song to brilliant effect.Then there is relatively unknown German actor Christoph Waltz. Many don't realise that if Tarantino didn't find Waltz this movie may have never been made. Tarantino was adamant that this role required both an astonishing actor and someone who could speak German, English and French with equal fluency. He famously said that he would not even begin making this picture unless he had the perfect person for the job, such is the importance of the Col. Landa role. He picked the right person. Waltz makes his vivacious 'Jew Hunter' both charming and nefarious, you want to hate him but at the same time you can't help but smile when he is on screen. He won Best Supporting Actor at Cannes this year and you would hope to see him feature come Oscar time. Don't forget about the headlining Pitt either. His Lee Marvin-alike Lt. Rain is tongue-in-cheek at its best. Clearly having a blast working with Tarantino, the more talented half of Brangelina oozes charisma as he hams it up as the half-apache leader of the Basterds. His flawless comic timing has never been so apparent before. Fassbender, Bruhl, Laurent and Schweiger all offer up top shelf performances but Kruger can't quite keep up with them and Martin Wuttke's Hitler is a touch over the top.Basterds is a self-aware romp that exists in the same world as Kill Bill's martial arts assassins, Death Proof's heroic chicks and Pulp Fiction's gangsters. Never does Tarantino try to convince us that this story belongs in our reality and nor is he ever apologetic at warping history to suit himself. Like usual he has created this following his own rules – which is to say no rules – and we thank him all the more for it.4.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Another Tarantino masterpiece,"Since I've watched ""Pulp Fiction"" I have continuously waited for the next comparable movie. I've liked Pulp Fiction so much, that ever since, I was comparing any movie that I liked with it. Since then, i have waited every year for the next Tarantino hit. I was not very impressed by Kill Bills (especially the second), or Deathproof. I felt that this will come. And it came, in the form of Inglourious Basterds. It was the first movie which, for me, can compare with Pulp fiction. As usual, the director is able to get the best from the actors. Brad Pitt is doing maybe one of his best roles, Cristoph Waltz (as Hans Landa) is extraordinary, incredible performance, for me it was an unbelievable revelation. As well, the other actors deliver very good performance, and i noted Mélanie Laurent (as Shosanna Dreyfus), Sylvester Groth( as Goebbels).I give it an {Excellent} mark, and I say that this is worth to be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Respect for History,"Tarantino, who worked his sense of revenge very well in the movie. The harmony of colors and shots are in place. The language tendency and role ability of Christopher Waltz is very good, even perfect. Effects took me from me. The acting is beautiful, even the smallest role was perfect. Only Brad Pitt's accent seemed a little bad, other than that, it was a nice, fun movie.Especially the dialogues caught my attention. It made me happy to have meaningful dialogues while making me laugh at the same time. Because so far I have watched 3 Tarantino movies. There were many meaningless, empty, shallow dialogs in those films. At first, I thought there would be such dialogues in this movie too, but when I watched the movie, I saw that it was not.I did not like the fact that a historical event was not shown in the film as it happened in history. It is disrespectful to the course of history that the Second World War and Hitler, who has an extremely serious character, is shown as a crazy madman in this way. Okay, Hitler may be a cruel. But a very serious historical event cannot kidding this much. The events are very out of reality. It is as if Tarantino in his dream showed how Hitler's end was.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Revenge to German Basterds for Germanic Savagery,"Revenge to German Basterds for Germanic SavageryIf you don't like Tarantino's style than you won't like this film. If you are a fan of his films it is not as noteworthy as other films but you will find it enjoyable nonetheless. Much like Tim Burton films there is a familiar component that you either love or hate.The film is based on a group of racial victims of German savagery during WW2 and their incredibly well deserved payback to said perpetrators. Germans committed horrific genocide and atrocities on Jews, Russians, Poles, Greeks and Serbs. The film focuses on a group of Jews who during the Allied liberation of occupied lands offer their own sweet justice on German 'Basterds'. The film is very loosely based on a bunch of real life American soldiers who were of the Judaic religion who rounded up and killed German murderers before they could be tried and most likely hanged.The acting ranged from Pitt's average showing to Waltz's exceptional performance. Major parts of the story were obviously fictitious but the story had a interesting plot. The directing was classic Tarantino.Overall 7 of out 10 for Tarantino or WW2 movie fans but a 5 out of 10 for those who don't like either.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

tragically bad. very poor choice of German actors doesn't help either,"I can only agree with the reviewers on the unstructured, badly paced patch work nature of this movie, and on the sad fact that the best scene is the first scene.I can only assume, people who believe the ""bar"" scene is ""witty"" don't understand the German language. A native speaker should notice immediately, how bad the actors really are and how forced and unpleasant the ""Tarantino table debate pattern"" aches on the viewers perception.What works in contemporary New York style short story dialogues does absolutely not apply to German ww2 era characters. Tarantino obviously tried to make it ""authentic"" by omitting all the vulgar street lingo, but thus fails cos whats left is just clumsy and cumbersome.Another thing nobody mentioned (AFAIK), is the fact that Tarantinos casting agent selected only the worst of the German actors available to fill his ""native speaker"" roles.(I am from Austria, so I have the dubious advantage of being pestered with all of those actors for decades now). And no, those actors are not suitable for ""the trashy approach"", they're just plain tiresome. it's as if a french movie maker wants to shoot an ""authentic rapper"" scene in New York and then hires the first actor that springs to mind. because he can't be bothered : ""well, Denzel Washington is black, American and famous, no? That should suffice"".Mr. Waltz has been playing the same role for 15 years of cheesy TV movie productions, so there's no ""outstanding character play"" here; he just plain can't do anything else but play the slimy psychopath.Til Schweiger is Germanies Ben Affleck. no further comment needed.Gedeon Burkhardt is only known as ""Komissar Rex"" - the lamest ""a cop and his dog"" TV production the world has ever birthed.That Diane Krueger has been promoting the stereotype of the boring, dull and flat German wood puppet with her outstanding ""acting skills"" doesn't help either.I believe I ""get"" what Tarantino is after with this movie, and I think its a wonderful concept - however, sadly it fails. hard.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

I'm a big fan of Tarantino but this one left me disappointed.,"Tarantino took an overly popular topic of history, applied with the ideas of revenge justice and the role of cinema.To this movie's credit, the stage design and costumes were expertly done and it's slightly more intelligent and witty than your average. Christoph Waltz as the charismatic and terrifying Hans Landa was made for the movie's best moments, but none of the other cast members truly stood out.A half hour could have been easily cut from 150 minute movie.

"A long, sad and boring decadence","I'm not a Tarantino's fan but I loved 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. So I can't believe that Tarantino directed 'Inglorious Basterds' After the opening scene with the Nazi officer interrogating the farmer who is hiding Jews in his basement the movie goes straight to the ridiculous, place from where don't exist come back. May be as an action B-movie 'Inglorious basterds' can stand up, but please!!!! We're talking about mainstream and a top level director. Obviously Tarantino forgets that grown-up people may be in attendance and assumes that there are only teenagers watching that sad remake of 'Dirty Dozen' and another good war themed movies. Boring (and pointless) conversations accumulate totalizing 154' of wasted budget. Also I'm tired with the sequence of 'homage' after 'homage' that Tarantino include in his movies. For surrealist movies I prefer Luis Buñuel's 'El perro andaluz' or 'El angel exterminador', but surrealism melted with the hyper-realism of Hitler, the Shoa, WWII is stupid if not unmoral. The usual argument with Tarantino lovers is ""if you can do it better...do it so"" but the point is, who needs this piece of bad B movie? The crew? Seriously disappointing performance by Brad Pitt who can't hide how amused he was filming that scrap. I can't understand how this movie is actually at 8.4 in IMDb please!!!!!! I absolutely hated 'Inglorious Basterds' and its collection of endless, sadistic and (the last but not the least) boring scenes. The scene where three people talk for several minutes at the same table, before, they are all shot is extremely boring, Ingmar Bergman mixed with Peckinpah? No way, Quentin!

"Gorgeous, violent, fun, tense and thoroughly Tarantino!","I consider myself to be a pretty big Tarantino fan, but I do not believe that every little thing he does is great. Just like all directors, he had his ticks and proclivities. These are the things that can both frustrate and endear us to particular directors. Wes Anderson is a director who is full of familiar tricks...we smile when we recognize those ""Anderson-isms"", but just once in awhile, they feel a bit forced or unnecessary or that bit of amused recognition actually pulls us out of the story just a bit.Tarantino, for all his talents, does the same. His love of dialogue has made for some extraordinarily wonderful scenes over the years. He lets his characters talk and talk, often about nothing ""important."" (Favorite example: Travolta and Jackson discussing foot massages in PULP FICTION.) Yet sometimes, it can be a bit much. Just a bit over-indulgent. Tarantino loves to surprise us with sudden deaths, such as the abrupt massacre in the bar in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, which leaves characters we thought were going to be important dead on the floor (thank you for participating, Michael Fassbender, but it turns out your character had not real value to driving the plot). He does it just because he likes these kinds of scenes where tensions build and build, resulting in sudden explosions (usually of violence). He does them well, and his fans love these moments.HATEFUL EIGHT is no exception. It is full of the kinds of things we love from Tarantino, along with moments of overindulgence. One of the things I like about it in particular is the SMALLER scale of the stakes. Tarantino's recent BASTERDS & DJANGO were big scale films with huge stakes, be it ending World War II or avenging slavery. HATEFUL is full of colorful characters, none of whom deserve to live but all of whom we enjoy meeting (from the safety of our chairs). But it is almost like a play (and almost like a return to RESERVOIR DOGS). Following a rather extensive opening sequence set on/around a stagecoach, we come to a Haberdashery in the middle of Wyoming that is serving as a place of security during a severe blizzard. No one can get safely in or out, once the storm hits...so now we have a cabin full of unsavory men (and one woman) who all have axes to grind and no reason to trust anyone else, and certainly no reason not to shoot first and ask questions later. Secrets will be revealed and violent bills will be paid.It's a story that could have been told by another filmmaker in a brisk, exciting, fast-paced 90 minutes. But Tarantino tells in in 3 hours, because he is so interested in lingering over these unsavory but articulate rascals. Letting them engage each other in fraught conversation is Tarantino's joy and the viewer's pleasure. Ultimately, this is what costs the film one star from me...because that's really ALL there is to this film. Talk, talk, talk, shoot, talk, talk, shoot. I don't mean to demean it...this is all great, juicy fun. And being on a small scale just adds a level of claustrophobia and danger that some of the broad scale films don't have. Think about DJANGO UNCHAINED. The best, most tense scene in the film isn't the expansive gun-battle at the end...it's the tense time when Christopf Waltz and Leonardo di Caprio face off in the latters library, over some drinks and smokes. The tension is so thick, their dialogue so fraught with tension, and the sudden explosive conclusion so shocking, that this is the scene that sticks with me over the years. In some ways, HATEFUL 8 is that scene to movie length.And the success of Tarantino's films also depends so much on the casting. He is a master of spot-on casting. HATEFUL includes truly towering performances from Samuel Jackson & Kurt Russell, but also some amazing work from Jennifer Jason Leigh. Solid support comes from Tim Roth, Bruce Dern, James Parks and Demian Bichir. I would say that Michael Madsen is forgettable, but Tarantino hasn't given him nearly the material to work with. And Walton Goggins, whom I loved in JUSTIFIED, just isn't quite all he needs to be in this role. He is given some pretty heavy lifting to do, the script doesn't give him quite all he needs, and his native ability fails him a bit at the end. We just don't CARE that much about his character, and yet he becomes so critical during the brutal climax of the film.Speaking of brutal...this film is quite nasty. While it's fun to see what these eight characters go through, and the various acts of violence the perpetrate on each other are a source of queasy fun...midway through, we have a flashback scene that is quite disturbing and violent and nasty and no fun at all. Good people, not ""hateful"" people, are involved, and it's no fun. While from a plot standpoint, the events need to take place...the action could have been presented differently, and not pulled me out of the mood of the film. Tarantino forgets that we can enjoy a bad guy for a couple of hours, and nonetheless readily accept his death...but we can meet a clearly nice, delightful person and grieve their death after only 5 minutes.HATEFUL 8 is loads of fun. Gorgeous cinematography. Great sound editing. Some great costumes and hair (the facial hair on Russell is magnificent!). Loads and loads of juicy dialogue. Many good actors having a great time. But at the end, you're left with a strong feeling of ""that's it?"" Or ""I sat through this, and this is all you have for me?"" As much as I admired the scaled-down stakes and confined setting, at the very end, I wished for more expansiveness of vision or meaning.For most films, I'd never think this way. But Tarantino is so much fun as a director/writer for 95% of the film...the flubbed 5% feels like so much more. But please don't let me dissuade you from seeing the film...I still highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Inglourious Basterds,"A fancy film with scenes including long takes, well sharpened dialogue and of course an incredible ensemblage of actors.

I mean for a director as great as Quentin Tarantino, one would expect perfection or near perfection from all of his work. It's just the bar he has raised for himself. But the film is tonely all over the place. The first couple chapters are compelling and you get very excited for what's going to happen throughout being introduced to Waltz's character being a horrid person. As well as Brad Pitt and his group of people. But it becomes then starts becoming a love story briefly and then all this insane craziness happens.

Good and Bad WW2 Comic Book Fantasy,"I'm a big fan of Tarantino movies, or at least the best of them such as Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. I believe him to be a man who genuinely loves cinema, which is a pretty good start. So how does this stack up? Well, I guess that it left me with mixed feelings. The acting is actually pretty good and the interesting cast give a good account of themselves. The story is obviously ridiculous. I don't believe that QT expects it to be taken seriously. This is comic book cinema with comic book characters, good guys and bad guys. There is a fair amount of graphic violence, maybe a little more than was necessary to make the point. I think the problem I had was that the whole thing was too much of a joke, the kind that sounds good fun after a night out with friends but which usually you realise isn't going to that funny when you review it in the cold (sober) light of day. This may sound pretentious but given that we know QT can make outstanding memorable movies, is this elaborate joke a little over the top and a waste of time and resources? On the other hand, it kept me glued to the screen for almost two and half hours, which is no mean feat. Also, I find it interesting to speculate - what if this was a new low budget movie by a director that no one had heard of previously? Answer I suspect - instant cult classic. Maybe I'm foolish not to join in and enjoy the joke more but I have a nagging feeling this will be forgotten quite quickly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
A Real Good Story!,"He's been able to make a living off it, but Quentin Tarantino doesn't do what he does simply to make money off it.
By the time Inglorious Basterds came out, Tarantino already had major success in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, more than enough to permit him to live the rest of his life in good comfort.
Quentin Tarantino just loves cinema, and that's never been more obvious than with this film. The meticulous attention to detail and carefully - and successfully - written plot leaves the audience feeling completely satisfied. In a film that relies partially on subtitles to tell its dialogue, it's extremely effective and entertaining.
As with previous films, Tarantino doesn't waste time. This movie is to the point and every single scene adds to the plot. Coming fresh out of this movie, it's a fantastic product that I will definitely be going back to watch many times.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
A classic all-time favorite from Tarantino,"Firstly, I would like to talk about the cast that is in this movie. Actors like Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, and Michael Fassbender, just to name a few in this movie, are amazing and I love many other titles they are in. The level of acting makes it feel like you are really immersed into the world that this movie takes place in. Another part about this movie that I really like is the tone of some scenes throughout the movie. If I had to describe the tone of this movie as a whole, I would say the tone is suspenseful. You would think in a movie with a lot of action, the tone would be different but by using dialogue it creates an atmosphere that is constantly keeping the watcher on the edge of their seats. There are multiple times in this movie where I can see where the plot can be ended in its tracks or derailed, but the characters find a way to revive the suspense in the situation. Another reason why I like the dialogue is because of the banter. The dialogue is so varied that for whatever the situation is, I think it gets its point across. Whether the point is to progress the story or to just fill in time to get a glimpse of what the characters are thinking, I think it is very satisfying to hear what the characters think about a given situation. I also like to consider myself as a history buff and I really liked the portrayal of the motives behind war and conflict in general. The enemy of this film is Nazi Germany and they were not cartoonishly evil and they also were not dumb where as to give the main characters pit falls to exploit. So many other movies make the enemy seem like they have forgotten a key factor or something that leads to their own downfall. It truly feels like that with this movie, good beats evil without outside intervention. Another part that I really liked about it was the comedy. The way that this movie makes light of some harsher topics is really refreshing to me. This part also ties in with my previously mentioned dialogue. This movie is a bit on the longer side but I feel that there are not any scenes added to just fill in time. A lot of the time the scenes that you think are filler turn out to be relevant to the plot by the time the ending comes around. One thing to keep in mind about this movie is that it is shot and spoken in three different languages. This is a level of immersion that a lot of other movies will not be able to portray. In other movies the whole movie is spoken in English when it takes place in another part of the world even though it is targeted to English speaking audiences. There are many nuanced cultural aspects that are also included in the film adding to the immersive world that this movie takes place in. I have seen in an interview where it was hard for Quentin Tarantino to find an actor that spoke English, French, and German at the same time. This is just a testament to how well Christoph waltz can act in many different languages. His portrayal of the Nazi SS officer Hans Landa made it seem like the enemy was intelligent and cultured as a character. Another portrayal of a character that was a stand out to me was Eli Roth as sergeant Donny Danowitz. His featured scene in the movie was amazing and I watch it multiple times every year. It shows the resentment that American Jews hold for the atrocities that the German Nazis have committed during World War 2. It is also a look into the world of this movie because it shows the notice of the German soldiers knowing about the titles given to Aldos group like ""the bear Jew' and ""Aldo the Apache"". It gives the movie life where it is another peek into the world where this is widely known among soldiers without physically showing it on screen. This unshown meaning and fear add to the scene brings audiences into the movie more. Another part of this movie, which occurs during this scene and many others, is the films score. Adding to the previously mentioned suspense, I think it sets the mood to how the audience should be feeling and feeds into it. There are so many instances where I would hear the background music and think it fits exactly perfect into the scene playing out before me. It always matches the scene wither it is to add to a triumphant scene or to coincide with a more somber scene. Taking in all of these points, and for many other reasons, I would give this movie a score of 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

A Nazi Police Procedural and An Allied Heroic Epic,"Many films, at least from my perspective, have a problem. They peak in quality just before the climax, leaving explosive and action packed scenes to seem dull by comparison with earlier parts of the film. This is one of the few films I have seen which does not have this problem. The climax is perfect, the absolute peak of quality mounting and building on top of the rest of the film's high quality. This film is a masterpiece, but the final forty-five minutes of the film are simply the best cinema I've ever seen, and that's so much more impactful than if the first forty-five minutes had been the best cinema I've ever seen. I cannot give higher or more detailed general praise than this without going into proper spoilers about the film. Quite simply, I think a truly blind watch is the ideal way to go into it. Every scene has something new and exciting for an uninitiated viewer. It's as though every scene has this wonderful twist that ensures things never happen quite how you think they will.The characters aren't necessarily unique, except for one, but they all fit together super well. The casting was genius, to the point where Tarantino nearly axed the entire film because he had trouble finding the right actor to fill a critical role. Every single character is believable, and this is the film's biggest strength. From the allied commando leader who's not afraid to commit a few warcrimes, to the SS detective who's not afraid to commit a few warcrimes, to the vengeful French national who's not afraid to commit a few warcrimes, the film makes it easy to get into the head of all of these people, and truly understand why they do the things they do without making the film feel overly dark and brooding.Inglourious Basterds is just the right amount of contemplative and cavalier about its violence and its subject matter. Make no mistake, Tarantino's trademark violence is here in full force, and cleverly used as ever. This is a film that wants you to enjoy watching it in the way a film like Downfall just wouldn't while trying to tackle the objective of humanizing Nazis to some degree. That's not to say Tarantino or the Jewish pedophile (damn the cunt) behind the financing of this film pulled punches on making it clear that the Nazis have what happens to them coming to them. It just lets you know that the violence isn't perfectly black and white, allowing for much needed moral texture.The soundtrack is beautiful, taking from the scores of other films and out of period songs as Tarantino is known for doing to great effect. There are some real bangers in here that raise scenes up into the stratosphere as far as memorability is concerned.This is a film that loves tension. It builds tension all up through scenes, all up through the movie before releasing it all in the climax to truly devastating effect. Tarantino is a master of the trade for tension, and this film has just that very skillset on full display for your viewing pleasure. The result is a film where a smile may hide terror, malice, greed, sadism, or genuine warmth of character in equal likelihood.This is a film I want you to see. I contemplated making this a spoiler filled review for the sake of ranting about all the things I absolutely love, but chose not to because I wanted people to see this film how I saw it, because the experience was truly that amazing. This is the movie most of all for which I want someone to wipe my brain so I can see it again. I envy you who are just about to see it for the first time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"Just Like Kill Bill, Liked, didn't Love","What can I say, pretty much everything I said for the Kill Bill movies is seen here. There don't seem to be any plot holes, the characters are fine, the the actings good, the action scenes are cool, and the dialog is as good as it is in any Tarantino movie. But for some reason I just didn't love it.Maybe it was because it was too violent for me, but that doesn't make much sense because I like the Final Destination films, and they have tons of violence. I didn't have any problems following the plot, and I absolutely loved to hate the villain, but why didn't I love this film.I guess it just isn't my type of movie, for what it was, I had fun watching it, and may watch it again someday, but overall I just didn't love this film.

Hilarious Brad Pitt glorifies basterds in this Unstrain Classic by Quentin Tarantino,"Inglorious Basterds (2009)
Brief Review -Hilarious Brad Pitt glorifies basterds in this unstrain Classic by Quentin Tarantino. Who says Tarantino can't have fun? Who says he always makes disturbing movies? Well, i myself used to say so. But i can't say it anymore after watching Inglorious Basterds. A fictional writing of Tarantino on serious people like Nazis, Jews and Hitler isn't serious at all. Especially the lead characters of the film whether it is Brad Pitt as protagonist or Christoph Walts as Antagonist. This film is funny yet seriously made by entire crew putting all seriousness into it. I laughed, i gasped and i enjoyed a Tarantino Film without a single strain moment. Can you believe it? I didn't believe it for a moment. Then i pinched myself to confirm it. Yes, Tarantino makes a Fun watch yet delivers a Classic filmmaking upto his standard. Brad Pitt is truly hilarious in the film. Watch out for his smashing dialogues (Especially the one at the ending scene). Christoph Walts outshined in enjoyable antagonist's role and grabbed the deserving Oscar. Melanie Laurent and rest of the cast is fantastic with their small roles. Inglorious Basterds is neither allegory nor satire but still it has got some intellectual things to be noticed by movie buffs (i shouldn't be spoiling anything here) so watch out. On one rare occasion you are gonna love the basterds for their brutality. Tarantino doesn't lack anything from his signature filmmaking but he just added unstrain factors and little fun this time. This glorifying film of basterds may not be a thought provoking and mind shattering film like other War films but it just mixes two genres together like never before. Brad Pitt and Tarantino Fans just can't miss it and don't forget to indulge surprise package Christoph Walts and excellent use of background score. This film is ranked too high on IMDb considering the kind of content it has but still a Classic is always a Classic doesn't matter if it doesn't fit in all time greats.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Very interesting and unique,"Quentin Tarantino is a really great director in my opinion, he has written himself into film history with his iconic style. Although ""Inglorious Basterds"" is not nearly as good as ""Pulp Fiction"" in my opinion, it is a really quality movie.As has been said countless times, Christoph Waltz's performance is brilliant, he steals every scene he's in. Also, ones like Brad Pitt, Eli Roth and Mélanie Laurent are also fantastic in their roles. The dialogue is also brilliant, the story is interestingly structured and although the film is quite long, I was not bored even once. My only real complaint about the film is perhaps the ending, which I think was rushed and quite out of place. The direction is really great, Tarantino's unique directing style echoes here as well.Overall, although the ending could have been better, this is an interesting and truly unique Tarantino film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
"""You know somethin', Utivich? I think this just might be my masterpiece.""","When it comes to Tarantino's near-immaculate filmography, my favorite film of his will always be Pulp Fiction. That was the film that introduced me to Tarantino and it blew my 16-year-old mind.However, I have to admit, looking at Tarantino's filmography objectively, I think Inglourious Basterds is his defining masterpiece. I know people who aren't even fans of Quentin Tarantino and they love this movie. Now, this is highly debatable but I believe that Inglorious Basterds is the film that showcases Tarantino's strengths as both a writer and director the most. If you need proof of that, then just watch the first 20 minutes of Inglourious Basterds. That's all the proof I need. Even Tarantino himself has gone on record to say that the opening to this film is the best thing he's ever written. I concur.Outside of the legendary opening, the rest of Inglourious Basterds is a perfect amalgamation of a war drama, mixed with grindhouse and arthouse cinema. This movie has all of the classic Tarantino trademarks of witty dialogue mixed with pulpy violence, but what elevates the film is the surprising amount of emotion that Tarantino shows in his writing, specifically with the character of Shosanna Dreyfus (played wonderfully by the stunning Mélanie Laurent). Out of all the characters Tarantino has ever written, Shosanna Dreyfus is arguably his most sympathetic and grounded.It's both the bravery and vulnerability in her character that helps elevate what is already a very compelling movie into pure masterpiece territory. Well that, and the rest of the amazing cast makes this film one of the best of the 21st century. Christoph Waltz's performance is quite honestly one of the best performances I've ever seen and it's also quite possibly the strongest performance in any Tarantino film.Obviously, I cannot praise this movie enough, It has everything I love in film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Inglourious Basterds,"The genius sparkled after joking. Movies make everything possible. History can also be subverted, ridiculed, assembled, and recreated in the video. Quentin has always been bad, thinking that he is too focused on playing with fun. Although the film does not deviate from its usual routine, it is obviously much more refined, and it is an upgraded version and an evolved version. Crazy imagination, black humor, the rhythm of flowing clouds, wonderful group acting skills ... Indulgent and paradoxical but shameless, spicy, bold and happy.
I think good directors should not focus on special effects or visual effects, but on every line and every plot. Quentin's work is the ultimate at this point.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

Hogans Hero's . . .,"Really late to the show - didn't watch this until about 2 years ago.Rewatching it again has given me a little better prospective.First let me say - I don't give a rip about Tarantino. He must have had all his cousins and all their in-laws write glowing user reviews bc there's no way this movie could rate 8.3. Maybe 6.5. Possibley.Seen about half of a couple of his movies. They mostly seem to be vehicles for the egreious use of the F word ad nauseum, and/or violence. (Ex. The crude 'Django').Inglorious Basterds is tolerable only bc I realized - it is basically Hogans Hero's with very controlled slapstick. Once I settled into the comedic aspect, then, yeh. Tolerable.NOTE: this movie is grossly mislabeled as 'adventure, drama, war'. Should'a been 'adventure, comedy, war era.'
Hence - the thousands of misleading user reviews. People view things from the perspective of their expectation.As one typical example of 'controlled slapstick'; when Waltz's character pulls out a huge, calabash-style pipe which we had never had the slightest a clue of considering his sleek, black leather trench. This one thing sets the mood for how the movie should be viewed. Another - we can clearly see by his neck scar Aldo was hung once, not to mention his whole cliche persona & dialogue. On and on are these controlled slapstick moments, dialogues, and even the plot.Meanwhile, anything Christoph Waltz is in is ok by my book. He is one of the most underrated actors, I think scarcely used because his accent sort of pigeon holes him, here he shines as the parody of an overly-polite-yet-truly evil German officer. He is the reverse portrayal of Col. Klink. Where Klink was a parody-cliche of loud and brash, mean & dumb - Landa is a parody-cliche of polite, calculated evil.The only other thing I disdain with these movies is how young people view them.For example, when Forest Gump came out, I ended up trying to convince 3 teenagers it was not a bio-drama. Arguments ensued with these 13 to 15 year olds, with no historic perspective to pull from, they insisted 'real TV footage' shown in the movie proves it was all true. I still wonder, now that these young people are nearing 30, if they still have a narrative somewhere in their head of Forest Gump as real history. I imagine, through so many films like Inglorious Basterds we have millions of dumb kids, basically only proficient at gaming, who use novel movies as true historic references for their education, and any kids educated in factual history are the ones persecuted.ANYWAY - watch this movie as a full on ridiculous dark comedy, and you'll probably enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
A disgusting travesty,"This is a disgusting travesty of a film that does its best to re-imagine the Holocaust as a comic book that was conceived by a 12-year old boy. There are a myriad of films that portray World War II in a fanciful light, but ""Inglorious Basterds"" is one of the few that I can recall that uses the extermination of the Jews as a launching pad for an outlandish Sam Peckenpaugh -inspired cartoon which depicts historical figures like Adolph Hitler and Joseph Goebbels - monsters who were responsible for the murder of millions of people - on the same level as Lex Luthor or The Joker.Brad Pitt and his crew of seemingly invincible marauders cut through the German lines with such ease that it's a wonder that the war lasted as long as it did, and with such a sadistic bloodthirstiness that they seemed likely subjects for a war crimes trial at the conflict's end. Tarantino crudely and artlessly tries to take the narrative between their bloody and far-fetched ""heroics"" and more genuine atrocities suffered by victims of the Nazis, so the line between Tarantino's outlandish fairy tale and the real-life horrors of the Holocaust are blurred to a degree that made me feel like the director was exploiting the brutal death of six million people in order to splash a lot of cool, fake blood on a movie set. That's perfectly fine if you're making a flight of fantasy like ""Kill Bill"", but the blood that was spilled in the Holocaust wasn't supplied by Hollywood special effects wizards and deserves more respect than it's given here.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"

This is Tarantino,"The movie is very stylistic and the camera angles, shots and overall directing by Tarantino in this one are just brilliant.

The amazing dialogues are also a positive point like in the first chapter where Landa talks about the similarities between a squirrel and a rat but yet we love one but hate other, simple dialogues but that make us think, typical of Tarantino. The division in chapters and the fact that the different stories get combined in only one at the end was a very smart idea and it did fitted the movie very well. We also know that this director loves violence which isn't missing in this movie but I think is the right and appropriate amount of violence , not just stupid and unnecessary violence.

INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (2009) - 13/11/2019,"An fun, engrossing, beautifully crafted piece of nonsense, the likes of which we hadn't seen in a long long time. The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilised monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating an Italian? I thought so. His character's name sounds like Aldo Ray and I'm sure that's no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970's  Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino's trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He's clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don't read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That's how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time. For better or worse, these are Tarantino times. Masterpiece of modern cinema, highly recommend it.Mitchell Bulfin",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama"
Best war film. Second best Tarantino,"What's not to like about it? It's funny. It's action packed and it's just an amazing film. Tarantino is (in my opinion) the best director of all time. There is a certain genius to this film in the way that everything comes together, all leading up to the end of the film. The characters are great and so is the acting. I can't decide if Christoph Waltz is better in this or Django. He is one of my favourite actors and I think Hans Landa is the best antagonist of all time. Brad Pitt (as always) is amazing in this and so are all the other actors. The scene in the bar is just amazing. You have barely met a single character in the scene yet the complexity of it makes you feel like you have known the characters your whole life.
